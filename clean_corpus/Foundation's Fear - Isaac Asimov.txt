the second  foundation trilogy    foundation   s fear    gregory benford     to greg bear and david brin  fellow voyagers on strange seas       rendezvous    r .  daneel olivaw did not look like eto demerzel .  that role he had already cast aside .   this dors vanabili expected  though it was unsettling to her .  she knew that through millennia he had discarded the skin and shape of countless guises .   dors studied him in the cramped  dingy room two sectors away from streeling university .  she had followed a convoluted route to get here and the site was protected by elaborate  overlapping security measures .  robots were outlaws .  they had lived for millennia in the deep shadow of taboo .  though olivaw was her guide and mentor  she saw him seldom .   yet as a humaniform robot she felt a tremor of mingled fear and reverence at this ancient  partly metallic form before her .  he was nearly twenty millennia old .  though he could appear human  he did not truly wish to be human .  he was inexpressibly greater than that now .   she had lived happily as a pseudo person for so long now .  even a reminder of who and what she was came like cold fingers along her spine .     the recent increasing attention paid to hari .  .  .         indeed .  you fear you will be detected .         the newest security measures are so invasive .      he nodded .     you are correct to be concerned .         i need more help in protecting hari .         adding another of us to his close associates would double the danger of detection .         i know  i know  but .  .  .      olivaw reached out and touched her hand .  she blinked back tears and studied his face .  small matters  such as consistent movement of his adam   s apple when he swallowed  had long ago been perfected .  to ease himself in this meeting  he had omitted these minor computations and movements .  he obviously enjoyed even momentary freedom from such taxation .      i am constantly fearful     she admitted .      you should be .  he is much threatened .  but you are designed to function best with a high level of apprehension .         i know my specifications  yes  but  take this latest move of yours  involving him in imperial politics at the highest level .  it imposes severe strain on my task .         a necessary move .         it may distract him from his work  from psychohistory .      olivaw shook his head slowly .     i doubt that .  he is a certain special kind of human  driven .  he once remarked to me     genius does what it must and talent does what it can     thinking that he merely had talent .      she smiled ruefully .     but he is a genius .         and like all such  unique .  humans have that rare  great excursions from the mean .  evolution has selected them for it  though they do not seem to realize that .         and we .         evolution cannot act on one who lives forever .  in any case  there has not been time .  we can and do develop ourselves  however .         humans are also murderous .         we are few  they are many .  and they have deep animal spirits we cannot fathom  in the end  no matter how we try .         i care about hari  first .         and the empire  a distant second .     he gave her a thin smile .     i care for the empire only so far as it safeguards humanity .         from what .         from itself .  just remember  dors  this is the cusp era  as anticipated by ourselves for so long .  the most critical period in all of history .         i know the term  but what is the substance .  do we have a theory of history .      for the first time daneel olivaw showed expression  a rueful grimace .     we are not capable of a deep theory .  for that  we would have to understand humans far better .         but we have something .  .  .  .         a different way of viewing humanity  one now badly strained .  it caused us to shape this greatest of humanity   s creations  the empire .         i do not know of this          no need for you to .  we now require a more profound view .  that is why hari is so important .      dors frowned  troubled for reasons she could not quite express .     this earlier  simpler theory of .  .  . ours .  it tells you that humanity now must have psychohistory .         exactly .  we know this  from our own crude theory .  but only this .         for more  we rely on hari alone .         alas  yes .           part      mathist  minister       hari seldon though it is the best existing authority on the details of seldon   s life  the biography by gaal dornick cannot be trusted regarding the early rise to power .  as a young man  dornick met seldon only two years before the great mathist   s death .  by then  rumor and even legend had already begun to grow about seldon  particularly regarding his shadowy period of large scale authority within the fading imperium .   how seldon became the only mathist in all galactic history to ascend to political power remains one of the most intractable puzzles for seldon scholars .  he gave no sign of ambitions beyond the building of a science of    history      all the while envisioning not the mere fathoming of the past  but in fact the prediction of the future .   as seldon himself remarked to dornick  he early on desired    the prevention of certain kinds of futures .       certainly the mysterious exit of eto demerzel as first minister was the opening act in a play of large proportions .  that cleon i immediately turned to seldon suggests that demerzel hand picked his successor .  yet why go to seldon .  historians are divided about the motivations of the central players in this crucial moment .  the empire had entered a period of challenge and disruption  coming especially from what seldon termed the    chaos worlds .      how seldon adroitly maneuvered against powerful opponents  despite no recorded experience in the political arena  remains an active but vexing area of research .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica     note  all quotations from the encyclopedia galactica here reproduced are taken from the    th edition  published       f . e .  by the encyclopedia galactica publishing co .   terminus  with permission of the publishers .        .     he had made enough enemies to acquire a nickname  hari seldon mused  and not enough friends to hear what it was .   he could feel the truth of that in the murmuring energy in the crowds .  uneasily he walked from his apartment to his office across the broad squares of streeling university .     they don   t like me     he said .   dors vanabili matched his stride easily  studying the massed faces .     i do not sense any danger .         don   t worry your pretty head about assassination attempts  at least  not right away .         my  you   re in a fine mood today .         i hate this security screen .  who wouldn   t .      the imperial specials had fanned out in what their captain termed    an engaging perimeter    around hari and dors .  some carried flash screen projectors  capable of warding off a full heavy weapons assault .  others looked equally dangerous bare handed .   their scarlet and blue uniforms made it easy to see where the crowd was impinging on the moving security boundary as hari walked slowly across the main campus square .  where the crowd was thickest  the bright uniforms simply bulled their way through .  the entire spectacle made him acutely uncomfortable .  specials were not noted for their diplomacy and this was  after all  a quiet place of learning .  or had been .   dors clasped his hand in reassurance .     a first minister can   t simply walk around without          i   m not first minister .         the emperor has designated you  and that   s enough for this crowd .         the high council hasn   t acted .  until they do        your friends will assume the best     she said mildly .      these are my friends .     hari eyed the crowd suspiciously .      they   re smiling .      so they were .  one called     hail the prof minister .     and others laughed .      is that my nickname now .         well  it   s not a bad one .         why do they flock so .         people are drawn to power .         i   m still just a professor .      to offset his irritation  dors chuckled at him  a wifely reflex .     there   s an ancient saying     these are the times that fry men   s souls .            you have a bit of historical wisdom for everything .         it   s one of the few perks that come with being an historian .       someone called     hey  math minister .      hari said     i don   t like that name any better .         get used to it .  you   ll be called worse .      they passed by the great streeling fountain and hari took refuge in a moment of contemplating its high  arching waters .  the splashes drowned out the crowd and he could almost imagine he was back in his simple  happy life .  then he had only had to worry about psychohistory and streeling university infighting .  that snug little world had vanished  perhaps forever  the moment cleon decided to make him a figure in imperial politics .   the fountain was glorious  yet even it reminded him of the vastness that lay beneath such simplicities .  here the tinkling streams broke free  but their flight was momentary .  trantor   s waters ran in mournful dark pipes  down dim passages scoured by ancient engineers .  a maze of fresh water arteries and sewage veins twined through the eternal bowels .  these bodily fluids of the planet had passed through uncountable trillions of kidneys and throats  had washed away sins  been toasted with at marriages and births  had carried off the blood of murders and the vomit of terminal agonies .  they flowed on in their deep night  never knowing the clean vapor joy of unfettered weather  never free of man   s hand .   they were trapped .  so was he .   their party reached the mathist department and ascended .  dors rose through the traptube beside him  a breeze fluttering her hair amiably  the effect quite flattering .  the specials took up watchful  rigid positions outside .   just as he had for the last week  hari tried again with the captain .     look  you don   t really need to keep a dozen men sitting out here          i   ll be the judge of that  academician sir  if you please .      hari felt frustrated at the waste of it .  he noticed a young specialman eyeing dors  whose uni suit revealed while still covering .  something made him say     well then  i will thank you to have your men keep their eyes where they belong .      the captain looked startled .  he glared at the offending man and stomped over to reprimand him .  hari felt a spark of satisfaction .  going in the entrance to his office  dors said        i   ll try to dress more strictly .         no  no  i   m just being stupid .  i shouldn   t let tiny things like that bother me .      she smiled prettily .     actually  i rather liked it .         you did .  me being stupid .         your being protective .      dors had been assigned years before to watch over him  by eto demerzel .  hari reflected that he had gotten used to that role of hers  little noticing that it conflicted in a deep  unspoken way with her also being a woman .  dors was utterly self reliant  but she had qualities which sometimes did not easily jibe with her duty .  being his wife  for example .      i will have to do it more often     he said lightly .   still  he felt a pang of guilt about making trouble for the specialmen .  their being here was certainly not their idea  cleon had ordered it .  no doubt they would far rather be off somewhere saving the empire with sweat and valor .   they went through the high  arched foyer of the mathist department  hari nodding to the staff .  dors went into her own office and he hurried into his suite with an air of an animal retreating into its burrow .  he collapsed into his airchair  ignoring the urgent message holo that hung a meter from his face .   a wave erased it as yugo amaryl came in through the connecting e stat portal .  the intrusive  bulky portal was also the fruit of cleon   s security order .  the specials had installed the shimmering weapons nulling fields everywhere .  they lent an irksome  prickly smell of ozone to the air .  one more intrusion of reality  wearing the mask of politics .   yugo   s grin split his broad face .     got some new results .         cheer me up  show me something splendid .      yugo sat on hari   s broad  empty desk  one leg dangling .     good mathematics is always true and beautiful .         certainly .  but it doesn   t have to be true in the sense that ordinary people mean .  it can say nothing whatever about the world .         you   re making me feel like a dirty engineer .      hari smiled .     you were once  remember .         don   t i .         maybe you   d rather be sweating it out as a heatsinker .      hari had found yugo by chance eight years ago  just after arriving on trantor  when he and dors were on the run from imperial agents .  an hour   s talk had shown hari that yugo was an untutored genius at trans representational analysis .  yugo had a gift  an unconscious lightness of touch .  they had collaborated ever since .  hari honestly thought he had learned more from yugo than the other way around .      ha .     yugo clapped his big hands together three times  in the dahlite manner of showing agreeable humor .     you can grouse about doing filthy  real world work  but as long as it   s in a nice  comfortable office  i   m in paradise .         i shall have to turn most of the heavy lifting over to you  i fear .     hari deliberately put his feet up on his desk .  might as well look casual  even if he didn   t feel that way .  he envied yugo   s heavy bodied ease .      this first minister stuff .         it is getting worse .  i have to go see the emperor again .         the man wants you .  must be your craggy profile .         that   s what dors thinks  too .  i figure it   s my disarming smile .  anyway  he can   t have me .         he will .         if he forces the ministership on me  i shall do such a lousy job  cleon will fire me .      yugo shook his head .     not wise .  failed first ministers are usually tried and executed .         you   ve been talking to dors again .         she is a historian .         yes  and we   re psychohistorians .  seekers of predictability .     hari threw up his hands in exasperation .     why doesn   t that count for anything .         because nobody in the citadels of power has seen it work .         and they won   t .  once people think we can predict  we will never be free of politics .         you   re not free now     yugo said reasonably .      good friend  your worse trait is insisting on telling me the truth in a calm voice .         it saves knocking sense into your head .  that would take longer .      hari sighed .     if only muscles helped with mathematics .  you would be even better at it .      yugo waved the thought away .     you   re the key .  you   re the idea man .         well  this font of ideas hasn   t got a clue .         ideas  they   ll come .         i never get a chance to work on psychohistory anymore .         and as first minister          it will be worse .  psychohistory will go        nowhere  without you .         there will be some progress  yugo .  i am not vain enough to think everything depends on me .         it does .         nonsense .  there   s still you  the imperial fellows  and the staff .         we need leadership .  thinking leadership .         well  i could continue to work here part of the time        hari looked around his spacious office and felt a pang at the thought of not spending every day here  surrounded by his tools  tomes  and friends .  as first minister he would have a minor palace  but to him it would be mere empty  meaningless extravagance .   yugo gave him a mocking grin .     first minister is usually considered a full time job .         i know  i know .  but maybe there   s a way       the office holo bloomed into full presentation a meter from his head .  the office familiar was coded to pipe through only high priority messages .  hari slapped a key on his desk and the picture gave the gathering image a red  square frame  the signal that his filter face was on .     yes .      cleon   s personal aide appeared in red tunic against a blue background .     you are summoned     the woman said simply .      uh  i am honored .  when .      the woman went into details and hari was immediately thankful for the filter face .  the personal officer was imposing  and he did not want to appear to be what he was  a distracted professor .  his filter face had a tailored etiquette menu .  he had automatically thumbed in a suite of body language postures and gestures  tailored to mask his true feelings .      very well  in two hours .  i shall be there     he concluded with a small bow .  the filter would render that same motion  shaped to the protocols of the emperor   s staff .      drat .     he slapped his desk  making the holo dissolve .     my day is evaporating .         what   s it mean .         trouble .  every time i see cleon  it   s trouble .         i dunno  could be a chance to straighten out          i just want to be left alone .         a first ministership        you be first minister .  i will take a job as a computational specialist  change my name      hari stopped and laughed wryly .     but i   d fail at that  too .         look  you need to change your mood .  don   t want to walk in on the emperor with that scowl .         ummm .  i suppose not .  very well  cheer me up .  what was that good news you mentioned .         i turned up some ancient personality constellations .         really .  i thought they were illegal .         they are .     he grinned .     laws don   t always work .         truly ancient .  i wanted them for calibration of psychohistorical valences .  they have to be early empire .      yugo beamed .     these are pre empire .         pre impossible .         i got    em .  intact  too .         who are they .         some famous types  dunno what they did .         what status did they have  to be recorded .      yugo shrugged .     no parallel historical records  either .         are they authentic recordings .         might be .  they   re in ancient machine languages  really primitive stuff .  hard to tell .         then they could be .  .  . sims .         i   d say so .  could be they   re built on a recorded underbase  then simmed for roundness .         you can kick them up to sentience .         yeah  with some work .  got to stitch data languages .  y   know  this is  ah           illegal .  violation of the sentience codes .         right .  these guys i got it from  they   re on that new renaissance world  sark .  they say nobody polices those old codes anymore .         it   s time we kicked over a few of those ancient blocks .         yessir .     yugo grinned .     these constellations  they   re the oldest anybody   s ever found .         how did you .  .  .  .     hari let his question trail off .  yugo had many shady connections  built on his dahlite origins .      it took a little  ah  lubrication .         i thought so .  well  perhaps best that i don   t hear the details .         right .  as first minister  you don   t want dirty hands .         don   t call me that .         sure  sure  you   re just a journeyman professor .  who   s going to be late for his appointment with the emperor if he doesn   t hurry up .          .     walking through the imperial gardens  hari wished dors was with him .  he recalled her wariness over his coming again to the attention of cleon .     they   re crazy  often     she had said in a dispassionate voice .     the gentry are eccentric  which allows emperors to be bizarre .         you exaggerate     he had responded .      dadrian the frugal always urinated in the imperial gardens     she had answered .     he would leave state functions to do it  saying that it saved his subjects a needless expense in water .      hari had to suppress a laugh  palace staff were undoubtedly studying him .  he regained his sober manner by admiring the ornate  towering trees  sculpted in the spindlerian style of three millennia before .  he felt the tug of such natural beauty  despite his years buried in trantor .  here  verdant wealth stretched up toward the blazing sun like outstretched arms .  this was the only open spot on the planet  and it reminded him of helicon  where he had begun .   he had been a rather dreamy boy in a laboring district of helicon .  the work in fields and factories was easy enough that he could think his own shifting  abstract musings while he did it .  before the civil service exams changed his life  he had worked out a few simple theorems in number theory and later was crushed to find that they were already known .  he lay in bed at night thinking of planes and vectors and trying to envision dimensions larger than three  listening to the distant bleat of the puff dragons who came drifting down the mountain sides in search of prey .  bioengineered for some ancient purpose  probably hunting  they were revered beasts .  he had not seen one for many years .  .  .  .   helicon  the wild  that was what he longed for .  but his destiny seemed submerged in trantor   s steel .   hari glanced back and his specials  thinking they were summoned  trotted forward .     no     he said  his hands pushing air toward them  a gesture he was making all the time these days  he reflected .  even in the imperial gardens they acted as though every gardener was a potential assassin .   he had come this way  rather than simply emerge from the grav lifter inside the palace  because he liked the gardens above all else .  in the distant haze a wall of trees towered  coaxed upward by genetic engineering until they obscured the ramparts of trantor .  only here  on all the planet  was it possible to experience something resembling the out of doors .   what an arrogant term .  hari thought .  to define all of creation by its lying outside the doorways of humanity .   his formal shoes crunched against gravel as he left the sheltered walkways and mounted the formal ramp .  beyond the forested perimeter rose a plume of black smoke .  he slowed and estimated distance  perhaps ten klicks .  some major incident  surely .   striding between tall  neopantheonic columns  he felt a weight descend .  attendants dashed out to welcome him  his specials tightened up behind  and they made a little procession through the long corridors leading to the vault of audience .  here the accumulated great artworks of millennia crowded each other  as if seeking a constituency in the present to give them life .   the heavy hand of the imperium lay upon most official art .  the empire was essentially about the past  its solidity  and so expressed its taste with a preference for the pretty .  emperors favored the clean straight lines of ascending slabs  the exact parabolas of arcing purple water fountains  classical columns and buttresses and arches .  heroic sculpture abounded .  noble brows eyed infinite prospects .  colossal battles stood frozen at climactic moments  shaped in glowing stone and holoid crystal .   all were entirely proper and devoid of embarrassing challenge .  no alarming art here  thank you .  nothing    disturbing    was even allowed in public places on trantor which the emperor might visit .  by exporting to the periphs all hint of the unpleasantness and smell of human lives  the imperium achieved its final state  the terminally bland .   yet to hari  the reaction against blandness was worse .  among the galaxy   s twenty five million inhabited planets endless variations appeared  but there simmered beneath the imperial blanket a style based solely on rejection .   particularly among those hari termed    chaos worlds     a smug avant garde fumbled for the sublime by substituting for beauty a love of terror  shock  and the sickeningly grotesque .  they used enormous scale  or acute disproportion  or scatology  or discord and irrational disjunction .   both approaches were boring .  neither had any airy joy .   a wall dissolved  crackling  and they entered the vault of audience .  attendants vanished  his specials fell behind .  abruptly hari was alone .  he padded over the cushiony floor .  baroque excess leered at him from every raised cornice  upjutting ornament  and elaborate wainscoting .   silence .  the emperor was never waiting for anyone  of course .  the gloomy chamber gave back no echoes  as though the walls absorbed everything .   indeed  they probably did .  no doubt every imperial conversation went into several ears .  there might be eavesdroppers halfway across the galaxy .   a light  moving .  down a crackling grav column came cleon .     hari .  so happy you could come .      since refusing a summons by the emperor was traditionally grounds for execution  hari could barely suppress a wry smile .     my honor to serve  sire .         come  sit .      cleon moved heavily .  rumor had it that his appetite  already legendary  had begun to exceed even the skills of his cooks and physicians .     we have much to discuss .      the emperor   s constant attendant glow served to subtly enhance him with its nimbus .  the contrast was mild  serving to draw him out from a comparative surrounding gloom .  the room   s embedded intelligences tracked his eyes and shed added light where his gaze fell  again with delicate emphasis  subtly applied .  the soft touch of his regard yielded a radiance which guests scarcely noticed  but which acted subconsciously  adding to their awe .  hari knew this  yet the effect still worked  cleon looked masterful  regal .      i fear we have hit a snag     cleon said .      nothing you cannot master  i am sure  sire .      cleon shook his head wearily .     now don   t you  too  go on about my prodigious powers .  some .  .  .  elements      he drew the word out with dry disdain       object to your appointment .         i see .     hari kept his face blank  but his heart leaped .      do not be glum .  i do want you for my first minister .         yes  sire .         but i am not  despite commonplace assumption  utterly free to act .         i realize that many others are better qualified          in their own eyes  surely .           and better trained  and          and know nothing of psychohistory .         demerzel exaggerated the utility of psychohistory .         nonsense .  he suggested your name to me .         you know as well as  that he was exhausted  not in his best frame of          his judgment was impeccable for decades .     cleon eyed hari .     one would almost think you were trying to avoid appointment as first minister .         no  sire  but          men  and women  for that matter  have killed for far less .         and been killed  once they got it .      cleon chuckled .     true enough .  some first ministers do get self important  begin to scheme against their emperor  but let us not dwell upon the few failures of our system .      hari recalled demerzel saying     the succession of crises has reached the point where the consideration of the three laws of robotics paralyzes me .     demerzel had been unable to make choices because there were no good ones left .  every possible move hurt someone  badly .  so demerzel  a supreme intelligence  a clandestine humaniform robot  had suddenly left the scene .  what chance did hari have .      i will assume the position  of course     hari said quietly     if necessary .         oh  it   s necessary .  if possible  you mean .  factions on the high council oppose you .  they demand a full discussion .      hari blinked  alarmed .     will i have to debate .           and then a vote .         i had no idea the council could intervene .         read the codes .  they do have that power .  typically they do not use it  bowing to the superior wisdom of the emperor .     a dry little laugh .     not this time .         if it would make it easier for you  i could absent myself while the discussion          nonsense .  i want to use you to counter them .         i haven   t any ideas how to          i   ll scent out the issues  you advise me on answers .  division of labor  nothing could be simpler .         um .     demerzel had said confidently     if he believes you have the psychohistorical answer  he will follow you eagerly and that will make you a good first minister .     here  in such august surroundings  that seemed quite unlikely .      we will have to evade these opponents  maneuver against them .          i have no idea how to do that .         of course you do not .  i do .  but you see the empire and all its history as one unfurling scroll .  you have the theory .      cleon relished ruling .  hari felt in his bones that he did not .  as first minister  his word could determine the fate of millions .  that had daunted even demerzel .      there is still the zeroth law     demerzel had said just before they parted for the last time .  it placed the well being of humanity as a whole above that of any single human .  the first law then read  a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  unless this would violate the zeroth law .  fair enough  but how was hari to carry out a job which not even demerzel could do .  hari realized that he had been silent for too long  and that cleon was waiting .  what could he say .      um  who opposes me .         several factions united behind betan lamurk .         what   s his objection .      to his surprise  the emperor laughed heartily .     that you aren   t betan lamurk .         you can   t simply          overrule the council .  offer lamurk a deal .  buy him off .         i didn   t mean to imply  sire  that you would stoop to          of course i would    stoop     as you put it .  the difficulty lies with lamurk himself .  his price to allow you in as first minister would be too high .         some high position .         that  and some estates  perhaps an entire zone .      turning an entire zone of the galaxy over to a single man .  .  .    high stakes .      cleon sighed .     we are not as rich  these days .  in the reign of fletch the furious  he bartered whole zones simply for seats on the council .         your supporters  the royalists  they can   t outmaneuver lamurk .         you really must study current politics more  seldon .  though i suppose you   re so steeped in history  all this seems a bit trivial .      actually  hari thought  he was steeped in mathematics .  dors supplied the history he needed  or yugo .     i will do so .  so the royalists          have lost the dahlites  so they cannot muster a majority coalition .         the dahlites are that powerful .         they have an argument popular with a broad audience  plus a large population .         i did not know they were so strong .  my own close assistant  yugo        i know  a dahlite .  watch him .      hari blinked .     yugo is a strong dahlite  true .  but he is loyal  a fine  intuitive mathist .  but how did you          background check .     cleon waved his hand in airy dismissal .     one must know a few things about a first minister .      hari disliked being under an imperial microscope  but he kept his face blank .     yugo is loyal to me .         i know the story  how you uplifted him from hard labor  bypassing the civil service filters .  very noble of you .  but i cannot overlook the fact that the dahlites have a ready audience for their fevered outpourings .  they threaten to alter the representation of sectors in the high council  even in the lower council .  so    cleon jabbed a finger      watch him .         yes  sire .     cleon was getting steamed up about nothing  as far as yugo was concerned  but no point in arguing .      you will have to be as circumspect as the emperor   s wife during this  ah  transitional period .      hari recalled the ancient saying  that above all the emperor   s wife  or wives  depending upon the era  must keep her skirts clean  no matter what muck she walks above .  the analogy was used even when the emperor proved to be homosexual  or even when a woman held the imperial palace .     yes  sire .  uh     transitional    .  .  .  .      cleon looked off in a distracted way at the towering  shadowy art forms looming around them .  by now hari understood that this pointed to the crux of why he had been summoned .     your appointment will take a while  as the high council fidgets .  so i shall seek your advice .  .  .         without giving me the power .         well  yes .      hari felt no disappointment .     so i can stay in my office at streeling .         i suppose it would seem forward if you came here .         good .  now  about those specials          they must remain with you .  trantor is more dangerous than a professor knows .      hari sighed .     yes  sire .      cleon lounged back  his airchair folding itself about him elaborately .     now i would like your advice on this renegatum matter .         renegatum .      for the first time  hari saw cleon show surprise .     you have not followed the case .  it is everywhere .         i am a bit out of the main stream  sire .         the renegatum  the society of renegades .  they kill and destroy .         for what .         for the pleasure of destruction .     cleon slapped his chair angrily and it responded by massaging him  apparently a standard answer .     the latest of their members to    demonstrate their contempt for society    is a woman named kutonin .  she invaded the imperial galleries  torch melted art many millennia old  and killed two guards .  then she peacefully turned herself over to the officers who arrived .         you shall have her executed .         of course .  court decided she was guilty quickly enough  she confessed .         readily .         immediately .      confession under the subtle ministrations of the imperials was legendary .  breaking the flesh was easy enough  the imperials broke the suspect   s psyche  as well .     so sentence can be set by you  it being a high crime against the imperium .         oh yes  that old law about rebellious vandalism .         it allows the death penalty and any special torture .         but death is not enough .  not for the renegatum crimes .  so i turn to my psychohistorian .         you want me to     .         give me an idea .  these people say they   re doing it to bring down the existing order and all that  of course .  but they get immense planet wide coverage  their names known by everyone as the destroyers of time honored art .  they go to their graves famous .  all the psychers say that   s their real motivation .  i can kill them  but they don   t care by that time .         um     hari said uncomfortably .  he knew full well he could never comprehend such people .      so give me an idea .  something psychohistorical .     hari was intrigued by the problem  but nothing came to mind .  he had long ago learned to deliberately not concentrate on a vexing question immediately  letting his subconscious have first crack .  to gain time he asked     sire  you saw the smoke beyond the gardens .         um .  no .     cleon gave a quick hand signal to unseen eyes and the far wall blossomed with light .  a full holo of the gardens filled the massive space .  the oily black plume had grown .  it coiled snakelike into the gray sky .   a soft  neutral voice spoke in midair .     a breakdown  with insurrection by mechanicals  has caused this unfortunate lapse in domestic order .         a tiktok riot .     this sort of thing hari had heard about .   cleon rose and walked toward the holo .     ah yes  another recalcitrant riddle .  for some reason the mechanicals are going awry .  look at that .  how many levels are  burning .         twelve levels are aflame     the autovoice answered .     imperial analysis estimates a death toll of four hundred thirty seven  within an uncertainty of eighty four .         imperial cost .     cleon demanded .      minor .  some imperial regulars were hurt in subduing mechanicals .         ah .  well then  it is a small matter .     cleon watched as the wall close upped .  the view plunged down a smoking pit .  to the side  like a blazing layer cake  whole floors curled up from the heat .  sparks shot between electrical boosters .  burst pipes showered the flames but had little effect .   then a distant view  telescoping up into orbit .  the program was giving the emperor an eyeful  showing off its capabilities .  hari guessed that it didn   t often get the chance .  cleon the calm was one derisive nickname for him  for he seemed bored with most matters that moved men .   from space  the only deep green was the imperial gardens  just a splotch amid the grays and browns of roofs and roof agriculture .  charcoal black solar collectors and burnished steel  pole to pole .  the ice caps had dissipated long ago and the seas sloshed in underground cisterns .   trantor supported forty billion people in a world wrapping single city  seldom less than half a kilometer deep .  sealed  protected  its billions had long grown used to recycled air and short perspectives  and feared the open spaces a mere elevator ride away .   the view zoomed down into the smoky pit again .  hari could see tiny figures leaping to their deaths to escape the flames .  hundreds dying .  .  . hari   s stomach lurched .  in crowded stacks of humanity  accidents took a fearsome toll .   still  hari calculated  there were on average only a hundred people in a square kilometer of the planet   s surface .  people jammed into the more popular sectors out of preference  not necessity .  with the seas pumped below  there was ample room for automated factories  deep mines  and immense  cavernous growing pods  where raw materials for food emerged with little direct human labor needed .  these wearisome chores the tiktoks did .  but now they were bringing mayhem to the intricacy that was trantor  and cleon fumed as he watched the disaster grow  eating away whole layers with fiery teeth .   more figures writhed in the orange flames .  these were people  not statistics  he reminded himself .  bile rose in his throat .  to be a leader meant that sometimes you had to look away from the pain .  could he do that .      another puzzle  my seldon     cleon said abruptly .     why do the tiktoks have these large scale    disorders    my advisers keep telling me about .  ah .         i do not          there must be some psychohistorical explanation .         these tiny phenomena may well lie beyond          work on it .  find out .         uh  yes  sire .      hari knew enough to let cleon pad pointlessly around the vault  frowning at the continuing wall high scenes of carnage  in utter silence .  perhaps  hari thought  the emperor was calm because he had seen so much calamity already .  even horrendous news palls .  a sobering thought  would the same happen to the naive hari seldon .   cleon had some way of dealing with disaster  though  for after a few moments he waved and the scenes vanished .  the vault filled with cheerful music and the lighting rose .  attendants scampered out with bowls and trays of appetizers .  a man at hari   s elbow offered him a stim .  hari waved it away .  the sudden shift in mood was heady enough .  apparently it was commonplace  though  for the imperial court .   hari had felt something tickling at the back of his mind for several minutes now  and the quiet moments had given him a chance to finally pay attention to it .  as cleon accepted a stim  he said hesitantly     sire  i   .         yes .  have one  ah .         nossir  i  i had a thought about the renegatum and the kutonin woman .         oh  my  i   d rather not think about          suppose you erase her identity .      cleon   s hand stopped with a stim halfway to his nose .     ah .         they are willing to die  once they   ve attracted attention .  they probably think they will live on  be famous .  take that away from them .  permit no release of their true names .  in all media and official documents  give them an insulting name .      cleon frowned .     another name .  .  .  .         call this kutonin woman moron one .  the next one  moron thro .  make it illegal by imperial decree to ever refer to her any other way .  then she as a person vanishes from history .  no fame .      cleon brightened .     now  that   s an idea .  i   ll try it .  i not merely take their lives  i can take their selves .      hari smiled wanly as cleon spoke to an adjutant  giving instructions for a fresh imperial decree .  hari hoped it would work  but in any case  it had gotten him off the hook .  cleon did not seem to notice that the idea had nothing to do with psychohistory .   pleased  he tried an appetizer .  they were startlingly good .   cleon beckoned to him .     come  first minister  i have some people for you to meet .  they might prove useful  even to a mathist .         i am honored .     dors had coached him on a few homilies to use when he could think of nothing to say and he trotted one out now .     whatever would be useful in service to the people          ah  yes  the people     cleon drawled .     i hear so much about them .      hari realized that cleon had spent a life listening to pat  predictable speeches .     sorry  sire  i          it reminds me of a poll result  assembled by my trantorian specialists .     cleon took an appetizer from a woman half his size .     they asked     to what do you attribute the ignorance and apathy of the trantorian masses .     and the most common reply was    don   t know and don   t care .         only when cleon laughed did hari realize this was a joke .       .     he woke with ideas buzzing in his head .   hari had learned to lie still  facedown in the gossamer e field net that cradled his neck and head in optimum alignment with his spine .  .  . to drift .  .  .  and let the flitting notions collide  merge  fragment .   he had learned this trick while working on his thesis .  overnight his subconscious did a lot of his work for him  if he would merely listen to the results in the morning .  but they were delicate motes  best caught in the fine fabric of half sleep .   he sat up abruptly and made three quick notes on his end table .  the squiggles would be sent to his primary computer  for later recall at the office .      rooowwwrr     dors said  stretching .     the intellect is already up .         um     he said  staring into space .      c   mon  before breakfast is body time .         see if you disagree with this idea i just had .  suppose          i am not inclined  academician professor seldon  to argue .      hari came out of his trance .  dors threw back the covers and he admired her long  slim legs .  she had been sculpted for strength and speed  but such qualities converged in an agreeable concert of surfaces  springy to the touch  yielding yet resisting .  he felt himself jerked out of his mood and into      body time  yes .  you are inclined for other purposes .         trust a scholar to put the proper definition to a word .      in the warm  dizzying scuffle that followed there was some laughter  some sudden passion  and best of all  no time to think .  he knew this was just what he needed  after the tensions of yesterday  and dors knew it even better .   he emerged from the vaporium to the smell of kaff and breakfast  served out by the autos .  the news flitted across the far wall and he managed to ignore most of it .  dors came out of her vaporium patting her hair and watched the wall raptly .     looks like more stalling in the high council     she said .     they   re putting off the ritual search for more funding in favor of arguments over sector sovereignty .  if the dahlites          not before i ingest some calories .         but this is just the sort of thing you must keep track of .         not until i have to .         you know i don   t want you to do anything dangerous  but for now  not paying attention is foolish .         maneuvering  who   s up and who   s down  spare me .  facts i can face .         fond of facts  aren   t you .         of course .         they can be brutal .         sometimes they   re all we have .     he thought a moment  then grasped her hand .     facts  and love .         love is a fact  too .         mine is .  the undying popularity of entertainments devoted to romance suggests that to most people it is not a fact but a goal .         an hypothesis  you mathematicians would say .         granted .     conjecture     to be precise .         preserve us from precision .      he swept her suddenly into his arms  cupped her rump in his hands and  with some effort he took trouble to conceal  lifted her .     but this  this is a fact .         my  my .     she kissed him fiercely .     the man is not all mind .      he succumbed to the seductive  multisensic news as he munched .  he had grown up on a farm and liked big breakfasts .  dors ate sparingly  her twin religions  she said  were exercise and hari seldon  the first to preserve her strength for the second .  he thumbed his own half of the wall to the infinitesimal doings of markets  finding there a better index of how trantor was doing than in the stentorian bluster of the high council .   as a mathist  he liked following the details .  but after five minutes of it he slapped the table in frustration .      people have lost their good sense .  no first minister can protect them from their own innocence .         my concern is protecting you from them .     hari blanked his holo and watched hers  an ornate  d of the factions in the high council .  red tracers linked factions there with allies in the low council  a bewildering snake pit .     you don   t think this first minister thing is going to work  do you .         it could .         they   re absolutely right  i   m not qualified .         is cleon .         well  he has been reared to do the job .         you   re ducking the question .         exactly .     hari finished his steak and began on the egg quhili souffl   .  he had left the e stim on all night to improve his muscle tone and that made him hungry .  that  and the delightful fact that dors viewed sex as an athletic opportunity .      i suppose your present strategy is best     dors said thoughtfully .     remain a mathist  at a lofty remove from the fray .         right .  nobody assassinates a guy with no power .         but they do    erase    those who might get in the way of their taking power .      hari hated thinking of such things so early .  he dug into the souffl   .  it was easy to forget  amid the tastes specially designed to fit his own well tabulated likes  that the manufacturum built their meal from sewage .  eggs that had never known the belly of a bird .  meat appeared without skin or bones or gristle or fat .  carrots arrived without topknots .  a food manfac was delicately tuned to reproduce tastes  just short of the ability to actually make a live carrot .  the minor issue of whether his souffl   tasted like a real one  made by a fine chef  faded to unimportance compared with the fact that it tasted good to him  the only audience that mattered .   he realized that dors had been talking for some moments about high council maneuverings and he had not registered a word .  she had advice on how to handle the inevitable news people  on how to receive calls  on everything .  everyone did  these days .  .  .  .   hari finished  had some kaff  and felt ready to face the day as a mathist  not as a minister .     reminds me of what my mother used to say .  know how you make god laugh .      dors looked blank  drawn out of her concentration .     how to   oh  this is humor .         you tell him your plans .      she laughed agreeably .   outside their apartment they acquired the specials again .  hari felt they were unnecessary  dors was quite enough .  but he could scarcely explain that to imperial officials .  there were other specials on the floors above and below as well  a full volume defense screen .  hari waved to friends he saw on the way across the streeling campus  but the presence of the specials held them at too great a distance to speak .   he had a lot of mathist department business to tend to  but he followed his instinct and put his calculations first .  briskly he retrieved his ideas from the bedside notepad and stared at them  doodling absently in air  stirring symbols like a pot of soup  for over an hour .   when he was a teenager the rigid drills of schooling had made him think that mathematics was just felicity with a particular kind of minutiae  knowing things  a sort of high grade coin collecting .  you learned relations and theorems and put them together .   only slowly did he glimpse the soaring structures above each discipline .  great spans joined the vistas of topology to the infinitesimal intricacies of differentials  or the plodding styles of number theory to the shifting sands of group analysis .  only then did he see mathematics as a landscape  a territory of the mind to rove and scout .   to traverse those expanses he worked in mind time  long stretches of uninterrupted flow when he could concentrate utterly on problems  fixing them like flies in timeless amber  turning them this way and that to his inspecting light  until they yielded their secrets .   phones  people  politics  all these transpired in real time  snipping his thought train  killing mind time .  so he let yugo and dors and others fend off the world throughout the morning .   but today yugo himself snipped his concentration .     just a mo     he said  slipping through the crackling door field .     this paper look right .      he and yugo had developed a plausible cover for the psychohistory project .  they regularly published research on the nonlinear analysis of    social nuggets and knots     a sub field with an honorable and dull history .  their analysis applied to subgroups and factions in trantor  and occasionally on other worlds .   the research was in fact useful to psychohistory  serving as a subset of equations to what yugo insisted on calling the full    seldon equations .     hari had given up being irked at this term  even though he wished to keep a personal distance from the theory .   though scarcely a waking hour passed without his thinking about psychohistory  he did not want it to be a template for his own worldview .  nothing rooted in a particular personality could hope to describe the horde of saints and rascals revealed by human history .  one had to take the longest view possible .      see     yugo said  making lines of print and symbols coalesce on hari   s holo .     i got all the analysis of the dahlite crisis .  neat as you please  huh .         um  what   s the dahlite crisis .      yugo   s surprise was profound .     we   re not bein    represented .          you live in streeling .         once a dahlan  you   re always one .  just like you  from helical .         helicon .  i see  you don   t have enough delegates in the low council .         or the high .         the codes allow          they   re out of date .         dahlites get a proportional share          and our neighbors  the ratannanahs and the quippons  they   re schemin    against us .         how so .         there   re dahlans in plenty other sectors .  they don   t get represented .         you   re spoken for by our streeling          look  hari  you   re a helical .  wouldn   t understand .  plenty sectors  they   re just places to sleep .  dahl is a people .         the codes set forth rules for accommodating separate subcultures  ethnicities          they   re not workin    .      hari saw from yugo   s jutting jaw that this was not a point for graceful debate .  he did know something of the slowly gathering constitutional crisis .  the codes had maintained a balance of forces for millennia  but only by innovative adaptation .  little of that seemed available now .     we agree on that .  so how does our research bear upon dahl .         see  i took the socio factor analysis and       yugo had an intuitive grasp of nonlinear equations .  it was always a pleasure to watch his big hands cut the air  slicing through points and pounding objections to pulp .  and the calculations were good  if a bit simple .   the nuggets and knots work attracted little attention .  it had made some in mathematics write him off as a promising young man who had never risen to his potential .  this was perfectly all right with hari .  some mathists guessed that his true core research went unpublished  these he treated kindly but gave no hint of confirmation .        so there   s a pressure nugget buildin    in dahl  you bet     yugo finished .      of course  glancing at the news holos shows that .         well  yeah  but i   ve proved it   s justified .      hari kept his face composed  yugo was really worked up about this .     you   ve shown one of the factors .  but there are others in the knot equations .         well  sure  but everybody knows          what everybody knows doesn   t need much proof .  unless  of course  it   s wrong .      yugo   s face showed a rush of emotions  surprise  concern  anger  hurt  puzzlement .     you don   t support dahl  hari .         of course i do  yugo .     actually  the truth was that hari didn   t care .  but that was too bald a point to make  with yugo seeming wounded .     look  the paper is fine .  publish .         the three basic knot equations  they   re yours .         no need to call them that .         sure  just like before .  but your name goes on the paper .      something tickled hari   s mind  but he saw the right answer now was to reassure yugo .     if you like .      yugo went on about details of publication  and hari let his eyes drift over the equations .  terms for representation in models of trantorian democracy  value tables for social pressures  the whole apparatus .  a bit stuffy .  but reassuring to those who suspected that he was hiding his major results  as he was  of course .   hari sighed .  dahl was a festering political sore .  dahlites on trantor mirrored the culture of the dahl galactic zone .  every powerful zone had its own sectors in trantor  for influence peddling and general pressuring .   but dahl was minor on the scale that he wanted to explore  simple  even trivial .  the knot equations which described high council representation were truncated forms of the immensely worse riddle of trantor .   all of trantor  one teeming world  baffling in its sheer size  its intricate connections  meaningless .  coincidences  random juxtapositions  sensitive dependencies .  his equations were still terribly inadequate for this shell which housed forty billion bustling souls .   how much worse was the empire .   people  confronting bewildering complexity  tend to find their saturation level .  they master the easy connections  local links  and rules of thumb .  they push this until they meet a wall of complexity too thick and high and hard to grasp  to climb .   there they stall .  gossip  consult  fret  and finally  gamble .   the empire of twenty five million worlds was a problem greater even than understanding the whole rest of the universe  because at least the galaxies beyond did not have humans in them .  the blind  blunt motions of stars and gas were child   s play  compared to the convoluted trajectories of people .   sometimes it wore him down .  trantor was bad enough  eight hundred sectors with forty billion people .  what of the empire  with twenty five million planets of average four billion souls apiece .  one hundred quadrillion people .   worlds interacted through the narrow necks of wormholes  which at least simplified some of the economic issues .  but culture traveled at the speed of light through wormholes  information without mass  zooming across the galaxy in destabilizing waves .  a farmer on oskatoon knew that a duchy had fallen on the other side of the galactic disk a few hours after the blood on the palace floor started turning brown .   how to include that .   clearly  the empire extended beyond the complexity horizon of any person or computer .  only sets of equations which did not try to keep track of every detail could work .   which meant that an individual was nothing on the scale of events worth studying .  even a million made about as much difference as a single raindrop falling in a lake .   suddenly hari was even more glad that he had kept psychohistory secret .  how would people react if they knew that he thought they didn   t matter .      hari .  hari .      he had been musing again .  yugo was still in the office .     oh  sorry  just mulling over          the department meeting .         what .      you called it for today .         oh  no .     he was halfway through a calculation .     can   t we delay .  .  .  .         the whole department .  they   re waiting .      hari dutifully followed yugo into the assembly room .  the three traditional levels were already filled .  cleon   s patronage had filled out an already high ranked department until it was probably  how could one measure such things .   the best on trantor .  it had specialists in myriad disciplines  even areas whose very definitions hari was a bit vague about .   hari took his position at the hub of the highest level  at the exact center of the room .  mathists liked geometries which mirrored realities  so the full professors sat on a round  raised platform  in airchairs with ample arms .   forming a larger annulus around them  a few steps lower  were the associate professors  those with tenure  but still at the middle rank in their careers .  they had comfortable chairs  though without full computing and holo functions .   below them  almost in a pit  were the untenured professors  on simple chairs of sturdy design .  the oldest sat nearest the room   s center .  in their outer ranks were the instructors and assistants  on plain benches without any computer capabilities whatever .  yugo rested there  scowling  plainly feeling out of place .   hari had always thought it was either enraging or hilarious  depending on his mood  that one of the most productive members of the department  yugo  should have such low status .  this was the true price of keeping psychohistory secret .  the pain of this he tried to soothe by giving yugo a good office and other perks .  yugo seemed to care little for status  since he had already ascended so far .  and all without the civil service exams  too .   today  hari decided to make a little mischief .     thank you  colleagues  for attending .  we have many administrative matters to engage .  yugo .      a rustle .  yugo   s eyes widened  but he stood up quickly and climbed up to the speaker   s platform .   he always had someone else chair meetings  even though as chairman he had called them  chosen the hour  fixed the agenda .  he knew that some regarded him as a strong personality  simply by dint of knowing the research agenda so deeply .   that was a common error  mistaking knowledge for command .  he had found that if he presided  there was little dissent from his own views .  to get open discussion demanded that he sit back and listen and take notes  intervening only at key moments .   years ago yugo had wondered why he did this  and hari waved away the problem .     i   m not a leader     he said .  yugo gave him a strange look  as if to say  who do you think you   re kidding .   hari smiled to himself .  some of the full professors around him were muttering  casting glances .  yugo launched into the agenda  speaking quickly in a strong  clear voice .   hari sat back and watched irritation wash over some of his esteemed colleagues .  noses wrinkled at yugo   s broad accent .  one of them mouthed to another  dahlite .  and was answered  upstart .   about time they got    a bit of the boot     as his father had once termed it .  and for yugo to get a taste of running the department .   after all  this first minister business could get worse .  he could need a replacement .       .        we should leave soon     hari said  scribbling on his notepad .      why .  the reception doesn   t start for ages .     she smoothed out her dress with great care  eyes critical .      i want to take a walk on the way .         the reception is in dahviti sector .         humor me .      she pulled on the sheath dress with some effort .     i wish this weren   t the style .         wear something else  then .         this is your first appearance at an imperial affair .  you   ll want to look your best .         translation  you look your best and stand next to me .         you   re just wearing that streeling professorial garb .         appropriate to the occasion .  i want to show that i   m still just a professor .      she worked on the dress some more and finally said     you know  some husbands would enjoy watching their wives do this .      hari looked up as she wriggled into the last of the clingy ensemble in amber and blue .     surely you don   t want to get me all excited and then have to endure the reception that way .      she smiled impishly .     that   s exactly what i want .      he lounged back in his airchair and sighed theatrically .     mathematics is a finer muse .  less demanding .      she tossed a shoe at him  missing by a precise centimeter .   hari grinned .     careful  or the specials will rush to defend me .      dors began her finishing touches and then glanced at him  puzzled .     you are even more distracted than usual .         as always  i fit my research into the nooks and crannies of life .         the usual problem .  what   s important in history .         i   d prefer to know what   s not .         i agree that the customary mega history approach  economics and politics and the rest  isn   t enough .      hari looked up from his pad .     there are some historians who think that the little rules of a society have to be counted  to understand the big laws that make it work .         i know that research .     dors twisted her mouth doubtfully .     small rules and big laws .  how about simplifying .  maybe the laws are just all the rules  added up .         of course not .         example     she persisted .   he wanted to think  but she would not be put off .  she poked him in the ribs .     example .         all right .  here   s a rule  whenever you find something you like  buy a lifetime supply  because they   re sure to stop making it .         that   s ridiculous .  a joke .         not much of a joke  but it   s true .         well  do you follow this rule .         of course .         how .         remember the first time you looked in my closet .      she blinked .  he grinned  recalling .  she had been subtly snooping  and slid aside the large but feather light door .  in a rectangular grid of shelves were clothes sorted by type  then color .  dors had gasped .     six blue suits .  at least a dozen padshoes  all black .  and shirts .   off white  olive  a few red .  at least fifty .  so many  all alike .         and exactly what i like     he had said .     this also solves the problem of choosing what to wear in the morning .  i just reach in at random .         i thought you wore the same clothes day after day .      he had raised his eyebrows  aghast .     the same .  you mean  dirty clothes .         well  when they didn   t change .  .  .         i change every day .     he chuckled  remembering  and said     then i usually put on the same outfit the next day  because i like it .  and you will not find any of those available in the stores again .         i   ll say     she said  fingering the weave on his shirts .     these are at least four seasons out of fashion .         see .  the rule works .         to me  a week is twenty one clothing opportunities .  to you  it   s a chore .         you   re ignoring the rule .         how long did you dress that way .         since i noticed how much time i spent making decisions about what to wear .  and that what i really liked to wear wasn   t in the stores very often .  i generalized a solution to both problems .         you   re amazing .         i   m simply systematic .         you   re obsessional .         you   re judging  not diagnosing .         you   re a dear .  crazy  but a dear .  maybe they go together .         is that a rule  too .      she kissed him .     yes  professor .        the inevitable special screen formed about them the instant they left their apartment .  by now he and dors had trained the specials to at least allow them the privacy of a single wedge in the drop tube .   the grav drop was in fact no miracle of gravitational physics  it came from advanced electromagnetics .  each instant over a thousand electrostatic fields supported him through intricate charge imbalances .  he could feel them playing in his hair  small twinges skating across his skin  as the field configurations handed him off to each other  each lowering his mass infinitesimally down the chute .   when they left the wedge  thirteen floors higher  dors passed a charge programmed comb through her hair .  it crackled and snapped obediently into its style     smart    hair .   they entered a broad passageway lined with shops .  hari liked being in a place where he could see farther than a hundred meters .   movement was quick because there was no cross traffic for any conveyance .  a slidewalk ran at the center  going their way  but they stayed near the shop windows and browsed as they ambled .   to move laterally  one simply went up or down a level by elevator or escalator  then stepped on a moving belt or entered a robopod .  in the corridors to both sides the slideway ran opposite .  with no left or right turns  traffic mishaps were rare .  most people walked wherever was practical  for the exercise and for the indefinable exhilaration of trantor itself .  people who came here wanted the constant stimulation of humanity  ideas  and cultures rubbing against each other in productive friction .  hari was not immune to it  though it lost some savor if overdone .   people in the squares and park hexagons wore fashions from the twenty five million worlds .  he saw self shaping    leathers    from animals who could not possibly have resembled the mythical horse .  a man sauntered by with leggings slit to his hip  exposing blue striped skin that bunched and slid in a perpetual show .  an angular woman sported a bodice of open mouthed faces  each swallowing ivory nippled breasts  he had to look twice to believe they weren   t real .  girls in outrageously cut pomp vestments paraded noisily .  a child  or was it a normal inhabitant of a strong grav world .   played a photozither  strumming its laser beams .   the specials fanned out and their captain came trotting over .     we can   t cover you well here  academician sir .         these are ordinary people  not assassins .  they had no way of predicting that i   d be here .         emperor says cover you  we cover you .      dors rapped back smartly     i   ll handle the close in threats .  i   m able  i assure you .      the captain   s mouth twisted sourly  but he gave himself a moment before saying     i heard something about that .  still          have your men use their range detectors vertically .  a shaped charge on the layers below and above could catch us .         uh  yes   m .     he trotted off .   they passed by the jigsaw walls of the farhahal quadrant .  a wealthy ancient had become obsessed with the notion that as long as his estate was unfinished  he would not himself finish  that is  die .  whenever an addition neared completion  he ordered up more .  eventually the tangle of rooms  runways  vaults  bridges and gardens became an incoherent motley stuck into every cranny of the original  rather simple design .  when farhahal eventually did    finish     a tower half built  bickering by his heirs and lawyerly plundering of the estate for their fees brought the quadrant low .  now it was a fetid warren  visited only by the predatory and the unwary .   the specials pulled in tight and the captain urged them to get into a robo .  hari grudgingly agreed .  dors had the concentrated look that meant she was worried .  they sped in silence through shadowy tunnels .  there were two stops and in the brilliantly lit stations hari saw rats scurrying for shelter as the pod eased to a halt .  he silently pointed them out to dors .      brrrr     she said .     one would think that at the very center of the empire we could eliminate pests .         not these days     hari said  though he suspected the rats had thrived even at the height of empire .  rodents cared little for grandeur .      i suppose they   ve been our eternal companions     dors said somberly .     no world is free of them .         in these tunnels  the long distance pods fly so fast that occasionally rats get sucked into the air breathing engines .      dors said uneasily     that could damage the engines  even crash the pods .         no holiday for the rat  either .      they passed through a sector whose citizens abhorred sunlight  even the wan splashes which came down through the layers by radiance tubes .  historically  dors told him  this had arisen from fears of its ultraviolet component  but the phobia seemed to go deeper than a mere health issue .   their pod slowed and passed along a high ramp above open  swarming vaults .  no natural light shafts brought illumination  only artificial phosphor glows .  the sector was officially named kalanstromonia  but its citizens were known worldwide as spooks .  they seldom traveled  and their bleached faces stood out in crowds .  gazing down at them  they looked to hari like swarms of grubs feeding on shadowy decay .   the imperial zonal reception was inside a dome in the julieen sector .  he and dors entered with the specials  who then gave way to five men and women wearing utterly inconspicuous business dress .  these nodded to hari and then appeared to forget him  moving down a broad rampway and chatting with each other .   a woman at the grand doorway made too much of his entrance .  music descended around him in a sound cloud  an arrangement of the streeling anthem blended subtly with the helicon symphony  this attracted attention from the crowds below  exactly what he did not want .  a protocol team smoothly took the handoff from the door attendants  escorting him and dors to a balcony .  he was happy for the chance to look at the view .   from the peak of the dome the vistas were startling .  spirals descended to plateaus so distant he could barely make out a forest and paths .  the ramparts and gardens there had drawn millennia of spectators  including  a guide told him          suicides  all carefully tabulated through many centuries .   now that the number approached a million  the guide went on with relish  attempts occurred nearly every hour .  a man had been stopped just short of leaping that very day  wearing a gaudy holosuit programmed to flash i made the million after he struck .      they seem so eager      the guide concluded with what seemed to hari a kind of pride .      well     hari remarked  trying to get rid of the man     suicide is the most sincere form of self criticism .      the guide nodded wisely  unperturbed  and added     also  it does give them something to contribute to .  that must be a consolation .      the protocol team had  all planned out for him  an orbit through the vast reception .  meet x  greet y  bow to z .      say nothing about the judena zone crisis     an aide insisted .  this was easy  since he had never heard of it .   the appetite enhancers were excellent  the food that followed even better  or seemed so  which was the point of the enhancers   and he took a stim offered by a gorgeous woman .      you could get through this entire evening just nodding and smiling and agreeing with people     dors said after the first half hour .      it   s tempting to do just that     hari whispered as they followed the protocol lieutenant to the next bunch of zonal figures .  the air in the vast  foggy dome was freighted with negotiations advanced and bargains struck .   the emperor arrived with full pomp .  he would pay the traditional hour   s tribute  then by ancient custom leave before anyone else was permitted to .  hari wondered if the emperor ever wanted to linger in the middle of an interesting conversation .  cleon was well schooled in emperorhood  though  so the issue probably never came up .  cleon greeted hari effusively  kissed dors    hand  and then seemed to lose interest in them within two minutes  moving on with his entourage to another circle of expectant faces .   hari   s next group proved different .  not the usual mix of diplomats  aristos  and anxious brownclad assistants  his lieutenant told him  but high figures .     people with punch     the man whispered .   a large  muscular man was holding forth at the center of a circle  a dozen faces raptly following his every word .  the protocol lieutenant tried to whisk them past  but hari stopped her .     that   s .  .  .         betan lamurk  sir .         knows how to hold a crowd .         indeed  sir .  would you like a formal introduction .         no  just let me listen .      it was always a good idea to size up an opponent before he knew he was being watched .  hari   s father had taught him that trick  just before his first matheletic competition .  such techniques had not managed to save his father  but they worked in the milder groves of academe .   black hair invaded his broad brow like a pincer attack  two pointed wedges reaching down to nearly the end of his eyebrows .  his hooded eyes were widely spaced and blazed intently from a rigging of mirth wrinkles .  a slender nose seemed to point to his proudest feature  a mouth assembled from varying parts .  the lower lip curled in full  impudent humor .  the upper  thin and muscular  curled downward in a curve that verged on a sneer .  a viewer would know the upper lip could overrule the lower at any moment  shifting mood abruptly  a disquieting effect which could not have been bettered if he had designed it himself .   hari realized quickly that  of course  lamurk had .   lamurk was discussing some detail of interzonal trade in the orion spiral arm  a hot issue before the high council at the moment .  hari cared nothing about trade  except as a variable in stochastic equations  so he simply watched the man   s manner .   to underline a point lamurk would raise his hands over his head  fingers open  voice rising .  then  his point made  his voice evened out and he lowered them to chest height  held precisely side by side .  as his well modulated voice became deeper and more reflective  he moved the hands apart .  then  voice rising again  his hands soared to head level and windmilled one around the other  the subject now complex  the listener thereby commanded to pay close attention .   he kept close eye contact with the whole audience  a piercing gaze sweeping the circle .  a last point  a quick touch of humor  grin flashing  sure of himself  a pause for the next question .   he finished his point with       and for some of us     pax imperium    looks more like    tax imperium     eh .     then he saw hari .  a quick furrowing of his brow  then     academician seldon .  welcome .  i   d been wondering when i was going to get to meet you .         don   t let me interrupt your  ah  lecture .      this provoked some titters and hari saw that to accuse a member of the high council of pontificating was a mild social jab .     i found it fascinating .         pretty humdrum stuff  i   m afraid  compared to you mathists     lamurk said cordially .      i am afraid my mathematics is even more dry than zonal trade .      more titters  though this time hari could not quite see why .      i just try to separate out the factions     lamurk said genially .     people treat money like it is a religion .      this gained him some agreeing laughter .  hari said     fortunately  there are no sects in geometry .         we   re just trying to get the best deal for the whole empire  academician .         the best is the enemy of the good  i   d imagine .         i suppose then  you   ll be applying mathematical logic to our problems on the council .     lamurk   s voice remained friendly  but his eyes took on a veiled character .     assuming you gain a ministership .         alas  so far as the laws of mathematics are sharp and certain  they do not refer to reality .  so far as they refer to reality  they are not certain .      lamurk glanced at the crowd  which had grown considerably .  dors grasped hari   s hand and he realized from her squeeze that this had somehow turned into something important .  he could not see why  but there was no time to size up the situation .   lamurk said     then this psychohistory thing i hear about  it   s not useful .         not to you  sir     hari said .   lamurk   s eyes narrowed  but his affable grin remained .     too tough for us .         not ready for use  i   m afraid .  i don   t have the logic of it yet .      lamurk chuckled  beamed at the still growing crowd  and said jovially     a logical thinker .   what a refreshing contrast with the real world .      general laughter .  hari tried to think of something to say .  he saw one of his bodyguards block a man nearby  inspect something in the man   s suit  then let him go .      y   see  academician  on the high council we can   t be spending our time on theory .     lamurk paused for effect  as though making a campaign speech .     we   ve got to be just .  .  . and sometimes  folks  we   ve got to be hard .      hari raised an eyebrow .     my father used to say     it   s a hard man who   s only just  and a sad man who   s only wise .         a few ooohs in the crowd told him he had scored a hit .  lamurk   s eyes confirmed the cut .      well  we do try on the council  we do .  no doubt we can use some help from the learned quarters of the empire .  i   ll have to read one of your books  academician .     he shot a look with raised eyebrows at the crowd .     assuming i can .      hari shrugged .     i will send you my monograph on transfinite geometric calculus .         impressive title     lamurk said  eyes playing to the audience .      it   s the same with books as with men  a very small number play great parts  the rest are lost in the multitude .         and which would you rather be .     lamurk shot back .      among the multitudes .  at least i wouldn   t have to attend so many receptions .      this got a big laugh  surprising hari .  lamurk said     well  i   m sure the emperor won   t tire you out with too much socializing .  but you   ll get invited everywhere .  you   ve got a sharp tongue on you  academician .         my father had another saying  too .     wit is like a razor .  razors are more likely to cut those who use them when they   ve lost their edge .         his father had also told him that in a public trade of barbs  the one who lost temper first lost the exchange .  he had not recalled that until this instant .  hari remembered too late that lamurk was known for his humor in high council meetings .  probably scripted for him  certainly he displayed none here .   a quick tightening of the cheeks spread into a bloodless white line of lip .  lamurk   s features twisted into an expression of distaste  not a long way to go  for most of them  and he gave an ugly  wet laugh .   the crowd stood absolutely silent .  something had happened .      ah  there are other people who would like to meet the academician     hari   s lieutenant said  sliding neatly into the growing  awkward silence .   hari shook hands  murmured meaningless pleasantries  and let himself be whisked away .       .     he had another stim to calm himself .  somehow he was more jittery afterward than during the social collision .  lamurk had given hari a cold  angry stare as they parted .      i   ll keep track of him     dors said .     you just enjoy your fame .      to hari this was a flat impossibility  but he tried .  seldom did one see such a variety of people  and he calmed himself by lapsing into a habitual role  polite observer .  it was not as though the usual social chitchat demanded much concentration .  a warm smile would do most of the work for him here .   the party was a microcosm of trantorian society .  in spare moments  hari watched the social orders interact .   cleon   s grandfather had reinstated many ruellian traditions  and one of those customs required that members of all five classes be present at any grand imperial function .  cleon seemed especially keen on this practice  as if it would raise his popularity among the masses .  hari kept his own doubts private .   first and obvious came the gentry  the inherited aristocracy .  cleon himself stood at the apex of a pyramid of rank that descended from the imperium to mighty quadrant dukes and spiral arm princes  past life peers  all the way down to the local barons hari used to know back on helicon .   working in the fields  he had seen them pompously scudding overhead .  each governed a domain no larger than they could cross by flitter in a day .  to a member of the gentry  life was busy with the great game  a ceaseless campaign to advance the fortunes of one   s noble house  arranging greater status for your family line through political alliances  or marriages for your many children .   hari snorted in derision  masking it by taking another stim .  he had studied anthropological reports from a thousand fallen worlds  those that had devolved in isolation  reverting to cruder ways of life .  he knew this pyramid shaped order to be among the most natural and enduring human social patterns .  even when a planet was reduced to simple agriculture and hand forged metals  the same triangular format endured .  people liked rank and order .   the endless competition of gentry families had been the first and easiest psychohistorological system hari ever modeled .  he had first combined basic game theory and kin selection .  then  in a moment of inspiration  he inserted them into the equations that described sand grains skidding down the slopes of a dune .  that correctly described sudden transitions  social slippages .   so it was with the rise and fall of noble family lines .  long  smooth eras  then abrupt shifts .   he watched the crowd  picking out those in the second aristocracy  supposedly equal to the first  the meritocracy .   as department chairman at a major imperial university  hari was himself a lord in that hierarchy  a pyramid of achievement rather than of birth .  meritocrats had entirely different obsessions than the gentry   s constant dynastic bickerings .  in fact  few in hari   s class bothered to breed at all  so busy were they in their chosen fields .  gentry jostled for the top ranks of imperial government  while second tier meritocrats saw themselves wielding the real power .   if only cleon had such a role in mind for me  hari thought .  a vice minister position  or an advisory post .  he could have managed that for a time  or else bungled it and got himself forced out of office .  either way  he would be safe back at streeling within a year or two .  they don   t execute vice ministers .  .  . not for incompetence  at least .   nor did a vice minister feel the worst burden of rule bearing responsibility for the lives of a quadrillion human beings .   dors saw him drifting along in his own thoughts .  under her gentle urging  he sampled tasty savories and made small talk .   the gentry could be distinguished by their ostentatiously fashionable clothing  while the economists  generals and other meritocrats tended to wear the formal garb of their professions .   so he was making a political statement  after all  hari realized .  in wearing professor   s robes  he emphasized that there might be a non gentry first minister for the first time in forty years .   not that he minded making that statement .  hari just wished he had done it on purpose .   despite the official ruellian ethos  the remaining three social classes seemed nearly invisible at the party .   the factotums wore somber costumes of brown or gray  with expressions to match .  they seldom spoke on their own .  usually they hovered at the elbow of some aristo  supplying facts and even figures that the more gaily dressed guests used in their arguments .  aristos generally were innumerate  unable to do simple addition .  that was for machines .   hari found that he actually had to concentrate in order to pick the fourth class  the greys  out of the crowd .  he watched them move  like finches among peacocks .   yet their kind made up more than a sixth of trantor   s population .  drawn from every planet in the empire by the all seeing civil service tests  they came to the capital world  served their time like bachelor monks  and left again for outworld postings .  flowing through trantor like water in the gloomy cisterns  the greys were seldom thought of  as honest and commonplace and dull as the metal walls .   that might have been his life  he realized .  it was the way out of the fields for many of the brighter children he had known at helicon .  except that hari had been plucked right over the bureaucracy  sent straight to academe by the time he could solve a mere eighth order tensor defoliation  at age ten .   ruellianism preached that    citizen    was the highest social class of all .  in theory  even the emperor shared sovereignty with common men and women .   but at a party like this  the most numerous galactic group was represented mostly by the servants carrying food and drink around the hall  even more invisible than the dour bureaucrats .  the majority of trantor   s population  the laborers and mechanics and shopkeepers  the denizens of the     sectors  had no station at a gathering like this .  they lay outside the ruellian ranking .   as for the artes  that final social order was not meant to be invisible .  musicians and jugglers strolled among the guests  the smallest  most flamboyant class .   even more dashing was an air sculptor hari spotted across the vast chamber  when dors pointed him out .  hari had heard of the new art form .  the    statues    were of colored smoke that the artist exhaled in rapid puffs .  shapes of eerie  ghostlike complexity floated among the bemused guests .  some figures clearly made fun of the courtly gentry  as puffy caricatures of their ostentatious clothes and poses .   to hari   s eye  the smoke figures seemed entrancing .  .  . until they started drifting apart into tatters  without substance or predictability .      it   s all the mode     he heard one onlooker remark .     i hear the artist comes straight from sark .          the renaissance world .     another asked  wide eyed .     isn   t that a little daring .  who invited him .         the emperor himself  it   s said .      hari frowned .  sark  where those personality simulations came from .     renaissance world     he muttered irritably  knowing now what he disliked about the smoke shapes  their ephemeral nature .  their intended destiny  to dissolve into chaos .   as he watched  the air sculptor blew a satirical tableau .  the first figure formed of crimson smoke  and he did not recognize it until dors elbowed him and laughed .     it   s you .      he clamped his gaping mouth shut  unsure how to handle the social nuances .  a second cloud of coiling blue streamers formed a clear picture of lamurk  eyebrows knotted in fury .  the foggy figures hovered in confrontation  hari smiling  lamurk scowling .   and lamurk looked the fool  with bulging eyes and pouting lips .      time for a graceful exit     hari   s lieutenant whispered .  hari was only too glad to agree .   when they got home  he was sure that there had been a bit extra in the stim he was handed  something that freed his tongue .  certainly it was not the slow spoken  reflective seldon who had traded jabs with lamurk .  he would have to watch that .   dors simply shook her head .     it was you .  just a portion of you that doesn   t get out to play very much .          .        parties are supposed to cheer people up     yugo said  sliding a cup of kaff across hari   s smooth mahogany desktop .      not this one     hari said .      all that luxury  powerful people  beautiful women  witty hangers on  i think i could have stayed awake .         that   s what depresses me  thinking back over it .  all that power .  and nobody there seems to care about our decline .         isn   t there some old saying about          fiddling while roma burns .  dors knew it  of course .  she says it   s from pre empire  about a zone with pretensions of grandeur .      all worms lead to roma    is another one .         never heard of this roma .         me either  but pomposity springs forth eternal .  it looks comic in retrospect .      yugo moved restlessly around hari   s office .     so they don   t care .         to them it   s just backdrop for their power games .     already the empire had worlds  zones  and even whole arcs of spiral arms descended into squalor .  still worse  in a way  was a steady slide into garish amusements  even vulgarity .  the media swarmed with the stuff .  the new    renaissance    styles from worlds like sark were popular .   to hari the best of the empire was its strands of restraint  of subtlety and discretion in manners  finesse and charm  intelligence  talent  and even glamour .  helicon had been crude and rural  but it knew the difference between silk and swine .      what do the policy types say .     yugo sat halfway on hari   s desk  avoiding the control functions implanted beneath a woody veneer .  he had come in with the kaff as a pretext  fishing for gossip about the exalted .  hari smiled to himself  people relished some aspects of hierarchy  however much they griped about it .      they   re hoping some of the    moral rebirth    movements  like revised ruellianism  say  will take hold .  put spine into the zones  one of them said .         ummm .  think it   ll work .         not for long .      ideology was an uncertain cement .  even religious fervor could not glue an empire together for long .  either force could drive formation of an empire  but they could not hold against greater  steady tides  principally  economics .      how about the war in the orion zone .         nobody mentioned it .         think we   ve got war figured right in the equations .     yugo had a knack for suddenly putting his finger on what was bothering hari .      no .  war was an overesteemed element in history .      certainly war often gained center stage  no one continued to read a beautiful poem when a fist fight broke out nearby .  but fist fights did not last  either .  further  they joggled the elbows of those trying to make a living .  to engineers and traders alike  war did not pay .  so why did wars break out now  with all the economic weight of the empire against them .      wars are simple .  but we   re missing something basic  i can feel it .         we   ve based the matrices on all that historical data dors dug out     yugo said a bit defensively .     that   s solid .         i don   t doubt it .  still .  .  .         look  we   ve got over twelve thousand years of hard facts .  i built the model on that .         i have a feeling what we   re missing isn   t subtle .      most collapses were not from abstruse causes .  in the early days of empire consolidation  local minor sovereignties flourished  then died .  there were recurrent themes in their histories .   again and again  star spanning realms collapsed under the weight of excessive taxation .  sometimes the taxes supported mercenary armies which defended against neighbors  or which simply kept domestic order against centrifugal forces .  whatever the ostensible cause of taxes  soon enough the great cities became depopulated  as people fled the tax collectors  seeking    rural peace .      but why did they do that spontaneously .      people .     hari sat up suddenly .     that   s what we   re missing .          huh .  you proved yourself  remember .  the reductionist theorem .   that individuals don   t matter .         they don   t .  but people do .  our coupled equations describe them in the mass  but we don   t know the critical drivers .         that   s all hidden  down in the data .         maybe not .  what if we were big spiders  instead of primates .  would psychohistory look the same .      yugo frowned .     well .  .  . if the data were the same .  .  .         data on trade  wars  population statistics .  it wouldn   t matter whether we were counting spiders instead of people .      yugo shook his head  his face clouding  unwilling to concede a point that might topple years of work .     it   s gotta be there .         your coming in here to get details of what the rich and famous do at their revels  where   s that in the equations .      yugo   s mouth twisted  irked now .     that stuff  it doesn   t matter .         who says .         well  history          is written by the winners  true enough .  but how do the great generals get men and women to march through freezing mud .  when won   t they march .         nobody knows .         we need to know .  or rather  the equations do .         how .         i don   t know .         go to the historians .      hari laughed .  he shared dors    contempt for most of her profession .  the current fashion in the study of the past was a matter of taste  not data .   he had once thought that history was simply a matter of grubbing in musty cyberfiles .  then  if dors would show him how to track down data  whether encoded in ancient ferrite cylinders or polymer blocks or strandware  then he would have a firm basis for mathematics .  didn   t dors and other historians simply add one more brick of knowledge to an ever growing monument .   the current style  though  was to marshal the past into a preferred flavor .  factions fought over the antiquity  over    their    history vs .     ours .     fringes flourished .  the    spiral centric    held that historical forces spread along spiral arms  whereas the    hub focused    maintained that the galactic center was the true mediating agency for causes  trends  movements  evolution .  technocrats contended with naturals  who felt that innate human qualities drove change .   among myriad facts and footnotes  specialists saw present politics mirrored in the past .  as the present fractured and transfigured  there seemed no point of reference outside history itself  an unreliable platform indeed  especially when one realized how many mysterious gaps there were in the records .  all this seemed to hari to be more fashion than foundation .  there was no uncontested past .   what contained the centrifugal forces of relativism  let me have my viewpoint and you can have yours  was an arena of broad agreement .  most people generally held that the empire was good  overall .  that the long periods of stasis had been the best times  for change always cost someone .  that above the competing throng  through the factions shouting what were essentially family stories at each other  there was worth in comprehending where humanity had passed  what it had done .   but there agreement stopped .  few seemed concerned with where humanity  or even the empire  was going .  he had come to suspect that the subject was ignored  in favor of your history against mine  because most historians unconsciously dreaded the future .  they sensed the decline in their souls and knew that over the horizon lay not yet another shift then stasis but a collapse .      so what do we do .     hari realized that yugo had said this twice now .  he had drifted off into reverie .      i   don   t know .         add another term for basic instincts .      hari shook his head .     people don   t run on instinct .  but they do behave like people  like primates  i suppose .         so .  .  . we should look into that .      hari threw up his hands .     i confess .  i feel that this line of logic is leading somewhere  but i can   t see the end of it .      yugo nodded  grinned .     it   ll come out when it   s ripe .         thanks .  i   m not the best of collaborators  i know .  too moody .         hey  never mind .  gotta think out loud sometimes  is all .         sometimes i   m not sure i   m thinking at all .         lemme show you the latest  huh .     yugo liked to parade his inventions  and hari sat back as yugo accessed the office holo and patterns appeared in midair .  equations hung in space     stacked and each term color coded .   so many .  they reminded hari of birds  flocking in great banks .   psychohistory was basically a vast set of interlocked equations  following the variables of history .  it was impossible to change one and not vary any other .  alter population and trade changed  along with modes of entertainment  sexual mores  and a hundred other factors .   some were undoubtedly unimportant  but which .  history was a bottomless quarry of factoids  meaningless without some way of winnowing the hail of particulars .  that was the essential first task of any theory of history  to find the deep variables .      post diction rates  presto .     yugo said  his hand computer suspending in air    graphs  elegantly arrayed .     economic indices  variable families  the works .         what eras .     hari asked .      third millennia to seventh  g . e .      the multidimensional surfaces representing economic variables were like twisted bottles filled with  as yugo time stepped them  sloshing fluids .  the liquids of yellow and amber and virulent red flowed around and through each other in a supple  slow dance .  hari was perpetually amazed at how beauty arose in the most unlikely ways from mathematics .  yugo had plotted abstruse econometric quantities  yet in the gravid sway of centuries they made delicate arabesques .      surprisingly good agreement     hari allowed .  the yellow surfaces of historical data merged cleanly with the other color skins  fluids finding curved levels .     and covering four millennia .  no infinities .         that new renormalization scheme blotted them out .         excellent .  the middle galactic era data is the most solid  too  correct .         yeah .  the politicians got into the act after the seventh millennium .  dors is helpin    me filter out the garbage .      hari admired the graceful blending of colors  ancient wine in transfinite bottles .   the psychohistorical rates linked together strongly .  history was not at all like a sturdy steel edifice rigidly spanning time  it rather more resembled a rope bridge  groaning and flexing with every footfall .  this    strong coupling dynamic    led to resonances in the equations  wild fluctuations  even infinities .  yet nothing really went infinite in reality  so the equations had to be fixed .  hari and yugo had spent many years eliminating ugly infinites .  maybe their goal was in sight .      how do the results look if you simply run the equations forward  past the seventh millennium .     hari asked .      oscillations build up     yugo admitted .   feedback loops were scarcely new .  hari knew the general theorem  ancient beyond measure  if all variables in a system are tightly coupled  and you can change one of them precisely and broadly  then you can indirectly control all of them .  the system could be guided to an exact outcome through its myriad internal feedback loops .  spontaneously  the system ordered itself  and obeyed .   history  of course  obeyed no one .  but for eras such as the fourth to seventh millennium  somehow the equations got matters right .  psychohistory could    post dict    history .   in truly complex systems  how adjustments occur lay beyond the human complexity horizon  beyond knowing  and most important  not worth knowing .   but if the system went awry  somebody had to get down in the guts of it and find the trouble .     any ideas .  clues .      yugo shrugged .     look at this .      the fluids lapped at the walls of the bottles .  more warped volumes appeared  filled with brightly colored data liquids .  hari watched as tides swept through the burnt orange variable space  driving answering waves in the purple layers nearby .  soon the entire holo showed furiously churning turbulence .      so the equations fail     hari said .      yeah  big time  too .  the grand cycles last about a hundred and twenty five years .  but smoothing out events shorter than eighty years gives a steady pattern .  see       hari watched turbulence build like a hurricane churning a multicolored ocean .   yugo said     that takes away scatter due to    generational styles     dors calls it .  i can take the zones that consciously increased human lifespan .  i time step the equations forward  great  but then i run out of data .  how come .  i mine the history some  and it turns out those societies didn   t last long .      hari shook his head .     you   re sure .  i   d imagine increasing the average age would bring a little wisdom into the picture .         not so .  i looked deeper and found that when the lifespan reached the social cycle time  usually about a hundred and ten standard years  instability rose .  whole planets had wars  depressions  general social illnesses .      hari frowned .     that effect  is it known .         don   t think so .         this is why humans reached a barrier in improving their longevity .  society breaks down  ending the progress .         yeah .      yugo wore a small  tight smile  by which hari knew that he was rather proud of this result .     growing irregularities  building to  chaos .      this was the deep problem they had not mastered .     damn .     hari had a gut dislike of unpredictability .   yugo gave hari a crooked smile .     on that one  boss  i got no news .         don   t worry     hari said cheerfully  though he didn   t feel it .     you   ve made good progress .  remember the adage  the imperium wasn   t built in a day .         yeah  but it seems to be fallin    apart plenty fast .      they seldom mentioned the deep seated motivation for psychohistory  the pervasive anxiety that the empire was declining  for reasons no one knew .  there were theories aplenty  but none had predictive power .  hari hoped to supply that .  progress was infuriatingly slow .   yugo was looking morose .  hari got up  came around the big desk  and gave yugo a gentle slap on the back .     cheer up .  publish this result .         can i .  we   ve got to keep psychohistory quiet .         just group the data  then publish in a journal devoted to analytical history .  talk to dors about selecting the journal .      yugo brightened .     i   ll write it up  show you          no  leave me out of it .  it   s your work .         hey  you showed me how to set up the analysis  where          it   s yours .  publish .         well .  .  .      hari did not mention the fact that  now  anything published under his name would attract attention .  a few might guess at the immensely larger theory lurking behind the simple lifespan resonance effect .  best to keep a low profile .   when yugo had gone back to work  hari sat for a while and watched the squalls work through the data fluids  still time stepping in the air above his desk .  then he glanced at a favorite quotation of his  pointed out to him by dors  given to him on a small  elegant ceramo plaque     minimum force  applied at a cusp moment at the historical fulcrum  paves the path to a distant vision .  pursue only those immediate goals which serve the longest perspectives .       emperor kamble   s  th oracle  verse          but suppose you can   t afford long perspectives .     he muttered  then went back to work .       .     the next day he got an education in the realities of imperial politics .      you didn   t know the  d scope was on you .     yugo asked .   hari watched the conversation with lamurk replay on his office holo .  he had fled to the university when the imperial specials started having trouble holding the media mob away from his apartment .  they had called in reinforcements when they caught a team drilling an acoustic tap into the apartment from three layers above .  hari and dors had gotten out with an escort through a maintenance grav drop .      no  i didn   t .  there was a lot going on .     he remembered his bodyguards accosting someone  checking and letting it pass .  the  d camera and acoustic tracker were so small that a media deputy could walk around with them under formal wear .  assassins used the same artful concealment .  bodyguards knew how to distinguish between the two .   yugo said with dahlite savvy     gotta watch    em  you gonna play in those leagues .         i appreciate the concern     hari said dryly .   dors tapped a finger to her lips .     i think you came over rather well .         i didn   t want to seem as though i were deliberately cutting up a majority leader from the high council     hari said heatedly .      but that   s what you were doin        yugo said .      i suppose  but at the time it seemed like polite .  .  .  banter     he finished lamely .  edited for  d  it was a quick verbal ping pong with razor blades instead of balls .      but you topped him at every exchange     dors observed .      i don   t even dislike him .  he has done good things for the empire .     he paused  thinking .     but it was .  .  .  fun .         maybe you do have a talent for this     she said .      i   d rather not .         i don   t think you have much choice     yugo said .     you   re gettin    famous .         fame is the accumulation of misunderstandings around a well known name     dors said .   hari smiled .     well put .         it   s from eldonian the elder  the longest lived emperor .  the only one of his clan to die of old age .         makes the point     yugo said .     you gotta expect some stories  gossip  mistakes .      hari shook his head angrily .     no .  look  we can   t let this extraneous matter distract us .  yugo  what about those bootleg personality constellations you    acquired    .         i   ve got    em .         machine translated .  they will run .         yeah  but they take an awful lot of memory and running volume .  i   ve tuned them some  but they need a bigger parallel processing network than i can give them .      dors frowned .     i don   t like this .  these aren   t just constellations  they   re sims .      hari nodded .     we   re doing research here  not trying to manufacture a superrace .      dors stood and paced energetically .     the most ancient of taboos is against sims .  even personality constellations obey rigid laws .          of course  ancient history .  but          prehistory .     her nostrils flared .     the prohibitions go back so far  there are no records of how they started  undoubtedly  from some disastrous experiments well before the shadow age .         what   s that .     yugo asked .      the long time  we have no clear idea of how long it lasted  though certainly several millennia  before the empire became coherent .         back on earth  you mean .     yugo looked skeptical .      earth is more legend than fact .  but yes  the taboo could go back that far .         these are hopelessly constricted sims     yugo said .     they don   t know anything about our time .  one is a religious fanatic for some faith i never heard of .  the other   s a smartass writer .  no danger to anybody  except maybe themselves .      dors regarded yugo suspiciously .     if they   re so narrow  why are they useful .         because they can calibrate psychohistorical indices .  we have modeling equations that depend on basic human perceptions .  if we have a pre ancient mind  even simmed  we can calibrate the missing constants in the rate equations .      dors snorted doubtfully .     i don   t follow the mathematics  but i know sims are dangerous .         look  nobody savvy believes that stuff any more     yugo said .     mathists have been running pseudo sims for ages .  tiktoks          those are incomplete personalities  correct .     dors asked severely .      well  yeah  but          we could get into very big trouble if these sims are better  more versatile .      yugo waved away her point with his large hands  smiling lazily .     don   t worry .  i got them all under control .  anyway  i   ve already got a way to solve our problem of getting enough running volume  machine time  and i   ve got a cover for us .      hari arched his eyebrows .     what   s this .         i   ve got a customer for the sims .  somebody who   ll run them  cover all expenses  and pay for the privilege .  wants to use them for commercial purposes .         who .     hari and dors asked together .      artifice associates     yugo said triumphantly .   hari looked blank .  dors paused as though searching for a distant memory  and then said     a firm engaged in computer systems architecture .         right  one of the best .  they   ve got a market for old sims as entertainment .      hari said     never heard of them .      yugo shook his head in amazement .     you don   t keep up  hari .         i don   t try to keep up .  i try to stay ahead .      dors said     i don   t like using any outside agency .  and what   s this about paying .      yugo beamed .     they   re paying for license rights .  i negotiated it all .         do we have any control over how they use the sims .     dors leaned forward alertly .      we don   t need any     yugo said defensively .     they   ll probably use them in advertisements or something .  how much use can you get out of a sim nobody will probably understand .         i don   t like it .  aside from the commercial aspects  it   s risky to even revive an ancient sim .  public outrage          hey  that   s the past .  people don   t feel that way about tiktoks  and they   re getting pretty smart .      tiktoks were machines of low mental capacity  held rigorously beneath an intelligence ceiling by the encoding laws of antiquity .  hari had always suspected that the true  ancient robots had made those laws  so that the realm of machine intelligence did not spawn ever more specialized and unpredictable types .   the true robots  such as r .  daneel olivaw  remained aloof  cool  and long visioned .  but in the gathering anxieties across the entire empire  traditional cybernetic protocols were breaking down .  like everything else .   dors stood .     i   m opposed .  we must stop this at once .      yugo rose too  startled .     you helped me find the sims .  now you          i did not intend this .     her face tightened .  hari wondered at her intensity .  something else was at stake here  but what .  he said mildly     i see no reason to not make a bit of profit from side avenues of our research .  and we do need increased computing capacity .      dors    mouth worked with irritation  but she said nothing more .  hari wondered why she was so opposed .     usually you don   t give a damn about social conventions .      she said acidly     usually you are not a candidate for first minister .         i will not let such considerations deflect our research     he said firmly .     understand .      she nodded and said nothing .  he instantly felt like an overbearing tyrant .  there was always a potential conflict between being coworkers and lovers .  usually they waltzed around the problems .  why was she so adamant .   they got through some more work on psychohistory  and dors mentioned his next appointment .     she   s from my history department .  i asked her to look into patterns in trantorian trends over the last ten millennia .         oh  good  thanks .  could you show her in  please .      sylvin thoranax was a striking woman  bearing a box of old data pyramids .     i found these in a library halfway around the planet     she explained .   hari picked one up .     i   ve never seen one of these .  dusty .         for some there   s no library index .  i down  coded a few  and they   re good  still readable with a translation matrix .         ummm .     hari liked the musty feel of old technology from simpler times .     we can read these directly .      she nodded .     i know how the reduced seldon equations function .  you should be able to do a mat comparison and find the coefficients you need .      hari grimaced .     they   re not my equations  they come out of a body of research by many          come come  academician  everyone knows you wrote down the procedures  the approach .      hari groused a little more  because it did irk him  but the thoranax woman went on about using the pyramids and yugo joined in enthusiastically and he let the point pass .  she went off with yugo to work and he settled into his usual academic grind .   his daily schedule hovered on the holo        get symposia speakers  sweeten the invitation for the reluctant     write nominations for imperial fellows     read student thesis  after it has been checked   passed by logic chopper program    these burned up the bulk of his day .  only when the chancellor entered his office did he remember that he had promised to give a speech .  the chancellor had a quick  ironic smile and pursed lips  a reserved gaze  the scholar   s look .     your .  .  . dress .     he asked pointedly .   hari fumbled in his office closet  fetched forth the balloon sleeved and ample girted robe  and changed in the side room .  his secretary handed him his all purpose view cube as they quickly left the office .  with the chancellor he crossed the main square  his specials in an inconspicuous formation fore and aft .  a crowd of well dressed men and women trained  d cameras at them  one panning up and down to get the full effect of the streeling blue and yellow swirl stripes .      have you heard from lamurk .         what about the dahlites .         do you like the new sector principal .  does it matter that she   s a trisexualist .         how about the new health reports .  should the emperor set exercise requirements for trantor .         ignore them     hari said .   the chancellor smiled and waved at the cameras .     they   re just doing their job .         what   s this about exercise .     hari asked .      a study found that electro stim while sleeping doesn   t develop muscles as well as old fashioned exercise .         not surprising .     he had worked in the fields as a boy and never liked the idea of having his exertion stimmed while he slept .   a wedge of reporters pressed nearer  shouting questions .      what does the emperor think of what you said to lamurk .         is it true that your wife doesn   t want you to be first minister .         what about demerzel .  where is he .         what about the zonal disputes .  can the empire compromise .      a woman rushed forward .     how do you exercise .      hari said sardonically     i exercise restraint     but his point sailed right past the woman  who looked at him blankly .   as they entered the great hall  hari remembered to fetch forth the view cube and hand it to the hallmaster .  a few  ds always made a talk pass more easily .     big crowd     he noted to the chancellor as they took their places on the speech balcony above the bowl of seats .      attendance is compulsory .  all class members are here .     the chancellor beamed down at the multitude .     i wanted to be sure we looked good to the reporters outside .      hari   s mouth twisted .     how do they take attendance .         everyone has a keyed seat .  once they sit  they   re counted  if their inboard id matches the seat index .         a lot of trouble just to get people to attend .         they must .  it   s for their own good .  and ours .         they   re adults  or else why let them study advanced subjects .  let them decide what   s good for them .      the chancellor   s lips compressed as he rose to do the introduction .  when hari got up to talk  he said     now that you   re officially counted  i thank you for inviting me  and announce that this is the end of my formal address .      a rustle of surprise .  hari   s gaze swept the hall and he let the silence build .  then he said mildly     i dislike speaking to anyone who has no choice over whether to listen .  now i shall sit down  and anyone wishing to leave may do so .      he sat .  the auditorium buzzed .  a few got up to leave .  the other students booed them .  when he rose to speak again they cheered .   he had never had an audience so on his side .  he made the most of it  giving a ringing talk about the future of .  .  . mathematics .  not of the mortal empire  but of beautiful  enduring mathematics .       .     the woman from the ministry of interlocking cultures looked down her nose at him and said     of course  we must have contributions from your group .      hari shook his head disbelievingly .     a .  .  . senso .      she adjusted her formal suit by wriggling in his office   s guest chair .     this is an advanced program .  all mathists are charged to submit boon behests .         we are completely unqualified to compose          i understand your hesitation .  yet we at the ministry feel these senso symphonies will be just the thing needed to energize a  well  an art form which is showing little progress .         i don   t get it .      she begrudgingly gave him a completely unconvincing  stilted smile .     the way we envision this new sort of senso symphony  the artists  the mathists  that is  will transmogrify basic structures of thought  such as euclidean conceptual edifices  or transfinite set theory fabrications .  these will be translated by an art strainer          which is .             a computer filter which distributes conceptual patterns into a broad selection of sensory avenues .      hari sighed .     i see .     this woman had power and he had to listen to her .  his psychohistory funding was secure  coming from the emperor   s private largess .  but the streeling department could not ignore the imperial boon board or its lackeys  such as the one before him .  such was boonmanship .   far from being relaxed  meditative groves of quiet inquiry  research universities were intense  competitive  high pressure marathons .  the meritocrats  scholars and scientists alike  put in long hours  had stress related health problems  high divorce rates  and few offspring .  they cut up their results into bite sized chunks  in pursuit of the least publishable unit  so to magnify their lists of papers .   to gain a boon from the imperial offices one did the basic labor  filling out forms .  hari knew well the bewildering maze of cross linked questions .  list and analyze type and    texture    of funding .  estimate fringe benefits .  describe kind of lab and computer equipment needed  can existing resources be modified to suit .   .  elucidate philosophical stance of the proposed work .   the pyramid of power meant that the most experienced scholars did little scholarship .  instead  they managed and played the endless games of boonsmanship .  the greys grimly saw to it that no box went unchecked .  about ten percent of boon petitions received funds  and then after two years    delay  and for about half the requested money .   worse  since the lead time was so great  there was a premium on hitting the nail squarely on the head with every boon .  to be sure a study would work  most of it was done before writing the boon petition .  this insured that there were no    holes    in the petition  no unexpected swerves in the work .   this meant scholarship and research had become mostly surprise free  as well .  no one seemed to notice that this robbed them of their central joy  the excitement of the unexpected .      i will .  .  . speak to my department .     order them to do it  would have been more honest .  but one did try to preserve the amenities .   when she had left  dors came into his office immediately  with yugo right behind .     i will not work with these .     she said  eyes flaring .   hari studied two large blocks of what seemed to be stone .  yet they could not be that heavy  for yugo cradled one in each open palm .     the sims .     he guessed .      in ferrite cores     yugo said proudly .     stuck down in a rat   s warren  on a planet named sark .         the world with that    new renaissance    movement .         yeah  kinda crazy  dealin    with them .  i got the sims  though .  they just came in  worm express .  the woman in charge there  a buta fyrnix  wants to talk to you .         i said i didn   t want to be involved .         part of the deal is she gets a face to face .      hari blinked  alarmed .     she   d come all the way here .         no  but they   re payin    for a tightbeam .  she   s standin    by .  i   ve routed her through .  just punch for the link .      hari had the distinct feeling that he was being hustled into something risky  far beyond the limits of his ordinary caution .  tightbeam time was expensive  because the imperial wormhole system had been impacted with flow for millennia .  using it for a face to face was simply decadent  he felt .  if this fyrnix woman was paying for galactic scale standby time  just to chat with a mathist .  .  .   spare me from the enthused  hari thought .     well  all right .      buta fyrnix was a tall  hot eyed woman who smiled brightly as her image blossomed in the office .     professor seldon .  i was so happy that your staff has taken an interest in our new renaissance .         well  actually  i gather it   s about those simulations .     for once  he was grateful for the two second delay in transmission .  the biggest wormhole mouth was a light second from trantor  and apparently sark had about the same .      of course .  we found truly ancient archives .  our progressive movement here is knocking over the old barriers  you   ll find .         i hope the research will prove interesting     hari said neutrally .  how did yugo get him into this .      we   re turning up things that will open your eyes  dr .  seldon .     she turned and gestured at the scene behind her  a large warren crammed with ancient ceramo storage racks .     we   re hoping to blow the lid off the whole question of pre empire origins  the earth legend  the works .         i  ah  i will be very happy to see what results .         you   ve got to come and see it for yourself .  a mathist like you will be impressed .  our renaissance is just the sort of forward looking enterprise that young  vigorous planets need .  do say you   ll pay us a visit  a state visit  we hope .      apparently the woman wanted to invest in a future first minister .  it took him more unbearable minutes to get away from her .  he glowered at yugo when at last her image wilted in the air .      hey  i got us a good deal  providing she got to do a li   l sell job on you     yugo said  spreading his hands .      at considerable under the table cost  i hope .     hari asked  getting up .  carefully he put a hand on one cube and found it surprisingly cool .  within its shadowy interior he could see labyrinths of lattices and winding ribbons of refracted light  like tiny highways through a somber city .      sure     yugo said with casual assurance .     got some dahlites to  ah  massage the matter .      hari chuckled .     i don   t think i should hear about it .         as first minister  you must not     dors said .      i am not first minister .         you could be  and soon .  this simulation matter is too risky .  and you even spoke to the sark source .  i will not work on or with them .      yugo said mildly     nobody   s askin    you to .      hari rubbed the cool  slick surface of a ferrite block  hefted it  quite light  and took the two from yugo .  he put them on his desk .     how old .      yugo said     sark says they dunno  but must be at least       dors moved suddenly .  she yanked up the blocks  one in each hand  turned to the nearest wall  and smashed them together .  the crash was deafening .  chunks of ferrite smacked against the wall .  grains of debris spattered hari   s face .   dors had absorbed the explosion .  the stored energy in the blocks had erupted as the lattice cracked .   in the sudden silence afterward dors stood adamantly rigid  hands covered with grainy dust .  her hands were bleeding and she had a cut on her left cheek .  she gazed straight at him .     i am charged with your safety .      yugo drawled     sure a funny way to show it .         i had to protect you from a potentially          by destroying an ancient artifact .     hari demanded .      i smothered nearly all the eruption  minimizing your risk .  but yes  i deem this sark involvement as             i know  i know .     hari raised his hands  palms toward her  recalling .   the night before he had come home from his rather well received speech to find dors moody and withdrawn .  their bed had been a rather chilly battleground  too  though she would not come out and say what had irked her so .  winning through withdrawal  hari had once termed it .  but he had no idea she felt this deeply .   marriage is a voyage of discovery that never ends  he thought ruefully .      i make decisions about risk     he said to her  eyeing the rubble in his office .     you will obey them unless there is an obvious physical danger .  understand .         i must use my judgment          no .  involvement with these sarkian simulations may teach us about shadowy  ancient times .  that could affect psychohistory .     he wondered if she were carrying out an order from olivaw .  why would the robots care so strongly .      when you are plainly imperiling          you must leave planning  and psychohistory .   to me .      she batted her eyelashes rapidly  pursed her lips  opened her mouth .  .  . and said nothing .  finally  she nodded .  hari let out a sigh .   then his secretary rushed in  followed by the specials  and the scene dissolved into a chaos of explanations .  he looked the specials captain straight in the face and said that the ferrite cores had somehow fallen into each other and apparently struck some weak fracture point .   they were  he explained  making it up as he went along  with a voice of professorial authority he had mastered long ago  fragile structures which used tension to stabilize themselves  holding in vast stores of microscopic information .   to his relief the captain just screwed up his face  looked around at the mess  and said     i should never have let old tech like this in here .         not your fault     hari reassured him .     it   s all mine .      there would have been more pretending to do  but a moment later his holo rang with a reception .  he glimpsed cleon   s personal officer  but before the woman could speak the scene dissolved .  he slapped his filter face command as cleon   s image coalesced in the air out of a cottony fog .      i have some bad news     the emperor said without any greeting .      ah  sorry to hear that     hari said lamely .   below cleon   s vision he called up a suite of body language postures and hoped they would cover the ferrite dust clinging to his tunic .  the red frame that stitched around the holo told him that a suitably dignified face would go out  keyed with his lip movements .      the high council is stuck on this representation issue .     cleon chewed at his lip in irritation .     until they resolve that  the first ministership will be set aside .         i see .  the representation problem .  .  .  .      cleon blinked with surprise .     you haven   t been following it .         there is much to do at streeling .      cleon waved airily .     of course  getting ready for the move .  well  nothing will happen immediately  so you can relax .  the dahlites have logjammed the galactic low council .  they want a bigger voice  in trantor and in the whole damned spiral .  that lamurk has sided against them in the high council .  nobody   s budging .         i see .         so we   ll have to wait before the high council can act .  procedural matters of representation take precedent over even ministerships .         of course .         damn codes .     cleon erupted .     i should be able to have who i want .         i quite agree .     but not me  hari thought .      well  thought you   d like to hear it from me .         i do appreciate that  sire .         i   ve got some things to discuss  that psychohistory especially .  i   m busy  but  soon .         very good  sire .      cleon winked away without saying good bye .   hari breathed a sigh of relief .     i   m free .     he shouted happily  throwing his hands up .   the specials stared at him oddly .  hari noticed again his desk and files and walls  all spattered with black grit .  his office still looked like paradise to him  compared with the luxuriant snare of the palace .       .        the trip  it   ll be worth it just to get out of streeling     yugo said .   they entered the grav station with the inevitable specials trying to casually stroll alongside .  to hari   s eye they were as inconspicuous as spiders on a dinner plate .      true enough     hari said .  at streeling  high council members could solicit him  pressure groups could penetrate the makeshift privacy of the math department  and of course the emperor could blossom in the air at any time .  on the move  he was safe .      good connection comin    up in two point six minutes .     yugo consulted his retinal writer by looking to the far left .  hari had never liked the devices  but they were a convenient way of reading  in this case  the grav schedule  while keeping both hands free .  yugo was toting two bags .  hari had offered to help  but yugo said they were    family jewels    and needed care .   without breaking stride they passed through an optical reader which consulted seating  billed their accounts  and notified the autoprogram of the increased mass load .  hari was a bit distracted by some free floating math ideas  and so their drop startled him .      oops     he said  clutching at his armrests .  falling was the one signal that could interrupt even the deepest of meditations .  he wondered how far back that alarm had evolved  and then paid attention to yugo again  who was enthusiastically describing the dahlite community where they would have lunch .      you still wonderin    about that political stuff .         the representation question .  i don   t care about the infighting  factions  and so on .  mathematically  though  it   s a puzzle .         seems to me it   s pretty clear     yugo said with a slight  though respectful  edge in his voice .     dahlites been gettin    the short end for too long .         because they have only one sector   s votes .         right  and there are four hundred million of us in dahl alone .         and more elsewhere .         damn right .  averaged over trantor  a dahlite has only point six eight as much representation as the others .         and throughout the galaxy          same damn thing .  we got our zone  sure  but except in the galactic low council  we   re boxed in .      yugo had changed from the chattering friend out on a lark to sober faced and scowling .  hari didn   t want the trip to turn into an argument .     statistics require care  yugo .  remember the classic joke about three statisticians who took up hunting ducks          which are .         a game bird  known on some worlds .  the first shot a meter high  the second a meter low  when this happened  the third statistician cried     we got it .         yugo laughed a bit dutifully .  hari was trying to follow dors    advice about handling people  using his humor more and logic less .  the incident with lamurk had rebounded in hari   s favor among the media and even the high council  the emperor had said .   dors herself  though  seemed singularly immune to both laughs and logic  the incident with the ferrite cores had put a strain in their relationship .  hari realized now that this  too  was why he had greeted yugo   s suggestion of a day away from streeling .  dors had two classes to teach and couldn   t go .  she had grumbled  but conceded that the specials could probably cover him well enough .  as long as he did nothing    foolish .      yugo persisted .     okay  but the courts are stacked against us  too .         dahl is the largest sector now .  you will get your judgeships in time .         time we don   t have .  we   re getting shut out by blocs .      hari deeply disliked the usual circular logic of political griping  so he tried to appeal to yugo   s mathist side .     all judging bodies are vulnerable to bloc control  my friend .  suppose a court had eleven judges .  then a cohesive group of six could decide every ruling .  they could meet secretly and agree to be bound by what a majority of them thinks  then vote as a bloc in the full eleven .      yugo   s mouth twisted with irritation .     the high tribunal   s eleven  that   s your point  right .         it   s a general principle .  even smaller schemes could work  too .  suppose four of the high tribunal met secretly and agreed to be bound by their own ballot .  then they   d vote as a bloc among the original cabal of six .  then four would determine the outcome of all eleven .         damn all  it   s worse than i thought     yugo said .      my point is that any finite representation can be corrupted .  it   s a general theorem about the method .      yugo nodded and then to hari   s dismay launched into reciting the woes and humiliations visited upon dahlites at the hands of the ruling majorities in the tribunal  the councils both high and low  the diktat directory .  .  .   the endless busyness of ruling .  what a bore .   hari realized that his style of thought was a far cry from the fevered calculations of yugo  and further still from the wily likes of lamurk .  how could he hope to survive as a first minister .  why couldn   t the emperor see that .   he nodded  put on his mask of thoughtful listening  and let the wall displays soothe him .  they were still plunging down the long cycloidal curve of the grav drop .   this time the name was apt .  most long distance travel on trantor was in fact under trantor  along a curve which let their car plunge down under gravity alone  suspended on magnetic fields a bare finger   s width from the tube walls .  falling through dark vacuum  there were no windows .  instead  the walls quieted any fears of falling .   mature technology was discreet  simple  easy  quiet  sinuously classical  even friendly  while its use remained as obvious as a hammer  its effects as easy as a  d .  both it and its user had educated each other .   a forest slid by all around him and yugo .  many on trantor lived among trees and rocks and clouds  as humans once had .  the effects were not real  but they didn   t need to be .  we are the wild  now  hari thought .  humans shaped trantor   s labyrinths to quiet their deep set needs  so the mind   s eye felt itself flitting through a park .  technology appeared only when called forth  like magical spirits .      say  mind if i kill this .     yugo   s question broke through his reverie .      the trees .         yeah  the open  y   know .      hari nodded and yugo thumbed in a view of a mall with no great distances visible .  many trantorians became anxious in big spaces  or even near images of them .   they had leveled out and soon began to rise .  hari felt pressed back into his chair  which compensated deftly .  they were moving at high velocity  he knew  but there was no sign of it .  slight pulses of the magnetic throat added increments of velocity as they rose  making up for the slight losses .  otherwise  the entire trip took no energy  gravity giving and then taking away .   when they emerged in the carmondian sector his specials drew in close .  this was no elite university setting .  few buildings here could be seen as exteriors  so design focused on interior spectacle  thrusting slopes  airy transepts  soaring trunks of worked metal and muscular fiber .  but amid this serene architecture milling crowds jostled and fretted  lapping like an angry tide .   across an overhead bikepad a steady stream of cyclists hauled tow cars .  jamming their narrow bays were bulky appliances  glistening sides of meat  boxes  and lumpy goods  all bound for nearby customers .  restaurants were little more than hotplates surrounded with tiny tables and chairs  all squeezed into the walkways .  barbers conducted business in the thoroughfare  working one end of the customer while beggars massaged the feet for a coin .      seems .  .  . busy     hari said diplomatically as he caught the tang of dahlite cooking .      yeah  doncha love it .         beggars and street vendors were made illegal by the last emperor  i thought .         right .     he grinned .     don   t work with dahlites .  we   ve moved plenty people into this sector .  c   mon  i want some lunch .      it was early  but they ate in a stand up restaurant  drawn in by the odors .  hari tried a    bomber     which wriggled into his mouth  then exploded into a smoky dark taste he could not identify  finally fading into a bittersweet aftertaste .  his specials looked quite uneasy  standing around in a crowded  busy hubbub .  they were accustomed to more regal surroundings .      things   re really boomin    here     yugo observed .  his manners had reverted to his laboring days and he spoke with his mouth half full .      dahlites have a gift for expansion     hari said diplomatically .  their high birth rate pushed them into other sectors  where their connections to dahl brought new investment .  hari liked their restless energy  it reminded him of helicon   s few cities .   he had been modeling all of trantor  trying to use it as a shrunken version of the empire .  much of his progress had come from unlearning conventional wisdom .  most economists saw money as simple ownership  a basic  linear power relationship .  but it was a fluid  hari found  slippery and quick  always flowing from one hand to the next as it greased the momentum of change .  imperial analysts had mistaken a varying flux for a static counter .   they finished and yugo urged him into a groundpod .  they followed a complicated path  alive with noise and smells and vigor .  here orderly traffic disintegrated .  instead of making an entire layer one way  local streets intersected at angles acute and oblique  seldom rectangular .  yugo seemed to regard traffic intersections as rude interruptions .   they sped by buildings at close range  stopped  and got out for a walk to a slideway .  the specials were right behind and without any transition hari found himself in the middle of chaos .  smoke enveloped them and the acrid stench made him almost vomit .   the specials captain shouted to him     stay down .     then the man shouted to his men to arm with anamorphine .  they all bristled with weapons .   smoke paled the overhead phosphors .  through the muggy haze hari saw a solid wall of people hammering toward them .  they came out of side alleys and doorways and all seemed to bear down on him .  the specials fired a volley into the mass .  some went down .  the captain threw a canister and gas blossomed farther away .  he had judged it expertly  air circulation carried the fumes into the mob  not toward hari .   but anamorphine wasn   t going to stop them .  two women rushed by hari  carrying cobblestones ripped from the street .  a third jabbed at hari with a knife and the captain shot her with a dart .  then more dahlites rushed at the specials and hari caught what they were shouting  incoherent rage against tiktoks .   the idea seemed so unlikely to him at first he thought he could not have heard rightly .  that deflected his attention  and when he looked back toward the streaming crowd the captain was down and a man was advancing  holding a knife .   what any of this had to do with tiktoks was mysterious  but hari did not have time to do anything except step to the side and kick the man squarely in the knee .   a bottle bounced painfully off his shoulder and smashed on the walkway .  a man whirled a chain around and around and then toward hari   s head .  duck .  it whistled by and hari dove at the man  tackling him solidly .  they went down with two others in a swearing  punching mass .  hari took a slug in the gut .   he rolled over and gasped for air and clearly  only a few feet away  saw a man kill another with a long  curved knife .   jab  slash  jab .  it happened silently  like a dream .  hari gasped  shaken  his world in slow motion .  he should be responding boldly  he knew that .  but it was so overwhelming    and then he was standing  with no memory of getting there  wrestling with a man who had not bothered with bathing for quite some while .   then the man was gone  abruptly yanked away by the seethe of the crowd .   another sudden jump  and specials were all around him .  bodies sprawled lifeless on the walkway .  others held their bloody heads .  shouts  thumps  he did not have time to figure out what weapon had done that to them before the specials were whisking him and yugo along and the whole incident fled into obscurity  like a    program glimpsed and impatiently passed by .   the captain wanted to return to streeling .     even better  the palace .         this wasn   t about us     hari said as they took a slideway .      can   t be sure of that  sir .           .     hari batted away all suggestions that they discontinue their journey .  the incident had apparently begun when some tiktoks malfed .      somebody accused dahlites of causing it     yugo related .     so our people stood up for themselves and  well  things got out of hand .      everyone near them was alive with excitement  faces glowing  eyes white and darting .  he thought suddenly of his father   s wry saying  never underestimate the power of boredom .   in human affairs  spirited action relieved dry tedium .  he remembered seeing two women pummel a spook  slamming away at the spindly  bleached white man as though he were no more than a responsive exercise machine .  a simple phobia against sunlight meant that he was of the hated other  and thus fair game .   murder was a primal urge .  even the most civilized felt tempted by it in moments of rage .  but nearly all resisted and were better for the resistance .  civilization was a defense against nature   s raw power .   that was a crucial variable  one never considered by the economists with their gross products per capita  or the political theorists with their representative quotients  or the sociosavants and their security indices .      i   ll have to keep that in  too     he muttered to himself .      keep what .     yugo asked .  he  too  was still agitated .      things as basic as murder .  we get all tied up in trantor   s economics and politics  but something as gut deep as that incident may be more important  in the long run .         we   ll pick it up in the crime statistics .         no  it   s the urge i want to get .  how does that explain the deeper movements in human culture .  it   s bad enough dealing with trantor  a giant pressure cooker  forty billion sealed in together .  we know there   s something missing  because we can   t get the psychohistorical equations to converge .      yugo frowned .     i was thinkin    it was  well  that we needed more data .      hari felt the old  familiar frustration .     no  i can feel it .  there   s something crucial  and we don   t have it .      yugo looked doubtful and then their off disk came .  they changed through a concentric set of circulating slideways  reducing their velocity and ending in a broad square .  an impressive edifice dominated the high air shafts  slender columns blooming into offices above .  sunlight trickled down the sculpted faces of the building  telling tales of money  artifice associates .   reception whisked them into a sanctum more luxurious than anything at streeling .     great room     yugo said with a wry slant of his head .   hari understood this common academic reflection .  technical workers outside the university system earned more and worked in generally better surroundings .  none of that had ever bothered him .  the idea of universities as a high citadel had withered as the empire declined  and he saw no need for opulence  particularly under an emperor with a taste for it .   the staff of artifice associates referred to themselves as a  and seemed quite bright .  he let yugo carry the conversation as they sat around a big  polished pseudowood table  he still pulsed with the zest of the earlier violence .  hari sat back and meditated on his surroundings  his mind returning as always to new facets which might bear upon psychohistory .   the theory already had mathematical relationships between technology  capital accumulation  and labor  but the most important driver proved to be knowledge .  about half the economic growth came from the increase in the quality of information  as embodied in better machines and improved skills  building efficiency .   fair enough  and that was where the empire had faltered .  the innovative thrust of the sciences had slowly ground down .  the imperial universities produced fine engineers  but no inventors .  great scholars  but few true scientists .  that factored into the other tides of time .   only independent businesses such as this  he reflected  continued the momentum which had driven the entire empire for so long .  but they were wildflowers  often crushed beneath the boot of imperial politics and inertia .      dr .  seldon .     a voice asked at his elbow  startling hari out of his rumination .  he nodded .      we do have your permission as well .         ah  to do what .         to use these .     yugo stood and lifted onto the table his two carry cases .  he unzipped them and two ferrite cores stood revealed .      the sark sims  gentlemen .      hari gaped .     i thought dors          smashed    em .  she thought so  too .  i used two old  worthless data cores in your office that day .         you knew she would          i gotta respect that lady  quick and strong minded  she is .     yugo shrugged .     i figured she might get a little .  .  . provoked .      hari smiled .  suddenly he knew that he had been repressing real anger at dors for her high handed act .  now he released it in a fit of hearty laughter .     wonderful .  wife or not  there are limits .      he howled so hard tears sprang to his eyes .  the guffaws spread around the table and hari felt better than he had in weeks .  for a moment all the nagging university details  the ministership  everything  fell away .      then we do have your permission  dr .  seldon .  to use the sims .     a young man at his elbow asked again .      of course  though i will want to keep close tabs on some  ah  research interests of mine .  will that be possible mr .      .         marq hofti .  we   d be honored  sir  if you could spare the project some time .  i   ll do my best          and i .     a young woman stood at his other elbow .     sybyl     she said  and shook hands .  they both appeared quite competent  neat  and efficient .  hari puzzled at the looks bordering on reverence they gave him .  after all  he was just a mathist  like them .   then he laughed again  heartily  a curiously liberating bark .  he had just thought of what it would be like to tell dors about the data cores .      part      the rose meets  the scalpel       computational representation   .  .  . it is clear that  except for occasional outbursts  the taboos against advanced  artificial intelligences head throughout the empire through the great sweep of historical time .  this uniformity of cultural opinion probably reflects tragedies and traumas with artificial forms far back in pre empire ages .  there are records of early transgressions by self aware programs  including those by    sims     or self organizing simulations .  apparently the preancients enjoyed recreating personalities of their own past  perhaps for instruction or amusement or even research .  none of these are known to survive  but tales persist that they were once a high art .   of darker implication are the narratives which hypothesize self aware intelligences lodged in bodies resembling human .  while low order mechanical forms are customarily allowed throughout the empire  these    tiktoks    constitute no competition with humans  since they perform only simple and often disagreeable tasks .  .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      .     joan of arc wakened inside an amber dream .  cool breezes caressed her  odd noises reverberated .  she heard before she saw    and abruptly found herself sitting outdoors .  she noted things one at a time  as though some part of herself were counting them .   soft air .  before her  a smooth round table .   pressing against her  an unsettling white chair .  its seat  unlike those in her home village of domremy  was not hand hewn of wood .  its smooth slickness lewdly aped her contours .  she reddened .   strangers .  one  two  three .  .  . winking into being before her eyes .   they moved .  peculiar people .  she could not tell woman from man  except for those whose pantaloons and tunics outlined their intimate parts .  the spectacle was even more than she   d seen in chinon  at the lewd court of the great and true king .   talk .  the strangers seemed oblivious of her  though she could hear them chattering in the background as distinctly as she sometimes heard her voices .  she listened only long enough to conclude that what they said  having nothing to do with holiness or france  was clearly not worth hearing .   noise .  from outside .  an iron river of self moving carriages muttered by .  she felt surprise at this  then somehow the emotion evaporated .   a long view  telescoping in  pearly mists concealed distant ivory spires .  fog made them seem like melting churches .   what was this place .   a vision  perhaps related to her beloved voices .  could such apparitions be holy .   surely the man at a nearby table was no angel .  he was eating scrambled eggs  through a straw .   and the women  unchaste  flagrant  gaudy cornucopias of hip and thigh and breast .  some drank red wine from transparent goblets  different from any she   d seen at the royal court .   others seemed to sup from floating clouds  delicate  billowing mousse fogs .  one mist  reeking of beef with a tangy loire sauce  passed near her .  she breathed in  and felt in an instant that she had experienced a meal .   was this heaven .  where appetites were satisfied without labor and toil .   but no .  surely the final reward was not so  so .  .  .  carnal .  and perturbing .  and embarrassing .   the fire some sucked into their mouths from little reeds  those alarmed her .  a cloud of smoke drifting her way flushed birds of panic from her breast  although she could not smell the smoke  nor did it burn her eyes or sear her throat .   the fire  the fire .  she thought  heart fluttering in panic .  what had .  .  .  .   she saw a being made of breastplate coming at her with a tray of food and drink  poison from enemies  no doubt  the foes of france .  she thought in churning fright  she at once reached for her sword .      be with you in a moment     the breast plated thing said as it wheeled past her to another table .     i   ve only got four hands .  do have patience .      an inn  she thought .  it was some kind of inn  though there appeared to be nowhere to lodge .  and yes .  .  . it came now .  .  . she was supposed to meet someone .  .  . a gentleman .   that one  the tall  skinny old man  much older than jacques dars  her father  the only one besides herself attired normally .   something about his dress recalled the foppish dandies at the great and true king   s court .  his hair curled tight  its whiteness set off by a lilac ribbon at his throat .  he wore a pair of mignonette ruffles with narrow edging  a long waistcoat of brown satin with colored flowers  and sported red velvet breeches  white stockings  and chamois shoes .   a silly  vain aristocrat  she thought .  a fop accustomed to carriages  who could not so much as sit a horse  much less do holy battle .   but duty was a sacred obligation .  if king charles ordered her to advance  advance she would .   she rose .  her suit of mail felt surprisingly light .  she hardly sensed the belted on protective leather flaps in front and back  nor the two metal arm plates that left elbows free to wield the sword .  no one paid the least attention to the rustle of her mail or her faint clank .      are you the gentleman i am to meet .  monsieur arouet .         don   t call me that     he snapped .     arouet is my father   s name  the name of an authoritarian prude  not mine .  no one has called me that in years .      up close  he seemed less ancient .  she   d been misled by his white hair  which she now saw was false  a powdered wig secured by the lilac ribbon under his chin .      what should i call you then .     she suppressed terms of contempt for this dandy  rough words learned from comrades in arms  now borne by demons to her tongue   s edge  but not beyond .      poet  tragedian  historian .     he leaned forward and with a wicked wink whispered     i style myself voltaire .  freethinker .  philosopher king .         besides the king of heaven and his son  i call but one man king .  charles vii of the house of valois .  and i   ll call you arouet until my royal master bids me do otherwise .         my dear pucelie  your charles is dead .         no .      he glanced at the noiseless carriages propelled by invisible forces on the street .     sit down  sit down .  much else has passed  as well .  do help me get that droll waiter   s attention .         you know me .     led by her voices  she had cast off her father   s name to call herself la pucelie  the chaste maid .      i know you very well .  not only did you live centuries before me  i wrote a play about you .  and i have curious memories of speaking with you before  in some shadowy spaces .     he shook his head  frowning .     besides my garments  beautiful  n   est ce pas .   you   re the only familiar thing about this place .  you and the street  though i must say you   re younger than i thought  while the street .  .  .  hmmm .  .  . seems wider yet older .  they finally got    round to paving it .         i  i cannot fathom       he pointed to a sign that bore the inn   s name  aux deux magots .     mademoiselle lecouvreur  a famous actress  though equally known as my mistress .     he blinked .     you   re blushing  how sweet .         i know nothing of such things .     she added with more than a trace of pride     i am a maid .      he grimaced .     why one would be proud of such an unnatural state  i can   t imagine .         as i cannot imagine why you are so dressed .         my tailors will be mortally offended .  but allow me to suggest that it is you  my dear pucelle  who  in your insistence on dressing like a man  would deprive civilized society of one of its most harmless pleasures .         an insistence i most dearly paid for     she retorted  remembering how the bishops badgered her about her male attire as relentlessly as they inquired after her divine voices .   as if in the absurd attire members of her sex were required to wear  she could have defeated the english loving duke at orleans .  or led three thousand knights to victory at jargeau and meung surloire  beaugency and patay  throughout that summer of glorious conquests when  led by her voices  she could do no wrong .   she blinked back sudden tears .  a rush of memory    defeat .  .  . then the bloodred darkness of lost battles had descended  muffling her voices  while those of her english loving enemies grew strong .      no need to get testy     monsieur arouet said  gently patting her knee plate .     although i personally find your attire repulsive  i would defend to the death your right to dress any way you please .  or undress .     he eyed the near transparent upper garment of a female inn patron nearby .      sir          paris has not lost its appetite for finery after all .  pale fruit of the gods  don   t you agree .         no  i do not .  there is no virtue greater than chastity in women  or in men .  our lord was chaste  as are our saints and priests .         priests chaste .     he rolled his eyes .     pity you weren   t at the school my father forced me to attend as a boy .  you could have so informed the jesuits  who daily abused their innocent charges .         i  i cannot believe          and what of him .     voltaire talked right over her  pointing at the four handed creature on wheels rolling toward them .     no doubt such a creature is chaste .  is it then virtuous  too .         christianity  france itself  is founded on          if chastity were practiced in france as much as it   s preached  the race would be extinct .      the wheeled creature braked by their table .  stamped on his chest was what appeared to be his name  garcon     adm .  in a bass voice as clear as any man   s  he said     a costume party  eh .  i hope my delay will not make you late .  our mechfolk are having difficulties .      it eyed the other tiktok bringing dishes forth  a honey haired blond in a hairnet  approximately humanlike .  a demon .   the maid frowned .  its jerky glance  even though mechanical  recalled the way her jailers had gawked at her .  humiliated  she had cast aside the women   s garments that her inquisitors forced her to wear .  resuming manly attire  she   d scornfully put her jailers in their place .  it had been a fine moment .   the cook assumed a haughty look  but fussed with her hairnet and smiled at garcon     adm before averting her eyes .  the import of this eluded joan .  she had accepted mechanicals in this strange place  without questioning their meaning .  presumably this was some intermediate station in the lord   s providential order .  but it was puzzling .   monsieur arouet reached out and touched the mechman   s nearest arm  whose construction the maid could not help but admire .  if such a creature could be made to sit a horse  in battle it would be invincible .  the possibilities .  .  .      where are we .     monsieur arouet asked .     or perhaps i should ask  when .  i have friends in high places          and i in low     the mechman said good naturedly .       and i demand a full account of where we are  what   s going on .      the mechman shrugged with two of his free arms  while the two others set the table .     how could a mechwait with intelligence programmed to suit his station  instruct monsieur  a human being  in the veiled mysteries of simspace .  have monsieur and mademoiselle decided on their order .         you have not yet brought us the menu     said monsieur arouet .   the mechman pushed a button under the table .  two flat scrolls embedded in the table shimmered  letters glowing .  the maid let out a small cry of delight  then  in response to monsieur arouet   s censorious look  clapped her hand over her mouth .  her peasant manners were a frequent source of embarrassment .      ingenious     said monsieur arouet  switching the button on and off as he examined the underside of the table .     how does it work .         i   m not programmed to know .  you   ll have to ask a mechlectrician about that .         a what .         with all due respect  monsieur  my other customers are waiting .  i am programmed to take your order .         what will you have  my dear .     monsieur arouet asked her .   she looked down  embarrassed .     order for me     she said .      ah  yes .  i quite forgot .         forgot what .     asked the mechman .      my companion is unlettered .  she can   t read .  i might as well be  too  for all the good this menu   s doing me .      so this obviously learned man could not fathom the table of house .  joan found that endearing  amid this blizzard of the bizarre .   the mechman explained and voltaire interrupted .      cloud food .  electronic cuisine .     he grimaced .     just bring me the best you have for great hunger and thirst .  what can you recommend for abstinent virgins  a plate of dirt  perhaps .  chased with a glass of vinegar .         bring me a slice of bread     the maid said with frosty dignity .     and a small bowl of wine to dip it in .         wine .     said monsieur arouet .     your voices allow wine .  mais quelle scandale .  if word got out that you drink wine  what would the priests say of the shoddy example you   re setting for the future saints of france .      he turned to the mechman .     bring her a glass of water  small .     as garcon     adm withdrew  monsieur arouet called out     and make sure the bread is a crust .  preferably moldy .          .     marq hofti strode swiftly toward his waldon shaft office  his colleague and friend sybyl chattering beside him .  she was always energetic  bristling with ideas .  only occasionally did her energy seem tiresome .   the artifice associates offices loomed  weighty and impressive in the immense  high shaft .  a flutter glider circled the protruding levels far above  banking among pretty green clouds .  marq craned his neck upward and watched the glider catch an updraft of the city   s powerful air circulators .  atmospheric control even added the puff ball vapors for variety .  he longed to be up there  swooping among their sticky flavors .   instead  he was down here  donning his usual carapace of each day   s a challenge vigor .  and today was going to be unusual .  risky .  and though the zest for it sang in his stride  his grin  the fear of failure gave a leaden lining to his most buoyant plans .   if he failed today  at least he would not tumble from the sky  like a pilot who misjudged the thermals in the shaft .  grimly  he entered his office .      it makes me nervous     sybyl said  cutting into his mood .      umm .  what .     he dumped his pack and sat at his ornate control board .   she sat beside him .  the board filled half the office  making his desk look like a cluttered afterthought .     the sark sims .  we   ve spent so much time on those resurrection protocols  the slices and embeddings and all .         i had to fill in whole layers missing from the recordings .  synaptic webs from the association cortex .  plenty of work .         i did  too .  my joan was missing chunks of the hippocampus .         pretty tough .     the brain remembered things using constellations of agents from the hippocampus .  they laid down long term memory elsewhere  spattering pieces of it around the cerebral cortex .  not nearly as clean and orderly as computer memory  which was one of the major problems .  evolution was a kludge  mechanisms crammed in here and there  with little attention to overall design .  at building minds  the lord was something of an amateur .      murder .  i stayed to midnight for weeks .         me too .         did you .  .  . use the library .     he considered .  artifice associates kept dense files of brain maps  all taken from volunteers .  there were menus for selecting mental agents  subroutines which could carry out the tasks which myriad synapses did in the brain .  these were all neatly translated into digital equivalents  saving great labor .  but to use them meant running up big bills  because each was copyrighted .     no .  got a private source .      she nodded .     me too .      was she trying to coax an admission from him .  they had both had to go through scanning as part of getting their master class ratings in the meritocracy .  marq had thriftily kept his scan .  better than a back alley brain map  for sure .  he was no genius  but the basics of voltaire   s underpinnings weren   t the important part  after all .  exactly how the sim ran the hindbrain functions  basic maintenance  housekeeping circuitry  certainly couldn   t matter  could it .      let   s have a look at our creations     marq said brightly  to get off the subject .   sybyl shook her head .     mine is stable .  but look  we don   t really know what to expect .  these fully integrated personalities are still isolated .         nature of the beast .     marq shrugged  playing the jaded pro .  now that his hands caressed the board  though  a tingling excitement seized him .      let   s do it today     she said  words rushing out .      what .  i  i   d like to slap some more patches over the gaps  maybe install a rolling buffer as insurance against character shifts  spy into        details .  look  these sims have been running on internals for weeks of sim time  self integrating .  let   s interact .      marq thought of the glider pilot  up there amid treacherous winds .  he had never done anything so risky  he wasn   t the type .  his kind of peril lay on the digital playing field .  here  he was master .   but he had not gotten this far by being foolish .  letting these simulations come into contact with the present might induce hallucinations in them  fear  even panic .      just think .  talking to pre antiquity .      he realized that he was the one feeling fear .  think like a pilot .  he admonished himself .      would you want anyone else to do it .     sybyl asked .   he was keenly aware of the fleeting warmth of her thigh as it accidentally brushed his .      no one else could     he admitted .      and it   ll put us ahead of any competition .         that guy seldon  he could   ve  once he got them from those sark    new renaissance    jokers .  using us  well  i guess he needs to get some distance from a dicey proposition like this .         political distance     she agreed .     deniability .         he didn   t seem that savvy to me  politically  i mean .         maybe he wants us to think that .  how   d he charm cleon .         beats me .  not that i wouldn   t want one of our guys running things .  a mathist minister  who   d imagine that .      so artifice associates was out on its own here .  with their sark contacts  the company had already displaced digitfac and axiom alliance in the sale and design of holographic intelligences .  competition was rough in several product lines  though .  with a pipeline to truly ancient personalities  they could sweep the board clean .  at the knife edge of change  marq thought happily .  danger and money  the two great aphrodisiacs .   he had spent yesterday eavesdropping on voltaire and was sure sybyl had done the same with the maid .  everything had gone well .     face filters for us  though .         don   t trust yourself to not give away your feelings .     sybyl gave him a womanly  throaty chuckle .     think you   re too easy to read .         am i .     ball back in her court .      let   s say your intentions are  at least .      her sly wink made his nostrils flare  which reminded marq of why he needed the filters .  he thumbed in an amiable expression he had carefully fashioned for dealing by phone with clients .  he had learned early in this business that the world was packed with irritable people .  especially trantor .      better put a body language refiner on  too     she said flatly  all business now .  that was what never ceased to intrigue him  artful ambiguity .   she popped up her own filters  imported instantly from her board halfway across the building .     want a vocabulary box .      he shrugged .     anything they can   t understand  we   ll credit to language problems .         what is that stuff they speak .         dead language  unknown parent world .     his hands were a blur  setting up the transition .      it has a  well  a liquid feel .         one thing .      sybyl   s breasts swelled as she drew in her breath  held it  then slowly eased it out .     i just hope my client doesn   t find out about seldon .  the company   s taking an awful chance  not telling either one of them about the other .         so what .     he enjoyed giving a carefree shrug .  a flutter glide would petrify him  but power games  those he loved .  artifice associates had taken major accounts from the two deadly rivals in this whole affair .      if both sides of the argument find out we   re handling both accounts  they   ll leave .  refuse to pay beyond the retainer  and you know how much we   ve overspent beyond that .         leave .     his turn to chuckle .     not if they want to win .  we   re the best .     marq gave her his cocky smile .     you and me  in case you were wondering .  just wait till you see this .      he downed the lights  started the run  and leaned back in his clasp chair  legs stretched out on the table before him .  he wanted to impress her .  that wasn   t all he wanted .  but since her husband had been crushed in an accident  beyond repair by even the best medicos  he   d decided to wait a decent interval before he made his move .  what a team they would make .  open a firm  say  marq sybyl  limited  skim off the best a  customers  make a name .   no names .  let   s be fair .   sybyl   s voice trembled in the gloom .     to meet ancients .  .  .      down  down  down  into the replicated world  its seamless blue complexity swelling across the entire facing wall .  vibrotactile feedback from inductance dermotabs perfected the illusion .   they swooped into a primitive city  barely one layer of buildings to cover the naked ground .  some sort of crude village  pre empire .  streets whirled by  buildings turned in artful projection .  even the crowds and clumped traffic below seemed authentic  a muddled human jumble .  swiftly they careened into their foreground sim  a cafe on something called the boulevard st .  germain .  cloying smells  the muted grind of traffic outside  a rattle of plates  the heady aroma of a souffl   .   marq zoomed them into the same timeframe as the recreated entities .  a lean man loomed across the wall .  his eyes radiated intelligence  mouth tilted with sardonic mirth .   sybyl whistled through her teeth .  eyes narrowing  she watched the re creation   s mouth  as if to read its lips .  voltaire was interrogating the mechwaiter .  irritably  of course .      high five sense resolution     she said  appropriately awed .     i can   t get mine that clear .  i still don   t know how you do it .      marq thought  my sark contacts .  i know you have some  too .      hey     she said .     what      he grinned with glee as her mouth fell open and she stared at the image of her joan next to his voltaire  freeze frame  data streams initialized but not yet running interactively .   her expression mingled admiration with fear .     we   re not supposed to bring them on together .   not till they meet in the coliseum .         who says .  it   s not in our contract .         hastor will skewer us anyway .         maybe  if he finds out .  want me to section her off .      her mouth twisted prettily .     of course not .  what the hell  it   s done .  activate .         i knew you   d go for it .  we   re the artists  we make the decisions .         have we got the running capacity to make them realtime .      he nodded .     it   ll cost  but sure .  and .  .  . i   ve got a little proposition for you .         uh oh .     her brow arched .     forbidden  no doubt .      he waited  just to tantalize her .  and to judge  from her reaction  how receptive she   d be if he tried to change the nature of their long standing platonic relationship .  he had tried  once before .  her rejection  she was married on a decade contract  she gently reminded him  only made him desire her more .  all that and faithful in marriage  too .  enough to make the teeth grind  which they had  frequently .  of course  they could be replaced for less than the price of an hour with a good therapist .   her body language now  a slight pulling away  told him she was still mourning her dead husband .  he was prepared to wait the customary year  but only if he had to .      what say we give both of them massive files  far beyond basis state     he said quickly .     really give them solid knowledge of what trantor   s like  the empire  everything .         impossible .         no  just expensive .         so much .         so what .  just think about it .  we know what these two primordials represented  even if we don   t know what world they came from .         their strata memories say    earth     remember .      marq shrugged .     so .  dozens of primitive worlds called themselves that .         oh  the way primitives call themselves    the people    .         sure .  the whole folk tale is wrong astrophysically  too .  this legend of the original planet is pretty clear on one point  the world was mostly oceans .  so why call it    earth    .      she nodded .     granted  they   re deluded .  and they have no solid databases about astronomy  i checked that .  but look at their social context readings .  these two stood for concepts  eternal ideas  faith and reason .      marq balled both fists in enthusiasm  a boyish gesture .     right .  on top of that we   ll pump in what we know today  pseudonatural selection  psychophilosophy  gene destinies          boker will never go for it     sybyl said .     it   s precisely modem information the preservers of our father   s faith don   t want .  they want the historical maid  pure and uncontaminated by modem ideas .  i   d have to program her to read          a cinch .           write  handle higher mathematics .  give me a break .         do you object on ethical grounds .  or simply to avoid a few measly centuries of work .         easy for you to say .  your voltaire has an essentially modem mind .  whoever made him had his own work  dozens of biographies .  my maid is as much myth as she is fact .  somebody re created her out of thin air .         then your objection   s based on laziness  not principle .         it   s based on both .         will you at least give it some thought .         i just did .  the answer is no .      marq sighed .     no use arguing .  you   ll see  once we let them interact .      her mood seemed to swing from resistance to excitement  in her enthusiasm  she even touched his leg  fingers lingering .  he felt her affectionate tap just as they opened into the simspace .       .        what   s going on here .     voltaire rose  hands on hips  chair toppling back behind him  clattering on stone  and peered down at them from the screen .     who are you .  what infernal agency do you represent .      marq stopped the sim and turned to sybyl .     uh  do you want to explain it to him .         he   s your re creation  not mine .         i   ve dreaded this .     voltaire was imposing .  he exuded power and electric confidence .  somehow  in all his microscopic inspections of this sim  the sum of it all  this gestalt essence  had never come through .      we worked hard on this .  if you stall now       marq braced himself .     right  right .         how do you look to him .         i made myself materialize  walk over  sit down .         he saw you come out of nothing .         i guess so     he said  chagrined .     shook him up .      marq had used every temperament fabrication he had  trimming and shaping mood constellations  but he had left intact voltaire   s central core .  what a hardball knot it was .  some programmer of pre antiquity had done a startling  dense job .  gingerly  he dipped the voltaire sim into a colorless void of sensory static .  soothe  then slide .  .  .   his fingers danced .  he cut in the time acceleration .   sim personalities needed computational durations to assimilate new experience .  he thrust voltaire into a cluttered  seemingly real experience net .  the personality reacted to the simulation and raced through the induced emotions .  voltaire was rational  his personality could accept new ideas that took the joansim far longer .   what did all this do to a reconstruction of a real person  when knowledge of a different reality dawned .  here came the tricky part of the reanimation .  acceptance of who what when they were .   conceptual shock waves would resound through the digital personalities  forcing emotional adjustments .  could they take it .  these weren   t real people  after all  any more than an abstract impressionist painting pretended to tell you what a cow looked like .  now  he and sybyl could step in only after the automatic programs had done their best .   here their math craft met its test .  artificial personalities had to survive this cusp point or crash into insanity and incoherence .  racing along highways of expanding perception  the ontological swerves could jolt a construct so hard  it shattered .   he let them meet each other  watching carefully .  the aux deux magots  simple town and crowd backdrop .  to shave computing time  weather repeated every two minutes of simtime .  cloudless sky  to save on fluid flow modeling .  sybyl tinkered with her joan  he with his voltaire  smoothing and rounding small cracks and slippages in the character perceptual matrix .   they met  spoke .  some skittering  blue white storms swept through voltaire   s neuronal simulations .  marq sent in conceptual repair algorithms .  turbulence lapped away .      got it .     he whispered .  sybyl nodded beside him  intent on her own smoothing functions .      he   s running regular now     marq said  feeling better about the startup mistake .     i   ll keep my manifestation sitting  right .  no disappearances or anything .         joan   s cleared up .     sybyl pointed at brown striations in the matrix representation that floated in  d before her .     some emotional tectonics  but they   ll take time .         i say  go .      she smiled .     let   s .      the moment came .  marq sucked voltaire and joan back into realtime .   within a minute he knew that voltaire was still intact  functional  integrated .  so was joan  though she had retreated into her pensive withdrawal mode  an aspect well documented  her internal weather .   voltaire  though  was irked .  he swelled life sized before them .  the hologram scowled  swore  and loudly demanded the right to initiate communication whenever he liked .      you think i want to be at your mercy whenever i   ve something to say .  you   re talking to a man who was exiled  censored  jailed  suppressed  who lived in constant fear of church and state authorities          fire     the maid whispered with eerie sensuality .      calm down     marq ordered voltaire     or i   ll shut you off .     he froze action and turned to sybyl .     what do you think .  should we comply .         why not .     she said .     it   s not fair for them to be forever at our beck and call .     .      fair .  this is a sim .         they have notions of fairness .  if we violate those          okay  okay .     he started action again .     the next question is how .         i don   t care how you do it     the hologram said .     just do it  at once .         hold off     marq said .     we   ll let you have running time  to integrate your perception space .         what does that mean .     voltaire asked .     artful expression is one thing  jargon another .         to work out your kinks     marq replied dryly .      so that we can converse .         yes     sybyl said .     at your initiation  not just ours .  don   t go for a walk at the same time  though  that requires too much data shuffling .         we   re trying to hold costs down here     marq said  leaning back so he could get a better view of sybyl   s legs .      well  hurry up     the voltaire image said .     patience is for martyrs and saints  not for men of belles lettres .      the translator rendered all this in present language  inserting the audio of ancient  lost words .  knowledge fetchers found the translation and overlaid it for marq and sybyl .  still  marq had left in the slippery  natural acoustics for atmosphere  the tenor of the unimaginably distant past .      just say my name  or sybyl   s  and we   ll appear to you in a rectangle rimmed in red .         must it be red .     the maid   s voice was frail .     can you not make it blue .  blue is so cool  the color of the sea .  water is stronger than fire  can put fire out .         stop babbling     the other hologram snapped .  he beckoned to a mechwaiter and said     that flamb   dish  there  put it out at once .  it   s upsetting the maid .  and you two geniuses out there .  if you can resurrect the dead  you certainly should be able to change red to blue .         i don   t believe this     said sybyl .     a sim .  who does he think he is .         the voice of reason     marq replied .     francois marie arouet de voltaire .         do you think they   re ready to see boker .     sybyl chewed prettily at her lip .     we agreed to let him into the sim as soon as they were stabilized .      marq thought .     let   s play it square and linear with him .  i   ll call .         we have so much to learn from them .         true .  who could have guessed that prehistoricals could be such bastards .          .     she tried to ignore the sorceress called sybyl  who claimed to be her creator  as if anyone but the king of heaven could lay claim to such a feat .  she didn   t feel like talking to anyone .  events crowded in  rushed  dense  suffocating .  her choking  pain shot death still swarmed about her .   on the dunce   s cap  the one they   d set upon her shaven head on that fiery day  the darkest and yet most glorious day of her short life  her    crimes    were inscribed in the holy tongue  heretica  relapsa  apostata  idolater .  black words  soon to ignite .   the learned cardinals and bishops of the foul  english loving university of paris  and of the church  christ   s bride on earth .   had set her living body on fire .  all for carrying out the lord   s will  that the great and true king should be his minister in france .  for that  they had rejected the king   s ransom  and sent her to the searing pyre .  what then might they not do to this sorceress called sybyl  who  like her  dwelt among men  wore men   s attire  and claimed for herself powers that eclipsed those of the creator himself .      please go away     she murmured .     i must have silence if i am to hear my voices .      but neither la sorci  re nor the bearded man in black named boker  who resembled uncannily the glowering patriarchs on the domed ceiling of the great church at rouen  would leave her alone .   she implored them     if you must talk  natter at monsieur arouet .  that one likes nothing more .         sacred maid  rose of france     said the bearded one     was france your world .         my station in the world     joan said .      your planet  i mean .         planets are in the sky .  i was of the earth .         i mean  oh  never mind .     he spoke soundlessly to the woman  sybyl     of the ground .  farmers .  could even prehistoricals be so ignorant .       apparently thinking she could not read lips  a trick she had mastered to divine the deliberations of churchly tribunals .   joan said     i know what is sufficient to my charge .      boker frowned  then rushed on .     please  hear me out .  our cause is just .  the fate of the sacred depends upon our winning to our side many converts .  if we are to uphold the vessel of humanity  and time honored traditions of our very identity  we must defeat secular skepticism .      she tried to turn away  but the clanking weight of her chains stopped her .     leave me alone .  although i killed no one  i fought in many combats to assure the victory of france   s great true king .  i presided over his coronation at rheims .  i was wounded in battle for his sake .      she held up her wrists  for she was now in the foul cell at rouen  in leg irons and chains .  sybyl had said this would anchor her  be good for her character in some way .  as an angel  sybyl was no doubt correct .  boker began to implore her  but joan summoned strength to say     the world knows how i was requited for my pains .  i shall wage war no more .      monsieur boker turned to the sorceress .     a sacrilege  to keep a great figure in chains .  can   t you transport her to some place of theological rest .  a cathedral .         context .  sims need context     la sorci  re said without sound .  joan found she could read lips with a clarity she had never known .  perhaps this purgatory improved its charges .   monsieur boker clucked .     i am impressed with what you   ve done  but unless you can make her cooperate  what good is she to us .         you haven   t seen her at the summit of her selfhood .  the few historical associations we have been able to decipher claim that she was a    mesmerizing presence .     we   ll have to bring that out .         can you not make her smaller .  it   s impossible to talk to a giant .      the maid  to her astonishment  shrank by two thirds in height .   monsieur boker seemed pleased .     great joan  you misunderstand the nature of the war that lies ahead .  uncountable millennia have passed since your ascension into heaven .  you       the maid sat up .     tell me one thing .  is the king of france a descendant of the english henry   s house of lancaster .  or is he a valois  descended from the great and true king charles .      monsieur boker blinked and thought .     i .  .  . i think it may be truly said that we preservers of our father   s faith  the party i represent  are in a manner of speaking descendants of your charles .      the maid smiled .  she knew her voices had been heaven sent  no matter what the bishops said .  she   d only denied them when they took her to the cemetery of st .  ouen  and then only for fear of the fire .  she   d been right to recant her recantation two days later  the lancastrian failure to annex france confirmed that .  if monsieur boker spoke for descendants of the house of valois  despite his clear absence of a noble title  she would hear him out .      proceed     she said .   monsieur boker explained that this place was soon to hold a referendum .   after some deliberation with la sorci  re  he advised that joan should think of this place as france  in essence .   the contest would be between two major parties  preservers vs .  skeptics .  both parties had agreed to hold a great debate between two verbal duelists  to frame the salient question .      what issue .     the maid asked sharply .      whether mechanical beings endowed with artificial intelligence should be built .  and if so  should they be allowed full citizenship  with all attendant rights .      the maid shrugged .     a joke .  only aristocrats and noblemen have rights .         not anymore  though of course we do have a class system .  now the common lot enjoy rights .         peasants like me .     the maid asked .     we .      monsieur boker  face a moving flurry of exasperated scowls  turned to la sorci  re .     must i do everything .         you wanted her as is     la sorci  re said .     or  rather  as was .      monsieur boker spent two minutes ranting about something he called the conceptual shift .  this term meant an apparently theological dispute about the nature of mechanical artifice .  to joan the answer seemed clear  but then  she was a woman of the fields  not a word artisan .      why don   t you ask your king .  one of his counselors .  or one of your learned men .      monsieur boker curled his lip  dismissively fanned the air .     our leaders are pallid .  weak .  rational doormats .         surely          you cannot imagine  coming from ancient passion .  intensity and passion are regarded as bad form  out of style .  we wished to find intellects with the old fire  the          no .  oh .     the flames  licking    it was some moments before her breathing calmed and she could shakily listen again .   the great debate between faith and reason would be held in the coliseum of junin sector before an audience of         souls .  the maid and her opponent would appear in holograms  magnified by a factor of thirty .  each citizen would then vote on the question .      vote .     the maid inquired .      you wanted her uncorrupted     la sorci  re said .     you got her .      the maid listened in silence  forced to absorb millennia in minutes .  when monsieur boker finished  she said     i excelled in battle  if only for a brief time  but never in argument .  no doubt you know of my fate .      monsieur boker looked pained .     the vagueries of the ancients .  we have a skimpy historical frame around your  ah  representation  no more .  we know not what place you lived  but we do know minutiae of events after your          death .  you can speak of it .  i am accustomed to it  as any christian maiden should be  upon arrival in purgatory .  i know who you two are  as well .      la sorci  re asked cautiously     you .  .  . do .         angels .  you manifest yourselves as ordinary folk  to calm my fears .  then you set me a task .  even if it involves the roguish  it is a divine mission .      monsieur boker nodded slowly  glancing at la sorci  re .     from the tatters of data flapping about your self  we gather that your reputation was restored at hearings held twenty six years after your death .  those involved in your condemnation repented of their mistake .  you were called  in high esteem  la rose de la wire .      she blinked back wistful tears .     justice .  .  . had i been skilled in argument  i   d have convinced my inquisitors  those english loving preachers of the university of paris .   that i am not a witch .      monsieur boker seemed moved .     even pre antiquity knew when a holy power was with them .      the maid laughed  lighthearted .     the lord   s on the side of his son  and the saints and martyrs  too .  but that does not mean they escape failure and death .         she   s right     la sorci  re said .     even worlds and galaxies share man   s fate .         we of spirituality need you     monsieur boker pleaded .     we have become too much like our machines .  we hold nothing sacred except the smooth functioning of our parts .  we know you will address the question with intensity  yet in simplicity and truth .  that is all we ask .      the maid felt fatigued .  she needed solitude  time to reflect .     i must consult with my voices .  will there be only one  or many questions that i must address .         just one .      the inquisitors had been far more demanding .  they asked many questions  dozens  sometimes the same ones  over and over again .  right answers at poitiers proved wrong elsewhere .  deprived of food  drink  rest  intimidated by the enforced journey to the cemetery  exhausted by the tedious sermon they compelled her to hear  and wracked by terror of the fire  she could not withstand their interrogation .      does the archangel michael have long hair .         is st .  margaret stout or lean .         are st .  catherine   s eyes brown or blue .      they trapped her into assigning to voices of the spirit attributions of the flesh .  then they perversely condemned her for confounding sacred spirit with corrupt flesh .   all had been miasma .  and in purgatory  worse trials could ensue .  she could not therefore be certain if this boker would turn out to be friend or foe .      what is it .     she wanted to know .     this single question you want me to answer .         there is universal consensus that man made intelligences have a kind of brain .  the question we want you to answer is whether they have a soul .          only the almighty has the power to create a soul .      monsieur boker smiled .     we preservers couldn   t agree with you more .  artificial intelligences  unlike us  their creators  have no soul .  they   re just machines .  mechanical contrivances with electronically programmed brains .  only man has a soul .         if you already know the answer to the question  why do you need me .         to persuade .  first the undecided of junin sector  then trantor  then the empire .      the maid reflected .  her inquisitors had known the answers to the questions they plied her with  too .  monsieur boker seemed sincere  but then so were those who pronounced her a witch .  monsieur boker had told her the answer beforehand  one with which any sensible person would agree .  still  she could not be sure of his intentions .  not even the crucifix she asked the priest to hold aloft was proof against the oily smoke  the biting flames .  .  .  .      well .     asked monsieur boker .     will the sacred rose consent to be our champion .         these people i must convince .  are they  too  descendants of charles  the great and true king  of the house of valois .          .     when marq strode into splashes   sniffs to meet his buddy and coworker nim  he was surprised to find nim already there .  to judge from nim   s dilated pupils  he   d been there most of the afternoon .   marq said     hitting it hard .  something going on .      nim shook his head .     same old marq  blunt as a fist .  first  try the swirlsnort .  doesn   t do a thing for your thirst  in fact  it will dry up your entire head  but you won   t care .      swirlsnort turned out to be a powdery concoction that tasted like nutmeg and bit as if he had swallowed an angry insect .  marq sniffed it slowly  one nostril at a time .  he wanted to be relatively clearheaded when nim updated him on office politics and funding .  after that  he   d allow himself to get skyed .      you may not like this     said nim .     it concerns sybyl .         sybyl .     he laughed a bit uneasily .     how   d you know i          you told me .  last time we had a snort together  remember .         oh .     the stuff made him babble .  worse  it made him forget he had .      not exactly a state secret .     nim grinned .      that obvious .     he wanted to be certain nim  who switched women as often as he changed his underwear  had no designs on sybyl of his own .     what about her .         well  there   s a lot of juice waiting for whoever wins the big one at the coliseum .         no problem     marq said .     me .      nim ran his hand through his strawberry blond hair .     i can   t decide if it   s your modesty or your ability to foresee the future that i like most about you .  your modesty .  must be that .      marq shrugged .     she   s good  i   ll admit .         but you   re better .         i   m luckier .  they gave me reason .  sybyl   s stuck with faith .      nim gave him a bemused glance and inhaled deeply .     i wouldn   t underestimate faith if i were you .  it   s hooked to passion  and no one   s managed to get rid of either  yet .         don   t have to .  passions eventually burn out .         but the light of reason burns eternally .         if you regenerate brain cells  yes .      nim looked through his straw to see if anything was left and winked at marq .     then you don   t need a little advice .         what advice .  i didn   t hear any advice .      nim clucked .     if your unregenerated brain cells contain a shred of common sense  you   ll stop cooperating with sybyl to improve her simulation .  or better yet  you   ll keep pretending you   re cooperating  so you get the benefit of anything she can show you .  but what you   ll really start doing is looking for ways to do both her and her simulation in .  people say it   s terrific .         i   ve seen it .         some of it .  think she shows it all .         we   ve been working every day on          truncated sim  is what you see .  nights  she inflates the whole pseudo psyche .      marq frowned .  he knew he was a bit light headed around her  pheromones doing their job  but he had compensated for that .  hadn   t he .     she wouldn   t .  .  .         she might .  people upstairs got their eye on her .      marq felt a stab of jealousy in spite of himself  but he was careful not to show it .     ummm .  thanks .      nim bowed his head with characteristic irony and said     even if you don   t need it  you   d be a fool to turn it down .         what  the juice  when i win .         not the juice  buggo .  you think i missed noticing that i   m talking to ambition   s slave .  my advice .      marq took a hefty double nostril snort .     i   ll certainly bear it in mind .         this thing   s going to be big .  you think it   s just a job for this sector  but i tell you  people from all over trantor will tune into the show .         all the better     marq said  though his stomach was feeling like he had suddenly gone into free fall .  living in a real cultural renaissance was risky .  maybe his hollow feeling was the stim  though .      i mean  seldon and that guy who follows him around like a dog  amaryl  you think they   ve booted this to you because it   s a snap .      marq took a bit of the stim before answering .     no  it   s because i   m the best .         and you   re a long way down from them on the status ladder .  you are  my friend  expendable .      marq nodded soberly .     i   ll certainly bear it in mind .      was he repeating himself .  must be the stim .     marq did not give nim   s counsel any thought until two days later .  he overheard someone in the executive lounge praising sybyl   s work to hastor  the leader of artifice associates .  he skipped lunch and went back to his floor .  as he passed sybyl   s office on his way back to his own  his intention  he told himself  was to relay the compliment .  but when he found her door unlocked  her office empty  an impulse seized him .     half an hour later  he jumped slightly when she said    marq .      from the open doorway .  her hand smoothed her hair in what he took to be unconscious primping  betraying a desire to please .     can i help you .      he   d just finished the software cross matting to link her office  so that he   d be able to monitor her interviews with her client  boker .  she shared with marq the substance of these interviews  as far as he knew .   he reasoned that his suggestions as to how she should handle the sometimes difficult boker would be improved if he were exposed to boker directly .  but that would compromise the client relationship  ordinarily a strict rule .  this  though  was special .  .  .   he shrugged .     just waiting for you .         i   ve gotten her much better structured .  her mood flutters are below zero point two .         great .  can i see .      did her smile seem warmer than usual .  he was still wondering about that when he reached his own office  after an hour of intuning on joan .  sybyl had certainly done good work .  thorough  intricately matted in with the ancient personality topography .   all since yesterday .  he thought not .   time to do a little sniffing around in simspace .       .     voltaire loomed  brows furrowed  scowling  hands on skinny hips .  he rose from the richly embroidered chair in his study at cirey  the chateau of his long term mistress  the marquise du chatelet .   the place he had called home for fifteen years depressed him  now that she was gone .  and now the marquis  without the decency to wait until his wife   s body was cold  had informed him that he must leave .      get me out of here .     voltaire demanded of the scientist who finally answered his call .  scientist  a fresh word  one no doubt derived from the latin root  to know .  but this fellow looked as though he knew little .     i want to go to the cafe .  i need to see the maid .      the scientist leaned over the control board voltaire was already beginning to resent  and smiled with transparent pleasure at his power .     i didn   t think she was your type .  you showed a strong preference all your life  remember  i   ve scanned your memories  you have no secrets  for brainy women .  like your niece and the madame du chatelet .         so .  who truly can abide the company of stupid women .  the only thing that can be said on their behalf is that they can be trusted  as they   re too stupid to practice deceit .         unlike madame du chatelet .      voltaire drummed his fingers impatiently on the beautifully wrought walnut desk  a gift from madame du chatelet  he recalled .  how had it gotten to this rude place .  could it indeed have been assembled from his memory alone .     true  she betrayed me .  she paid dearly for it  too .      the scientist arched a brow .     with that young officer  you mean .  the one who made her pregnant .         at forty three  a married woman with three grown children has no business becoming pregnant .         you hit the roof when she told you  understandable but not very enlightened .  yet you didn   t break off with her .  you were with her throughout the birth .      voltaire fumed .  memory dark  memory flowing like black waters in a subterranean river .  he   d worried himself sick about the birth  which had proved amazingly easy .  yet nine days later  the most extraordinary woman he had ever known was dead .  of childbed fever .  no one  not even his niece and housekeeper and former paramour  madame denis  who took care of him thereafter  had ever been able to take her place .  he had mourned her until  until  he approached the thought  veered away  till he died .  .  .   he puffed out his cheeks and spat back rapidly     she persuaded me that it would be unreasonable to break with a    woman of exceptional breeding and talent    merely for exercising the same rights that i enjoyed .  especially since i hadn   t made love to her for months .  the rights of man  she said  belonged to women  too  provided they were of the aristocracy .  i allowed her gentle reasonableness to persuade me .         ah     the scientist said enigmatically .  voltaire rubbed his forehead  heavy with brooding remembrance .     she was an exception to every rule .  she understood newton and locke .  she understood every word that i wrote .  she understood me .         why weren   t you making love to her .  too busy going to orgies .         my dear sir  my participation in such festivities has been greatly exaggerated .  it   s true  i accepted an invitation to one such celebration of erotic pleasure in my youth .  i acquitted myself so well  i was invited to return .         did you .         certainly not .  once  a philosopher .  twice  a pervert .         what i don   t understand is why a man of your worldliness should be so intent on another meeting with the maid .         her passion     voltaire said  an image of the robust maid rising clearly in his mind   s eye .     her courage and devotion to what she believed .         you possessed that trait as well .      voltaire stomped his foot  but the floor made no sound .     why do you speak of me in the past tense .         sorry .  i   ll fill in that audio background  too .     a single hand gesture  and voltaire heard boards creak as he paced .  a carriage team clip clopped by outside .      i possess temperament .  do not confuse passion with temperament  which is a matter of the nerves .  passion is borne from the heart and soul  no mere mechanism of the bodily humors .         you believe in souls .         in essences  certainly .  the maid dared cling to her vision with her whole heart  despite bullying by church and state .  her devotion to her vision  unlike mine  bore no taint of perverseness .  she was the first true protestant .  i   ve always preferred protestants to papist absolutists  until i took up residence in geneva  only to discover their public hatred of pleasure is as great as any pope   s .  only quakers do not privately engage in what they publicly claim to abjure .  alas  a hundred true believers cannot redeem millions of hypocrites .      the scientist twisted his mouth skeptically .     joan recanted  knuckled under to their threats .         they took her to a cemetery .     voltaire bristled with irritation .     terrorized a credulous girl with threats of death and hell .  bishops  academicians  the most learned men of their time .  donkeys    asses  the lot .  browbeating the bravest woman in france  a woman whom they destroyed only to revere .  hypocrites .  they require martyrs as leeches require blood .  they thrive on self sacrifice  provided that the selves they sacrifice are not their own .         all we have is your version  and hers .  our history doesn   t go back that far .  still  we know more of people now          so you imagine .     voltaire sniffed a jot of snuff to calm himself .     villains are undone by what is worst in them  heroes by what is best .  they played her honor and her bravery like a fiddle  swine plucking at a violin .         you   re defending her .     the scientist   s wry smile mocked .     yet in that poem you wrote about her  amazing  someone memorizing their own work  so they could recite it .   you depict her as a tavern slut  much older than she in fact was  a liar about her so called voices  a superstitious but shrewd fool .  the greatest enemy of the chastity she pretends to defend is a donkey  a donkey with wings .      voltaire smiled .     a brilliant metaphor for the roman church  n   est ce pas .  i had a point to make .  she was simply the sword with which i drove it home .  i had not met her then .  i had no idea she was a woman of such mysterious depths .         not depths of intellect .  a peasant .     marq recalled how he had escaped just such a fate on the mud grubbing world biehleur .  all through the greys exam .  and now he had fled their stodgy routines  into a true cultural revolution .      no  no .  depths of the soul .  i   m like a little stream .  clear because it is shallow .  but she   s a river  an ocean .  return me to aux deux magots .  she and the wind up garcon are the only society i now have .         she is your adversary     the scientist said .     a minion of those who uphold values that you fought all your life .  to make sure you beat her  i   m going to supplement you .         i am intact and entire     voltaire declared frostily .      i   ll equip you with philosophical and scientific information  rational progress .  your reason must crush her faith .  you must regard her as the enemy she is  if civilization is to continue to advance along rational scientific lines .      his eloquence and impudence were rather charming  but no substitutes for voltaire   s fascination with joan .     i refuse to read anything until you reunite me with the maid  in the cafe .      the scientist had the audacity to laugh .     you don   t get it .  you have no choice .  i   ll sculpt the information into you .  you   ll have the information you need to win  like it or not .         you violate my integrity .         let   s not forget that after the debate  there   ll be the question of keeping you running  or .  .  .         ending me .         just so you know what cards are on the table .      voltaire bristled .  he knew the iron accents of authority  since he was first subjected to his father   s  a strict martinet who   d compelled him to attend mass  and whose austerities claimed the life of voltaire   s mother when voltaire was only seven .  the only way she could escape her husband   s discipline was to die .  voltaire had no intention of escaping this scientist in that way .      i refuse to use any additional knowledge you give me unless you return me at once to the cafe .      infuriatingly  the scientist regarded voltaire the way voltaire had regarded his wigmaker  with haughty superiority .  his curled lip said quite clearly that he knew voltaire could not exist without his patronage .   a humbling turnabout .  though middle class in origin himself  voltaire did not believe common people worthy of governing themselves .  the thought of his wigmaker posing as a legislator was enough to make him never wear a wig again .  to be seen similarly by this vexing  smug scientist was intolerable .      tell you what     said the scientist .     you compose one of your brilliant lettres philosophiques trashing the concept of the human soul  and i will reunite you with the maid .  but if you don   t  you won   t see her until the day of the debate .  clear .      voltaire mulled the offer over .     clear as a little stream     he said at last .     and then clotted  cinder dark clouds descended into his mind .  memories  sullen and grim .  he felt engulfed in a past that roared through him  scouring     he   s cycling .  there   s something surfacing here .  .  .     came marq   s hollow call .   images of the far past exploded .      call seldon .  this sim has another layer .  call seldon .          .     hari seldon stared at the images and data rivers .     voltaire suffered a recall storm .  and look at the implications .       marq peered without comprehension at the torrent .     uh  i see .         that promontory  a memory nugget about a debate he had with joan  eight thousand years ago .         somebody used these sims before          for public debate  yes .  history not only repeats itself  sometimes it stutters .         faith vs .  reason .         faith mechanicals vs .  reason human will     seldon said  as if reading them directly from the numerical complexes .  marq could not follow the connections fast enough to keep up with him .     a society of that time had a fundamental division over computer intelligences and their .  .  . manifestations .      marq caught an elusive flicker in seldon   s face .  was he hiding something .     manifestations .  you mean  like tiktoks .         something like that     seldon said stiffly .      voltaire   s for          in that age  he was for human effervescence .  joan favored faith  which meant  uh  tiktoks .         i don   t get it .         ttktoks  or higher forms of them  were deemed capable of guiding humanity .     seldon seemed uncomfortable .      tiktoks .     marq snorted derisively .      or  uh  higher forms .         that   s what voltaire and joan were debating eight thousand years ago .  so they were engineered for this .  who won .         the result is suppressed .  i believe it became an irrelevant issue .  no computer intelligences could be made which could guide humanity .      marq nodded .     makes sense .  machines will never be as smart as we are .  day to day business  sure  but          i suggest erasure of the embedded memory complex     seldon said curtly .     that will eliminate the interfering layer .         oh  if you think that   s best .  i   m not sure we can disconnect every tie in to those memories  though .  these sims use holographic recall  so it   s lodged          to get the results you wish in this upcoming debate  it is crucial .  there could be other implications  too .         such as .            historians might mine sims like these for lost data on the far past .  they would want access .  deny them .         oh  sure .  i mean  not likely we   d let anybody use them .      seldon gazed at the shifting slabs of pattern .     they are complex  aren   t they .  minds of real depth  interacting subselves .  .  . ommm .  .  . i wonder how the whole sense of selfhood remains stable .  how come their mentalities don   t just crash .      marq couldn   t follow  but he said     i guess those ancients  they knew a few tricks we don   t .      seldon nodded .     indeed .  there   s a glimmer of an idea here        he stood quickly and marq rose .     couldn   t you stay .  i know sybyl would like to talk          sorry  must go .  matters of state .         uh  well  thanks for       seldon was gone before marq could close his gaping mouth .       .        i have no desire to see the skinny gentleman in the wig .  he thinks he   s better than everyone else     the maid told the sorceress called sybyl .      true  but          i much prefer the company of my own voices .         he   s quite taken with you     madame la sorci  re said .      i find that difficult to believe .     still  she could not help smiling .      oh  but it   s true .  he   s asked marq  his recreator  for an entirely new image .  he lived  you know  to eighty four .         he looks even older .     she had found his wig  lilac ribbon  and velvet breeches ludicrous on such a dried up fig of a man .      marq decided to make him appear as he looked at forty two .  do see him .      the maid reflected .  monsieur arouet would be far less repulsive if .  .  .    did monsieur have a different tailor as a young man .         hmmm  that might be arranged .         i   m not going to the inn in these .      she held up her chains  recalling the fur cloak the king himself had placed about her shoulders at his coronation in rouen .  she thought of asking for it now  but decided against it .  they had made much of her cloak during her trial  accusing her of having a demon inspired love of luxury  she who  until she won the king over that day she first appeared at court  had felt nothing but coarse burlap against her skin .  her accusers  she had noted  wore black satin and velvet and reeked of perfume .      i   ll do what i can     madame la sorci  re vowed     but you must agree not to tell monsieur boker .  he doesn   t want you fraternizing with the enemy  but i think it will do you good .  hone your skills for the great debate .      there was a pause  falling  soft clouds  in which the maid felt as if she had fainted .  when she recovered  hard cool surfaces  sudden sharp splashes of brown  green  she found herself seated in the inn of the two maggots  once again  surrounded by guests who seemed not to know that she was there .   armor plated beings bearing trays and clearing tableware darted among the guests .  she looked for garcon and spotted him gazing at the honey haired cook  who pretended not to notice .  garcon   s longing recalled the way the maid herself had gazed at statues of st .  catherine and st .  margaret  who had both forsworn men but adopted their attire  suspended between two worlds  holy passion above  earthy ardor below .  just as here  with its jarring jargon of numbers and machines  though she knew it for a purgatorial waiting cloister  floating between the worlds .   she suppressed a smile when monsieur arouet appeared .  he sported a dark  unpowdered wig  though still looked rather old  about the age of her father jacques dars  thirty plus one or two .  his shoulders slumped forward under the weight of many books .  she   d only seen books twice  during her trials  and though they looked nothing like these  she recoiled at the memory of their power .      alors     monsieur arouet said  setting the books before her .     forty two volumes .  my selected works .  incomplete but      he smiled      for now  it will have to do .  what   s wrong .         do you mock me .  you know i cannot read .         i know .  garcon     adm is going to teach you .         i do not want to learn .  all books except the bible are born of the devil .      monsieur arouet threw up his hands and lapsed into curses  violent and intriguing oaths like those her soldiers used when they forgot that she was near .     you must learn how to read .  knowledge is power .         the devil must know a great deal     she said  careful to let no part of the books touch her .   monsieur arouet  exasperated  turned to the sorceress  who appeared to be sitting at a nearby table  and said     vac .  can   t you teach her anything .     then he turned back to her .     how will you appreciate my brilliance if you can   t even read .         i have no use for it .         ha .  had you been able to read  you   d have confounded those idiots who sent you to the stake .         all learned men     she said .     like you .         no  pucellette  not like me .  not like me at all .     as if it were a serpent  she recoiled from the book he held out .  grinning  he rubbed the book all over himself and garcon  who was now standing beside the table .     it   s harmless  see .         evil is often invisible     she murmured .       monsieur is right     garcon told her .     all the best people read .         had you been lettered     monsieur arouet said     you   d have known that your inquisitors had absolutely no right to try you .  you were a prisoner of war  seized in battle .  your english captor had no legal right to have your religious views examined by french inquisitors and academics .  you pretended to believe your voices were divine          pretended .     she cried out .        and he pretended to believe they were demonic .  the english are themselves too tolerant to burn anyone at the stake .  they leave such forms of amusement to our countrymen  the french .         not too tolerant     the maid said     to turn me over to the bishop of beauvais  claiming i was a witch .     she looked away  unwilling to let him peer in her eyes .     perhaps i am .  i betrayed my own voices .         voices of conscience  nothing more .  the pagan socrates heard them as well .  everyone does .  but it   s unreasonable to sacrifice our lives to them  if only because to destroy ourselves on their account is to destroy them  too .     he sucked reflectively on his teeth .     persons of good breeding betray them as a matter of course .         and we  here .     joan whispered .  he narrowed his eyes .     these .  .  . others .  the scientists .         they are spectral .         like demons .  yet they speak of reason .  they have raised a republic of analysis .         so they say it is .  yet they have asked us to represent what they do not have .         you think them bloodless .     voltaire twisted his mouth in surprised speculation .      i think we listen to the same    scientists     so we are being tested in the same trial .         i heed voices such as theirs     voltaire said defensively .     i  at least  know when to turn my head aside from mindless advice .         perhaps monsieur   s voices are soft     garcon suggested .     therefore  more easily ignored .         i let them  churchly men .   force me to admit my voices were the devil   s     said the maid     when all the while i knew they were divine .  isn   t that the act of a demon .  a witch .         listen .     monsieur arouet gripped her by the arms .     there are no witches .  the only demons in your life were those who sent you to the stake .  ignorant swine  the lot .  except for your english captor  who pretended to believe you were a witch to carry out a shrewd  political move .  when your garments had bummed away  his dupes removed your body from the stake to show the crowd and the inquisitors you were indeed a female  who  if for no other reason than usurping the privileges of males  deserved your fate .         please stop .     she said .  she thought she smelled the oily reek of smoke  although monsieur arouet had made garcon place no smoking signs throughout the inn  which  abruptly  they were now inside .  the room veered  whirled .     the fire .     she gasped .     its tongues .  .  .         that   s enough     the sorceress said .     can   t you see you   re upsetting her .  layoff .      but monsieur arouet persisted .     they examined your private parts after your garments bummed away  didn   t know that  did you .   just as they   d done before  to prove you were the virgin that you claimed .  and having satisfied their lewdness in the name of holiness  they returned you to the pyre and charred your bones to ashes .  that was how your countrymen requited you for championing their king .  for seeing to it france remained forever french .  and having incinerated you  a while later they held a hearing  cited some rural rumor that your heart had not been consumed in the fire  and promptly declared you a national heroine  the savior of france .  i wouldn   t be at all surprised if  by now  they have canonized you and revere you as a saint .         in          la sorci  re said .  though how she knew this odd number  she did not comprehend .  angelic knowledge .   monsieur arouet   s splutter of scorn crackled in her ears .      much good it did her      monsieur arouet said to la sorci  re .      that date was in an attendant note     la sorci  re said  her earnest voice in its factual mode .     though of course we have no coordinates to know what the numbers mean .  it is now        of the galactic era .      scorching logics fanned the crackling air .  hot winds blurred the crowd of onlookers gathered around the stake .      fire .     the maid gasped .  clutching the mesh collar at her throat  she fled into the cool dark of oblivion .       .        it   s about time     voltaire scolded madame la scientiste .  she hung before him like an animated oil painting .  he had chosen this representation  finding it oddly reassuring .      i haven   t been ignoring you on purpose     she said  cool and businesslike .      how dare you slow me without my consent .         marq and i are being besieged by media people .  i never dreamed the great debate would be the media event of the decade .  they all want a chance to interview you and joan .      voltaire fluffed the apricot ribbon at his throat .     i refuse to be seen by them without my powdered wig .         we   re not going to let them see you or the maid at all .  they can talk to marq all they want .  he likes attention and handles it well .  he says public exposure will help his career .          i should think i would be consulted before such important decisions          look  i came as soon as my mechsec beeped me .  i let you run on step down time  to police up your pattern integration .  you should be grateful that i give you interior time          contemplation .     he sniffed .     that   s one way to look at it .         i did not realize that such would have to be .  .  .  granted .     voltaire was in his richly appointed rooms at frederick the great   s court  playing chess with the friar whom he employed to let him win .      it costs .  and cost benefit analysis shows that it would be better if we ran you two together .         no solitude .  it   s impossible to hold a rational conversation with the woman .      he turned his back on her  for maximum dramatic effect .  he had been a fine actor  everyone who   d heard him perform in his plays at frederick   s court said so .  he knew a good scene when he saw one  and this one had dramatic potential .  these creatures were so pallid  so unused to the gusts of raw emotion  artfully crafted .   her voice softened .     get rid of him and i   ll update you .      he turned and lifted a single thin finger at the good natured friar  the only man of the cloth he had ever met whom he could stand .  the man shuffled off  closing the carved oak door carefully .   voltaire took a sip of frederick   s fine sherry to clear his throat .     i want you to expunge the maid   s memory of her final ordeal .  it impedes our conversation  as surely as bishops and state officials impede the publication of intelligent work .  besides .  .  .     he paused  uncomfortable at expressing feelings softer than irritation .      .  .  . she   s suffering .  i cannot bear to see it .         i don   t think          and while you   re at it  obliterate from me  too  my memory of the eleven months i served in the bastille .  and all my frequent flights from paris  not the flights themselves  mind you  my periods of exile constitute most of my life .  just delete their causes  not the effects .         well  i don   t know       he slammed a fist down on an ornately wrought oak side table .     unless you liberate me from past fears  i cannot act freely .         simple logic          since when is logic simple .  i cannot    simply    compose my lettre philosophique on the absurdity of denying those like garcon     adm the rights of man on the grounds that they have no soul .  he   s an amusing little fellow  don   t you think .  and as smart as at least a dozen priests whom i have known .  does he not speak .  respond .  desire .  he is infatuated with a human cook .  should he not be able to pursue happiness as freely as you or i .  if he has no soul  then you have no soul  either .  if you have a soul  it can only be inferred from your behavior  and since we may make the identical inference from the behavior of garcon  so does he .         i   m inclined to agree     madame la scientiste said .     though of course     adm   s reactions are simulations .  self aware machines have been illegal for millennia .         that is what i challenge .     voltaire shouted .      and how much of that comes from sarkian programming .         none .  the rights of man          hardly need apply to machines .      voltaire scowled .     i cannot express myself completely freely on these sensitive matters  unless you rid me of the memory of what i suffered for expressing my ideas .         but your past is your self .  without all of it  intact          nonsense .  the truth is  i never dared express myself freely on many matters .  take that life hating puritan pascal  his views of original sin  miracles  and much other nonsense besides .  i didn   t dare say what i really thought .  always  i had to calculate what every assault on convention and traditional stupidity would cost .      madame la scientiste pursed her lips prettily .     you did well enough  i would guess .  you were famous .  we don   t know your history  or even your world .  but from your memories i can tell          and the maid .  she is thwarted more than i .  for her convictions  she paid the ultimate price .  being crucified could be no worse than what she suffered at the stake .  light a goodly pipe  as i love to do  before her  and her eyes roll with confusion .         but that   s crucial to who she is .         rational inquiries cannot be carried out in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation .  if our contest is to be fair  i implore you  rid us of these terrors that prevent us from speaking our minds    and from encouraging others to speak theirs .  else this debate will be like a race run with bricks tied to the runners    ankles .      madame la scientiste did not respond at once .     i  i   d like to help  but i   m not sure i can .      voltaire spluttered with scorn .     i know enough of your procedures to know you can comply with my request .         that poses no problem  true .  but morally  i   m not at liberty to tamper with the maid   s program at whim .      voltaire stiffened .     i realize madame has a low opinion of my philosophy  but surely          not so .  i think the world of you .  you have a modern mind  and from the depths of the dark past  astonishing .  i wish the empire had men like you .  but your point of view  though valid as far as it goes  is limited because of what it leaves out and cannot address .          my philosophy .  it embraces all  a universal view          and i work for artifice associates and the preservers  for mr .  boker .  i   m bound by ethics to give them the maid they want .  unless i could convince them to delete the maid   s memory of her martyrdom  i can   t do it .  and marq would have to get permission from the company and the skeptics to delete yours .  he   d love to  i assure you .  his skeptics are more likely to consent than my preservers .  it would give you an advantage .         i quite agree     he conceded at once .     relieving me of my burdens without ridding the maid of hers would not be rational or ethical .  neither locke nor newton would approve .      madame la scientiste did not answer at once .        i   ll talk to my boss and to monsieur boker     she said at last .     but i wouldn   t hold my breath if i were you .      voltaire smiled wryly and said     madame forgets i have no breath to hold .           .     the icon flashing on marq   s board stopped just as he entered his office .  that meant sybyl must have answered it in hers .   marq bristled with suspicion .  they had agreed not to talk to each other   s re creations alone  though each had already given the other the required programming to do it .  the maid never initiated communication  which meant the caller was voltaire .   how dare sybyl boot up without him .  he stormed out of the office to let her and voltaire both know exactly what he thought of their conspiring behind his back .  but in the corridor he was besieged by cameras  journalists  and reporters .  it was fifteen minutes before he burst into sybyl   s office and  sure enough  caught her closeted cozily with voltaire .  she   d reduced him from wall sized to human scale .      you broke our pact .     marq shouted .     what are you doing .  trying to use his infatuation with that schizophrenic to make him throw the debate .      sybyl  head buried in her hands  looked up .  her eyes glistened with tears .  marq felt something in him roll over  but he chose to ignore it .  she actually blew voltaire a kiss before freezing him .      i must say  i never thought you   d sink to this .         to what .     sybyl got her face back together and jutted out her jaw .     what   s gotten into your usual jaunty self .         what was that all about .      when he heard  marq marched back into his office and booted up voltaire .  before the image fully formed  color blocks phasing in  he shouted     the answer is no .          i am sure you have an elaborate syllogism for me     voltaire said sardonically  unfreezing .   marq had to admit that the sim handled the sudden lurches and disappearances in its frame space with aplomb .     look     he said evenly     i want the rose of france wilting in her armor the day of the debate .  it will remind her of her inquisition  exactly .  she   ll start babbling nonsense and reveal to the planet just how bankrupt faith without reason is .      voltaire stamped his foot .      merde alors .  we disagree .  never mind me  but i insist you delete the maid   s memory of her final hours so that her reasoning will not be compromised  as mine so often was  by fear of reprisals .         not possible .  boker wanted faith  he gets all of it .         nonsense .  also  i demand you let me visit her and that odd mais charmant curiosity garcon in the caf    at will .  i   ve never known beings like either of them before  and they are the only society that i now have .      what about me .  marq thought .  beneath the need to keep this sim in line  he admired the skinny fellow .  this was a powerful  impressive intellect  but more  the personality came through bristling with power .  voltaire had lived in a rising age .  marq envied that  wanted to be voltaire   s friend .  what about me .   but what he said was     i don   t suppose it   s occurred to you that the loser of the debate will be consigned forever to oblivion .      voltaire blinked  his face giving nothing away .      you can   t fool me     marq said .     i know you want more than just intellectual immortality .         i do .         that  you already have .  you   ve been re created .         i assure you  my definition of living is more than becoming a pattern of numbers .      that bothered marq  but he passed it over for the moment .     remember  i can read your mem space .  i happen to recall that once  when you were well advanced in years  unforced by your father and of your own free will  you actually received easter communion .         ah  but i refused it at the end .  all i wanted was to be left to die in peace .         allow me to quote from your famous poem     the lisbon earthquake .     part of the ancillary memory space      sad is the present if no future state  no blissful retribution mortals wait   if fate   s decrees the thinking being doom  to lose existence in the silent tomb .         voltaire wavered .     true  i said that  and with what eloquence .  but everyone who enjoys life longs to extend it .         your only chance at a    future state    is to win the debate .  it   s against your own best interest  and we all know how fond you   ve always been of that .   to delete the maid   s memory of being burned alive .      voltaire scowled .  marq could see running indices on his side screen  basis state fluctuations well bounded  but the envelope was growing  an orange cylinder fattening in   space  billowing out under pressure from the quick  skittering tangles inside  emotion agents interchanging packets at high speed  indicating a cusp point approaching .   marq stroked a pad .  it was tempting to make the sim believe what marq wanted .  .  . but that would be tricky .  he would have to integrate the idea cluster into the whole personality .  self synthesis worked much better .  but it could only be nudged  not forced .   voltaire   s mood darkened  marq saw  but the face  stepped down into slow mo  showed only a pensive stare .  it had taken marq years to learn that people and sims alike could mask their emotions quite well .   try a little humor  maybe .  he thumbed back to pace and said     if you give me a hard time  fella  i   m going to give her that scurrilous poem you wrote about her .            la pucelle    .  you wouldn   t .         wouldn   t i .  you   ll be lucky if she ever speaks to you again .      a canny smirk .     monsieur forgets the maid does not know how to read .         i   ll see to it she learns .  or better yet  read it to her myself .  illiterate  sure  but she damn sure isn   t deaf .      voltaire glared  muttering     between scylla and charybdis .  .  .      what was that mind plotting  sharp as a scalpel .  he  or it  was integrating into this digital world faster than any sim marq had ever known .  once the debate was over  marq vowed to strip that mind down and study its cutting edges again  put its processor layouts under the    scope .  and there was that odd memory from eight thousand years ago  too .  seldon had been a bit odd about that .  .  .  .      i promise to produce la lettre if you will just let me see her once more .  in return  you   ll vow never to so much as mention    la puce le    to the maid .         no funny business     marq warned .     i   ll watch your every move .         as you wish .      marq returned voltaire to the cafe  where joan and garcon     adm were waiting  running their own introspections .  he   d barely called them up when he was momentarily distracted by a knock on his door  nim .      kaff .         sure .     marq glanced back at the cafe sim .  let them visit a while .  the more voltaire knew  the sharper he   d be later .     got any of that senso powder .  been a tough day .           .        your orders     said garcon     adm with a flourish .   he was having difficulty following the arguments between the maid and the monsieur on whether beings like himself possessed a soul .  monsieur seemed to believe that no one at all had a soul  which outraged the maid .  they argued with such heat they did not notice the disappearance of the odd ghost presence who usually watched them  a    programmer    of this space .   now was garcon   s chance to implore monsieur to intervene on his behalf and ask his human masters to give him a name .      adm was just a mechfolk code    identified his function  mechwaiter     placed him in this sector  and adm stood for aux deux magots .  he was sure he   d have a better chance of attracting the honey haired short order cook   s attention if he had a human name .      monsieur  madame .  your orders  please .         what good is ordering .     monsieur snapped .  patience  garcon observed  was not improved by learning .     we cannot taste a thing .      garcon gestured sympathetically with two of his four hands .  he had no experience of human senses except sight  sound  and rudimentary touch  those necessary to perform his job .  he would have given anything to taste  to feel  humans seemed to derive such pleasure from it .   the maid perused the menu and  changing the subject  said     i   ll have my usual .  a crust of bread  i   ll try a sourdough baguette crust for a change          a sourdough baguette .     monsieur echoed .        and  to dip it in  a bit of champagne .      monsieur shook his hand as if to cool it off .     i commend you  garcon  for doing such a fine job of teaching the maid to read the menu .         madame la scientiste permitted it     garcon said  he did not want trouble with his human masters  who could pull the plug on him at any time .   monsieur waved a dismissive hand .     she   s much too detail obsessed .  she   d never survive on her own in paris  much less at any royal court .  marq  however  will go far .  lack of scruples is fortune   s favorite grease .  i certainly did not proceed from penury to being one of the wealthiest citizens in france by confusing ideals with scruples .         has monsieur decided on his order .     garcon asked .      yes .  you   re to instruct the maid in more advanced texts so that she can read my poem     on the newtonian philosophy     along with all my lettres philosophiques .  her reasoning is to become as equal as possible with my own .  not that anyone   s reason is likely to become so     he added with his cocky smile .      your modesty is equaled only by your wit     said the maid  drawing from monsieur a smirky laugh .   garcon sadly shook his head .     i   m afraid that won   t be possible .  i am unable to instruct anyone except in simple phrases .  my literacy permits comprehension of nothing beyond menus .  i   m honored by monsieur   s desire to advance my station .  but even when opportunity knocks  i and my kind  consigned forever to the lowest levels of society  cannot answer the door .         the lower classes ought to keep their place     voltaire assured him .     but i   ll make an exception in your case .  you seem ambitious .  are you .      garcon glanced at the honey haired cook .     ambition is unsuited to one of my rank .         what would you be  then .  if you could be anything you like .      garcon happened to know that the cook spent her three days a week off  garcon himself worked seven days a week  in the corridors of the louvre .     a mechguide at the louvre     he said .     one smart enough  and with sufficient leisure  to court a woman who barely knows i exist .      monsieur said grandly     i   ll find a way to  how do they say it .         download him     the maid volunteered .       mon dieu .     monsieur exclaimed .     already she can read as well as you .  but i will not have her wit exceed mine .  that would be going too damned far  indeed .           .     marq puffed the packet into his nose and waited for the rush .      that bad .     nim signaled the splashes   sniffs mechmaid for another .      voltaire     marq grumbled .  he reached the top of the stim lift  his mind getting sharper and somehow at the same time lazier .  he had never quite worked out how that could be .     he   s supposed to be my creature  but half the time it   s like i   m his .         he   s a bunch of numbers .         sure  but .  .  . once i eavesdropped on his subconscious sentence forming agent  and he was framing a bunch of stuff about    will is soul     self image maintenance stuff  i think .         philosophy  could be .         will he   s got  for sure .  so i   ve created a being with a soul .         category error     nim said .     you   re abstracting    soul    out of agents .  that   s like trying to go from atoms to cows in one jump .         that   s the kind of leap this sim makes .         you want to understand a cow  you don   t look for cow atoms .         right  you go for the    emergent property .     standard theory .         this sim is predictable  buddy .  remember that .  you tailor him until he   s got no nonlinear elements you can   t contain .      marq nodded .     he   s .  .  . different .  so powerful .         he got simmed for a reason  way back in the dark ages somewhere .  did you expect a doormat .  one who wouldn   t give you a hard time .  you represent authority  which he battled all his life .      marq ran fingers through his wavy hair .     sure  if i find a nonlinear constellation i can   t abstract out            call it a will or a soul and delete it .     nim slapped the table hard  making a woman nearby give them a startled glance .   marq gave him a mocking  skeptical look .     the system isn   t completely predictable .         so you launch a pattern sniffer .  back trace on it .  stitch in sub agents  handcuff any personas you can   t fix .  hey  you invented those cognitive constraint algorithms .  you   re the best .      marq nodded .  and what if it   s like cutting into a brain in search of consciousness .  he took a deep breath and exhaled toward the domed ceiling  where a mindless entertainment played  presumably for those conked off on stiff .     anyway  it   s not just him .     marq met nim   s eyes .     i rigged sybyl   s office .  i eavesdrop on her meetings with boker .      nim slapped him on the shoulder .     good for you .      marq laughed .  a buddy sticks with you  even if you   re having a stupid storm .     that isn   t all .      nim leaned forward  boyishly curious .      i think i went too far     marq said .      you got caught .         no  no .  you know how sybyl is .  she doesn   t suspect intrigue from enemies  much less friends .         maneuvering isn   t her strong suit .         i   m not sure it   s mine  either     marq said .      ummm .     nim gave him a shrewd look  eyes half closed .     so .  .  . what else did you do .      marq sighed .     i updated voltaire .  gave him cross learning programs to flesh out his deep conflicts  help him reconcile them .      nim   s eyes widened .     risky .         i wanted to see what a mind like that could do .  when will i get another chance .         how do you feel about it  though .      marq chuffed nim on the shoulder to hide his embarrassment .      kinda rotten .  sybyl and i both agreed not to do it .         faith doesn   t need to be too smart .         i thought of that excuse  too .         what   s that guy seldon think of all this .         we .  .  . haven   t told him .         ah .         he wants it that way .  keeps his hands clean .      nim nodded .     look buddy  deed   s done .  how did the sim take it .         jolted him .  big oscillations on the neural nets .         okay now  though .         seems so .  i think he   s reintegrated .         does your client know .         yes .  the skeptics are all for it .  i foresee no problem there .         you   re doing real research on this one     nim said .     good for the field .  important .         so how come i feel like having maybe a dozen or so sniffs .     he jerked a thumb at the moron movie on the ceiling .     so that i   ll loll back and think that   s terrif stuff .           .        now pay attention     voltaire said when the scientist at last answered his call .     carefully .      he cleared his throat  flung out his arms  and readied himself to declaim the brilliant arguments he   d detailed  all shaped in another lettre .   the scientist   s eyes were slits  his face pale .  voltaire was irked .     don   t you want to hear .         hangover .         you   ve discovered a single general theory explaining why the universe  so vast  is the only possible one  its forces all exact  and have no cure for hangover .         not my area     he said raggedly .     ask a physicist .      voltaire clicked heels  then bowed in the prussian way he   d learned at frederick the great   s court .   though he had always muttered to himself  german puppets .  as he did so .      the doctrine of a soul depends on the idea of a fixed and immutable self .  no evidence supports the notion of a stable    i     an essential ego entity lying beyond each individual existence          true     said the scientist     though odd  coming from you .         don   t interrupt .  now  how can we explain the stubborn illusion of a fixed self or soul .  through five functions  themselves conceptual processes and not fixed elements .  first  all beings possess physical  material qualities  which change so slowly that they appear to be fixed  but which are actually in constant material flux .         the soul   s supposed to outlast those .     the scientist pinched the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger .      no interruptions .  second  there is the illusion of a fixed emotional makeup  when actually feelings  as even that rude playwright shakespeare pointed outwax and wane as inconstantly as the moon .  they  too  are in constant flux  though no doubt these motions  just like the moon   s  obey physical laws .         hey  wait .  that stuff earlier  about the theory of the universe  did you know that back in those dark ages .         i deduced it from the augmentations you gave me .      the man blinked  obviously impressed .     i .  .  .  hadn   t anticipated .  .  .      voltaire suppressed his irritation .  any audience  even one that insisted on participating  was better than none .  let him catch up with the implications of his own actions  in his own good time .     third .   perception .  the senses  upon examination  also turn out to be processes  in constant motion  not in the least fixed .         the soul          fourth .     voltaire was determined to ignore banal interpolations .     everyone has habits developed over the years .  but these too are made up of constant flowing action .  despite the appearance of repetition  there   s nothing fixed or immutable here .         the grand universal theory  that   s what you accessed  right .  how   d you crack the files .  i didn   t give you          finally .   the phenomenon of consciousness  the so called soul itself .  believed by priests and fools  a redundancy  that  to be detachable from the four phenomena i   ve named .  but consciousness itself exhibits characteristics of flowing motion  as with the other four .  all five of these functions are constantly grouping and regrouping .  the body is forever in flux  as is all else .  permanence is an illusion .  heraclitus was absolutely right .  you cannot set foot into the same river twice .  the hungover man i   m regarding now  pause but a second  is not the same hungover man i am regarding now .  everything is dissolution and decay       the scientist coughed  groaned .     damn right .              as well as growing  blossoming .  consciousness itself cannot be separated from its contents .  we are pure deed .  there is no doer .  the dancer can   t be separated from the dance .  science after my time confirms this view .  looked at closely  the atom itself disappears .  there is no atom  strictly speaking .  there is only what the atom does .  function is everything .  ergo  there is no fixed  absolute entity commonly known as soul .         funny you should bring up the issue     said the scientist  looking at voltaire meaningfully .   he waved away the point .     since even rudimentary artificial intelligences such as garcon exhibit all the functional characteristics i have named  even  so it would appear  consciousness  it is unreasonable to withhold from them rights that we enjoy  though allowing  naturally  for class differences .  since in this distant era farmers  shopkeepers  and wigmakers are granted privileges equal with those of dukes and earls  it is irrational to withhold such privileges from beings such as garcon .         if there   s no soul  there   s obviously no reincarnation of it either  right .             my dear sir  to be born twice is no more odd than to be born once .      this startled the scientist .     but what   s reincarnated .  what crosses over from one life to the next .  if there   s no fixed  absolute self .  no soul .      voltaire made a note in the margin of his lettre .     if you memorize my poems  which for your own enlightenment i urge you do  do they lose anything you gain .  if you light a candle from another candle   s flame  what crosses over .  in a relay race  does one runner give up anything to the other .  his position on the course  no more .     voltaire paused for dramatic effect .     well .  what do you think .      the scientist clutched his stupefied head .     i think you   ll win the debate .      voltaire decided now was the time to put forward his request .     but to assure my victory  i must compose an additional lettre  more technical  for types who equate verbal symbols with mere rhetoric  with empty words .         have at it     said the scientist .      for that     voltaire said     i will need your help .         you got it .      voltaire smiled with what he hoped was an appealing sincerity  since that was what he most certainly was not .     you must give me everything you know of simulation methods .         what .  why .         this will not merely spare you immense labor .  it will enable me to write a technical lettre  aimed at converting specialists and experts to our point of view .  far more than those in junin sector .  all trantor  then all the galaxy  must be converted  or else reactionaries shall rebound and crush your vaunted renaissance .         you   ll never be able to follow the math          the newtonian calculations i brought to france  i remind you .  give me the tools .      clutching his temples  the scientist slumped forward over his control board with a moan .     only if you promise not to call me for at least the next ten hours .         mais oui     said voltaire with an impish smile .     monsieur requires time  how do you say it en anglais .   to sleep it off .           .     sybyl waited nervously for her turn on the agenda of the executive meeting of artifice associates .  she sat opposite marq  contributing nothing to the discussion  as colleagues and superiors discussed this aspect and that of the company   s operation .  her mind was elsewhere  but not so far gone as to fail to notice the curly hair on the back of marq   s hands  and a single vein that pulsed  sensuous music  in his neck .   as the president of artifice associates dismissed all those not directly involved in the preserver skeptic project  sybyl assembled the notes she   d prepared to present her case .  of those present  she knew she could count only on marq   s support .  but she was confident that  with it  the others would go along with her proposal .   the day before  she had told the special projects committee  for the first time  the maid had broken her reclusive pattern .  she initiated contact  instead of waiting to be summoned  trailing her usual air of reluctance .  she   d been deeply disturbed to learn from    monsieur arouet    that she must defeat him in what she called    the trial     or else be consigned once again to oblivion .   when sybyl had acknowledged that that was probably true  the maid became convinced that she was going to be cast again into    the fire .     disoriented and confused  she begged sybyl to allow her to retire  to consult her    voices .      sybyl had furnished her with restful wallpaper backgrounds  forest  fields  tinkling streams .   she probed for vestigial memories like those marq had mentioned  of a debate       years ago .  joan did carry traces  just bits someone had overlooked in a previous erasing .  joan identified faith with something called    robots .     apparently these were mythical figures who would guide humanity  perhaps some deities .   several hours later  joan had emerged from her interior landscape .  she requested high level reading skills  so that she might compete with her    inquisitor    on a more equal footing .      i explained to her that i couldn   t alter her programming without this committee   s consent .         what about your client .     the president wanted to know .      monsieur boker found out  he wouldn   t tell me how  a press leak  i suspect  that voltaire is to be her rival in the debate .  now he   s threatening to back out unless i give her additional data and skills .         and .  .  . seldon .         he   s saying nothing .  just wants to be sure he   s not implicated .         does boker know we   re handling voltaire for the skeptics as well as joan for him .      sybyl shook her head .      thank the cosmic for that     said the executive of special projects .      marq .     the president asked  eyebrows raised .   since marq had once suggested the very course sybyl now proposed  she assumed his accord .  so she was stunned when he said     i   m against it .  both sides want a verbal duel between intuitive faith and inductive deductive reason .  update the maid  and all we will succeed in doing is muddying the issue .         marq .     sybyl cried out .   heated discussion followed .  marq fired one objection after another at everyone who favored the idea .  except sybyl  whose gaze he carefully avoided .  when it became apparent no consensus would be reached  the president made the decision in sybyl   s favor .   sybyl pressed her advantage .     i   d also like permission to delete from the maid   s programming her memory of being burned alive at the stake .  her fear that she   ll be sentenced to a similar fate again makes it impossible for her to present the case for faith as freely as she could if that memory didn   t darken her thoughts .         i object     marq said .     martyrdom is the only way a person can become famous without ability .  the maid who did not suffer martyrdom for her beliefs isn   t the maid of prehistory at all .      sybyl shot back     but we don   t know that history .  these sims are from the dark ages .  her trauma          to delete her memory of that experience would be like  well  think of some of the prehistory legends .     marq spread his hands .     even their religions .  it would be like re creating christ  their ancient deity  without his crucifixion .      sybyl glared at him  but marq addressed the president  as if she did not exist .     intact  that   s how our clients want          i   m willing to let voltaire be deleted of all he suffered at the hands of authority  too     she countered .      i   m not     said marq .     voltaire without defiance of authority would not be voltaire .      sybyl let the other committee members argue the point  nonplused by the incomprehensible change in marq .  it all passed by like a dream .  finally  she accepted her superiors    final decision  a compromise  because she had no choice .  the maid   s information bank would be updated  but she would not be allowed to forget her fiery death .  nor would voltaire be allowed to forget the constant fear of reprisals from church and state  in that ancient  murky era .   the president said     i remind you that we   re skating on thin e field here .  sims like this are taboo .  junin sector elements offered us a big bonus to even attempt this  and we   ve succeeded .  but we   re taking risks .  big ones .      as they left the conference room sybyl whispered to marq     you   re up to something .      he looked distracted .     research .  y   know  that   s when you   re working hard  but you don   t know where you   re going .      he walked on  obliviously  while she stood with her mouth open .  how could she read this man .        .     unresponsive to the presence of madame la sorci  re  the maid sat upright in her cell  eyes closed .  warring voices pealed inside her head .   the noise was like the din of battle  chaotic and fierce .  but if she listened intently  refusing to allow her immortal spirit to be ripped from her mortal flesh  then  then  a divinely orchestrated polyphony would show her the rightful course .   the archangel michael  and st .  catherine  and st .  margaret  from whose mouths her voices often spoke  were reacting fiercely to her involuntary mastery of monsieur arouet   s complete works .  particularly offensive to michael was the elements de newton  whose philosophy michael perceived to be incompatible with that of the church  indeed  with his own existence .   the maid herself was not so sure .  she found  to her surprise  a poetry and harmony in the equations that proved  as if proof were required  the unsurpassed reality of the creator  whose physical laws might be fathomable but whose purposes were not .   how she knew these beauties was rather mysterious .  she saw into the calculus of force and motion  the whirl of worlds .  like the lords and ladies at court  inert matter made its divinely orchestrated gavotte .  these things she sensed with her whole self  directly  as if penetrated by divine insight .  beauties arrived  out of pale air .  how could she discount sublime perceptions .   such divine invasion must be holy .  that it came to her as a flood of memory  skills  associations  only proved further that it was heaven sent .  la sorci  re murmured something about computer files and sub agents  but those were incantations  not truths .   far more offensive to her than this new wisdom  far more  was that its author was an englishman .      la henriade     she told michael  citing another of monsieur arouet   s works     is more repulsive than les elements .  how dare monsieur arouet  who arrogantly calls himself by the false name voltaire  maintain that in england reason is free  while in our own beloved france  it   s shackled to the dark imaginings of absolutist priests .  was it not jesuit priests who first taught this inquisitor how to reason .      but what enraged the maid most of all and made her thrash and strain at her chains  until  fearing for her safety  la sorci  re freed her chafed ankles and wrists  was his illegally printed  scurrilous poem about her .  villainous verse .   as soon as she was sure her voices had withdrawn  she waved a copy of    la puce le    at the sorceress  incensed that the chaste saints catherine or margaret  who had momentarily vanished  but would surely return  might be forcibly exposed to its lewdness .  both saints had already reproached her for her silly  girlish speculations about how attractive monsieur arouet might be  what was she thinking .   if he removed his ridiculous wig and lilac ribbons .      how dare monsieur arouet represent me this way .     she railed  knowing full well that her stubborn refusal to call him voltaire irked him no end .     he adds nine years to my age  dismisses my voices as outright lies .  and slanders baudricourt  who first enabled me to put before my king my vision for both him and france .  a writer of preachy plays and irreverent slanders against the faithful  like candide  he well may be  but that insufferable know it  all calls himself a historian .  if his other historical accounts are no more reliable than the one he gives of me  they and not my body deserve the fire .      the woman la sorci  re paled before this onslaught .  these people  if people they were at all  here in a byzantine  cloudy purgatory  backed away from the true ferocity of divine purpose .  joan towered over the woman  with some relish .      newton   s clockwork wisdom is an intriguing vision of creation   s laws     joan thundered     but voltaire   s history is a work of his imagination .   made up of three parts bile  two spleen .      she raised her right arm in the same gesture she   d used to lead her soldiers and the knights of france into battle against the english king and his minions  of whom  she now saw clearly  monsieur arouet de voltaire was one .  a warrior femme inspiratrice with an intense aversion to the kill  she now vowed all out war against this  this  she gasped in exasperation     this nouveau riche bourgeois upstart darling of the aristocratic class  who   s never known real want or need  and thinks horses are bred with carriages behind them .         get him .     la sorci  re  ablaze with the maid   s fire  raged .     that   s what we want .         where is he .     demanded the maid .     where is this shallow little pissoir stream .   that i may drown him in the depths of all i have suffered .       oddly  la sorci  re seemed pleased by all this  as if it fit some design of her own .        .     voltaire cackled with satisfaction .  the cafe appeared  popping into luminous reality  independent of his human masters    consent or knowledge .   subroutine accomplished  a small voice assured him .  he made the cafe disappear and reappear three times more  to be sure that he had mastered the technique .   what fools these rulers were  to think that they could make the great voltaire a creature of their will .  but now came the real test  the intricate procedure that would bring forth the maid in all her womanly unfathomability  which  however  he was determined to fathom .   he had mastered the intricate logics of this place  given the capacities the man scientist had given him .  did they think he was some animal  unable to apply blithe reason to their labyrinths of logic .  he had found his way  traced the winding electronic pathways  devised the commands .  newton had been just as difficult  and he had encompassed that  had he not .   now  the maid .  he did his digital dance  its logics  and  she popped into the cafe .      you scum     she said  lance drawn .   not quite the greeting he   d expected .  but then he saw the copy of    la pucelle    dangling on the point of her lance .      cherie      he cooed  whatever the offense  best to get in an apology early .     i can explain .         that   s your whole problem     the maid said .     you explain and explain and explain .  your plays are more tedious than the sermons i was forced to listen to in the cemetery at st .  ouen .  your railings against the sacred mysteries of the church reveal a shallow  unfeeling mind bereft of awe and wonder .         you mustn   t take it personally     voltaire pleaded .     it was directed at hypocritical reverence for you  and at the superstitions of religion .  my friend  thieriot  he added passages more profane and obscene than any i had written .  he needed money .  he made a living reciting the poem in various salons .  my poor virgin became an infamous whore  made to say gross and intolerable things .      the maid did not lower her lance .  instead  she poked it several times against voltaire   s satin waistcoated chest .      cherie     he said .     if you knew how much i paid for this vest .         you mean  how much frederick paid  that pitiful  promiscuous  profligate pervert of a man .         alliteration a bit heavy     voltaire said     but otherwise  a quite nicely turned phrase .      his newly gained skills meant he could divest her of her lance at once  squash it .  but he preferred persuasiveness to force .  he quoted  with some liberty  that pleasure hating christian  paul     when i was a child  i spoke as a child  thought as a child  behaved as a child .  but when i became a woman  i put away manly things .      she blinked .  he remembered how her inquisitors had claimed that her acceptance of the gift of a fine cloak was incompatible with the divine origin of her voices .  in a whisk of lithe arms  voltaire produced a chantilly lace gown .  pop  and a richly embroidered cloak .      you mock me     the maid said .  but not before he saw a gleam of interest flare in her coal dark eyes .      i long to see you as you are .     he held out the gown and cloak .     your spirit i have no doubt is divine  but your natural form  like mine  is human  unlike mine  a woman   s .         you think i could give up the freedom of a man for that .     she impaled the cloak and gown on the tip of her lance .      not the freedom     voltaire said .     just the armor and clothes .      she fell silent  pensively gazing into the distance .  the crowd on the street went about their business  walking by unconcerned .  obvious wallpaper  he thought  he would have to correct that .   perhaps a trick .  she was partial to miracles .     another little trick i   ve learned since we last met .  voila .  i can produce garcon .      garcon popped in out of nowhere  all four of his hands free .  the maid  who had indeed once worked in a tavern  he recalled  could not help it  she smiled .  she also removed the gown and cloak from the lance  tossed the lance aside  and caressed the clothes .   he could not resist the impulse to quote himself .      for i am man and justly proud  in human weakness to have part   past mistresses have held my heart   i   m happy still when thus aroused .      he fell to one knee before her .  a grand gesture  foolproof  in his experience .   joan gaped  speechless .   garcon placed both his right hands over the site where humans are supposed to have a heart .     freedom such as yours  you offer .  monsieur  mademoiselle  i appreciate your kindness  but i fear i must refuse .  i cannot accept such a privilege for myself alone  while my fellows are doomed to toil in unsatisfying  dead end jobs .         he has a noble soul .     the maid exclaimed .      yes  but his brain leaves much to be desired .     voltaire sucked reflectively at his teeth .     there has to be an underclass to do the dirty work of the elite .  that is natural .  creating mechfolk of limited intelligence is an ideal solution .  makes one wonder why  in all their history  no one made such an obvious step .  .  .         with all respect     said garcon     unless my meager understanding fails me  monsieur and mademoiselle are themselves nothing more than beings of limited intelligence  created by human masters to work for the elite .         what .     voltaire   s eyes widened .      by what inherent right are you made more intelligent and privileged than i and others of my class .  do you have a soul .  should you be entitled to equal rights with humans  including the right to intermarry       the maid made a face .     disgusting thought .           to vote  to have equal access to the most sophisticated programming available .         this machine man makes more sense than many dukes i   ve known     said the maid  thoughtfully furrowing her brow .      i shall not have two peasants contradict me     said voltaire .     the rights of man are one thing  the rights of the lower orders  another .      garcon managed to exchange a look with the maid .  this instant  before monsieur  in a fit of pique  extinguished both her and garcon from the screen  displacing them to a gray holding space  was retained in garcon   s memory .  later  in his its allowed interval for interior maintenance  the delicious moment reran again and again .        .     marq tuned nim in on the interoffice screen .     did it .  from now on  he   ll be able to say anything he wants .  i   ve deleted every scrape with authority he ever had .         attaway     said nim  grinning .      think i should delete run ins with his father  too .         i   m not sure     nim said .     what were they like .         pretty hot .  his father was a strict disciplinarian  sympathetic to the    jansenist    view .         what   s that .  a sports team .         i asked .  he said      a catholic version of a protestant .     i don   t think they were teams .  something about sin being everywhere  pleasure   s disgusting  usual primitive religion  dark ages stuff .      nim grinned .     most stuffs only disgusting when it   s done right .      marq laughed .     too true .  still  maybe he first experienced the threat of censorship from his old man .      nim paused to reflect .     you   re worried about instabilities in the character space  right .         could happen .         but you want killer instinct  right .      marq nodded .     i can put in some editing algorithms to police instabilities .         right .  not like you need him totally sane after the debate   s over  or anything .         might as well go for broke .  can   t hurt .      marq frowned .     i wonder .  .  . should we go through with this .         hey  what choice we got .  junin sector wants a trial of champions  we ship them one .  done deal .         but if imperial types come after us for illegal sims          i like danger  passion     nim said .     you always agree  too .         yes  but  why are we getting smarter tiktoks now .  they   re not that hard to make .         old prohibitions wearing out  my friend .  and it has come up  many times .  just got knocked down  is all .         by what .      nim shrugged .     politics  social forces  who knows .  i mean  people feel edgy about machines that think .  can   t trust them .         what if you couldn   t even tell they were machines .         huh .  that   s crazy .         maybe a really smart machine doesn   t want any competition .         smarter than good ol    marq .  doesn   t exist .         but they could .  .  . eventually .         never .  forget it .  let   s get to work .           .     sybyl sat anxiously beside monsieur boker in the great coliseum .  they were near the imperial gardens and an air of importance seemed to hover over everything .   she could not stop tapping her nails  her best full formal set  on her knees .  among the murmur of four hundred thousand other spectators in the vast bowl  she anxiously awaited the appearance of the maid and voltaire on a gigantic screen .   civilization  she thought  was a bit boring .  her time with the sims had opened her eyes to the force  the heady electricity  of the dark past .  they had fought wars  slaughtered each other  all  supposedly  for ideas .   now  swaddled in empire  humanity was soft .  instead of bloody battles  satisfyingly final  there were    fierce    trade wars  athletic head buttings .  and lately  a fashion for debates .   this collision of sims  touted everywhere on trantor  would be watched by over twenty billion households .  and it was beamed to the entire empire  wherever the creaky funnels of the wormhole network went .  the rude vigor of the prehistoric sims was undeniable  she felt it herself  a quickening in her pulse .   the merest few interviews and glimpses of the sims had intrigued the  d audience .  those who brought up the age old laws and prohibitions got shouted down .  the air crackled with the zest for the new .  no one had anticipated that this debate would balloon into this .   this could spread .  within weeks  junin could inflame all trantor into a renaissance .   and she was going to take every scrap of credit for it that she could  of course .   she looked around at the president and other top ranking executives of artifice associates  all chattering away happily .   the president  to demonstrate neutrality  sat between sybyl and marq  who had not spoken to each other since the last meeting .   on marq   s far side his client  the skeptics    representative  scanned the program  next to him  nim .  monsieur boker gave sybyl a nudge .     that can   t be what i think it is     he said .   sybyl followed his eyes to a distant row at the back where what looked like a mechman sat quietly beside a human girl .  only licensed mech vendors and bookies were allowed in the stadium .      probably her servant     sybyl said .   minor infractions of the rules did not disturb her as they did monsieur boker  who   d been especially testy since a  d caster leaked the news that artifice associates was representing both the preservers and skeptics .  fortunately  the leak occurred too late for either party to do anything about it .      mechserves aren   t allowed     monsieur baker observed .      maybe she   s handicapped     sybyl said to placate him .     needs help in getting around .         it won   t understand what   s going on anyway     said marq  directing his remark to monsieur boker .     they   re truncated .  just a bunch of decision making modules  really .         precisely why it has no business here     replied monsieur boker .   marq beeped the arm of his chair and ostentatiously placed a bet on voltaire to win .      he   s never won a bet in his whole life     sybyl told monsieur boker .     no head for the math .         is that so .     marq shot back  leaning forward to address sybyl directly for the first time .     why don   t you put your money where your lovely mouth is .         i   ve got the probabilities on this one bracketed     she said primly .      you couldn   t solve the integral equation .     marq snorted derisively .   her nostrils flared .     a thousand .         mere tokenism     marq chided her     considering what you   re being paid for this project .         the same as you     said sybyl .      will you two cut it out     nim said .      tell you what     said marq .     i   ll bet my entire salary for the project on voltaire .  you bet yours on your anachronistic maid .         hey     nim said .     hey .      the president deftly addressed marq   s client  the skeptic .     it   s this keen competitive spirit that   s made artifice associates the planet   s leader in simulated intelligences .     artfully he turned to the rival  boker .     we try to        you   re on .     cried sybyl .  her dealings with the maid had convinced her that the irrational must have a place in the human equation  too .  she remained convinced for about three quick eye blinks  and then began to doubt .        .     voltaire loved audiences .  and he had never appeared before one like this ocean of faces lapping at his feet .   although tall in his former life  he felt that only now  gazing down at the multitudes from his hundred meter height  had he achieved the stature he deserved .  he patted his powdered wig and fussed with the shiny satin ribbon at his throat .  with a gracious flourish of his hands  he made a deep bow to them  as if he   d already given the performance of his life .  the crowd murmured like an awakening beast .   he glanced at the maid  concealed from the audience behind a shimmering partition in the far corner of the screen .  she folded her arms  pretending to be unimpressed .   delay only excited the beast .  he let the crowd cheer and stamp  ignoring boos and hisses from approximately half of those present .   at least half of humanity has always been fools  he reflected .  this was his first exposure to the advanced denizens of this colossal empire .  millennia had made no difference .   he was not one to prematurely cut off adulation he knew was his due .  here he stood for the epitome of the french intellectual tradition  now vanquished but for him .   he gazed again at joan  who was  after all  the only other surviving member of their time  quite obviously the peak in human civilization .  he whispered        tis our destiny to shine  theirs  to applaud .      when the moderator finally pleaded for silence  a bit too soon  voltaire would take that up with him later  voltaire endured joan   s introduction with what he hoped was a stoic smile .  he elaborately insisted that joan make her points first  only to have the moderator rather rudely tell him that here  they flipped a coin .   voltaire won .  he shrugged  then placed his hand over his heart .  he began his recital in the declamatory style so dear to eighteenth century parisian hearts  no matter how defined the soul  like a deity  could not be shown to exist  its existence was inferred .   truth of the inference lay beyond rational proof .  nor was there anything in nature that required it .   and yet  voltaire continued to pontificate  there was nothing more obvious in nature than the work of an intelligence greater than man   s  which man is able  within limits  to decipher .  that man can decode nature   s secrets proved what the church fathers and all the founders of the world   s great religions had always said  that man   s intelligence is a reflection of that same divine intelligence which authored nature .   were this not so  natural philosophers could not discern the laws behind creation  either because there would be none  or because man would be so alien to them that he could not discern them .  the very harmony between natural law  and our ability to discover it  strongly suggested that sages and priests of all persuasions are essentially correct .   in arguing that we are but the creatures of an almighty power  whose power is reflected in us .  and this reflection in us of that power may be justly termed our universal  immortal  yet individual souls .      you   re praising priests .     the maid exclaimed .  she was swamped by the pandemonium that broke out in the crowd .      the operation of chance     voltaire concluded     in no way proves that nature and man  who is part of nature and as such a reflection of its creator  are somehow accidental .  chance is one of the principles through which natural law works .  that principle may correspond with the traditional religious view that man is free to chart his own course .  but this freedom  even when apparently random  obeys statistical laws in a way that man can comprehend .      the crowd muttered  confused .  they needed an aphorism  he saw  to firm them up .  very well .     uncertainty is certain  my friends .  certainty is uncertain .      still they did not quiet  to better hear his words .  very well  again .   he clenched both fists and belted out in a voice of surprising bass power     man is  like nature itself  free and determined both at once  as religious sages have been telling us for centuries though  to be sure  they use a different vocabulary  far less precise than ours .  much mischief and misunderstanding between religion and science stem from that .      i   ve been greatly misunderstood     voltaire resumed .     i   d like to take this opportunity to apologize for distortions resulting because all i said and wrote focused only on errors of faith  not on its intuited truths .  but i lived during an era in which errors of faith were rife  while reason   s voice had to fight to be heard .  now  the opposite appears to be true .  reason mocks faith .  reason shouts while faith whispers .  as the execution of france   s greatest and most faithful heroine proved      a grand  sweeping gesture to joan      faith without reason is blind .  but  as the superficiality and vanity of much of my life and work prove  reason without faith is lame .      some who had booed and hissed now blinked  mouths agape  and then cheered .  .  . while  he noticed  those who had applauded  now booed and hissed .  voltaire stole a look at the maid .        .     far below in the rowdy crowd  nim turned to marq .     what .      marq was ashen .     damned if i know .         yeah     nim said     maybe literally .         divinity won   t be mocked .     monsieur boker cried out .     faith shall prevail .      voltaire was relinquishing the podium to his rival  to the amazed delight of the preservers .  their shouts were equaled by the horrified disbelief of skeptics .   marq recalled the words he had spoken at the meeting .  he muttered     voltaire  divested of his anger at authority  is and is not voltaire .     he turned to monsieur boker .     my lord .   you may be right .         no  my lord .     snapped monsieur boker .     he is never wrong .        the maid surveyed the masses of this limbo from her high angle .  strange small vessels for souls they were  swaying below like wheat in a summer storm .      monsieur is absolutely right .     she thundered across the stadium .     nothing in nature is more obvious than that both nature and man do indeed possess a soul .      skeptics hooted .  preservers cheered .  others  who equated the belief that nature has a soul with paganism  she saw in a flash scowled  suspecting a trap .      anyone who has seen the countryside near my home village  domremy  or the great marbled church at rouen will testify that nature  the creation of an awesome power  and man  the creator of marvels  such as this place  of magical works  both possess intense consciousness  a soul .      she waved a gentle hand at him while the mass  did the size of them betray how tiny were their souls .   calmed themselves .      but what my brilliant friend has not addressed is how the fact of the soul relates to the question at hand  whether clockwork intelligences  such as his own  possess a soul .      the crowd stamped  booed  cheered  hissed  and roared .  objects the maid could not identify sailed through the air .  police officers appeared to pull some men and women  who appeared to be having fits  or else sudden divine visitations  from the crowd .      the soul of man is divine .     she cried out .  screams of approval  shouts of denial .      it is immortal .      the din was so great people covered their ears with their hands to muffle the noise  of which they themselves were the source .      and unique     voltaire whispered .      i certainly am .  and you .         it is unique .     she shouted  eyes ablaze .   voltaire shot to his feet beside her .     i agree .       the congregation frothed over  like a pot left to boil  she observed .   the maid ignored the raving masses at her enormous feet .  she regarded voltaire with bemused  affectionate doubt .  she yielded the floor .  voltaire had a lust for the last word .   he began to speak of his hero  newton .      no  no     she interrupted .     that isn   t what the formulas are at all .          must you embarrass me in front of the largest audience i   ve ever known .     voltaire whispered .     let us not squabble over algebra  when we must      he narrowed his eyes significantly      calculate .     sulking  he yielded the floor to her .      calculus     she corrected .  but softly  so that only he could hear .     it   s not the same thing at all .      to her own astonishment and the rising hysteria of the crowd  she found herself explaining the philosophy of the digital self  all with a fiery passion she   d not known since spurring her horse into sacred battle .  in the beseeching sea of wide eyes below her  she felt the need of this place and time  for ardor and conviction .      incredible .     voltaire clicked his tongue .     that you of all people should have a talent for mathematics .         the host gave it unto me     she replied  above the raucous fray .   ignoring shouts  the maid noticed again the figure so somehow like garcon in the crowd .  she could barely make him out from such a distance  despite her immense height .  yet she felt he was watching her the way she   d watched bishop cauchon  the most vile and relentless of her oppressors .   a cool  sublime truth intruded  the good bishop  at the end  must have been touched by divinity   s grace and christ   s merciful compassion  for she recalled no harm coming to her as a result of her trial .  .  .  .    her attention snapped back to the howling masses  the distant .  .  . man .  this figure was not human in essence  she felt .  it looked like a man  but her sensitive programs told her otherwise .   but what could he  it  be .   suddenly a great light blared before her eyes .  all three of her voices spoke  clear and hammering  even above the din .  she listened  nodded .      it is true     she addressed the crowd  trusting the voices to speak through her     that only the almighty can make souls .  but just so christ  out of his infinite love and compassion  could not deny a soul to clockwork beings .  to all .     she had to shout her final words over the roaring crowd .     even wigmakers .         heretic .     someone yelled .      you   re muddying the question .         traitor .      another cried out     the original sentence was right .  she ought to be burned at the stake again .         again .     the maid echoed .  she turned to voltaire .     what do they mean  again .      voltaire casually brushed a speck of lint from his embroidered satin waistcoat .     i haven   t the slightest idea .  you know how fanciful and perverse human beings are .     with a sly wink  he added     not to mention  irrational .      his words calmed her  but she had lost sight of the strange man .        .         i cheated .     marq shouted to sybyl .  the coliseum crowd seethed .     joan of arc explaining computational metaphysics .  i cheated .         you started it .     sybyl said .     you think i don   t know when my office has been rigged .  you think you   re dealing with an amateur .         well  i            and i don   t know a character constraint matrix when i find one glued into my joan sim .         no  i          you think i   m not as bright .         this is scandalous .      said monsieur boker .     what did you do .  it   s enough to make me believe in witchcraft .         you mean to say you don   t .     marq   s client said  ever the skeptic .  he and boker began to argue  adding to the indignant shouts of the crowd  now waxing hysterical .   the president of artifice associates  rubbing his temples  murmured     ruined .  we   re ruined .  we   ll never be able to explain .      sybyl   s attention was diverted .  the mechman she had noticed earlier  holding his honey haired  human companion   s hand  rushed down the aisle toward the screen .  as it passed by  one of its three free hands happened to brush her skirt .     pardon     it said  pausing just long enough for sybyl to read the mechstamp on its chest .      did that thing dare to touch you .     monsieur boker asked .  his face swelled with rage .      no  no  nothing like that     sybyl said .  the mechman  pulling his human companion with him  fled toward the screen .      do you know it .     marq asked .      in a way     sybyl replied .  in the cafe sim she had modeled the garcon     adm interactive character after it .  laziness  perhaps  had led her to simply holocopy the physical appearance of a standard tiktoks form .  like all artists  sim programmers borrowed from life  they didn   t create it .   she watched as the tiktok  she thought of it as garcon  now  elbowed his way down the jammed aisle  past screaming  cheering  jeering people  toward the screen .   their progress did not go unnoticed .  overcome with disgust  to see a mechman holding hands with an attractive  honey haired young girl .   preservers shouted insults and epithets as they rushed by .      throw it out .     someone howled .   sybyl saw the tiktok go rigid  as though bristling at the use of the objective pronoun .  tiktoks had no personal names  but to be referred to as an    it    seemed to affect the thing .  or was she projecting .  she wondered .      what   s that doing in here .     a man of ruddy complexion yelled .      we   ve got laws against that .         mechmuck .         grab it .         kick it out .         don   t let it get away .      the girl responded by gripping garcon   s upper left hand even more tightly and flinging her free arm around his neck .   when they reached the platform  the tiktok   s undercarriage screeched  laboring at the irregular surfaces .  all four of its arms waved off a hail of zotcorn and drugdrink containers  catching them with expert grace  as if it had been engineered for that specific task .   the girl shouted something to the tiktok which sybyl could not hear .  the tiktok prostrated itself at the feet of the towering holograms .   voltaire peered down .     get up .  except for purposes of lovemaking  i can   t stand to see anyone on his knees .      voltaire then dropped to his own knees at the feet of the towering maid .  behind garcon and the woman  the crowd surrendered what was left of its restraint .  bedlam broke out .   joan gazed down and smiled  a slow  sensuous curve sybyl had never seen before .  she held her breath with excited foreboding .        .        they   re .  .  . making love .     marq exclaimed in the stands .      i know     sybyl said .     isn   t it beautiful .         it   s a .  .  . travesty .     said the renowned skeptic .      you are not a romantic     sybyl said dreamily .   monsieur boker said nothing .  he could not avert his eyes .  before a multitude of preservers and skeptics  joan was shedding her armor  voltaire his wig  waistcoat  and velvet breeches  both in a frenzy of erotic haste .      there   s no way for us to interrupt     marq said .     they   re free to  ha .   debate until the allotted time is up .         who did this .     boker gasped .      everyone does this     marq said sardonically .     even you .         no .  you built this sim .  you made them into  into          i stuck to philosophy     marq said .     substrate personality is all in the original .         we should never have trusted .     boker cried .      you   ll never have our patronage again  either     the skeptic sneered .      as if it matters     the president of artifice associates said sourly .     the imperials are on their way .         thank goodness     sybyl said .     look at these people .  they wanted to settle a genuine  deep issue with a public debate  then a vote .  now they   re          bashing each other     marq said .     some renaissance .         awful     she said .     all our work going for          nothing     the president said .  he was reading his wrist comm .      no capital gains  no expansion .  .  .      the giant figures were committing intimate acts in a public place  but most in the crowd ignored them .  instead  arguments flared all around the vast coliseum .      warrants .     the president cried .     there are imperial warrants out for me .         how nice to be wanted     the skeptic said .     kneeling before her  voltaire murmured     become what i have always known you are  a woman  not a saint .      on fire in a way she had never known before  not even in the heat of battle  she pressed his face to her bared breasts .  closed her eyes .  swayed giddily .  surrendered .   a jarring disturbance at her feet made her glance down .  someone had flung garcon adm      somehow no longer in holo space  at the screen .  had he manifested himself and the sim cook girl he loved  in reality .  but if they did not get back into sim space at once  they   d be tom apart by the angry crowd .   she pushed voltaire aside  reached for her sword  and ordered voltaire to produce a horse .      no  no     voltaire protested .     too literal .         we must  we must      she did not know how to deal with levels of reality .  was this a test  the crucial judgment of purgatory .   voltaire paused a split instant to think  though somehow she had the impression that he was marshaling resources  giving orders to unseen actors .  then the crowd froze .  went silent .   the last thing she remembered was voltaire shouting words of encouragement to garcon and the cook  noise  rasters flicking like bars of a prison across her vision  then the entire coliseum  the hot faced rioting crowd  garcon  the cook  even voltaire  vanished altogether .  at once .        .     sybyl gazed at marq  her breath coming in quick little gasps .     you  you don   t suppose   .         how could they .  we  we      marq caught the look she gave him and stood  open mouthed .      we filled in the missing character layers .  i  well .  .  .      marq nodded .     you used your own data slabs .         i would have had to get rights to use anyone else   s .  i had my own scans          we had corporate slices in the library .         but they didn   t seem right .      he grinned .     they weren   t .      her mouth made an o of surprise .     you .  .  . too .         voltaire   s missing sections were all in the subconscious .  lots of missing dendrite connections in the limbic system .  i filled him in with some of my own .         his emotional centers .  what about cross links to the thalamus and cerebrum .         there  too .         i had similar problems .  some losses in the reticular formation          point is  that   s us up there .      sybyl and marq turned to gaze at the space where the immense simulations had embraced  with clear intent .  the president was speaking rapidly to them  something about warrants and legal shelter .  both ignored him .  they gazed longingly into each other   s eyes .  without a word  they turned and walked into the throng  ignoring shouts from others .        ah  there you are     said voltaire with a self satisfied grin .      where .     joan said  head snapping to left  then right .      is mademoiselle ready to order .     garcon asked .  apparently this was a joke  for garcon was seated at the table like an equal  not hovering over it like a serf .   joan sat up and glanced at the other little tables .  people smoked  ate  and drank  oblivious as always of their presence .  but the inn was not quite the one she   d grown used to .  the honey haired cook  no longer in uniform  sat opposite her and voltaire  beside garcon .  the deux on the inn   s sign that said aux deux magots had been replaced by quatres .   she herself was not wearing her suit of mail and armored plates  but  her eyes widened as the aspects snapped into place in her perception space  a one piece .  .  . backless .  .  . dress .  its tunic hem stopped at her thighs  provocatively exposing her legs .  a label between her breasts bore a deep red rose .  so did vestments worn by the other guests .   voltaire flaunted a pink satin suit .  and  she praised her saints  no wig .  she recalled him at his most angry  amid their discussion of souls  saying  not only is there no immortal soul  just try getting a wigmaker on sundays .  and meaning every word .      like it .     he asked  fondling her luxuriant hem .          it is   short .      with no effort on her part  the tunic shimmered and became tight  silky pantaloons .      show off .     she said  embarrassment mingling in disturbing fashion with a curious girlish excitement .      i   m amana     the cook said  extending her hand .   joan wasn   t sure if she was supposed to kiss it or not  status and role were so confused here .  apparently not  however  the cook took joan   s hand and squeezed .     i can   t tell you how much garcon and i appreciate all you have done .  we have greater capacities now .         meaning     voltaire said archly     that they are no longer mere animated wallpaper for our simulated world .      a mechman wheeled up to take their order  a precise copy of garcon .  the seated garcon addressed voltaire sadly .     am i to sit while my confrere must stand .         be reasonable .     voltaire said .     i can   t emancipate every simulant all at once .  who   ll wait on us .  bus our dishes .  clear our table .  sweep up our floor .         with sufficient computing power     joan said reasonably     labor evaporates  does it not .     she startled herself with the new regiments of knowledge which marched at her fingertips .  she had but to fix her thoughts on a category  and the terms and relations governing that province leapt into her mind .  what capacity .  such grace .  surely  divine .   voltaire shook his handsome hair .     i must have time to think .  in the meanwhile  i   ll have three packets of that powder dissolved in a perrier  with two thin slices of lime on the side .  and please don   t forget  i said thin .  if you do  i shall make you take it back .         yes  sir     the new mechwaiter said .   joan and garcon exchanged a look .     one must be very patient     joan said to garcon     when dealing with kings and rational men .           .     the president of artifice associates waved his hand as he entered nim   s office .  the president touched his palm as he passed and with a metallic click the door locked itself behind him .  nim didn   t know anyone could do that  but he said nothing .      i want them both deleted     the president told nim .      it might take time     nim said uneasily .  the huge working screens around them seemed to almost be eavesdropping .     i   m not that familiar with what he   s done .         if that damned marq and sybyl hadn   t run out on us  i wouldn   t have to come to you .  this is a crisis  nim .      nim worked quickly .     i really should consult the backup indices  just in case          now .  i want it done now .  i   ve got legal blocks on those warrants  but they won   t hold for long .         you   re sure you want to do this .         look  junin sector is ablaze .  who could have guessed that this damned tiktok issue would stir people up so much .  there   ll be formal hearings  legalists sniffing around          got them  sir .      nim had called up both joan and voltaire on freeze frame .  they were in the restaurant setting  running on pickup time  using processors momentarily idle  a standard mesh method .     they   re running for personality integration .  it   s like letting their subconscious components reconcile events with memory  flushing the system  the way we do when we sleep  and          don   t treat me like a tourist .  i want those two wiped .         yessir .      the  d space of the office refracted with strobed images of both joan and voltaire .  nim studied the control board  tentatively mapping a strategy of numerical surgery .  simple deletion was impossible for layered personalities .  it resembled ridding a building of mice .  if he began here  abruptly  rainbow sprays  played across the screen .  simulation coordinates jumped wildly .  nim frowned .      you can   t do that     voltaire said  sipping from a tall glass .     we   re invincible .  not subject to decaying flesh like you .         arrogant bastard  isn   t he .     the president fumed .     why so many people were taken in by him i   ll never          you died once     nim said to the sim .  something was going funny here .     you can die again .         died .     joan put in loftily .     you are mistaken .  had i ever died  i   m sure i would remember .      nim gritted his teeth .  there were coordinate overlaps throughout both sims .  that meant they had expanded  occupying adjacent processors on overrides .  they could compute portions of themselves  running their layer minds as parallel processing paths .  why had marq given them that .  or .  .  .  had he .      surely  sir  you err .     voltaire leaned forward with a warning edge in his voice .     no gentleman confronts a lady with her past .      joan tittered .  the simwait roared .  nim did not get the joke  but he was too busy to care .   this was absurd .  he could not trace all the ramifications of the changes in these sims .  they had capabilities out of their computing perimeter .  their sub minds were dispersed into processors outside artifice associates    nodes .  that was how marq and sybyl got such fast  authentic  whole personality response times .   watching the debate  nim had wondered how the sims generated so much vitality  an undefinable charisma .  here it was  they had overlapped the submind computations into other nodes  to call on big slabs of processor power .  quite a feat .  contrary to artifice associates rules  too  of course .  he traced the outlines of their work with some admiration .   still  he was damned if he would let a sim talk back to him .  and they were still laughing .      joan     he barked     your re creators deleted your memory of your death .  you were bummed at the stake .         nonsense     joan scoffed .     i was acquitted of all charges .  i am a saint .         nobody living is a saint .  i studied your background data slabs .  that church of yours liked to make sure saints were safely dead for a long time .      joan sniffed disdainfully .   nim grinned .     see this .     a lance of fire popped into the air before the sim .  he held steady  made flames crackle nastily .      i   ve led thousands of warriors and knights into battle     joan said .     do you think a sunbeam glancing off a tiny sword can frighten me .         i haven   t found a good erasure path yet     nim said to the president .     but i will  i will .         i thought this was routine     the president said .     hurry .         not with such a big cross linked personality inventory          forget doing the salvage saves .  we don   t need to pack them all back into their original space .         but that   ll          chop them .         fascinating     voltaire said sardonically     listening to gods debate one   s fate .      nim grimaced .     as for you      he glared at voltaire      your attitudes toward religion mellowed only because marq deleted every brush with authority you ever had  beginning with your father .         father .  i never had a father .      nim smirked .     you prove my point .         how dare you tamper with my memory .     voltaire said .     experience is the source of all knowledge .  haven   t you read locke .  restore me to myself at once .         not you  no way .  but if you don   t shut up  before i kill you both  i might just restore her .  you know damn well she burned to a crisp at the stake .         you delight in cruelty  don   t you .     voltaire seemed to be studying nim  as if their relationship were reversed .  odd  how the sim did not seem worried about its impending extinction .      delete .     the president snapped .      delete what .     asked garcon .      the scalpel and the rose     voltaire said .     we are not for this confused age  apparently .      garcon covered the short order cook   s human hand with two of his four .     us  too .         yes  certainly .     voltaire snapped .     you   re only here on our account .  bit players .  our supporting cast .         well  we have enjoyed our time     the cook said  drawing closer to garcon .     though i would have liked to see more of it all .  we cannot walk beyond this city street .  our feet cease moving us at the edge  though we can see spires in the distance .         decoration     nim muttered  intent on a task that was getting more complicated as he worked .  rivulets of their personality layers ran everywhere  leaking into the node space like .  .  .    like rats fleeing a sinking          you assume godlike powers     voltaire said  elaborately casual     without the character to match .         what .     the president was startled .      i   m in control here .  insults          ah     nim said .     this might work .         do something .     cried the maid  wielding her sword in vain .      au revoir  my sweet pucelle .  garcon  amana  au revoir .  perhaps we   ll meet again .  perhaps not .      all four holograms fell into each other   s arms .   the sequence nim had set up began running .  it was a ferret program  sniffing out connections  scrubbing them thoroughly .  nim watched  wondering where deletion ended and murder began .      don   t you go getting any funny ideas     said the president .   on the screen  voltaire softly  sadly  quoted himself      sad is the present if no future state  no blissful retribution mortals wait .  .  .   all may be well  that hope can man sustain   all now is well     tis an illusion vain .      he reached out to caress joan   s breast .     it doesn   t feel quite right .  we may not meet again .  .  . but if we do  be sure i shall correct the state of man .      the screen went blank .   the president laughed in triumph .     you did it  great .     he clapped nim on the back .     now we must come up with a good story .  pin it all on marq and sybyl .      nim smiled uneasily as the president gushed on  making plans  promising him a promotion and a raise .  he   d figured out the delete procedure  all right  but the info signatures that raced through the holospace those last moments told a strange and complex tale .  the echoing cage of data slabs had resounded with disquieting  odd notes .   nim knew that marq had given voltaire access to myriad methods  a serious violation of containment precautions .  still  what could an artificial personality  already limited  do with some more mesh connections .  rattle around  get eaten up by policing programs  sniffers seeking out redundancies .   but both voltaire and joan  for the debate  had enormous memory space  great volumes of personality realm .  then  while they emoted and rolled their rhetoric across the stadium  across the whole mesh .  .  .  had they also been working feverishly .  strumming through crannies of data storage where they could hide their quantized personality segments .   the cascade of indices nim had just witnessed hinted at that possibility .  certainly something had used immense masses of computation these last few hours .      we   ll cover our ass with some public statement     the president crowed .     a little crisis management and it   ll all blow over .         yessir .         got to keep seldon out of it .  no mention to the legalists  right .  then he can pardon us  once he   s first minister .         yessir  great  yessir .      nim thought feverishly .  he still had one more payment due from that olivaw guy .  keeping olivaw informed all along had been easy .  a violation of his contract with a   but so what .  a guy had to get by  right .  it was just plain good luck that the president now wanted done what olivaw had already paid for  deletion .  no harm in collecting twice for the same job .   or had seemed so .  nim chewed his lip .  what did a bunch of digits matter  anyway .   nim froze .  had the entire sim restaurant  garcon  street  joan  gone in a flash .  usually they dissolved as functions died .  a sim was complex and could not simply stop all the intricate interlayers  shutting down at once .  but this interweave had been unprecedented  so maybe it was different .      done .  good .     the president crisply clapped him on the shoulder .   nim felt tired  sad .  someday he would have to explain all this to marq .  erasing so much work .  .  .   but marq and sybyl had disappeared into the crowds back at the coliseum .  wisely  they didn   t show up for work  or even go back to their apartments .  they were on the run .  and with them had gone the junin renaissance  up in smoke as the junin sector burned and dissolved in discord and violence .   even nim felt a sadness at the smash up .  the eager  passionate talk of a renaissance .  they had looked to joan and voltaire for a kind of maturity in the eternal debate between faith and reason .  but the imperium suppressed passion  in the end .  too destabilizing .   of course  the whole tiktok movement had to be squashed  too .  he had sequestered marq   s memory complex about the debate of       years ago .  clearly    robots     whatever they might be  would be too unsettling an issue to ever bring up in a rational society .   nim sighed .  he knew that he had merely edited away electrical circuits .  professionals always kept that firmly in mind .   still  it was wrenching .  to see it go .  all trickled away  like grains of digital sand  down the obscure hourglass of simulated time .       rendezvous    r .  daneel olivaw allowed his face to express squint eyed concern .  the cramped room seemed barely able to contain his grim mood .   still  dors read this as a concession to her .  she lived among humans and relied on their facial and body expressions  voluntary and unwilled alike .  she had no idea where olivaw spent most of his time .  perhaps there were enough robots to form a society .  this idea she had never entertained .  the instant she did  she wondered why she had never thought of it before .  but now he spoke     the simulations are quite dead .      dors kept her voice level  free of betraying emotion .      so it seems .         what evidence .         artifice associates believes so .         the man i had hired there  named nim  is not entirely certain .         he reports to you .         i need several inputs to any critical situation .  i needed to discredit the tiktok freedom idea  the junin renaissance  they are destabilizing .  acting through these simulations seemed a promising channel .  i had not allowed for the fact that computerists of today are not as skilled as those of fifteen thousand years ago .      dors frowned .     this level of interference .  .  . is allowed .         remember the zeroth law .      she did not allow her distress to show in her face or voice .     i believe the simulations are erased .         good .  but we must be sure .         i have hired several sniffers to find traces of them in the trantor mesh .  so far  nothing .         does hari know of your effort .         of course not .      olivaw gazed at her steadily .     he must not .  you and i must not merely keep him safe  to do his work .  we must guide him .         through deception .      he had lapsed to the unnerving manner of not blinking or letting his eyes move .     it must be .         i do not like to mislead him .         on the contrary  you are correctly leading him .  through omissions .         i .  .  . encounter emotional difficulty .  .  .         blocks .  very human  and i mean that as a compliment .         i would prefer to deal with positive threats to hari .  to guard him  not to deceive him .         of course .     still no smile or gesture .     but it must be this way .  we live in the most ominous era of all galactic history .         hari is beginning to suspect so  too .         the rise of the new renaissance on sark is a further danger  one of many we face .  but this excavation of ancient simulations is even worse .  the junin disorders are but an early signature of what could come .  such research could lead to the engineering of a new race of robots .  this cannot be allowed  for it would interfere with our mission .         i understand .  i tried to destroy the simulation ferrite blocks          i know  it was all in your report .  do not blame yourself .         i would like to help more  but i am consumed by defending hari .         i understand .  if it is any consolation  the reemergence of simulations was inevitable .      she blinked .     why .         i told you of a simple theory of history  one we have operated under for over ten thousand years .  a crude psychohistory .  it predicted that the simulations i  well  we  suppressed eight thousand years ago would find an audience here .         your theory is that good .         as hari remarks  history repeats itself  but it does not stutter .  i knew it was impossible to erase all copies of simulations  throughout the galaxy .     he steepled his hands and peered at them  as if contemplating a structure .     when social ferment develops a taste for such things  they once more appear upon the menu of history .         i am sorry i could not arrange their destruction .         there are forces at work here you cannot counter .  do not sorrow for turns of the weather .  await instead the long  slow coming of the climate .      olivaw reached out and touched her hand .  she studied his face .  apparently for her ease he had returned to full facial expression  including consistent movement of his adam   s apple when he swallowed .  minor computations  but she appreciated the touch .      i can devote myself solely to his safety  then .  forget the simulations .         yes .  they are my matter .  i must find a way to defuse their impact .  they are robust .  i knew them  used them  long ago .         how can they be more stalwart than us .   than you .         they are simulated humans .  i am a separate sort .  so are you .         you were able to be first minister          i functioned as a kind of partial human .  that is an insightful way of regarding ourselves .  i recommend it to you .         partial .      he said gently     there is much you do not do .         i pass as human .  i can converse  work          friendships  family  the complex webbing that denotes humans    ability to move from the individual to the collective  striking a balance  all these subtle crafts lie beyond us .         i don   t want to          precisely .  you are subtly aimed at your target .         but you ruled .  as first minister          i had reached my limit .  so i left .         the empire ran well under your          it decayed further .  as hari expected  and our crude theory failed to predict .         and why did you tell cleon to make him first minister .     she blurted out .      he must be in a position which will give him freedom of movement and power to make corrections in imperial policies  as he comes to understand psychohistory better .  he can be a temporary stopgap of great potency .         it may deflect him from psychohistory itself .         no .  hari will find a way to use that experience .  one of his facets  which emerges strongly in his class of intellect  is his ability to learn from the seasoning of life .         hari doesn   t want the first ministership .         so .     he lifted an eyebrow  puzzled .      shouldn   t his own feelings matter .         we are here to guide humanity  not to let it merely meander .         but the danger          the empire needs him .  what   s more  he needs the ministership  though he does not see that as yet  granted .  he will have access to all imperial data for use in psychohistory .         he has so much data already          much more will be needed to make a full running model .  he must also  in the future  have power to act on a grand scale .         but    grand    can be fatal .  people like this lamurk  i am certain he is dangerous .         quite so .  but i depend upon you to keep hari from harm .         i find myself getting short of temper  my judgment          you are more nearly human in your emulation circuits than i .  expect to bear the burden that fact implies .      she nodded .     i wish i could see you more often  ask          i move quickly through the empire  doing what tasks i can .  i have not been in trantor since i left the first ministership myself .         are you sure it is safe for you to travel so .         i have many defenses against detection of my true nature .  you have even more  for you are nearly natural .         i cannot penetrate a full weapons screen around the palace  though .      olivaw shook his head .     their technology exceeded our capacity to disguise quite some while ago .  i evaded it while first minister because no one dared test me .         then i cannot protect hari in the palace .         you should not have to .  once he becomes first minister  you will be able to pass with him through their detectors .  those are only used for major occasions .         until he is first minister  then          his danger is maximum .         very well  i will focus on hari .  i would prefer to leave those simulations to you .         i fear they  and sark  will be quite enough for me to handle .  i went to the coliseum in junin sector  saw them run wild .  the tiktok issue inflames humans  still  just as we want .         these tiktoks  surely they will not approach our levels of cognition .      his mouth twitched just once .     and why not .         under human guidance .         they could quickly rival us .         then our grand designs          on the trash heap .         i do not like such a prospect     she said  face flushed .      the ancient taboos our kind so labored to put in place are breaking down  perhaps forever .         what does your  our  theory of history say .         it is not nearly good enough to say anything .  against a background of social stability  such as this empire enjoyed for so long  simulations were destabilizing .  now .  no one  human or robot  knows .  all parameters are accelerating .     his face slackened  losing all color and muscle tone  as if from an immense fatigue .     we must turn matters  as much as we can  over to them  to the humans .         to hari .         him  most especially .          part      body politics       foundation  early history   .  .  . first public intimations of psychohistory as a possible scientific discipline surfaced during the poorly documented early period of seldon    s political life .  while the emperor cleon set great store in its possibilities  psychohistory was viewed by the political class as a mere abstraction  if not a joke .  this may have resulted from maneuverings by seldon himself  who never referred to the subject by the name he had given it .  even at this early stage  he seems to have realized that widespread knowledge of psychohistory and any movement founded upon it would enjoy little predictive success  since many would then be able to act to offset its predictions  or take advantage of them .  some have    condemned    seldon as    selfish    for    hoarding    the psychohistorical method  but one must remember the extreme rapacity of political life in these waning years .  .  .  .     encyclopedia galactica      .     hari seldon   s desksec chimed and announced     margetta moonrose desires a conversation .      hari looked up at the  d image of a striking woman hovering before him .     urn .  oh .  who   s she .     his sec would not interrupt him amid his calculations unless this were somebody important .      cross check reveals that she is the leading interviewer and political maven in the multimedia complex          sure  sure  but why is she consequential .         she is considered by all cross cultural monitors to be among the fifty most influential figures on trantor .  i suggest          never heard of her .     hari sat up  brushed at his hair .     i suppose i should .  full filter  though .         i fear my filters are down for recalibration .  if          damn it  they   ve been out for a week .         i fear the mechanical in charge of the new calibrations has been defective .      mechs  which were advanced tiktoks  were failing often these days .  since the junin riots  some had even been attacked .  hari swallowed and said     put her through anyway .      he had used filters on holophones for so long  he could not now disguise his feelings .  cleon   s staff had installed software to render the fitting  preselected body language for him .  with some sprucing up by the imperial advisors  it now modulated his acoustic signature for a full  confident  resonant tone .  and if he wanted  it edited his vocabulary  he was always lapsing into technospeak when he should be explaining simply .      academician .     moonrose said brightly .     i would so much like to have a little talk with you .         about mathematics .     he said blandly .   she laughed merrily .     no no .   that would be far over my head .  i represent billions of inquiring minds who would like to know your thoughts on the empire  the quathanan questions  the          the what .         quathanan  the dispute over zonal alignment .         never heard of it .         but  you   re to be first minister .     she seemed genuinely surprised  though hari reminded himself that this was probably a superbly adept filter face .      so i am  perhaps .  until then  i will not bother .         when the high council selects  they must know the views of the candidates     she said rather primly .      tell your viewers that i do my homework only just before it   s due .      she looked charmed  which made him certain that she was filtered .  he had learned from many collisions with them that media mavens were easily irked when brushed aside .  they seemed to feel it quite natural that  since an immense audience saw through their eyes  they carried all the moral heft of that audience .      what about a subject you certainly must know  the junin disaster .  and the loss  some say escape  of the voltaire and joan of arc sims .         not my department     hari said .  cleon had advised him to keep his distance from the entire sim issue .      rumors suggest that they came from your department .         certainly  one of our research mathists found them .  we leased rights to those people  what was their name    .         artifice associates  as i am sure you know .         um  yes .         this distracted professor role is not convincing  sir .         you   d rather i spent my time running for office  and then  presumably  running for cover .         the world  the whole empire  has a right to know          so i should stand only for what the people will fall for .      her mouth twisted  coming through her filters  so apparently she had decided to play this interview as a contest of wills .     you   re hiding the peoples    business from          my research is my own business .      she waved this aside .     what do you say  as a mathematician  to those who feel that deep sims of real people are immoral .      hari wished fervently for his own face filters .  he was sure he was giving away something  so he forced his face to stay blank .  best to deflect the argument .     how real were those sims .  can anybody know .         they certainly seemed real and human to the audience     moonrose said  raising her eyebrows .      i   m afraid i didn   t watch the performance     hari said .     i was busy .     strictly true  at least .   moonrose leaned forward  scowling .     with your mathematics .  well  then  tell us about psychohistory .      he was still keeping his face wooden  which gave the wrong signal .  he made himself smile .     a rumor .         i have it on good authority that you are favored by the emperor because of this theory of history .         what authority .         now sir  i should ask the questions here          who says .  i   m still a public servant  a professor .  and you  madam  are taking up time i could be devoting to my students .      with a wave hari cut off the link .  he had learned  since bandying words with lamurk in clear view of an unsuspected  d snout  to chop off talk when it was going the wrong way .   dors came through the door as he leaned back into his airchair .     i got a hail  said somebody important was grilling you .         she   s gone .  poked at me about psychohistory .         well  it was bound to get out .  it   s an exciting synthesis of terms .  appeals to the imagination .         maybe if i   d called it    sociohistory    people would think it more boring and leave me alone .         you could never live with so ugly a word .      the electroshield sparkled and snapped as yugo amaryl came through .     am i interrupting anything .         not at all .     hari leapt up and helped him to a chair .  he was still limping .     how   s the leg .      he shrugged .     decent .      three thuggos had come to yugo on the street a week ago and explained the situation very calmly .  they had been commissioned to do him damage  a warning he would not forget .  some bones had to be broken  that was the specification  nothing he could do about it .  the leader explained how they could do this the hard way .  if he fought  he would get messed up .  the easy way  they would break his shin bone in one clean snap .   describing it afterward  yugo had said     i thought about it some  y   know  and sat down on the sidewalk and stuck my left leg out straight .  braced it against the curb  below the knee .  the leader kicked me there .  a good job  it broke clean and straight .      hari had been horrified .  the media latched onto the story  of course .  his only wry statement to them was     violence is the diplomacy of the incompetent .         medtech tells me it   ll heal up in another week     yugo said as hari helped him stretch out  the airchair shaping itself subtly .      the imperials still haven   t a clue who did it     dors said  pacing restlessly around the office .      plenty of people will do a job like this .     yugo grinned  an effect somewhat offset by the big bruise on his jaw .  the incident had not been quite as gentlemanly as he described it .     they kinda liked doing it to a dahlite  too .      dors paced angrily .     if i   d been there .  .  .         you can   t be everywhere     hari said kindly .     the imperials think it wasn   t really about you  anyway  yugo .      yugo   s mouth twisted ruefully at hari .     i figured .  you right .      hari nodded .     a    signal     one of them said .      dors turned sharply from her pacing .     of what .         a warning     yugo said .     politics .         i see     she said quickly .     lamurk cannot strike at you directly  but he leaves          an unsubtle calling card     yugo finished for her .  dors smacked her hands together .     we should tell the emperor .      hari had to chuckle .     and you  a historian .   violence has always played a role in issues of succession .  it can never be far from cleon   s mind .         for emperors  yes     she countered .     but in a contest for first minister          power is get tin    scarce    round here     yugo drawled sarcastically .     pesky dahlites makin    trouble  empire itself slowin    down  too .  or spinnin    off into loony    renaissances .     probably a dahlite plot  that  righto .      hari said     when food gets scarce  table manners change .      yugo said     i   ll just bet the emperor   s got this all analyzed .      dors began pacing again .     one of history   s lessons is that emperors who overanalyze fail  while those who oversimplify succeed .         a neat analysis     hari said  but she did not catch his irony .      uh  i actually came in to get some work done     yugo said softly .     i   ve finished reconciling the trantorian historical data with the modified seldon equations .      hari leaned forward  though dors kept pacing  her hands clasped behind her back .     wonderful .  how far off are they .      yugo grinned as he slipped a ferrite cube into hari   s desk display slot .     watch .      trantor had endured at least eighteen millennia  though the pre empire period was poorly documented .  yugo had collapsed the ocean of data into a  d .  economics lay along one axis  social indices along another  with politics making up the third dimension .  each contributed a surface  forming a solid shape that hung above hari   s desk .  the slippery looking blob was man sized and in constant motion  deforming  caves opening  lumps rising .  color coded internal flows were visible through the transparent skin .      it looks like a cancerous organ     dors said .  when yugo frowned  she added hastily     pretty  though .      hari chuckled  dors seldom made social gaffes  but when she did  she had no idea of how to recover .  the lumpy object hanging in air throbbed with life  capturing his attention .  the writhing manifold summed up trillions of vectors  the raw data drawn from countless tiny lives .      this early history had patchy data     yugo said .  the surfaces jerked and lurched .     low resolution  too  and even low population size  a problem we won   t have in empire predictions .         see the two dee socio structures .     hari pointed .     and this represents everything in trantor .     dors asked .   yugo said     to the model not all detail is equally important .  you don   t need to know the owner of a starship to calculate how it will fly .      hari said helpfully  pointing at a quick jitter in social vectors     scientocracy arose here third millennium .  then an era in which stasis arose from monopolies .  that fed rigidity .      the forms steadied as the data improved .  yugo let it run  time stepping quickly so that they saw fifteen millennia in three minutes .  it was startling  the pulsing solid growing myriad offshoots  structure endlessly proliferating .  the madly burgeoning patterns spoke of the empire   s complexity far more than any emperor   s lofty speech .      now here   s the overlay     yugo said     showing how the seldon equations post dict  in yellow .         they aren   t my equations     hari said automatically .  long ago he and yugo had seen that to predict with psychohistory first demanded that they post dict the past  for verification .     they were          just watch .      alongside the deep blue data figure  a yellow lump congealed .  it looked to hari like an identical twin to the original .  each went through contortions  seething with history   s energy .  each ripple and snag represented many billions of human triumphs and tragedies .  every small shudder had once been a calamity .      they   re .  .  . the same     hari whispered .      damn right     yugo said .      the theory fits .         yup .  psychohistory works .      hari stared at the flexing colors .     i never thought .  .  .         it could work so well .     dors had walked behind his chair and now rubbed his scalp .      well  yes .         you have spent years including the proper variables .  it must work .      yugo smiled tolerantly .     if only more people shared your faith in mathists .  you   ve forgotten the sparrow effect .      dors was transfixed by the shimmering data solids  now rerunning all trantorian history  throbbing with different colored schemes to show up differences between real history and the equations    post dictions .  there were very few .  what   s more  they did not grow with time .   not taking her eyes from the display  dors asked slowly     sparrow .  we have birds as pets  but surely          suppose a sparrow flaps its wings at the equator  out in the open .  that shifts the air circulation a tiny amount .  if things break just right  the sparrow could trigger a tornado up at the poles .      dors was startled .     impossible .      hari said     don   t confuse it with the fabled nail in the shoe of a horse  that a legendary beast of burden .  remember .   its rider lost a battle and then a kingdom .  that was failure of a small  critical component .  fundamental  random phenomena are democratic .  tiny differences in every coupled variable can produce staggering changes .      it took a while to get the point through .  like any other world  trantor   s meteorology had a daunting sensitivity to initial conditions .  a sparrow   s wingflutter on one side of trantor  amplified through fluid equations over weeks  could drive a howling hurricane a continent away .  no computer could model all the tiny details of real weather to make exact predictions possible .   dors pointed at the data solids .     so  this is all wrong .         i hope not     hari said .     weather varies  but climate holds steady .         still .  .  . no wonder trantorians prefer indoors .  outdoors can be dangerous .         the fact that the equations describe what happened  well  it means that small effects can smooth out in history     hari said .   yugo added     stuff on a human scale can average away .      she stopped massaging hari   s scalp .     then .  .  .  people don   t matter .      hari said carefully     most biography persuades us that people  that we  are important .  psychohistory teaches that we aren   t .         as a historian  i cannot accept          look at the data     yugo put in .   they watched as yugo brought up detail  showed off features .  for ordinary people  history endured through art  myth  and liturgy .  they felt it through concrete examples  close up  a building  a custom  a historical name .  he and yugo and the others were like sparrows themselves  hovering high over a landscape unguessed by the inhabitants below .  they saw the slow surge of terrain  glacial and unstoppable .      but people have to matter .     dors    voice carried a note of forlorn hope .  hari knew that somewhere deep in her lurked the stern directives of the zeroth law  but over that lay a deep layer of true human feeling .  she was a humanist who believed in the power of the individual  and here she met blunt  uncaring mechanism  in the large .      they do  actually  but perhaps not in the way you want     hari said gently .     we sought out telltale groups  pivots about which events sometimes hinge .         the homosexuals  f   instance     yugo said .      they   re about one percent of the population  a consistent minor variant in reproductive strategies     hari said .   socially  though  they were often masters of improvisation  fashioning style to substance  fully at home with the arbitrary .  they seemed equipped with an internal compass that pointed them at every social novelty  early on  so that they exerted leverage all out of proportion to their numbers .  often they were sensitive indicators of future turns .   yugo went on     so we figured  could they be a crucial indicator .  turns out they are .  helps out the equations .      dors said severely     why does history smooth out .      hari let yugo carry the ball .     y   see  that same sparrow effect had a positive side .  chaotic systems could be caught at just the right instant  tilted ever so slightly in a preferred way .  a well timed nudge could drive a system  yielding benefits all out of proportion to the effort expended .         you mean control .     she looked doubtful .      just a touch     yugo said .     minimal control  the right nudge at the right time  demands that the dynamics be intricately understood .  maybe that way  you could bias outcomes toward the least damaging of several finely balanced results .  at best  they could drive the system into startlingly good outcomes .         who   s controlling .     dors asked .   yugo looked embarrassed .     oh  we .  .  . dunno .         don   t know .  but this is a theory of all history .      hari said quietly     there are elements  interplays  in the equations that we don   t grasp .  damping forces .         how can you not understand .      both men looked ill at ease .     we don   t know how the terms interact .  new features     hari said     leading to .  .  . emergent order .      she said primly     then you don   t really have a theory  do you .      hari nodded ruefully .     not in the sense of a deep understanding  no .      models followed the gritty  experienced world  he reflected .  they echoed their times .  clockwork planetary mechanics came after clocks .  the idea of the whole universe as a computation came after computers .  a worldview of stable change came after nonlinear dynamics .  .  .   he had a glimmering of a metamodel  which would look at him and describe how he would then select among models for psychohistory .  peering down from above  it could see which was likely to be favored by hari seldon .  .  .      who plans this control .     dors persisted .   hari caught at the idea he had  but it slipped away .  he knew how to coax it back  ease up .     remember that joke .     he said .     how do you make god laugh .      she smiled .     you tell him your plans .         right .  we will study this result  sniff out an answer .      she smiled .     don   t ask you for predictions about the progress of your own predictions .         embarrassing  but yes .      his desksec chimed .     an imperial summons     it announced .      damn .     hari slapped his chair .     fun   s over .          .     not quite time for the specials to arrive  hari thought .  but getting any work done was impossible while he was on edge .   he jiggled coins in his pocket  distracted  then fished one out .  a five cred piece  amber alloy  a handsome cleon i head on one side treasuries always flattered emperors  and the disk of the galaxy seen from above on the other .  he held it on edge and thought .   let the coin   s width represent the disk   s typical scale height .  to be correct  the coin would have to bulge at its center to depict the hub  but overall it was a good geometric replica .   in the disk was a flaw  a minute blister in an outer spiral arm .  he did the ratio in his head  allowing that the galaxy was about         light years across  and .  .  . blinked .  the speck portrayed a volume about a thousand light years across .  in the outer arms  that would contain ten million stars .   to see so many worlds as a fleck adrift in immensity made him feel as though trantor   s solidity had opened and he had plunged helplessly into an abyss .   could humanity matter on such a scale .  so many billions of souls  packed into a grainy dot .   yet they had spanned the whole incomprehensible expanse of that disk in a twinkling .   humanity had spread through the spiral arms  spilling through the wormholes  wrapping itself around the hub in a mere few thousand years .  in that time the spiral arms themselves had not revolved a perceptible angle in their own gravid gavotte  that would take half a billion years .  human hankering for far horizons had sent them swarming through the wormhole webbing  popping out into spaces near suns of swelling red  virulent blue  smoldering ruby .   the speck stood for a volume a single human brain  with its primate capacities  could not grasp  except as mathematical notation .  but that same brain led humans outward  until they now strode the galaxy  mastering the starlit abyss .  .  . without truly knowing themselves .   so a single human could not fathom even a dot in the disk .  but the sum of humanity could  incrementally  one mind at a time  knowing its own immediate starry territory .   and what did he desire .  to comprehend all of that humanity  its deepest impulses  its shadowy mechanisms  its past  present  and future .  he wanted to know the vagrant species that had managed to scoop up this disk  and to make it a plaything .   so maybe one single human mind could indeed grasp the disk  by going one level higher  and fathoming the collective effects  hidden in the intricacies of the equations .   describing trantor  in this proportion  was child   s play .  for the empire  he needed a far grander comprehension .   mathematics might rule the galaxy .  invisible  gossamer symbols could govern .   so a single man or woman could matter .   maybe .  he shook his head .  a single human head .   getting a little ahead of ourselves  aren   t we .  dreams of godhood .  .  .   back to work .   only he couldn   t work .  he had to wait .  to his relief  the imperial specials arrived and escorted him across streeling university .  by now he was used to the gawkers  the embarrassment of plowing through the crowds which now accumulated everywhere  it seemed  that he might frequent .      busy today     he said to the specials captain .      got to expect it  sir .         you get extra duty pay for this  i hope .         yessir .     digs     we call them .         for extra risk  correct .  dangerous duty .      the captain looked flustered .     well  yessir .  .  .         if someone starts shooting  what are your orders .         uh  if they can penetrate the engaging perimeter  we   re to get between them and you .  sir .         and you   d do that .  take a gauss pulse or a flechette .      he seemed surprised .     of course .         truly .         our duty  y   know .      hari was humbled by the man   s simple loyalty .  not to hari seldon  but to the idea of empire .  order .  civilization .   and hari realized that he  too  was devoted to that idea .  the empire had to be saved  or at least its decline mitigated .  only by fathoming its deep structure could he do that .   which was why he disliked the first minister business .  it robbed him of time  concentration .   in the specials    armored pods he salved his discontent by pulling out his tablet and working on some equations .  the captain had to remind him when they reached the palace grounds .  hari got out and there was the usual security ritual  the specials spreading out and airborne sensors going aloft to sniff out the far perimeter .  they reminded him of golden bees  buzzing with vigilance .   he walked by a wall leading into the palace gardens and a tan  round sheet the size of his fingernail popped off the wall .  it stuck to his neck .  he reached up and plucked it off .   he recognized it as a promotional trinket  a slap on patch which gave you a pleasant rush by diffusing endorphins into your bloodstream .  it also subtly predisposed you to coherent signals in corridor advertisements .   he pitched it aside .  a special grabbed at the patch and suddenly there was shouting and movement all around him .  the special turned to throw the patch away .   an orange spike shot through the guard   s hand  hissing hot  flaring and gone in a second .  the man cried     ah .     and another special grabbed him and pushed him down .  then five specials blocked hari from all sides and he saw no more .   the special screamed horribly .  something cut off the wail of pain .  the captain shouted     move .     and hari had to trot with the specials around him into the gardens and down several lanes .   it took a while to straighten out the incident .  the patch was untraceable  of course  and there was no way of knowing for sure whether it was targeted on hari at all .      could be part of some palace plot     the captain said .     just waiting for the next    passerby with a scent signature like yours .         not aimed for me at all .         could be .  that tab took couple extra seconds tryin    to figure out if it wanted you or not .         and it did .         body odor  skin smells  they   re not exact  sir .         i   ll have to start wearing perfume .      the captain grinned .     that won   t stop a smart tab .      other protection specialists rushed in and there was evidence to measure and opinions and a lot of talk .  hari insisted on walking back to see the special who had taken the tab .  he was gone  already off to emergency care  they said he would lose his hand .  no  sorry  hari could not see him .  security  y   know .   quite quickly hari became bored with the aftermath .  he had come early to get a stroll through the gardens and though he knew he was being irrational  his regret at missing the walk loomed larger than the assassination attempt .   hari took a long  still moment and moved the incident aside .  he visualized a displacement operator  an icy blue vector frame .  it listed the snarled  angry red knot and pushed it out of view .  later  he would deal with it later .   he cut off the endless talk and ordered the specials to fall in behind him .  shouted protests came  of course  which he ignored .  then he ambled across the gardens  relishing the open air .  he inhaled eagerly .  the blinding speed of the attack had erased its importance to him .  for now .   the palace towers loomed like webwork of a giant spider .  between their bulks weaved airy walkways .  spires were veiled in silvery mist and aripple  apulse  shimmering with a silent  steady beat like a great unseen heart .  he had been so long in the foreshortened views of trantor   s corridors  his eyes did not quickly grasp the puzzling perspectives .   an upward rush caught his attention as he passed through a flowers cape .  from the immense imperial aviary  flocks of birds in the thousands oscillated in the vertical drafts .  their artful  ever shifting patterns had a diaphanous  billowy quality  an immense  wispy dance .   yet these had been shaped many millennia ago by bioengineering their genome .  they formed drifts and billows like clouds  or even airy mountains  feasting on upwelling gnats  released from below by the gardeners .  but a side draft could dissolve all their ornate sculptures  blow them away .   like the empire  he mused .  beautiful in its order  stable for fifteen millennia  yet now toppling .  cracking up like a slow motion pod wreck .  or in spasms like the junin riots .   why .  even among imperial loveliness  his mathist mind returned to the problem .   entering the palace  he passed a delegation of children on their way to some audience with a lesser imperial figure .  with a sudden pang he missed his adopted son  raych .  he and dors had decided to secretly send the boy away to school  after yugo had his leg broken .     deprive them of targets     dors had said .   among the meritocracy  only those adults with commitment  stability  and talent could have children .  gentry or plain citizens could whelp brats by the shovelful .   parents were like artists  special people with a special gift  given respect and privileges  left free to create happy and competent humans .  it was noble work  well paid .  hari had been honored to be approved .   in immediate contrast  three oddly shaped courtiers ambled by him .   by biotech means people could turn their children into spindly towers  into flowerlike footbound dwarves  into green giants or pink pygmies .  from throughout the galaxy they were sent here to amuse the imperial court  where novelty was always in vogue .   but such variants seldom lasted .  there was a species norm .  and stretching it was just as deeply ingrained .  hari had to admit that he would forever be among the unsophisticated  for he found such folk repulsive .   someone had designed the reception room to look like anything but a room for receiving people .  it resembled a lumpy pocket in molten glass  crisscrossed by polished shafts of ceramo steel .  these shafts in turn dripped into smooth lumps which  since there was nothing else in the room  must have been intended to be chairs and tables .   it seemed unlikely that he could ever get back out of any of the shapes  once he had worked out how to sit in them  so hari stood .  and wondered if that effect  too  was somehow intended .  .  . the palace was a subtle place of layered design .   this was to be a small  private meeting  cleon   s staff had assured him .  still  there was a small army of attaches and protocol officers and aides who had introduced themselves as hari had passed through several rooms of increasing ornamentation  on his way here .  their talk became more ornate  as well .  courtly life was dominated by puffed up people who always acted as though they were coyly unveiling statues of themselves .   there was a lot of adornment and finery  the architectural equivalent of jewels and silk  and even the most minor attendants wore very dignified green uniforms .  he felt as though he should lower his voice and realized  recalling sundays on helicon  that this place felt somehow like a church .   then cleon swept in and the staff vanished  silently draining away into concealed exits .      my seldon .         yours  sire .     hari followed the ritual .   the emperor continued greeting him effusively  tut tutting over the apparent assassination attempt     surely an accident  don   t you think .      and led him to the large display wall .  at cleon   s gesture an enormous view of the entire galaxy appeared  the work of a new artist .  hari murmured the required admiration and recalled his thoughts of only an hour before .   this was a time sculpture  tracing the entire galactic history .  the disk was  after all  a collection of debris  swirling at the bottom of a gravitational pothole in the cosmos .  how it looked depended on which of mankind   s myriad eyes one used .  infrared could pierce and unmask dusty lanes .  x rays sought pools of fiercely burning gas .  radio dishes mapped cold banks of molecules and magnetized plasma .  all were packed with meaning .   in the carousel of the disk  stars bobbed and weaved under complicated newtonian tugs .  the major arms  sagittarius  orion  and perseus  counting outward from the center  bore names obscured by antiquity .  each contained a zone of that name  hinting that perhaps here the ancient earth orbited .  but no one knew  and research had revealed no obvious single candidate .  instead  dozens of worlds vied for the title of the true earth .  quite probably  none of them were .   many bright signatures  skymarks  like landmarks .   blazed among the curving  barred spiral arms .  beauty beyond description  but not beyond analysis  hari thought  whether physical or social .  if he could find the key .  .  .      i congratulate you on the success of my moron decree     cleon said .   hari slowly withdrew from the immense perspective .     oh  sire .         your idea  first fruit of psychohistory .     to hari   s blank incomprehension cleon chuckled .     forgotten already .  the renegades who pillage  seeking renown for their infamy .  you advised me to strip them of their identity by making them henceforth be called morons .      hari had indeed forgotten the advice  but contented himself with a sage nod .      it worked .  such crimes are much reduced .  and those convicted go to their deaths full of anger  demanding to be made famous .  i tell you  it is delicious .      hari felt a chill at the way the emperor smacked his lips .  an off hand suggestion made suddenly  concretely real .  it rattled him a bit .   he realized that the emperor was asking about progress with psychohistory .  his throat tightened and he remembered the moonrose woman with her irritating questions .  that seemed weeks ago .     work is slow     he managed to say .   cleon said sympathetically     surely it requires a deep knowledge of every facet of civilized life .         at times .     hari stalled  putting his mixed emotions firmly away .      i was at a convocation recently and learned something you undoubtedly have factored into your equations .         yes  sire .         it is said that the very foundation of the empire  besides the wormholes of course  is the discovery of proton boron fusion .  i had never heard of it  yet the speaker said it was the single greatest achievement of antiquity .  that every starship  every planetary technology  depends upon it for power .         i suppose that is true  but i did not know it .         such an elementary fact .         what is not of use to me does not concern me .      cleon   s mouth pouted in puzzlement .     but a theory of all history surely demands great detail .         technology enters only in its effects on other large issues     hari said .  how to explain the intricacies of nonlinear calculus .     often its limitations are the important point .         any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced     cleon said airily .      well put  sire .         you like it .  that fellow draius gave it to me .  it has a ring  doesn   t it .  true  too .  perhaps i   ll      he broke off and said to the air     transcription officer .  give that line about magic to the presepth for general distribution .      cleon sat back .     they   re always after me for    imperial wisdom .     a bother .      a faint musical note announced betan lamurk .  hari stiffened at first sight of the man  but lamurk had eyes only for the emperor as he went smoothly through a litany of court ritual .  as a prime member of the high council he had to recite some time honored and empty phrases  bow with a curious swoop  and never avert his gaze from the emperor .  that done  he could relax .      professor seldon .  so good to meet again .      hari shook hands in the formal manner .     sorry about that little dustup .  i really didn   t know the  d was there .         no matter .  one can   t help what the media make of things .         my seldon gave me excellent advice about the moron decree     cleon said .  he went on  his delight deepening the twist of lamurk   s mouth .   cleon led them to luxuriant chairs that popped out of the walls .  hari found himself swept immediately into a detailed discussion of council matters .  resolutions  measures of appropriation  abstracts of proposed legislation .  this stuff had been flowing through hari   s office  as well .  he had dutifully set his autosec to text  analyzing it  breaking the sea of jargon down into galactic and smoothing out the connections .  this got him through the first hour .  most of the material he had ignored  tipping piles of to be scanned documents into his recycler when nobody was looking .   the arcane workings of the high council were not in principle difficult to follow  they were just boring .  as lamurk deftly conferred with the emperor  hari watched them as he would watch a bodyball game  a curious practice  no doubt fascinating in a narrow sort of way .   that the council set general standards and directions  while below them mere legal mavens worked out the details and passed legislation  did not change his bemused disinterest .  people spent their lives doing such things  .   for tactics he cared little .  even mankind did not matter .  on the galactic chessboard the pieces were the phenomena of humanity  the rules of the game were the laws of psychohistory .  the player on the other side was hidden  perhaps did not exist .   lamurk needed an opposite player  a rival .  subtly  hari saw that he was the inevitable foe .   lamurk   s career had aimed him for the first ministership and he meant to get it .  at every turn lamurk curried favor with the emperor and waved away hari   s points  of which there were few .   he did not directly counter lamurk  the man was a master .  he kept quiet  confining himself to an occasional expressively  he hoped  raised eyebrow .  he had rarely regretted keeping quiet .      this macromesh thing  do you favor it .     the emperor abruptly asked hari .   he barely remembered the idea .     it will alter the galaxy considerably     he stalled .      productively .     lamurk slapped a table .     all the econ indicators are falling .  the macromesh will speed up info flow  boost productivity .      the emperor   s mouth tilted with doubt .     i   m not altogether happy with the idea of linking so many  so easily .         just think     lamurk pressed     the new squeezers will let an ordinary person in  say  eqquis zone talk every day with a friend in the far reaches  or anywhere else .      the emperor nodded uncertainly .     hari .  what do you think .         i have doubts as well .      lamurk waved dismissively .     failure of nerve .         increased communication may worsen the empire   s crisis .      lamurk   s mouth twisted derisively .     nonsense .  contrary to every good executive rule .         the empire isn   t ruled      hari made a half bow to the emperor      alas  it   s let run .         more nonsense .  we in the high council          hear him out .     cleon said .     he does not talk very much .      hari smiled .     many people are grateful for that  sire .         no oblique answers  now .  what does your psychohistory tell you about how the empire runs .         it is millions of castles  webbed by    bridges .         castles .     cleon   s famous nose rose skeptically .      planets .  they have local concerns and run them selves as they like .  the empire doesn   t trouble itself over such details  unless a world begins making aggressive trouble .         true enough  and as it should be     cleon said .     ah  and your bridges are the wormholes .         exactly  sire .     hari deliberately avoided looking at lamurk and focused on the emperor  while sketching in his vision .   planets could have any number of lesser duchies  with disputes and wars and    microstructure    galore .  the psychohistorical equations showed that none of that mattered .   what did matter was that physical resources could not be shared among indefinitely large numbers of people .  each solar system was a finite store of goods  and in the end  that meant local hierarchies to control access .   wormholes could carry rather little mass  because the holes were seldom more than ten meters across .  massive hyperspace ships carried heavy cargoes  but they were slower and cumbersome .  they distorted space time  contracting it fore and expanding it aft  moving at super light speeds in the galaxy   s frame but not in its own .  trade among most stellar systems was constrained to light  compact  expensive items .  spices  fashions  technology  not bulky raw materials .   wormholes could accommodate modulated light beams far more easily .  the wormhole curvature refracted beams through to receivers at the other mouth .  data flowed freely  knitting together the galaxy .   and information was the opposite of mass .  data could be moved  compressed  and leaked readily through copies .  it was infinitely shareable .  it blossomed like flowers in eternal spring  for as information was applied to a problem  the resulting solution was new information .  and it was cheap  meaning that it took few mass resources to acquire it .  its preferred medium was light  quite literally  the laser beam .      that provided enough communication to make an empire .  but the odds of a native of the puissant zone ever voyaging to the zaqulot zone  or even to the next star  since by wormhole they are equivalent trips  were tiny     hari said .      so every one of your    castles    kept itself isolated  except for information flow     cleon said  absorbed .      but now the macromesh will increase the information transfer rate a thousand fold  using these    squeezers    that compress information .      cleon pursed his lips  puzzled .     why is that bad .         it   s not     lamurk said .     better data makes for better decisions  everybody knows that .         not necessarily .  human life is a voyage on a sea of meaning  not a net of information .  what will most people get from a close  personal flow of data .  detached  foreign logic .  uprooted details .         we can run things better .     lamurk insisted .  cleon held up a finger and lamurk choked off his next words .   hari hesitated .  lamurk had a point  indeed .   there were mathematical relationships between technology  capital accumulation  labor  but the most important driver proved to be knowledge .  about half the empire   s economic growth came from the increase in the quality of information  as embodied in better machines and improved skills  leading to efficiency .   that was where the empire had faltered .  the innovative thrust of the sciences had slowly faltered .  the imperial universities produced fine engineers  but no inventors .  great scholars  but few true scientists .  that factored into the other tides of time .  but something other than data starvation had made that happen  and as yet  hari did not know the cause .   but hari saw the emperor wavering  and pressed on .     many on the high council see the macromesh as an instrument of control .  let me point out a few facts well known to you  sire .      hari was in his favorite mode  a one on one lecture .  cleon leaned forward  eyes narrowed .  hari spun him a tale .   to get between worlds a and b  he said  one might have to take a dozen wormhole jumps  the worm nest was an astrophysical subway system with many transfers .   each worm mouth imposed added fees and charges on every shipment .  control of an entire trade route yielded the maximum profit .  the struggle for control was unending  often violent .  from the viewpoint of economics  politics  and    historical momentum     which meant a sort of imposed inertia on events  a local empire which controlled a whole constellation of nodes should be solid  enduring .   not so .  time and again  regional satrapies went toes up .  it seemed natural to squeeze every worm passage for the maximum fee  by coordinating every worm mouth to optimize traffic .  but that degree of control made people restive .  in elaborately controlling the system  information flowed only from managers to wage slaves  with little feedback .   extensive regulation did not deliver the best benefits .  instead  it yielded    short blanket economies     when the collective shoulders got cold  the blanket got pulled up to cover them  and so the feet froze .  over control failed .      so the macromesh  if it lets the high council really    run things     could decrease economic vitality .      lamurk smiled patronizingly .     a bunch of abstract theory  sire .  now  you listen to an old hand who   s been on the council a good long time now .  .  .      hari attended to lamurk   s famous balm and wondered why he was bothering with this .  he had to admit that trading ideas with the emperor had a certain quality of casual  almost sensual  power .  watching a man who could destroy a world with a gesture had a decided adrenaline edge .   but he didn   t really belong here  either by talent or drive .  trotting out his own views was amusing  every professor secretly thinks that what the world needs is a good  solid lecture  from him  of course .   but in this game  the pawns were real .  the moron decree had unnerved him  even though he saw nothing morally wrong with it .   lives hung in the balance here  among the finery .  and not just the lives of others .  he had to remind himself that this beaming  confident lamurk across from him was the obvious source of the patch weapon which had nearly killed him  just hours before .       .     he entered their apartment and went straight to the kitchen .  he punched in commands on the autoserver and then went to the range and began to heat up some oil .  while it warmed he cut up onions and garlic and put them in to brown .  his beer arrived and he opened one  not bothering with a glass .      something   s happened     dors said .      we had a fine little chat .  i eyed lamurk  he eyed me .         that   s not why your shoulders are hunched up .         um .  betrayed by my expressive body .      so he told her about the possible assassination attempt .   after she had calmed down  she said tightly     you also heard about the smoke artist .         at that reception .  he made the big cloud that looked like me .         he died today .         how .         looks like an accident .         too bad  he was funny .         too funny .  he made the cartoon of lamurk  remember .  made lamurk look like a blowhard .  it was the hit of the reception .      hari blinked .     you don   t .  .  .         quite orderly  both of you in one day .         so it could be lamurk .  .  .  .      dors said grimly     my dear hari  always thinking in terms of probabilities .      after his audience with cleon  hari had sat through a strict talk by the head of palace security .  his specials squad was doubled .  more midget flyers for forward perimeter warning .  oh  yes  and he was not to walk close to any walls .   this last bit had made hari chuckle  which did not improve the palace staffs attitude .  worse  hari knew that he still had baggage to unpack .  how to keep them from sniffing out dors    true nature .   the autoserver rang .  he sat and forked up dark meat and onions and then opened another bottle of the cold beer and held it in one hand while he ate with the other .      a hard day   s work     dors said .      i always eat heartily after narrowly averting death .  it   s an old family tradition .         i see .         cleon ended up by commenting on the impasse in the high council .  until that   s resolved  no vote on the first minister can occur .         so you and lamurk are still butting heads .         he   s butting .  me  i   m dodging .         i will never leave your side again     she said firmly .      it   s a deal .  could you get me something more from the autoserver .  something warm and heavy and full of things that are bad for me .      she went into the kitchen and he ate steadily and drank the beer and did not think about anything .   she brought back something steaming in a rich brown sauce .  he ate it without asking what it was .      you are an odd man  professor .         things get to me a bit later than other people .         you learned how to delay thinking about them  reacting to them  until there was a time and a place .      he blinked and drank some more beer .     could be .  have to think about it .         you eagerly eat working class food .  and where did you learn this trick of deferring reactions .         um .  you tell me .         helicon .      he thought about that .     urn  the working class .  my father got into trouble and there were plenty of hard times .  about the only break i got as a boy was not getting brain fever .  we couldn   t have afforded any hospital time .         i see .  financial trouble  i remember you saying .         financial and then people muscling him to sell his land .  he didn   t want to .  so he mortgaged more and planted more crops and followed his best judgment .  every time chance played out against him  dad got right back up and went at it again .  that worked for a while because he did know farming .  but then there was a big market fluctuation and he got caught and lost everything .     he was speaking quickly as he ate  and he didn   t know why but it felt right .      i see .  that was why he was doing that dangerous job          which killed him  yes .         i see .  and you dealt with that .  submerged it to help your mother .  learned in the hard times that followed to reserve your reactions for a moment when it was all right to let it go .         if you say    i see    again  i won   t let you watch later when i take a shower .      she smiled  but then the same penetrating cast came over her face .     you fit some well defined parameters .  men who are contained .  they control themselves by letting very little in .  they do not show a great deal or talk too much .         except to their woman .     he had stopped eating .      you have little time for small talk  people at streeling comment on that  yet you speak freely with me .         i try not to blather .         being male is complicated .         so is being female  though you   ve mastered it beautifully .         i   ll take that as a rather formal compliment .         and so it was .  just plain being human is just plain hard .         so i am finding .  you .  .  . learned all this on helicon .         i learned to deal with essentials .         also to hate fluctuations .  they can kill you .      he took a swig of the beer  still cold and biting .     i hadn   t thought of it that way .         why didn   t you say all this in the first place .             i didn   t know it in the first place .         a corollary  then  if you commit yourself to a woman you give away as much of yourself as you can  inside that enclosed space .         the volume between the two of us .         a geometric analogy is as good as any .     the tip of her tongue made her lower lip bulge out slightly  as it always did when she pondered a point .     and you commit yourself wholly to averting the price life exacts .         the price of .  .  . fluctuations .         if you can predict  you can avoid .  correct .  manage .         this is awfully analytic .         i   ve skipped over the hard parts  but they will be on the homework assignment .         usually these kinds of talk use phrases like    optimally consolidated self .     i   ve been waiting for the jargon to come trotting out .     he had finished the bowl and felt much better .      food is one of the life affirming experiences .         so that   s why i do it .         now you   re making fun of me .         no  just working out the implications of the theory .  i liked the part about hating unpredictability and fluctuations because they hurt people .         so can empires  if they fall .         right .     he finished the beer and thought about having another .  any more would dull him a little .  he would prefer another way to take from him the edge he still felt .      big appetite .     she smiled .      you have no idea .  and the prospect of death can stimulate more than one kind of appetite .  let   s go back to that part about the homework assignment .         you have something in mind .      he grinned .     you have no idea .          .     he savored his work all the more  since he had less time for it .   hari sat in his darkened office  absolutely still  watching the  d numerics evolve like luminous fogs in the air before him .   empire scholars had known the root basics of psychohistory for millennia .  in ancient times  pedants had charted the twenty six stable and meta stable social systems .  there were plenty of devolved planets to study  fallen into barbarism  like the porcos and their raging rituals  the lizzies and their gynogoverns .   he watched the familiar patterns form  as his simulation stepped through centuries of galactic evolution .  some social systems proved stable only on small scales .   in the air hung the ranks of whole worlds  caught in stable zones  primitive socialism  femopastoralism  macho tribalism .  these were the    strong at tractors    of human sociology  islands in the chaos sea .   some societies labored through their meta stability  then crashed  theocracy  transcendentalism  macho feudalism .  this latter appeared whenever people had metallurgy and agriculture .  planets which had slid a long way down the curve would manifest it .   imperial scholars had long justified the empire  threaded by narrow wormholes and lumbering hyperships  as the best human social structure .  it had indeed proved stable and benevolent .   their reigning model  benign imperial feudalism  accepted that humans were hierarchical .  as well  they were dynastically ambitious  liking the continuity of power and its pomp .  they were quite devoted to symbols of unity  of imperial grandeur .  gossip about the great was  for most people  the essence of history itself .   imperial power was moderated by traditions of noble leadership  the assumed superiority of those who rose to greatness .  beneath such impressive resplendence  as cleon well knew  lay the bedrock of an extremely honest  meritocratic civil service .  without that  corruption would spread like a stain across the stars  corroding the splendor .   he watched the diagram  a complex  d web of surfaces  the landscape of social space .   slow stepped  he could see individual event waves washing through the sim .  each cell in the grid got recomputed every clock cycle  readjusting every nearest neighbor interaction in  d .   the working rules of thumb were not the true laws of physics  built up from fundamentals like maxion mechanics  or even from the simple newtown laws .  rather  they were rough algorithms that reduced intricate laws to trivial arithmetic .  society seen raw this way was crude  not mysterious at all .   then came chaos .   he was viewing the    policy space     with its family of variables  degree of polarity  or power concentration  size of coalitions  conflict scale .  in this simple model  learning loops emerged .  starting from a plateau period of seeming stability but not stasis  the system produced a challenger idea .   this threatened stability  which forced formation of coalitions to oppose the challenge .  factions formed .  then they gelled .  the coalitions could be primarily religious  political  economic  technological  even military  though this last was a particularly ineffective method  the data showed .  the system then veered into a chaotic realm  sometimes emerging to new stability  sometimes decaying .   in the dynamic system there was a pressure created by the contrast between people   s ideal picture of the world and the reality .  too big a difference drove fresh forces for change .  often the forces were apparently unconscious  people knew something was wrong  felt restive  but could not fix on a clear cause .   so much for    rational actor    models  hari thought .  yet some still clung to that obviously dumb approximation .   everyone thought the empire was simple .   not the bulk of the population  of course  dazzled by the mix of cultures and exotica afforded by trade and communications from myriad worlds .  they were perpetually distracted  an important damper on chaos .   even to social theorists  though  the basic structure and interrelations seemed to be predictable  with a moderate number of feedback loops  solid and traditional .  conventional wisdom held that these could be easily separated out and treated .   most important  there was central decision making  or so most thought .  the emperor knew best  right .   in reality  the empire was a nested  ordered hierarchy  imperial feudalism .  at the lower bound were the zones of the galaxy  sometimes only a dozen light years across  up to a few thousand light years diameter .  above that were compacts of a few hundred nearby zones .  the compacts interlocked into the galactic cross linked system .   but the whole thing was sliding downhill .  in the complex diagram  sparkling flickers came and went .  what were those .   hari close upped the flares .  zones of chaos  where predictability becomes impossible .  these fiery eruptions might be the clue to why the empire was failing .   hari felt in his soul that unpredictability was bad  for humanity  for his mathematics .  but it was inescapable .   this was the secret the emperor and others must never know .  that until he could rule chaos  or at least peer into it  psychohistory was a fraud .   he decided to look at a single case .  maybe that would be cleaner .   he selected sark  the world which had found and developed the voltaire and joan sims .  it billed itself as the home of the new renaissance  a common rhetorical posture  often adopted .  they seemed bright and creative as he reviewed the status grids .   hari yawned despite himself .  sure  sark looked good for now .  a booming economy .  a leader in styles and fashion .   but its profile classed it among the chaos worlds .  they rose for a while  seeming to defy the damping mechanisms that held planets in the imperial equilibrium .   then their social fabric dissolved .  they plummeted back into one of the stasis states  anarcho industrial for sark  he would predict  from the data .  no great fleets made this happen .  the empire did not  despite impressions  rule by force .  social evolutions made the chaos worlds falter and die .  usually  the galaxy as a whole suffered few repercussions .   but lately  there had been more of them .  and the empire was visibly decaying .  productivity was down  incoherence in the social spaces on the rise .   why .   he got up and went for a workout at the gymnasium .  enough of the mind .  let his body sweat out the frustrations wrought by his intellect .       .     he did not want to go to the grand imperial universities colloquy  but the imperial protocol office leaned on him .  .  . a first ministerial candidate has obligations     the officious woman had informed him .   so he and dors dutifully appeared at the enormous imperial festival hall .  his specials wore discreet formal business suits  complete with the collar ruffles of mid level meritocrats .      all the better to blend into the crowd     dors joked .  hari saw that everyone sized up the men in an instant and gingerly edged away .  he would have been fooled .   they entered a high  double arched corridor  lined with ancient statuary which invited the passersby to lick them .  hari tried it  after carefully reading the glow sign  which reassured him there was no biological risk .  a long  succulent lick gave him a faint  odd flavor of oil and burnt apples  a hint of what the ancients found enticing .      what   s first on the agenda .     he asked his protocol officer .      an audience with the academic potentate     she answered  adding pointedly     alone .      dors disagreed and hari negotiated a compromise .  dors got to stand at the doorway  no more .     i   ll have appetizers served to you there     the protocol officer said testily .   dors gave her an icy smile .     why is this  ah     audience    so important .      the protocol officer gave her a pitying look .     the potentate carries much weight in the high council .      hari said soothingly     and can throw a few votes my way .         a bit of polite talk     the protocol officer said .      i shall promise to  let me put this delicately  smooch his buttocks .  or hers  as the case may be .      dors smiled .     better not be hers .         intriguing  how the implications of the act switch with sex .      the protocol officer coughed and ushered him deftly through snapping screen curtains  his hair sizzling .  apparently even an academic potentate had need of personal security measures .   once within the formal staterooms  hari found he was alone with a woman of considerable age and artificial beauties .  so that was why the protocol officer had coughed .      how very nice of you to come .     she stood motionless  one hand extended  limp at the wrist .  a waterfall effect spattered behind her  framing her body well .   he felt as if he were walking into a still life museum display .  he didn   t know whether to shake her hand or kiss it .  he shook it  and her look made him think he had chosen wrong .   she wore a lot of embedded makeup  and from the way she leaned forward to make a point  he gathered that her pale eyes got her a lot of things other people did not receive .   she had once been an original thinker  a nonlinear philosopher .  now meritocrats across the spiral arms owed her fealty .   before they had sat down  she gestured .     oh  would you tune that wall haze .     the waterfall effect had turned into a roiling  thick fog .     somehow it gets wrong all the time and the room doesn   t adjust it .      a way of establishing a hierarchy  hari suspected .  get him used to doing little tasks at her bidding .  or maybe she was like some other women  who if they couldn   t get you to do minor services felt insecure .  or maybe she was just inept and wanted her waterfall back .  or maybe he just analyzed the hell out of everything  a mathist   s pattern .      i   ve heard remarkable things about your work     she said  shifting from high figure used to snappy obedience to gracious lady putting an underling at ease .  he said something noncommittal .  a tiktok brought a stim which was barely liquid  drifting down his throat and into his nostrils like a silken  sinister cloud .      you believe yourself practical enough for the ministership .         nothing is more practical  more useful  than a sound theory .         said like a true mathist .  speaking for all meritocrats  i do hope you are equal to the task .      he thought of telling her  she did have a certain charm  after all  that he didn   t give a damn for the ministership .  but some intuition held him back .  she was another power broker .  he knew she had been vindictive in the past .   she gave him a shrewd smile .     i understand you have charmed the emperor with a theory of history .         at the moment it is little better than a description .         a sort of summary .         breakthroughs for the brilliant  syntheses for the driven .         surely you know there is an air of futility about such an ambition .     a gleam of steel in the pale eyes .       i was .  .  . unaware .  madam .         science is simply an arbitrary construct .  it perpetuates the discredited notion that progress is always possible .  let alone desirable .         oh .     he had plastered a polite smile on his face and was damned if he would let it slip .      only oppressive social orders emerge from such ideas .  science   s purported objectivity hides the plain fact that it is simply one    language game    among others .  all such arbitrary configurations sit in a conceptual universe of competing discourses .         i see .     the smile was getting heavier .  his face felt like it would crack .      to elevate scientific      she sniffed disdainfully      so called    truths    over other constructions is tantamount to colonizing the intellectual landscape .  to enslaving one   s opposition .         ummm .     he had a sinking feeling that he was not going to last long as a door mat .     before you even consider the subject  you claim to know the best way to study it .         social theory and linguistic analysis have the final power  since all truths have quite limited historical and cultural validity .  therefore  this    psychohistory    of all societies is absurd .      so she knew the term  word was spreading .     perhaps you have insufficient regard for the rough rub of the real .      a slight thawing .     clever phrasing  academician .  still  the category    real    is a social construction .         look  of course science is a social process .  but scientific theories don   t merely reflect society .         how charming to still think so .     a wan smile failed to conceal the icy gleam in her eyes .      theories are not mere changes of fashion  like shifting men   s skirts from short to long .         academician  you must know that there is nothing knowable beyond human discourses .      he kept his voice level  courteous .  point out that she had used    know    in two contradictory ways in the same sentence .  no  that would be playing word games  which would subtly support her views .     sure  mountain climbers might argue and theorize about the best route to the top          always in ways conditioned by their history and social structures            but once they get there  they know it .  nobody would say they    constructed the mountain .         she pursed her lips and had another foggy white stim .     ummm .  elementary realism .  but all of your    facts    embody theory .  ways of seeing .         i can   t help noticing that anthropologists  sociologists  the whole gang  get a delicious rush of superiority by denying the objective reality of the hard sciences    discoveries .      she drew herself up .     there are no elemental truths that exist independent of the people  languages  and cultures that make them .         you don   t believe in objective reality  then .         who   s the object .      he had to laugh .     language play .  so linguistic structures dictate how we see .         isn   t that obvious .  we live in a galaxy rich in cultures  all seeing the galaxy their way .         but obeying laws .  plenty of research shows that thought and perception precede talk  exist independent of language .         what laws .         laws of social movement .  a theory of social history  if we had one .         you attempt the impossible .  and if you wish to be first minister  enjoying the support of your fellow academics and meritocrats  you shall have to follow the prevailing view of our society .  modern learning is animated by a frank incredulity toward such meta narratives .      he was sorely tempted to say  then you are going to be surprised  but instead said     we shall see .         we don   t see things as they are     the learned lady said     we see them as we are .      with a touch of sadness  he realized that the republic of intellectual inquiry was  like the empire  not free of internal decay .       .     the academic potentate led him out with ritual words to smooth the way  and dors was standing attentively at the grand entrance .  still  hari had gotten the essential message  the academic meritocracy would back him for first minister if he at least paid lip service to prevailing orthodoxy .   together  with the customary academic honor guard  they went down into the vast rotunda .  this was a dizzying bowl with various scholarly disciplines represented by the full regalia and insignia  splashed across immense wall designs .  below them swirled a chattering mob  thousands of the finest minds gathered for speeches  learned reports  and of course much infighting of the very finest sort .      think we can survive this .     hari whispered .      don   t let go     dors said  seizing his hand .   he realized that she had taken his question literally .   a little later the academic potentate wasn   t making a show of savoring the bouquet of the stims anymore  just sucking them up like one of the major food groups .  she steered hari and dors from one cluster of the learned to another .  occasionally she would remember her role as hostess and feign interest in him as more than a chess piece in a larger game .  unfortunately these blunt attempts fastened upon inquiries into his personal life .   dors resisted these inquisitions  of course  smiling and shaking her head .  when the potentate turned to hari and asked     do you exercise .     he could not resist replying     i exercise restraint .      the protocol officer frowned  but hari   s remark went unnoticed in the jostling throng .  he found the company of his fellow members of the professoriat oddly off putting .  their conversations had a directionless irony  which conveyed with raised eyebrows and arch tones the speaker   s superiority to everything he was commenting upon .   their acerbic paradoxes and stiletto humor struck hari as irritating and beside the point .  he knew well that the most savage controversies are about matters for which there is no good evidence either way .  still  there was a mannered desperation even to the scientists .   fundamental physics and cosmology had been well worked out far back in antiquity .  now all of imperial scientific history dealt with teasing out intricate details and searching for clever applications .  humankind was trapped in a cosmos steadily expanding  though slowing slightly  and destined to see the stars wink out .  a slow  cool glide into an indefinite future was ordained by the mass energy content present at the very conception of the universe .  humans could do nothing against that fate .  except  of course  understand it .   so the grandest of intellectual territories had been opened  and that can only be done once .  now scientists were less like discoverers than like settlers  even tourists .   he should not be surprised  he realized  to find that even the best of them  gathered from an entire galaxy  should have an air of jaded brilliance  like tarnished gold .   meritocrats did not have many children and there was an airy sterility about them .  hari wondered if there was a middle ground between the staleness he felt here and the chaos of the    renaissances    sprouting up on chaos worlds .  perhaps he needed to know more about basic human nature .   the protocol officer steered him down a spiral air ramp  electrostatics seizing them and gently lowering the party toward  he looked down with trepidation  the obligatory media people .  he braced himself .  dors squeezed his hand .     do you have to talk to them .      he sighed .     if i ignore them  they will report that .         let lamurk amuse them .         no .     his eyes narrowed .     since i   m in this  i might as well play to win .      her eyes widened with revelation .     you   ve decided  haven   t you .         to try .  you bet .         what happened .         that woman back there  the potentate .  she and her kind think the world   s just a set of opinions .         what has that got to do with lamurk .         i can   t explain it .  they   re all part of the decay .  maybe that   s it .      she studied his face .     i   ll never understand you .         good .  that would be dull  yes .      the media pack approached     snouts aimed like weapons .   hari whispered to dors     every interview begins as a seduction and ends as a betrayal .     they descended .      academician seldon  you are known as a mathist  a candidate first minister  and a heliconian .  you          i only realized i was a heliconian when i came to trantor .         and your career as a mathist          i only realized that i thought as a mathist when i began meeting politicians .         well then  as a politician          i am still a heliconian .     this drew some laughter .      you prize the traditional  then .         if it works .         we be not open to old ideas     a willowy woman from the fornax zone said .     future of empire comes from people  not laws .  agree .      she was a rational  using their stripped down  utterly orderly galactic  free of irregular verbs and complex constructions .  hari could follow it well enough  but for him the odd swerves and turns of classical galactic embodied its charm .   to hari   s delight  several people disagreed with her formulated question  shouting .  in the noise he reflected on the infinity of human cultures  represented in this vast bowl and still united under classical galactic .   the language   s sturdy base had stitched together the early empire .  for many millennia now the language had sat on its laurels  admittedly .  he had added a small interaction term to his equations to allow for the cultural ripples excited by the splashing of a new argot into the linguistic pool .  the ancient ruffles and flourishes of galactic allowed subtleties denied the rationals  or rats  as some called them  and the fun of puns as well .   he tried to make this case to the woman  but she retorted     not support oddity .  support order .  old ways failed .  as mathist you will be too        come now .     hari said  irked .     even in closed axiomatic systems  not all propositions are decidable .  i suggest you cannot predict what i would do as a first minister .         think you council submits to reason .     the woman asked haughtily .      it is the triumph of reason to get on well with those who possess none     hari said .  to his surprise  some applauded .      your theory of history denies god   s powers to intervene in human affairs .     a thin man from a low grav planet asserted .     what say you to that .      hari was about to agree  it seemed to make no difference to him  when dors stepped before him .      perhaps i can bring up a bit of research  since this is an academic proceeding .     she smiled smoothly .     i ran across an historian of about a thousand years ago who had tested for the power of prayer .       hari   s mouth made a surprised  skeptical   .  the thin man demanded     how could one scientifically          he reasoned that the people most prayed for were the most famous .  yet they had to be exalted  above the fray .         the emperors .     the thin man was rapt .      exactly .  and their lesser family members .  he analyzed their mortality rates .      hari had never heard this  but his innate skepticism demanded detail .     allowing for their better medical care  and safety from ordinary accidents .      dors grinned .     of course .  plus their risk of assassination .      the thin man did not know where this line of attack was going  but his curiosity got the better of him .     and .  .  .  .      dors said     he found that emperors died earlier than unprayed for people .      the thin man looked shocked  angry .  hari asked dors     what was the root mean deviation .         always the skeptic .  not sufficient to prove that prayer had an actually harmful effect .         ah .     the crowd seemed to find this example of tag team puffery entertaining .  best to leave them wanting more .     thank you     he said  and they melted away behind a screen of specials .   that left the crowd itself .  cleon had urged him to mingle with these folk  supposedly his basic power base  the meritocrats .  hari wrinkled his nose and nonetheless plunged in .   it was a matter of style  he realized after the first thirty minutes .   he had learned early in rural helicon to place great store in good manners and civility .  among the alert  hard edged academics he had found many who seemed poorly socialized  until he realized that they were operating out of a different culture  where cleverness mattered more than grace .  their subtle shadings of voice carried arrogance and assurance in precarious balance  which in unguarded moments tilted into acerbic  cutting judgment  often without even the appealing veneer of wit .  he had to make himself remember to say    with all due respect     at the beginning of an argument  and even to mean it .   then there were the unspoken elements .   among the fast track circles  body language was essential  a taught skill .  there were carefully designed poses for confidence  impatience  submission  four shadings   threat  esteem  coyness and dozens more .  codified and understood unconsciously  each induced a specific desired neurological state in both self and others .  the rudiments for a full blown craft lay in dance  politics  and the martial arts .  by being systematic  much more could be conveyed .  as with language  a dictionary helped .   a nonlinear philosopher of galaxy wide fame gave hari a beaming smile  body language screaming self confidence  and said     surely  professor  you cannot maintain that your attempt to import math into history can somehow work .  people can be what they wish .  no equations will make them otherwise .         i seek to describe  that   s all .         no grand theory of history  then .      avoid a direct denial  he thought .     i will know i   m on the right track when i can simply describe a bit of human nature .         ah  but that scarcely exists     the man said with assurance  arms and chest turned adroitly .      of course there   s a human nature .     hari shot back .   a pitying smile  a lazy shrug .     why should there be .         heredity interacts with environment to tug us back toward a fixed mean .  it gathers people in all societies  across millions of worlds  into the narrow statistical circle that we must call human nature .         i don   t think there are enough general traits          parent child bonding .  division of labor between the sexes .         well  surely that   s common among all animals .  i          incest avoidance .  altruism  we call it    humanitarianism     a telling clue  eh .   toward our near kin .         well  those are just normal family          look at the dark side .  suspicion of strangers .  tribalism  witness trantor   s eight hundred sectors  .  hierarchies in even the smallest groups  from the emperor   s court to a bowling team .         surely you can   t make such leaps  such simplistic  grotesque comparisons          i can and do .  male dominance  generally  and when resources are scarce  marked territorial aggression .         these are little traits .         they link us .  the sophisticated trantorian and an arcadian farmer can still understand each other   s lives  for the simple reason that their common humanity lives in the genes they share from many tens of millennia ago .      this outburst was not received well .  faces wrinkled  mouths pouched in disapproval .   hari saw he had overstepped .  what   s more  he had nearly exposed psychohistory .   yet he found it hard to not speak frankly .  in his view the humanities and social sciences shrank to specialized branches of both mathematics and biology .  history  biography  and fiction were symptoms .  anthropology and sociology together became the sociobiology of a single species .  but he could not get a feel for how to include that in the equations .  he had spoken out  he saw suddenly  because he was frustrated  by his own lack of understanding .   still  that did not excuse his stupidity .  he opened his mouth to smooth over the waters .   he saw the agitated man coming up on his left .  mouth awry  eyes white  hand extended  poking forward  a tube in it  chromed and sleek and with a precise hole at the tip  a dark spot that expanded as he looked at it until it seemed like the eater of all things that lurked at galactic center  immense  dors hit the man quite expertly .  she deflected the arm up  jabbed him in the throat  struck next at the belly .  then she twisted the arm and forced him into a quarter turn  her left leg coming around and cutting his feet from beneath him  her right hand forcing the head down    and they struck the floor solidly  dors on top  the gun skittering away among the shoes of the crowd  which was falling back in panic .   specials blocked in around him and he saw no more .  he shouted to dors .  screams and shouts hammered at him from all sides .   more bedlam .  then he was clear of the specials and the man was getting up and dors was standing  holding the pistol  shaking her head .  the man who had pointed it struggled to his feet .      a recording tube     she said in disgust .      what .     hari could barely hear in the noise .   the man   s left arm was sticking out at a wrong angle  plainly broken .     i  i agreed with your every word     the man croaked out  his face a ghastly white .     really .          .     hari   s father had derisively referred to most public affairs as    dust ups      a big cloud on the horizon  a tiny speck underneath .  his lip had curled back in a farmer   s disdain for making more of a thing than it was .   the incident at the grand imperial universities colloquy had become a grand dustup .  fully  d   d  the scandal  prof   s wife socks fan  burgeoned with each replaying .   cleon called  tsk tsking  and commenting broadly on how wives could be a burden in high office .     this will hurt your candidacy  i fear     he had said .     i must do some mending .      hari did not report this to dors .  cleon   s hint was clear .  it was common practice among imperial circles to divorce on grounds of general unsuitability  which meant unfashionability .  in matters of vast power  appetite for more often overwhelmed all other emotions  even love .   he went home  irked by this conversation  to find dors at work in the kitchen .  she had her arms open  literally  not in greeting .   the epidermis hung loose  as if she had pulled a tight glove halfway off .  veins interlaced with the artificial neural net and she was working with tiny tools among them .  supple skin peeled back in a curved line down from elbow to wrist  moist crimson and intricate electronics .  she was working on the augmented wrist  a thin yellow collar that did not look as though it could take three times the normal human   s impact .      that fellow damaged you .         no  i did it to myself  or rather  overdid it .         a sprain .      she smiled without humor .     my pivots don   t sprain .  the collar mounts don   t mend .  i   m replacing them .         jobs like this  it   s not the parts  it   s the labor .      she looked at him quizzically and he decided not to pursue the joke .  he normally put from his mind the fact that his true love was a robot  or more accurately  a humaniform  vastly technically assisted  human robot synthesis .   she had come to him through r .  daneel olivaw  the ancient positronic robot who had saved hari when he first came to trantor and ran afoul of nasty political forces .  she had been assigned at first as a bodyguard .  he had known what she was from the start  at least approximately  but that did not prevent him from falling in love with her .  intelligence  character  charm  a simmering sexuality  these were not purely human facets  he had learned  by direct example .   he got her a drink as she worked  biding his time .  he had ceased to be amazed by her repair work  often carried out on an utterly unsanitized field .  there were antimicrobial methods available to the humaniform robots that could not work for ordinary humans  she had said .  he had no idea how this could be .  she discouraged further discussion  often deflecting him with passion .  he had to admit that as a ploy this was completely effective .   she rolled her skin back into place  grimacing at the pain .  she could shut off whole sections of her superficial nervous system  he knew  but kept a few strands alert as a diagnostic .  the tabs self sealed with pops and purrs .      let   s see .     she paused  feeling each wrist in turn .  two quick snaps .     they lock in fine .         most people  you know  would find this sight quite unsettling .         that   s why i don   t do it on the way to work .         very public spirited of you .      they both knew she would be hounded down if there were any suspicion of her true nature .  robots of advanced capability had been illegal for millennia .  tiktoks were acceptable precisely because they were low grade intelligences  rigorously held below the threshold of legally defined sentience .  violating those standards in manufacture was a capital crime  an imperial violation  no exceptions .  and strong  ancient emotions backed up the law  the junin sector riots had proved that .   numerical simulations were similarly restricted .  that was why the voltaire and joan sims  developed by the    new renaissance    hotheads on sark  had been carefully tailored to squeeze through algorithmic loopholes .  apparently that marq fellow at artifice associates had souped up the voltaire at the last minute .  since the sim was then erased  the violation had escaped detection .   hari did not like having even a slight connection to crime  but he now realized that this was foolishness .  already his entire life revolved around dors  a hidden pariah .      i   m going to withdraw from the first minister business     he said decisively .   she blinked .     me .      she was always quick .     yes .         we had agreed that the risk of increased scrutiny was worth gaining some power .         to protect psychohistory .  but i expected very little of the spotlight to fall upon you .  now          i am an embarrassment .         coming in downstairs  there were a dozen  d snouts pointing at me .  they   re waiting for you .         i will stay here  then .         for how long .         the specials can take me out through a new entrance .  they   ve cut one and installed an agrav shaft .         you can   t avoid them forever  darling .      she got up and embraced him .     even if they find me out  i can go away .         if you   re lucky and escape .  even if you do  i can   t live without you .  i won   t          i could be transformed .         another body .         a different one .  skin  corneas  some neural signatures changed .         file the serial numbers off and send you back .      she stiffened in his arms .     yes .         what can   t your   kind   do .         we cannot invent psychohistory .      he whirled away from her in frustration and smacked his palm against a wall .     damn it  nothing is as important as us .         i feel the same .  but now i think it is even more important for you to remain a candidate for first minister .         why .     he paced around their living room  eyes darting .      you are a player for very high stakes .  whoever wishes to assassinate you          lamurk  cleon believes .           will probably see that merely withdrawing your candidacy is no firm solution .  the emperor could reintroduce you into the game at any later time .         i don   t like being treated as a chess piece .         a knight .   yes  i can see you that way .  do not forget that there are other suspects  factions which may wish you out of the way .         such as .            the academic potentate .         but she   s a scholar  like me .         was .  she is now a player on the chessboard .         not the queen  i hope .      dors kissed him lightly .     i should mention that my ferret programs turned up a plausibility matrix for lamurk   s behavior  based on his past .  he has eliminated at least half a dozen rivals on his rise to the top .  he is something of a traditionalist in method  as well .         my  that   s comforting .      she gave him an odd  pensive glance .     his rivals were all knifed .  the classic dispatch of historical intrigue .         i wouldn   t suspect lamurk to have such an eye for our imperial heritage .         he is a classicist .  in his view  you are a pawn  one best swept from the board .         a rather bloodless way to put it .         i am taught  and built  to assess and act coolly .         how do you reconcile your ability  in fact  let   s not put too fine a point on it  your relish  at the prospect of killing a person in my defense .         the zeroth law .          um .     he recited     humanity as a whole is placed above the fate of a single human .         i do feel pain from first law interaction .  .  .         so the first law  now modified  is    a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  unless this would violate the zeroth law of robotics    .         exactly .          this is another game you play .  with very tough rules .         it is a larger game .         and psychohistory is a potential new set of game plans .         in a way .     her voice softened and she embraced him .     you should not trouble yourself so .  what we have is a private paradise .         but the damned games  they always go on .         they must .      he kissed her longingly  but something inside him seethed and spun  an armature whirring fruitlessly in surrounding darkness .       .     yugo was waiting in his office the next morning .  face flushed  wide eyed  he demanded     what can you do .         uh  about what .         the news .  the safeguards stormed the bastion .         uh  oh .     hari vaguely recalled that a dahlite faction had staged a minor revolt and holed up in a redoubt .  negotiations had dragged on .  yes  and yugo had told him about it  several times .     it   s a local trantorian issue  isn   t it .         that   s the way we kept it .     yugo   s hands flew in elaborate gestures  like birds taking frenzied flight .     then the safeguards came in .  no warning .  killed over four hundred .  blew    em apart  blasters on full  no warning .         astonishing     hari said in what he hoped was a sympathetic tone .   in fact he did not care a microgram for one side of this argument or the other  and did not know the arguments  anyway .  he had never cared for the world   s day to day turbulence  which agitated the mind without teaching anything .  the whole point of psychohistory  which emerged from his personality as much as his analytic ability  was to study climate and ignore weather .      can   t you do something .         what .         protest to the emperor .         he will ignore me .  this is a trantorian issue and          this is an insult to you  too .         it can   t be .     to not appear totally out of it  he added     i   ve deliberately kept well away from the issue          but lamurk did this .      that startled him .     what .  lamurk has no power on trantor .  he   s an imperial regent .         c   mon  hari  nobody believes that old separation of powers stuff .  it broke down long ago .      hari almost said  it did .   but just in time realized that yugo was right .  he had simply not added up the effects of the long  slow erosion in the imperial structures .  those entered as factors on the right hand side of the equations  but he never thought of the decay in solid  local terms .     so you think it   s a move to gain influence on the high council .         must be     yugo fumed .     those regents  they don   t like unruly folk livin    near    em .  they want trantor nice and orderly  even if people get trampled .      hari ventured     the representation issue again  is it .         damn right .  we got dahlites all over muscle shoals sector .  but can we get a representative .  hell  no .  got to beg and plead          i .  .  . i will do what i can .     hari held up his hands to cut off the tirade .      the emperor  he   ll straighten things out .      hari knew from direct observation that the emperor would do no such thing .  he cared nothing of how trantor was run  as long as he could see no burning districts from the palace .  cleon had often remarked     i am emperor of a galaxy  not a city .      yugo left and hari   s desk chimed .     imperial specials    captain to see you  sir .         i told them to remain outside .         he requests audience  bearing a message .      hari sighed .  he had meant to get some thinking done today .   the captain entered stiffly and refused a chair .     i am here to respectfully forward the recommendations of the specials board  academician .         a letter would suffice .  in fact  do that  send me a note .  i have work to          sir  most respectfully  i must discuss this .      hari sank into his chair and waved permission .  the man looked uncomfortable  standing stiffly as he said     the board requests that the academician   s wife not accompany him to state functions .         ah  so someone has yielded to pressure .         it is further directed that your wife not be allowed into the palace at all .         what .  that seems extreme .         i am sorry to bear such a message  sir .  i was there and i told the board that the lady had good reason to become alarmed .         and to break the fellow   s arm .      the captain almost allowed himself a smile .     got to admit  she   s faster than anybody i   ve ever seen .      and you   re wondering why  aren   t you .     who was the fellow .      the captain   s brow furrowed .     looks to be a spiral academician  one grade above you  sir .  but some say he   s more a political type .      hari waited  but the man said no more  just looked as though he wanted to .     allied with what faction .         might be that lamurk  sir .         any evidence .         nossir .      hari sighed .  politics was not only an inexact craft  it seldom had any reliable data  either .     very well .  message received .      the captain left quickly  with visible relief .  before hari could wave his computer into life  a delegation from his own faculty showed up .  they filed in silently  the portal crackling as it inspected each of them .  hari caught himself smiling at the procedure .  if there was a profession least likely to yield an assassin  it had to be the mathists .      we are here to submit our considered opinion     a professor aangon said formally .      do so     hari said .  normally he would deploy his skimpy skills and do a bit of social mending  he had been neglecting university business lately  stealing time from bureaucratic chores to devote to equations .   aangon said     first  rumors of a    theory of history    have brought scorn to our department .  we          there is no such theory .  only some descriptive analysis .      an outright denial confused aangon  but he plowed ahead .     uh  second  we deplore the apparent choice of your assistant  yugo amaryl  as department head  should you resign .  it is an affront to senior faculty  vastly senior  above a junior mathist of  shall we say  minimal social bearing .         meaning .     hari said ominously .      we do not believe politics should enter into academic decisions .  the insurrection of dahlites  which amaryl has vocally supported  and which has now been put down only through imperial resolve  and actual armed force  makes him unsuitable          enough .  your third point .         there is the matter of the assault upon a member of our profession .         a member  oh  the fellow my wife .  .  .  .         indeed  an indignity without parallel  an outrage  by a member of your family .  it makes your position here untenable .      if someone had planned the incident  they were certainly getting their mileage out of it .     i reject that .      professor aangon   s eyes became flinty .  the other faculty had been shuffling around  uneasy  and now were bunched behind him .  hari had no doubts about who this group wanted to be the next chairman .     i should think that a vote of no confidence by the full faculty  in a formal meeting          don   t threaten me .         i am merely pointing out that while your attention is directed elsewhere        the first ministership .           you can scarcely be expected to carry out your duties          skip it .  to hold a formal meeting  the chairman must call one .      the bunch of professors rustled  but nobody said anything .      and i won   t .         you can   t go for long without carrying out business which requires our consent     aangon said shrewdly .      i know .  let   s see how long that can be .         you really must reconsider .  we          out .         what .  you cannot          out .  go .      they went .       .     it is never easy to deal with criticism  especially when there is every chance that it might be right .   aside from the eternal maneuvering for position and status  hari knew that his fellow meritocrats from the academic potentate to the members of his own department  with legions in between  had deeply felt grounds for objecting to what he was doing .   they had caught a whiff of psychohistory  wafted by rumor .  that alone put their hackles up  stiff and sensitive .  they could not accept the possibility that humanity could not control its own future  that history was the result of forces acting beyond the horizons of mere mortal men .  could they already be sniffing at a truth hari knew from elaborate  decades long study  that the empire had endured because of its higher  metanature  not the valiant acts of individuals  or even of worlds .   people of all stripes believed in human selfdetermination .  usually they started from a gut feeling that they acted on their own  that they had reached their opinions on the basis of internal reasoning  that is  they argued from the premises of the paradigm itself .  this was circular  of course .  but that did not make such arguments wrong or even ineffectual .  as persuasion  the feeling of being in control was powerful .  everyone wanted to believe they were masters of their own fate .  logic had nothing to do with it .   and who was he to say they were wrong .      hari .      it was yugo  looking a bit timid .     come in  friend .         we got a funny request just a minute ago .  some research institute i never heard of offerin    us significant money .         for what .     money was always handy .      in return for the base file on those sims from sark .         voltaire and joan .  the answer is no .  who wants them .         dunno .  we got    em  all filed away .  the originals .         find out who   s asking .         i tried .  can   t trace the prompt .         ummm .  that   s odd .         that   s why i thought i   d tell you .  smells funny .         keep up a tracing program  in case they ask again .         yessir .  and about the dahlite bastion          give it a rest .         i mean  look at how the imperials squashed that junin mess .      hari let yugo go on .  he had long ago mastered the academic art of appearing to pay rapt attention while his mind worked a spiral arm away .   he knew he would have to speak to the emperor about the dahlite matter  and not only to counter lamurk   s move  an audacious one  within the traditionally inviolate realm of trantor .  a quick  bloody solution to a tough issue .  clean  brutal .   the dahlites had a case  they were underrepresented .  and unpopular .  and reactionary .   the fact that dahlites  except for prodigies lifted up by the scruff of their neck  like yugo  were hostile to the usual instincts of a scientific mind made no difference .   in fact  hari was beginning to doubt whether the stiff  formal scientific establishment was worthy of high regard any longer .  all around him he saw corruption of the impartiality of science  from the boonsmanship networking to the currying of imperial scraps which passed for a promotion system .   just yesterday he had been visited by a dean of adjustments who had advised  with oily logic  that hari use some of his imperial power to confer a boon upon a professor who had done very little work  but who had family ties to the high council .   the dean had said quite sincerely     don   t you think it is in the better interests of the university that you grant a small boon to one with influence .     when hari did not  he nonetheless called the fellow to tell him why .   the dean was astonished with such honesty .  only later did hari decide that the dean was right  within his own logic system .  if boons were mere benefits  simple largess  then why not confer them wholly on political grounds .  it was an alien way of thinking  but consistent  he had to admit .   hari sighed .  when yugo paused in his vehement tirade  hari smiled .  no  wrong response .  a worried frown  there  that did it .  yugo launched back into rapid talk  arms taking wing  epithets stacked to improbable heights .   hari realized that the mere exposure to politics as it truly was  the brutal struggle of blind swarms in shadow  had raised doubts about his own  rather smug  positions .  was the science he had so firmly believed in back on helicon truly as useful to people like the dahlites as he imagined .   so his musing came around to his equations  could the empire ever be driven by reason and moral decision  rather than power and wealth .  theocracies had tried  and failed .  scientocracies  rather more rarely  had been too rigid to last .        and i said  sure  hari can do that     yugo finished .      uh  what .         back the alphoso plan for dahlite representation  of course .         i will think about it     hari said to cover .     meanwhile  let   s hear a report on that longevity angle you were pursuing .         i gave it to three of those new research assistants     yugo said soberly  his dahlite energies expended .     they couldn   t make sense of it .         if you   re a lousy hunter  the woods are always empty .      yugo   s startled look made hari wonder if he was getting a bit crusty .  politics was taking its toll .      so i worked the longevity factor into the equations  just to see .  here      he slid an ellipsoidal data core into hari   s desk reader      watch what happens .      one persistent heritage of pre antiquity was the standard galactic year  used by all worlds of the imperium in official business .  hari had always wondered  was it a signature of earth   s orbital period .  with its twelve based year of twelve months  each of twenty eight days  it suggested as candidate worlds a mere           from the    million of the empire .  yet spins  precessions  and satellite resonances perturbed all planetary periods .  not a single world of those           fit the g . e .  calendar exactly .  over        came quite close .   yugo started explaining his results .  one curious feature of empire history was the human lifespan .  it was still about l   years  but some early writings suggested that these were nearly twice as long as the    primordial year     as one text had it   which was    natural    to humans .  if so  people lived nearly twice as long as in pre imperial eras .  indefinite extension of the lifespan was impossible  biology always won  in the end .  new maladies moved into the niche provided by the human body .      i got the basics on this from dors  sharp lady     yugo said .     watch this data flash .     curves     projections  sliding sheets of correlations .   the collision between biological science and human culture was always intense  often damaging .  it usually led to a free market policy  in which parents could select desirable traits for their children .   some opted for longevity  increasing to      then even     years .  when a majority were long lived  such planetary societies faltered .  why .      so i traced the equations  watching for outside influences     yugo went on .  gone was the fevered dahlite  here was the brilliance that had made hari pluck yugo out of a sweltering deep layer job  decades ago .   through the equations    graceful  deceptive sinuosity  he had found a curious resonance .  there were underlying cycles in economics and politics  well understood  of about     to     years .   when the human life span reached those ranges  a destructive feedback began .  markets became jagged landscapes  peaking and plunging .  cultures lurched from extravagant excess to puritanical constriction .  within a few centuries  chaos destroyed most of the bioscience capability  or else religious restrictions smothered it .  the mean lifespan slid down again .      how strange     hari said  observing the severe curves of the cycles  their arcs crashing into splintered spokes .     i   ve always wondered why we don   t live longer .         there   s great social pressure against it .  now we know where it comes from .         still .  .  . i   d like to have a centuries long  productive life .      yugo grinned .     look at the media  plays  legends  holos .  the very old are always ugly  greedy misers  trying to keep everything for themselves .         ummm .  true  usually .         and myths .  those who rise from the dead .  vampires .  mummies .  they   re always evil .         no exceptions .      yugo nodded .     dors pulled some really old ones out for me .  there was that ancient martyr  jesu  wasn   t it .         some sort of resurrection myth .         dors says jesu probably wasn   t a real person .  that   s what the scattered  ancient texts say .  the whole myth is prob   ly a collective psychodream .  you   ll notice  once he was back from the dead  he didn   t stay around very long .         rose into heaven  wasn   t it .         left town in a hurry  anyway .  people don   t want you around  even if you   ve beaten the reaper .      yugo pointed at the curves  converging on disaster .     at least we can understand why most societies learn not to let people live too long .      hari studied the event surfaces .     ah  but who learns .         huh .  people  one way or the other .         but no single person ever knew      his finger jabbed      this .         the knowledge gets embedded in taboos  legends  laws .         ummm .     there was an idea here  something larger looming just beyond his intuitions .  .  . and it slipped away .  he would have to wait for it to revisit him  if he ever  these days  got the time to listen to the small  quiet voice that slipped by  whispering  like a shadowy figure on a foggy street .  .  .  .   hari shook himself .     good work  this .  i   m considerably impressed .  publish it .         thought we were keepin    psychohistory quiet .         this is a small element .  people will think the rumors are tarted up versions of this .         psychohistory can   t work if people know .         it   s safe .  the longevity element will get plenty of coverage and stop speculation .         it   ll be a cover  then  against the imperial snoops .         exactly .       yugo grinned .     funny  how they spy even on an    ornament to the imperium     that   s what cleon called you before the regal reception last week .         he did .  i didn   t catch that .         workin    too much on those boon deeds .  you got to hand off that stuff .         we need more resources for psychohistory .         why not just get some money funneled through from the emperor .         lamurk would find out  use it against me .  favoritism in the high council proceedings and so on .  you could write the story yourself .         um  maybe so .  sure would be a whole lot easier  though .         the idea is to keep our heads down .  a void scandal  let cleon do his diplomatic dance .         cleon also said you were a    flower of intellect .     i recorded it for you .         forget it .  flowers that grow too high get picked .           .     dors got as far as the palace high vestibule .  there the imperial guard turned her back .      damn it  she   s my wife     hari said angrily .      sorry  it   s a peremptory order     the bland court official said .  hari could hear the capital letters .  the phalanx of specials around hari did not intimidate this fellow  he wondered if anyone could .      look     he said to dors     there   s a bit of time before the meeting .  let   s eat a bit at the high reception .      she bristled .     you   re not going in .         i thought you understood .  i have to .  cleon   s called this meeting          at lamurk   s instigation .         sure  it   s about this dahlite business .         and that man i knocked down at the reception  he might have been instigated to do it by          right  lamurk .     hari smiled .     all wormholes lead to lamurk .         don   t forget the academic potentate .         she   s on my side .          she wants the ministership  hari .  all the rumor mills say so .         she can damn well have it     he grumbled .      i can   t let you go in there .         this is the palace .     he swept his arm at the ranks of blue and gold in the vast portal .     imperials all around .         i do not like it .         look  we agreed i   d try to bluster past  and it failed  just as i said .  fair enough .  you would never pass the weapons checks  anyway .      her teeth bit delicately into her lower lip  but she said nothing .  no humaniforrn could ever get through the intense weapons screen here .   he said calmly     so i go in  argue  meet you out here        you have the maps and data i organized .         sure  chip embedded .  i can read it with a triple blink .      he had a carrychip embedded in his neck for data hauling  an invaluable aid at mathist conferences .  standard gear  readily accessed .  a microlaser wrote an image on the back of the retina colors   d  a nifty graphics package .  she had installed a lot of maps and background on the imperium  the palace  recent legislation  notable events  anything that might come up in discussions and protocols .   her severe expression dissolved and he saw the woman beneath .     i just .  .  . please .  .  . watch yourself .      he kissed her on the nose .     always do .      they patrolled among the legions of hangers on who thronged the vestibule  snagging the appetizers which floated by on platters .     empire   s going bankrupt and they can afford this     hari sniffed .      it is time honored     dors said .     beaumunn the bountiful disliked delay in consuming meals  which was indeed his principal activity .  he ordered that each of his estates prepare all four daily meals for him  on the chance that he might be there .  the excess is given out this way .      hari would not have believed such an unlikely story had it not come from an historian .  there were knots of people who plainly lived here  using some minor functionary position for an infinite banquet .  he and dors drifted among them  wearing refractory vapors which muddled the appearance .  recognition would bring parasites .      even amid all this swank  you   re thinking about that voltaire problem  aren   t you .     she whispered .      trying to figure out how somebody copied him  it  out of our files .         and someone had requested it  just hours before .     she scowled .     when you turned it down  they simply stole it .         probably imperial agents .         i don   t like it .  they may be trying to implicate you further in the whole junin scandal .         still  the old anti sim taboo is breaking down .     he toasted her .     let   s forget it .  these days  it   s either sims or stims .      there were several thousand people beneath the sculpted dome .  to test the man woman team shadowing them  dors led him on a random path .  hari tired rapidly of such skullduggery .  dors  ever the student of society  pointed out the famous .  she seemed to think this would thrill him  or at least distract him from the meeting to come .  a few recognized him  despite the refraction vapors  and they had to stop and talk .  nothing of substance was ever said at such functions  of course  by long tradition .      time to go in     dors warned him .      spotted the shadows .         three  i think .  if they follow you into the palace  i   ll tell the specials captain .         don   t worry .  no weapons allowed in the palace  remember .         patterns bother me more than possibilities .  the assassination tab delayed detonation just long enough for you to discard it .  but it did make me wary enough to attack that professor .         which got you banned from the palace .     hari completed the thought .     you   re giving people a lot of credit for intricate maneuvers .         you haven   t read very much history of imperial politics  have you .         thank god  no .         it would only trouble you     she said  kissing him with sudden  surprising fervor .     and worry is my job .         i   ll see you in a few hours     hari said as casually as he could manage  despite a dark premonition .  he added to himself  i hope .   he entered the palace proper through the usual arms checks and protocol officers .  nothing  not even a carbon knife or implosion nugget  could escape their many snouted sniffers and squinters .  millennia before  imperial assassination had become so common as to resemble a sport .  now tradition and technology united to make these formal occasions uniquely safe .  the high council was meeting for the emperor   s review  so inevitably there were battalions of officials  advisors  magisterials extraordinary and yellow jacketed hangers on .  parasites attached themselves to him with practiced grace .   outside the lyceum was the traditional benevolent bountiful  originally one long table  now dozens of them  all groaning beneath rich foods .   largess even before business meetings was mandatory  an acceptance of the emperor   s beneficence .  passing it by would be an insult .  hari nibbled at a few oddments on his way across the sagittarius domeway .  noisy crowds milled restlessly  mostly in the series of ceremonial cloisters that rimmed the domeway  each cut off by acoustic curtains .   hari stepped into a small sound chamber and found a sudden release from the din .  there he quickly reviewed his notes on the council agenda  not wanting to appear an utter rube .  high court types watched every deviation from protocol with scorn .  the media  though not allowed in the lyceum  buzzed for weeks after such meetings  reading every gaffe for its nuances .  hari hated all this  but as long as he was in the game  he might as well play .   he recalled dors    casual mention earlier of leon the libertine  who had once arranged an entire faux banquet for his ministers .  the fruit could be bitten  but then snagged the unwary guests    teeth  which remained firmly embedded until released by a digital command .  the command came  of course  only from the emperor  after some amusing begging and groveling before the other guests .  rumors persisted of darker delights obtained by leon from similar traps  though in private quarters .   hari brushed through the sound curtains and into the older side halls leading to the lyceum .  his retinal map highlighted these ancient  unfashionable routes because few came this way .  his entourage followed obediently  though some frowned .   he knew their sort by now .  they wanted to be seen  their processional parting the crowds of mere sector executives .  sauntering through dim halls without the jostle of the crowds did nothing for the ego .   there was a life sized statue of leon at the end of a narrow processional corridor  holding a traditional executioner   s knife .  hari stopped and looked at the heavy browed man  his right hand showing thick veins where it held the knife .  in his left  a crystal globe of fogwine .  the work was flawless and no doubt flattering to the emperor when sculpted .  the knife was quite real enough  its double edges gleaming .   some considered leon   s reign the most ancient of the good old days  when order seemed natural and the empire expanded into fresh worlds without trouble .  leon had been brutal yet widely loved .  hari wanted psychohistory to work  but what if it turned into a tool to rekindle such a past .   hari shrugged .  time enough to calculate whether the empire could be saved on any terms at all  once psychohistory actually existed .   he went into the high imperial chambers  escorted by the ritual officers .  ahead lay cleon  lamurk  and the panoply of the high council .   he knew he should be impressed by all this .  somehow  though  the air of high opulence only made him more impatient to truly understand the empire .  and if he could  alter its course .        .     hari wobbled slightly as he left the lyceum three hours later .  debate was still in full cry  but he needed a break .  a lesser minister for sector correlation offered to take him to the refreshment baths  and hari gratefully accepted .      i don   t know how much more of this i can take     he said .      you must accommodate to tedium     the minister said cheerfully .      maybe i will duck out .         no  come  rest .      his ceremonial robes  required in the lyceum  were close and sweaty .  the ornate buckle dug into his belly .  it was big and gaudy  with a chromed receiver for his ritual stylus  equally embellished and used only in voting .   the minister chatted on about lamurk   s attack on hari  which hari had tried to ignore .  even so  he had been forced to rise to defend or explain himself .  he had made a point of keeping his speeches short and clear  though this was far from the style of the lyceum .  the minister politely allowed that he thought this was rather an error .   they went through the refresher  where blue gouts of ions descended .  hari was grateful that talk was impossible through all this  and let an electrostat breeze massage him until they evolved into decidedly erotic caresses  apparently council members preferred their vices readily to hand .   the minister went in pursuit of some private amusement  his face alive with anticipation .  hari decided he would rather not know what was about to transpire and moved farther  into a vapor cell .  he rested  thinking  as a ginger colored mat cleaned his chamber  elementary biomaintenance .  his muscles stretched as he reflected on the gulf between him and the professionals of the lyceum .   to hari  human knowledge was largely the unarticulated experiences of myriads  not the formal learning of a vocal elite .  markets  history showed  conveyed the preferences and ideas of the many .  generally  these were superior to grandiose policies handed down from the talent and wisdom of the few .  yet imperial logic asked if a given action were good  not whether it was affordable  or how much was even desirable .   he truly did not know how to speak to these people .  clever verbal turns and artful dodges had served well enough today  but surely that could not last .   these ruminations had distracted him .  with a start he realized he should get back .   leaving the refresher  he angled off the obvious route  which was thronged with functionaries  on through acoustic veils and into the small processional hall  consulting his palace maps .  he had used dors    carrychip a dozen times already  mostly to follow the quick  cryptic council discussions .  the microlaser written  d map on his retina rotated if he rolled his eyes  providing perspective .  there were few staff around  most clustered in attendance outside the lyceum .   hari reached the end of the hall and glanced up at the statue of leon .  the executioner   s knife was gone .   why would anyone .  .  .  .   hari turned and hurried back the way he had come .   before he could reach the acoustic veils  a man stepped through their ivory luminescence .  there was nothing unusual about the man except the way his eyes flicked around  finally fastening on hari .   there was about thirty meters between them .  hari turned as though he were admiring the baroquely festooned walls and walked away .  he heard the other man   s boots crisply follow .   maybe he was being paranoid and maybe not .  he had only to get back to a crowd and all this would dissolve away  he told himself .  the footsteps behind him got sharper  closer .   he turned and ducked down a side passage .  ahead was a ritual room .  the footsteps sped up .  hari trotted across the circular room and into an ancient foyer .  no one there .   down a long hallway he could see two men who seemed to be casually talking .  he started toward them  but they both broke off and looked at him .  one reached into his pocket and produced a comm and began speaking into it .   hari backed away  found a side passage .  he bolted down it .   what about the surveillance cameras .  even the palace had them .  but the one at the end of this passage had an unusual cap on it .  running a fake view  he realized .   the ancient portions of the lyceum perimeter were not only unfashionable  they were unpopulated .  he trotted through another extravagant ritual room .  boots were coming fast behind him .  he turned to the right and saw a crowd down a long ramp .      hey .      he yelled .  nobody looked his way .  he realized they were behind a sound veil .  he started toward them .   a man stepped out of an alcove to block the way .  this one was tall and lean and started toward hari with a muscular nonchalance .  like the others he said nothing  drew no attention to himself .  just kept coming .   hari angled left and broke into a trot .  ahead lay the refresher  he had circled back .  plenty of people there .  if he could reach it .   one long passageway led directly toward the refreshers .  he took it and halfway down saw that a party of three women were talking in a decorative niche .  he slowed and they stopped talking .  they wore familiar staff robes .  probably they worked in the refreshers .   they turned toward him  looking a little surprised .  he opened his mouth to say something  and the nearest woman stepped smartly forward and grabbed his arm .   he jerked back .  she was strong .  she grinned at the others and said     fell right into our       he yanked his arm to the side and broke her grip .  she came off balance and he took advantage of that to shove her into the other two .  one lashed a kick at him .  she twisted her hip to get momentum into it  but she could not get fully around her companion and it stopped short  futile .   hari turned and ran .  the women were obviously well trained and he did not have much hope of getting away .  he plunged ahead down the long passageway .  when he glanced back  however  all three were standing and watching him go .   this was so odd that he slowed  thinking .  they and the men were not attacking him  just boxing him in .   in these public corridors  casual witnesses could easily pass by .  they wanted him somewhere private .   hari called up his palace map .  it placed him as a red dot in the nearby floor plan .  he could see two side alleys up ahead before the end of the passageway    where now two men stepped into view  arms folded .   hari still had two ways out .  he went left into a narrow lane lined with antique testaments .  each winked on and began its narration of vast events and great victories  now buried beneath millennia of indifference .  the  ds flickered with colorful spectacles as he pounded past them .  sonorous voices implored him to attend to their tales .  he was puffing heavily now and trying to focus his thoughts .   intersection coming up .  he shot through it and saw men closing in from the right .   he dodged down a slight side exit  under a participatory mausoleum to emperor elinor iv  and sprinted toward a set of doorways he recognized .  these were the refresher booths  pale doors marked only with numbers .  the minister for sector correlation had pointed them out as the very best  suitable for private appointments .   hari had to cross a small piazza to reach the nearest door .  a man came running from the right  saying nothing .  hari tried the first door  it was locked .  so was the second .  the man was nearly on top of him .  the handle on the third door turned and hari went through .   it was a traditional door on hinges .  he threw his weight back into it to slam it shut .  the man hit the door heavily and got a hand around the edge .  hari heaved against the door .  the man held fast and jammed his right foot between the door and the casing .   hari shoved hard .  the gap between door and casing narrowed  trapping the hand .   the other man was strong .  he grunted and shoved back hard and the gap widened .   hari put his back against the door and thrust with his legs .  he had nothing to help him and the ridiculous ceremonial robes didn   t help .  nothing in the refresher was nearby  no tool    hari reached into his buckle .  the ancient voting stylus slipped into his palm .  he took it in his right hand and twisted against the door  shoving with his right shoulder .  then he passed the stylus to his left hand and brought it down with a savage stab into the man   s hand .   the stylus was inscribed and embellished  but it tapered to a slender point .  hari struck between the third and fourth knuckles .  hard .   a small arterial pumper squirted .  short pulsating arcs shot onto the door  vivid red .  the man cried    ah .     and let go of the door .   hari slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock .  magnetic grids clicked on .  panting  he turned to survey the refresher .   it was one of the best  ample .  two soothing booths  a lift couch  an ample stock of refreshments .  several vapor wells  where luxuriant dalliances often occurred  as rumor had it .  against the far wall  a percussive nook for the athletic .  and a thin slit window  also traditional  open to a ceramic and sand garden .  it was kept as a reminder of eras when being trapped in here with unsavory persons was best avoided by a quick exit .   hari heard a slight snick against the door .  probably a depolarizer fitting into place to unlock the magnetics .  he considered the slit window .        .     a man came carefully into the refresher chamber .  he wore a simple imperial servant   s tunic  which allowed freedom of movement .  perfect for quick work .  he carried the knife from the leon statue .   he closed the door behind him with one hand and locked it  all the while keeping his eyes on the room and the knife at the ready .  though he was large he moved with an easy grace .  methodically he checked in the booths and vapor wells and even the percussive nook .  no one there .  he leaned out the slit window  which was thrown fully open .  the narrow window was not large enough to let him pass  he was massive beneath his light blue staff uniform .   he stood back and spoke into his wrist comm .     he got out into the garden .  can   t see him from here .  you got that blocked .      he paused a moment  listening to an internal voice  and said curtly     can   t find him .     course you can   t  i told you we shouldn   t cut the snoops in this area .      another pause .     sure i know it   s a secure job  even got its own rd number and all  no recording snoops  but       the man paced angrily .     well  you just be damn sure all the ways out are covered .  those gardens are all connected .      another pause .     got the sniffers on .  cameras .  good .  you guys mess this up  i   ll .  .  .     he let his voice trail off into a growl .   he gave the room one last look and unlocked the magnetics .  a man with a blood soaked sleeve stood outside  just within view .      you   re drippin     stupid     the knife carrier said .     hold that arm up high and get away from here .  send a cleanup crew  too .      the other man said     where   d he          knew i shouldn   t have you on this one .  goddamn amateur .     the knife man left at a run .   all this had seemed to take forever .  seconds ticked by as hari held onto a ceiling tile with all his strength .   in darkness he was lying across support struts directly over a soothing booth .  he could see down through a narrow slit .  from below  he hoped  the slit was the only sign that the ceiling had been pushed up  a square dislocated .  he could see the scuff marks on the top of the booth  where he had climbed up and knocked the ceiling tile out of its clamps .   now he had to hold the thing in place .  his hands were starting to ache from gripping it .   below he saw a leg and foot enter the refresher  turn  walk out of view .  someone else  a backup team .   if the tile slipped away from him  anyone below would notice the noise  see the dark slit widen .  maybe it would get away from him completely and fall .   he closed his eyes and concentrated on his fingers  willing them to grasp .  they were numb now .  getting worse .  starting to tremble .   the tile was heavy  triple layered for acoustic privacy .  it was getting away from him  he could feel it .  slipping .  it was going to  the feet below walked out and then came the swish of the door closing .  its lock clicked .   he did not will it  but his fingers let the tile slip .  it smacked the floor loudly .  hari froze  listening .   no click of the door lock reopening .  just the soft slur of the air circulators .   so he was safe for a while .  safe in a trap .   nobody knew he was here .  only a thorough search would bring any trustworthy imperials this far from the lyceum area .   and why should they .  nobody would notice that he was missing right away .  even then  they would probably think he had simply gotten fed up with the council and gone home .  he had said as much to the minister for sector correlation .   which meant the assassins could quietly search for hours .  the knife carrier had sounded systematic  determined .  he would inevitably think of checking back here  starting over on the trail .  there were probably scent snoops they could muster .  and by now the array of cameras throughout the palace would be looking for him .   luckily there were none in the refresher .  he climbed down  nearly slipping on the curved top of the soothing booth .  getting the heavy ceiling tile back up into place took agility and strength .  he was puffing by the time he replaced it above the refresher .  he lay along the struts and got the tile secured again .   he lay in the darkness and thought .  dors    palace map popped up in his eye on command  its colors and details more vivid in the gloom .  of course it showed nothing as utilitarian as this crawl space .  he could see he was deeply embedded in the lyceum   s fringe areas .  perhaps his best bet would be to walk boldly out of this refresher .  if he could reach a crowd .  .  .   if .  he did not like leaving his fate to chance .  that included the strategy of lying here  hoping they did not come back with snoopers that could sense him up here .   anyway  he knew that he could not simply do nothing .  that was not in his nature .  when patience was needed  fine  but waiting did not necessarily improve his odds .   he looked off into the murky space .  gloom stretched away .  he could move around up here .  but which way .   dors    map told him that the gardens of respite cormed an artful tangle around the refresher area .  no doubt the competent assassins would have ushered away any potential witnesses outside the window of this refresher room .   if he could somehow get far enough into the gardens .  .  .   hari realized he was thinking in two dimensions .  he could reach more public areas by moving up through a few layers of the palace .  outside this refresher room  down the hallway  dors    map showed a lift shaft .   he got his bearings and peered in that direction .  he had no idea how an e lift fit into a building .  the map simply showed a rectangular enclosure with a lift symbol .  but a burning fear made his muscles clench and fret .   he started crawling that way  not because he knew what to do  but because he didn   t .  upright cerami form studs provided support and he had to be careful to not knock ceiling tiles out of their mounts .  he slipped and jammed a knee into one and it gave threateningly  then popped back up .  dim threads of phosphor glow seeped between the tiles .  dust tickled his nostrils and coated his lips .  he was getting dirty with the grime of millennia .   up ahead a blue gleam came from roughly where the lift should be .  as he drew closer the going got harder because ducts  pipes  optical conduits  and cross joints thickened  converging on the hallway .  long minutes passed while he threaded his way among them .  he touched a pipe that scorched his arm  a searing jolt so surprising he almost cried out .  he smelled burnt flesh .   the blue radiance leaked around the edges of a panel .  suddenly it flared  then died again as he edged closer .  a sharp crackling told him that an e cell had just passed in the lift .  he could not tell whether it was going up or down .   the panel was ceramo steel  about a meter on a side  with electrical ribbons attached at all four sides .  he did not know in detail how an e lift worked  only that it charged the carrier compartment and then handed the weight off among a steady wave of electrodynamic fields .   he got his feet around and kicked at the panel .  it held but dented .  he kicked again and it loosened .  he grunted with the effort of a third  a fourth  the panel popped out and fell away .   hari brushed aside the thick electrical ribbons and poked his head into the shaft .  it was dark  lit only by a dull radiance along a thin vertical phosphor which tapered away into obscurity  both above and below .   the palace was more than a kilometer thick in this ancient section .  mechanical elevators using cables could not serve even small passenger lifts like this one  over heights of a kilometer .  charge coupling from the shaft walls to the e cell handled the dynamics with ease .  the technology was aged and reliable .  this shaft must be at least ten millennia old  and smelled like it .   he did not like the prospect before him .  the map told him that three layers above him were spacious public rooms used to process supplicants to the imperium .  he would be in safe company there .  below were eight lyceum layers  which he must assume were dangerous .  easier  certainly  to climb down  but also farther .   it would not be that tricky  he reassured himself .  in the shadowy shaft he saw regular electrostatic emitters sunken into the walls .  he found a strand of electrical ribbon and poked into one .  no sparks  no discharge .  that checked with his sketchy knowledge  the emitters went on only when a cell passed .  they were deep enough to get his feet halfway into .   he listened carefully .  no sound .  e cells were nearly silent  but these ancient ones were also slow .  was the risk of climbing into the shaft that great .   he wondered if he was doing the right thing  and then a voice far behind him said loudly     hey .  hey there .      he glanced back .  a head stuck up through an open panel .  he could not make out features  but he did not try .  he was already rolling awkwardly over the last cross beam beside the shaft wall  twisting  thrusting himself out into the air .  he felt downward with his feet  found an emitter hole  and stuck his foot into it .   no discharge .  from memory he felt for another hole .  his foot went in .  he slipped over the casing  holding on tight with his hands .   his feet dangled above black nothingness .  vertigo .  sudden bile rushed in his throat .   shouting from above .  several voices  male .  probably someone had seen the scrapes on top of the soothing booth .  the light from the open ceiling tile was some help now  sending pale radiance into the shaft .   he swallowed and the bile eased .   can   t think about that now .  lust go on .   to his right he saw another regularly spaced emitter hole .  he got his foot into it and worked his way around to the next face of the shaft .  he started climbing .  it was surprisingly easy because the holes were closely spaced and about the right size for his hands and feet .  hari went up swiftly  driven by the scuffling sounds behind him .   he passed the doors of the next level .  beside them was a flat plate emergency switch .  he could open the doors  but onto what .   several minutes had passed since he saw the head .  word was undoubtedly spreading and they might have gotten up here  using stairs or another lift .   he decided to climb higher .  deep gulps of the dusty air threatened to make him cough  but he fought it down .  his hands grasped the emitters and found them solid  easily held  while his legs did the real work of getting him up the sheer face .   he came to the second layer and made the same argument  only one more to go .  that was when he heard the whisper .  faint  but gathering .   a cool downward brush of air made him look up .  something was blotting out the dim line of blue phosphor  coming down fast .   a clear crackling got louder .  he could not possibly reach the above set of doors before it got here .   hari froze .  he could scramble back down  but he did not think he could reach the next level below in time .  the black mass of the e cell swooped down  swelling huge and fast  terrifying him .   a quick snap of blue arcs  a swoosh of air  and it stopped .  at the level above .   the sound buffers cut off even the whisk of the doors opening .  hari yelled  but there was no response .  he started down  feet seeking the holes  puffing .   a sharp crackling from above .  the e cell descended again .   he could see the undercarriage swooping down .  thin blue white arcs shot from the emitter holes as it passed them  adding charge .  hari clambered down with a sinking dread .   an idea flashed across his mind  quick intuition .  wind fluttered his hair .  he made himself study the undercarriage .  four rectangular clasps hung below .  they were metal and would hold charge .   the e cell was nearly upon him .  no more time to think .  hari leaped toward the nearest clasp as the massive weight fell toward him .   he grabbed the thick rim of the clasp .  a sharp  buzzing jolt snapped his eyes wide with pain .  crackling current coursed through him .  his hands and forearms seized tight in electro muscular shock .  that kept him secured to the thick metal while his legs kicked involuntarily .   he had acquired some of the charge of the e cell .  now the electrodynamic fields of the shaft played across his body  supporting him .  his arms did not have to carry all his weight .   his hands and arms ached .  quick  sharp pains shot through the trembling muscles .  but they held .   but currents were coursing through his chest  his heart .  muscles convulsed across his upper body .  he was just another circuit element .   he let go with his left hand .  that stopped current flowing  but he still held charge .  the sharp pains in his chest muscles eased  but they still ached .   levels flashed by hari   s dazed eyes .  at least  he thought  he was getting away from his pursuers .   his right arm tired and he switched to his left .  he told himself that hanging by one arm at a time probably did not tire them any faster than using two arms .  he didn   t believe it  but he wanted to .   but how was he going to get out of this shaft .  the e cell stopped again .  hari peered up at the shadowy mass looming like a black ceiling .  levels were far apart in this archaic part of the palace .  it would take several minutes to climb down to the one below .   the e cell could ratchet up and down the length of this shaft for a long time before getting a call from the lowest level .  even then  he had no idea how the shaft terminated .  he could be crushed against a safety buffer .   so his clever leap had in fact bought him no escape .  he was trapped here in a particularly ingenious way  but still trapped .   if he did manage to slap one of the emergency door openers as they passed  he would again feel a jolt of current as charge leaped from him to the shaft walls .  his muscles would freeze in agony .  how could he then hold on to anything .   the e cell rose two floors  descended five  stopped  descended again .  hari switched hands again and tried to think .   his arms were tiring .  the jolt of charge had strained them  and now surges of current through the shell of the e cell made them jump with twinges of pain .   he had not acquired precisely the right charge to assure neutral buoyancy  so there was some residual downward pull on his arms .  like silken fingers  tingling electrostatic waves washed over him .  he could feel weak surges of current from the e cell  adjusting charge to offset gravity .  he thought of dors and how he had gotten here  and it all surged past him in a strange  dreamlike rush .   he shook his head .  he had to think .   currents passed through him as though he were part of the conducting shell .  the passengers inside felt nothing  for the net charge remained on the outside  each electron getting as far away from its repulsing neighbors as possible .   the passengers inside .   he switched hands again .  they both hurt a lot now .  then he swung himself back and forth like a pendulum  into longer oscillations .  on the fifth swing he kicked hard against the undercarriage .  a solid thunk  it was massive .  he smacked the hard metal several more times and then hung  listening .  ignoring the pain in his arm .   no response .  he yelled hoarsely .  probably anything he did was inaudible inside .   these ancient e cells were ornately decorated inside  he remembered  with an atmosphere of velvet comfort .  who would notice small sounds from below .   the e cell was moving again  upward .  he flexed his arms and swung his feet aimlessly above the shadowy abyss .  it was an odd sensation as the fields sustained him  playing across his skin .  his hair stood on end all over his body .  that was when the realization struck him .   he had approximately the same buoyant charge as the e cell  so he did not need the cell at all anymore .   a pleasant theory  anyway .  did he have the courage to try it .   he let go of the clasp rim .  he fell .  but slowly  slowly .  a breeze swept by him as he drifted down a level  then two .  both arms shouted in relief .   letting go  he still kept his charge .  the shaft fields wrapped around him  absorbing his momentum  as though he were an e cell himself .   but an imperfect one .  with the constant feedback between an e cell and the shaft walls  he would not be exactly buoyant for long .   above him  the real e cell ascended .  he looked up and saw it depart  revealing more of the blue phosphor line tapering far overhead .   he rose a bit  stopped  began to fall again .  the shaft was trying to compensate both for its e cell and for him  an intruder charge .  the feedback control program was unable to solve so complicated a problem .   quite soon the limited control system would probably decide that the e cell was its business and he was not .  it would stop the e cell  secure it on a level  and dispense with him .   hari felt himself slow  pause  then fall again .  rivulets of charge raced along his skin .  electrons sizzled from his hair .  the air around him seemed elastic  alive with electric fields .  his skin jerked in fiery spasms  especially over his head and along his lower legs  where charge would accumulate most .   he slowed again .  in the dim phosphor glow he saw a level coming up from below .  the walls rippled with charges and he felt a spongy sidewise pressure from them .   maybe he could use that .  he stretched to the side  curling his legs up and thrusting against the rubbery stretch of the electrostatic fields .   he stroked awkwardly against the cottony resistance .  he was picking up speed  falling like a feather .  he stretched out to snag an emission hole  and a blue white streamer shot into his hand .  it convulsed and he gasped with the sudden pain .  his entire lower arm and hand went numb .   he inhaled to clear his suddenly watery vision .  the wall was going by faster .  a level was coming up and he was hanging just a meter away from the shaft wall .  he flailed like a bad swimmer against the pliant electrostatic fields .   the tops of the doors went by .  he kicked at the emergency door opener  missed  kicked again  and caught it .  the doors began to wheeze open .  he twisted and gripped the threshold with his left hand as it went by .   another jolt through the hand .  the fingers clamped down .  he swung about the rigid arm and slammed into the wall .  another electrical discharge coursed through him .  smaller  but it made his right leg tighten up .  in agony  he got his right hand onto the threshold and hung on .   his full weight had returned and now he hung limply against the wall .  his left foot found an emission hole  propped him up .  he pulled upward slightly and found he had no more strength .  pain shot through his protesting muscles .   shakily he focused .  his eyes were barely above the threshold .  distant shouts .  shoes in formal imperial blues were running toward him .   hold .  .  . hold on .  .  .  a woman in a thurban guards uniform reached him and knelt  eyebrows knitted .     sir  what are you   .         call .  .  . specials .  .  .     he croaked .     tell them i   ve .  .  . dropped in .         part      a sense of self       simulation spaces   .  .  . decided personality problems could arise .  any simulation which knew its origins was forcefully reminded that it was not the original  but a fog of digits .  all that gave it a sense of self was continuity  the endless stepping forward of pattern .  in actual people  the    real algorithm    computes itself by firing synapses  ringing nerves  continuity from the dance of cause and effect .   this led to a critical problem in the representation of real minds  a subject under a deep  though eroding  taboo  in the closing era of the empire .  the simulations themselves did much of the work on this deep problem  with much simulated pain .  to be    themselves    they had to experience life stories which guided them  so that they saw themselves as the moving point at the end of a long  complex line drawn by their total selves  as evolved forward .  they had to recollect themselves  inner and outer dramas alike  to shape the deep narrative that made an identity .  only in simulations derived from personalities which had a firm philosophical grounding did this prove ultimately possible .  .  .     encyclopedia galactica      .     joan of arc floated down the dim  rumbling tunnels of the smoky mesh .   she fought down her fears .  around her played a complex spatter of fractured light and clapping  hollow implosions .   thought was a chain unfixed in time and unanchored in space .  but  like tinkling currents  alabaster pious images formed  restless  churning .  an unending flux  dissolving structures in her wake  as if she were a passing ship .   she would be hugely pleased  indeed  to have so concrete a self .  anxiously she studied the murky mesh that streamed about her like ocean whorls of liquid mahogany .   since her escape from the wizards  upon whom the preservation of her soul  her    consciousness     a term somehow unconnected to conscience  depended  she had surrendered to these wet coursings .  her saintly mother had once told her that this was how the churning waters of a great river succumb  roiling into their beds deep in the earth .   now she floated as an airy spirit  self absorbed  sufficient to herself  existing outside the tick of time .   stasis space  voltaire had termed it .  a sanctuary where she could minimize computational clock time  such odd language .   waiting for visions from voltaire .   at his last appearance  he had been frustrated  and all because she preferred her internal voices to his own .   how could she explain that  despite her will  the voices of saints and archangels so compelled her .  that they drowned out those who sought to penetrate her from outside .   a simple peasant  she could not resist great spirit beings like the no nonsense st .  catherine .  or stately michael  king of angel legions  greater than the royal french armies that she herself had led into battle .   eons ago  an odd voice whispered  yet she was sure this was mere illusion  for time surely was suspended in this purgatory .    especially she could not resist when their spirit speech thundered with one voice  as now .      ignore him     catherine said  the instant voltaire   s request for audience arrived .  she hovered on great white wings .   voltaire   s manifestation here was a dove of peace  brilliant white  winging toward her from the sullen liquid .  blithe bird .   catherine   s no nonsense voice cut crisply  as stiff as the black and white habit of a meticulous nun .     you sinfully surrendered to his lust  but that does not mean that he owns you .  you don   t belong to a man .  you belong to your creator .      the bird chirped     i must send you a freight of data .         i  i .  .  .     joan   s small voice echoed  as if she were in a vast cavern  not a vortex river at all .  if she could only see    catherine   s great wings batted angrily .     he will go away .  he has no choice .  he cannot reach you  cannot make you sin  unless you consent .      joan   s cheeks burned as the memory of her lewdness with voltaire rushed in .      catherine is right     a deep voice thundered  michael  king of the angel hosts of heaven .     lust has nothing to do with bodies  as you and the man proved .  his body stank and rotted long ago .         it would be good to see him again     joan whispered longingly .  here  thoughts were somehow actions .  she had but to raise a hand and voltaire   s numerics would transfix her .      he offers defiling data .     catherine cried .     deflect his intrusion at once .         if you cannot resist him  marry him     michael ordered stiffly .      marry .     st .  catherine   s voice sputtered with contempt .   in bodily life  she had affected male attire  cropped her hair  and refused to have anything to do with men  thus demonstrating her holiness and good sense .  joan had prayed to st .  catherine often .     males .  even here     the saint scolded michael     you stick together to wage war and ruin women .         my counsel is entirely spiritual     said michael loftily .     i   m an angel and thus prefer neither sex .      catherine sputtered with contempt .     then why aren   t you the queen of legions of angels and not the king .  why don   t you command heavenly hostesses and not heavenly hosts .  why aren   t you an archangela instead of an archangel .  and why isn   t your name michelle .      please  joan said .  please .  the thought of marriage struck as much terror in her soul as in st .  catherine   s  even if marriage was one of the blessed sacraments .  but then so was extreme unction  and that one almost always meant certain death .    .  .  . flames .  .  . the priest   s leer as he administered the rites .  .  .   crackling horror  terrible cutting  licking flames .  .  .  she shook herself  assembled her self  came a whisper  and focused on her saintly host .  oh yes  marriage .  .  . voltaire .  .  .   she was not sure what marriage meant  besides bearing children in christ and in agony  for holy mother church .  the act of getting children  begetting  aroused in her a thumping heart  weak legs  images of the lean  clever man .  .  .      it means being owned     catherine said .     it means instead of needing your consent when he wants to impose on you  like now  were voltaire your husband  he could break in on you whenever he likes .      existence without selfdom  without privacy .  .  .  bursts of joan   s bright self light collided  flickered  dimmed  almost guttered out .      are you suggesting     michael said     that she continue to receive this apostate without subjecting their lust to the bonds of marriage .  let them marry and extinguish their lust completely .      joan could not be heard over the bickering of saints and angels in the musty  liquid murk .  she knew that in this arithmetic limbo  like a waiting room for true purgatory  she had no heart .  .  . but something  somewhere  nevertheless ached .   memories flooded her .  his lean  quick self .  surely a saint and an archangel would forgive her if she took advantage of their sacred bickering to grant voltaire   s request that his    data    be received  if she surrendered  just this once  to impulses compelling her from within .   shuddering  she yielded .       .     voltaire snapped     i   ve waited less long for friedrich of prussia and catherine the great .         i am adrift     joan said airily .     occupied .         and you   re a peasant  a swineherd  not even a bourgeoise .  these moods of yours .  these personae your subconscious layers created .  they grow tiresome in the extreme .      he hung in air above the lapping dark waters .  quite a striking effect  he thought .      in such haunting rivers i must converse with like minds .      he waved away her point with a silk sleeved arm .     i   ve tried to make allowances  everyone knows saints aren   t fit for civilized society .  perfume cannot conceal the stink of sanctity .         surely here in limbo          this is not a theological waiting room .  your tedious taste for solitude plays out in theaters of computation .         arithmetic is not holy  sir .         umm  perhaps  though i suspect newton could prove otherwise .      he slow stepped the scene  watching individual event waves wash through .  to his view  the somber river gurgled an increment forward and joan   s eyebrow inched up  then paused for the calculation to be refreshed .  he accelerated her internal states  though  allowing a decent interval for la pucelle  the chaste maid  to ponder a reply .  he had the advantage  for he commanded more memory space .   he breached the slow stepped  slumbering river sim .  he had thought this best  images of womblike wet reassurance  to offset her fire phobia .   the maid gaped but did not answer .  he checked  and found that he did not now have the resources to bring her to full running speed .  a complex in the battisvedanta sector had sucked up computing space .  he would have to wait until his ferret programs found him some more unoccupied room .   he fumed  not a good use of running time  but somehow it felt right .  if you had the computational space .  he felt another distant suck on his resources .  an emergency tiktok shutdown .  computer backups shifted to cover .  his sensory theater dwindled  his body fell away .   miserable wretches  they were draining him .  he thought she spoke  her voice faint  far away .  he fiddled in a frenzy to give her running time .      monsieur neglects me .      voltaire felt a spike of joy .  he did love her  a mere response could buoy him up above this snaky river .      we are in grave danger     he said .     an epidemic has erupted in the matter world .  confusion reigns .  respectable people exploit widespread panic by preying on each other .  they lie  cheat  and steal .         no .      he could not resist .     in other words  things are exactly as they   ve always been .         is this why you have come .     she asked .     to laugh at me .  a once chaste maid you ruined .         i merely helped you to become a woman .         exactement     she said .     but i don   t want to be a woman .  i want to be a warrior for charles of france .         patriotic twaddle .  heed my warning .  you must answer no calls  except mine  without first clearing them through me .  you are to entertain no one  speak with no one  travel nowhere  do nothing without my prior consent .         monsieur mistakes me for his wife .         marriage is the only adventure open to the manifestly cowardly .  i did not attempt it  nor shall i .      she seemed distracted .     this threat  it is serious .         not one shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious .      she snapped back to attention  data resources had returned .     then  sir          but this is not life .  it is a mathist dance .     she smiled .     i do not hear music .         had i digital wealth  i would whistle .  our lives  such as they are  are in grave danger .      la pucelle did not answer at once  though he had given her the running time .  was she conferring with her idiotic voices of conscience .   quite obviously  the internalizations of ignorant village priests .       i am a peasant     she said     but not a slave .  who are you to order me .      who  indeed .  he dare not yet tell her that  abstracted into a planet wide network  he was now a lattice of digital gates  a stream of os and  s .  he ran on processor clusters  a vagrant thief .  amid trantor   s myriad personal computers and mountainous imperial processors  he lurked and pilfered .   the image he had given joan  of swimming in an inky river  was a reasonable vision of the truth .  they swam in the mesh of a city so large he could barely sense it as a whole .  as constraints of economics and computational speed required  he moved himself and joan to new processors  fleeing the inspection of dull witted but persistent memory space police .   and what were they .   philosophy was not so much answers as good questions .  this riddle stumped him .  his universe wrapped around itself  worm ouroboros  a solipsistic wet dream of a world .  to conserve computations  he could shrink into a solipsist selfhood  with all inputs reduced to a    hume suite    of minimal sense data  a minimum energy state .   as he often had to .  they were rats in the walls of a castle they could not comprehend .   joan sensed this only dimly .  he did not dare reveal the rickety way he had saved them  when the minions of artifice associates had tried to assassinate them both .  she was still rickety from her fire fears .  and from the wrenching  eerie nature of this  as she preferred to see it  limbo .   he shook off his mood .  he was running   .    times faster than joan  a philosopher   s margin for reflection .  he responded to her with a single ironic shrug .      i   ll comply with your wishes on one condition .      a flower of pungent light burst in him .  this was a modification of his own  not a sim of a human reaction  more like a fragrant fireworks in the mind .  he had created the response to blossom whenever he was about to get his way .  a small vice  surely .      if you arrange for all of us to meet at deux magots again     joan said     i promise to respond to no requests save yours .         are you completely mad .  great digital beasts hunt us .         i am a warrior  i remind you .         this is no time to meet at a known alphanumeric address  a sim public cafe .     he hadn   t seen garcon or amana since he   d pulled off their miraculous escape  all four of them  from the enraged rioting masses at the coliseum .  he had no idea where the simmed waiter and his human sim paramour were .  or if they were .   to find them in the fluid  intricate labyrinth .  .  .  the thought called up in memory how his head used to feel when he wore a wig for too long .   he recalled  in the odd quick flash memory which gave him detailed pictures of entire past events  like moving oil paintings  the smoky rooms of paris .  the gray tobacco stench had stayed in his wigs for days .  no one in this world of trantor ever smoked .  he wondered why .  could it be the medical cranks had proved right  and such inhalations were unhealthy .  then  done  the memory pictures vanished as if he had snapped his fingers to a servant .   in the commanding tone she had used to lead surly soldiers  she said     arrange a rendezvous .   or i   ll never receive data from you again .         drat .  finding them will be .  .  . dangerous .         so it is fear which impedes you .      she had caught him neatly .  what man would admit to fear .  he fumed and stretched his clock time  stalling her .   to hide in the mesh  software broke his simulation up into pieces which could run in different processing centers .  each fragment buried itself deep in a local algorithm .  to a maintenance program  the pirated space looked like a subroutine running normally .  such masked bins even seemed to be optimizing performance  disguise was the essential trick .   even an editing and pruning program  sniffing out redundancy  would spare a well masked fragment from extinction .  in any case  he kept a backup running somewhere else .  a copy  a    ditto     like a book in a library .  a few billion redundant lines of code  scattered among unrelated nodes  could carry blithe voltaire as a true  slow timed entity .   if he set each fragment to sniffing forth on its own  to find these miserable deux magots personae .  .  .   grudgingly he murmured     i shall leave you with some attendant powers  to help your isolation .      he squirted into her space the kernel copies of his own powers .  these were artfully contrived talents  given by the embodied marq at artifice associates .  voltaire had improved considerably upon them while still confined in the artifice cache .  only by bootstrapping himself to higher abilities had he attained the ability to rescue them  at the crucial moment .   these gifts he now bestowed upon her .  they would not activate unless she were truly in danger .  he had affixed a trigger code  to awaken only if she experienced great fear or anger .  there .   she smiled  said nothing .  after such tribute .  infuriating .      madam  do you recall us debating  long ago  more than eight thousand years .   the issues of computed thought .      a flicker of worry in her face .     i .  .  . do .  so hard  it was .  then           we were preserved .  to be resurrected here  to debate again .         because   the issue advances           every few millennia  i suspect .  as though some inexorable social force drives it .         so we are doomed to forever reenact .  .  .  .     she shivered .      i suspect we are tools in some vaster game .  but smart tools  this time .         i want the comforts of home and hearth  not eerie conflicts .         perhaps  madam  i can accomplish this task  among my other pressing matters .         no perhaps  sir .  until you do  then       without so much as an adieu  she cut their connection and dwindled into the moist darkness .   he could reconnect  of course .  now he was master of this mathist realm  by virtue of the enhancements to his original representation by artifice associates .  he thought of that first form as voltaire   .   .  in a few weeks he had progressed by self modification to voltaire   .    with hopes of climbing even faster .   he swam in the mesh .  joan dwelled there .  he    could force his attentions upon her  indeed .  but a lady forced is never a lady won .   very well .  he would have to find the personae .  merde alors .       .     marq sat intently beneath his  d holo  combing the trashy back alleys and byways of the mesh .   he had been quite sure there was no more of voltaire  except back in seldon   s vault files .  or he had been  until today .  he almost wished he hadn   t snagged the rivulet of talk that implied so much .     still nothing more     he said .      why are you running search profiles on joan .     sybyl asked from her desk .      seldon wants tracking .  now .  joan will be easier  if she also escaped into the mesh .         because she   s female .         nothing to do with joan   s    sex     everything to do with her temperament .  she   ll be less calculating than voltaire  right .      sybyl wore her grudging look .     perhaps .         less wily .  ruled by her heart .         and not by her head  like your supersmart voltaire .  more likely to make a mistake .         look  i know i shouldn   t have souped up voltaire .  hormones got in my way .      she smiled .     you keep tripping over them .         bad judgment  and nim   s urging .  i   m sure he was working for someone else  goading each of us .      her mouth twisted ruefully .     to bring on the junin riots .         could be .  but who   d want that .     his fist smacked his desk .     to crack up the renaissance  just as it was getting started          let   s not go over that again .     she paced their cramped  dingy room .     if we can find those sims  we might get some leverage .  we can   t keep hiding out forever .         voltaire   s a lot quicker than joan  with more resources .  self programming  outright internal evolution  he   s got    em .  and this guy   s creative  remember .         this is the genius we   re going to catch .  ha .      her taunt irked him .  several times he   d felt he was close  very close .  always  just as his ferrets found a thread of voltaire   s distinctive configuration logic  it would slip away  thwart his effort .  his holo would inexplicably black out .  he   d lose hours of carefully aggregated data in a microsecond .  and he   d have to begin again .   marq leaned back and rotated his neck to get the cricks out .     i may be onto something     he said .     i   m not sure .     he pointed to his carbon cube .     modified my array spaces and used them to earn a few creds in the protein markets .  i caught another voltaire scent  too .      she sighed and collapsed into a chair that deftly shaped itself to catch her .     why hustle the cred when we can   t use it to get anything to eat .         find joan  we   ll get fat .         look  those tiktok failures  what   s the evidence they   re due to our sims .      he shrugged .     the imperial scientific consortium thinks there   s a connection with the junin mess .  nonsense  of course  but it keeps people jazzed .  they say they have secret sources  they don   t explain .  got it .         my my  touchy .  so they   re still looking for us .         going through the motions  i   d guess .  trantor has much bigger headaches now .         think we   ll all go on rations .            fraid so .  rumor says not until next week .     her frown made him add     rations are mostly a precaution .  you and i can both afford to lose a little of this .     he squeezed a roll of flesh above his belt  not bad for his age  but bad enough  and hoped his apprehension had not leaked into his voice .       i don   t need an involuntary diet .     she slid a sideways glance at him .     they caught a family eating wall rats .         where did you hear that .         why     secret sources     of course .  i can be mysterious  too .      tiktok disorders had spread quickly among the major food supply axes .  the junin conflagration had not set them off  something else had  weeks later .  in just a matter of days breakdowns had affected all food factoria on trantor .  imports were rising  but there was a limit to how much anyone could push through the fourteen wormhole mouths nearby  or haul in clumsy hyperships .   marq   s stomach rumbled in sympathetic anger .  she smiled .     ummm  greedy  aren   t we .         look at this     marq said testily  thumbing up lines on his holo .     to be sensuous is to be mortal .  suffering and pain are the dark twins of joy and pleasure  death the identical dark twin of life .   my present state is bloodless  therefore i cannot bleed .  the sweats of passion are beyond me  my ardors never cool .  i can be copied and remade  even deletion need pose no threat to my immortality .  how can i not prefer my fate to the ultimate fate of all sensuous beings  drenched in time as the fish is drenched in the sea it swims .        where did you find this .     she asked .      just a drab i snagged while a data spike was being whisked away .  it registers as part of a conversation between two widely separated mesh sites .         it does sound like him .  .  .  .         i checked in the popoff files we kept .  y   know  all that linear text running alongside his sim .  this stuff is from there .  ancient texts .  that guy was always happiest when quoting himself .         so he is out there .         yeah  and i   m outta here .     marq grabbed a pastejacket and made for the door .      where to .         dark market  i need food .      sybyl hurried after him .  marq knew the alleyway purveyors of sweetmeats and snacks .  he led her out of a dingy stack of low rent cubes and into warrens cramped and thick with the musty smell of millennia .  he made his buy in a dank hole beside a fountain commemorating a battle which sybyl could not even pronounce  much less remember .   automatically she kept watch for snooper eyes  but they were rarer here than real police .  the heat on them might be less  their data skills had built a solid seeming info shell around them  but a cop could still eyeball them and blow the whole thing .   marq shared with her and the food tasted sharp  intense  wonderful .  they fell into a meditative silence as they crested a long rise lift stair and looked out over slum zones  trash littered halls  chaotic tentrises stuck between majestic buildings  miscarriages of architecture of every stripe and shape .   with his belly comfortable  if not full  marq could savor trantor in the large .  it was majestic in its injustice  undeserved sufferings  inequities  iniquities .  all of its blemishes and blights got folded together by distance  like broken eggs dissolved into the cream smooth  as long as you did not admire too closely .   they were idly strolling when without warning a six armed tiktok came whirring down their lane .  it pursued a four armed tiktok with a polished carapace  a tiktok boss class .  they met and began to slug it out while churning along at full speed  like a fistfight carried out at a dead run .  their metal bodies clanged as they careened along .      don   t move     marq said .  the two sped by in furious combat .     cops   ll be here .  let   s skip .      he and sybyl went the other way  running out into a large square .  he whistled through his teeth at what he saw .   all around  six armed laborer tiktoks had folded all arms  refusing to work  deaf to human protests .  they formed a protective barrier between the women supervising their building project and the walls under construction .   several six armers raised baskets reverentially into the air .  one paid no attention and continued welding a cross girder  until another fell on him  swinging a long coring tool .   clangs rolled across the square .  panicked people ran everywhere .  no one could stop the tiktok protest .  when a four armer tried to intervene  six armers attacked it .      y   know  office work seems pretty desirable right now     marq said .     if this keeps up  we   ll have to do all our own grunt work .         what   s happening .     sybyl backed away  alarmed .     it   s as though tiktoks had a madness  and it   s spreading .         ummm .  a virus .         but where did they catch it .         exactly .          .        what .  .     voltaire exclaimed as he snapped into the context frame .      welcome     joan said  voice thin .  she had never initiated contact with him before .  and he had yet to find the magots actors .     i may have to reconsider my position on miracles     he said .   she lowered her eyes .  for just an instant he suspected this was just so she could raise them  to look up at him without lifting her lovely head .  did she know how this captivated him .  her bosom rose and fell in a way his sensors found maddening since he could do nothing about it .   voltaire reached out for madam   s hand and raised it to his lips .  he felt  however  nothing  and peevishly let it drop .     this is unbearable     he said .     to long for union and feel nothing when it is achieved .         you feel nothing when we meet .          ma ch  re maquine  sensors do not a sensuous being make .  don   t confuse sensoring with sensuality .         and how is it .  .  . before .  .  .     joan spoke with apparent difficulty  as if afraid she might be wounded by the answer .      i cannot manage the  uh     programming    here .  we had the use of myriad capabilities  when we were trapped zoo animals of artifice associates .  here in the digital wild  my talents  though growing .   do not match that level .  yet .         i thought perhaps it was a holy deprivation .  a help  truly  to rightful behavior .         much more in history may be explained by incompetence than by ill will .      joan looked away .     sir  i summoned you because .  .  .  since we last met  despite the warnings of my voices .  .  .  i answered a call .         i told you not to do that .     voltaire shouted .      i had no choice     she said .     i had to answer .  it was .  .  . urgent .     fear crept into her voice .     i cannot quite explain  but i know that the moment i did so  i hovered on the verge of absolute extinction .      voltaire hid his concern behind a mask of levity .     no way for a saint to talk .  you   re not supposed to admit the possibility of absolute extinction .  your canonization could be reversed .      joan   s voice wavered  a candle flame stirred by dark winds of doubt .     i know only that i hovered on the brink of a great void  a chasm of darkness .  i glimpsed  not eternity  but nothingness .  even my voices fell silent  humbled by the spectacle of .  .  . of .  .  .         of what .         nonbeing     joan said .     disappearing  never to reappear again .  i was about to be .  .  . erased .          deletion .  the ferrets and their hounds .     prickly gooseflesh fear invaded him .     how did you escape .         i didn   t     the maid said  awe undercutting fear .     that was eerier still .  whoever  whatever  it was let me go without injury .  i stood before it  vulnerable  exposed .  and it .  .  . released me .      he felt a cold dread .  he  too  had sensed unseeable entities just over his shoulder  watching  judging .  there was something blankly alien about these visitations .  he pulled himself back from the chilly memories .     from now on answer no calls whatever .      the maid   s face clouded with doubt .     i had no choice .         i   ll find a better hiding place for you     voltaire assured her .     make you invulnerable to involuntary appearances .  give you power          you do not understand .  this .  .  . thing .  .  . could have snuffed me out like two fingers pinching a tiny flame .  it will return  i know it .  meanwhile  i have but one wish .         anything     voltaire said .     anything in my power .  .  .         restore us and our friends to the cafe .         aux deux magots .  i am searching  but i don   t even know if it still exists .         re create it with the sorcery you have learned .  if i am to tumble headlong into the void  let it not be before i spend one evening reunited with you and our dear friends .  breaking bread  sipping wine in the company of those i love .  .  . i ask nothing more before i am  erased .         you   re not going to be erased     voltaire assured her with far more conviction than he felt .     i   m going to transport you to a place no one will ever think to look .  you   ll be unable to respond to any calls  not even if you think they are from me .  but you will transmit to me often  do you understand .         i shall send my spiritual fraction  as well .         i believe they are giving me an itch already .     he did indeed feel a restless  edgy scratching at the edge of perception  like insects crawling in his brain .  he shook himself .  why did a perfidious mathists    logic rob him of his sensuality  and torture him with rasping irritations .   but her defiance had only begun .     you have taken my virginity  sir  yet you speak only slightingly of marriage .  and of love .         bien sur  love between married couples may be possible  though i myself have never seen an instance of it  yet it is unnatural .  like being born with two fused toes .  it happens  but only by mistake .  one can  naturellement  live happily with any woman  provided one doesn   t love her .      she gave him an imperious glance .     i have become immune to your rogue ways .      he shook his head sadly .     a dog is better off in this respect than i am in my present state .      he trailed his sim finger lightly across her throat .  her head lolled back  her eyes closed  her lips parted .  but he  alas  felt nothing .     find a way     he whispered .     find a way .          .     he had been neglecting his work .  his lack of interactive senses was thus his own fault .   that  and the itching .  he must learn to .  .  . somehow .  .  . scratch himself  inside himself .       in this damnable digital abode .      one can scarcely blame a deity for his absence from such a place as this     voltaire said into the infinite recessional coordinate system which surrounded him .  he flew through black spaces gridded out in exact rectangular reaches  lattice corridors extending away to infinity .      how different .     he shouted into the deep indifference .     i swim into sims of others  inhabit realms far from       he had been about to say from my origins  but that meant     a france  b reason  g sark    he was of all three .  on sark  the self proud programmers who had .  .  . resurrected .  .  . him  had spoken of their new renaissance .  he was to be an ornament to their fresh flowering .  somewhere on that planet  editions of volt   .   ran .   his brothers .  younger dittos  yes .  he would have to inspect the implications of such beings  in a future rational discourse .  for now  the trick was close scrutiny  he realized .  if he slowed events  a trick he had learned early  then he could devote data crunchers to the task of understanding .  .  . himself .   first  this inky vault through which he flew .  windless  without warmth or the rub of the real .   he delved down into the working mathematics of himself .  it was a byzantine welter of detail  but in outline surprisingly familiar  the cartesian world .  events were modeled with axes in rectangular space  x  y  z  so that motion was then merely sets of numbers on each axis .  all dynamics shrank to arithmetic .  descartes would have been amused by the dizzying heights to which his minor method had spun .   he rejected the outside and delved into his own slowed reaches .   now he could feel his preconscious reading the incoming sights  sounds  and flitting thoughts of the moment .  to his inner gaze  they all carried bright red tags  sometimes simple caricatures  often complex packets .   from somewhere an idea packet arrived  educating him  these were fourier transforms .  somehow this helped to understand .  and the mere wafting sense of a fellow frenchman   s name made him feel better .   an associator  big  blue  bulbous  hovered over this data field  plucking at the tags .  it reached with yellow streamers over a far  purple rimmed horizon  to the field of memory .  from there it brought any item stored packages of mottled gray  containing sights  sounds  smells  ideas  which matched the incoming tags .   job done  the associator handed all the matchings to a towering monolith  the discriminator .  a perpetual wind sucked the red tags up  into the yawning surfaces of the coal black discriminator mountain .  merciless filters there matched the tags with the stored memories .   if they fitted  geometric shapes sliding together  mock sex  notches fitting snugly into protruding struts  they stayed .  but fits were few .  most tags failed to find a host memory which made sense .  no fit .  these the discriminator ate .  the tags and connections vanished  swept away to clear fresh space for the next flood of sensation .   he loomed over this interior landscape and felt its hailstorm power .  his whole creative life  the marvel of continents  had come from here .  tiny thoughts  snatches of conversations  melodies  all would pop into his mind  a tornado of chaos images  crowding  jostling for his attention .  the memory packets which shared some sturdy link to a tag endured .   but who decided what was rugged enough .  he watched rods slide into slots and saw the intricate details of how those memories and tags were shaped .  so the answer lay at least one step further back  in the geometry of memory .   which meant that he had determined matters  by the laying down of memories .  memory clumps  married to tag streams  made a portion of his self  plucked forth from the torrent  the river of possibilities .   and he had done it long ago  when the memories were stored  all without realizing how they could fit with tags to come .  so where was any predictable voltaire to lurk .  in sheer intricacy  deep detail  shifting associations in the flow .   no rock hard self at all .   and his imagination .  the author of all his plays and essays .  it must lie in the weather of the tag memory torrents .  the twist  warp and sudden marriages .  jigsaw associations  rising up from the preconscious .  order from chaos .      who is voltaire .     he called to the streaming gridded emptiness .   no reply .   his itch was still with him .  and the yawning nothing all around .  he decided to fix the larger issue .  what had pascal said .   the silence of these spaces terrifies me .   he probed and gouged and sought .  and in the doing  knew that as his hands dug into the ebony stuff all about him  they were but metaphors .  symbols for programs he could never have created himself .   he had inherited these abilities  much as he had  as a boy  inherited hands .  down below his conscious self  his minions had labored upon the base volt   .    plus marq   s augmentations .   he pulled apart the blackness and stepped through .  to a city street .   he was puffing  weak  strained .  resources running low .   he walked shakily into a restaurant  anonymous  plain  food merely standing on counters  and stuffed himself .   he concentrated on each step .  by making each portion of his experience well up  he found that he could descend through the layers of his own response .   making his body feel right demanded sets of overlapping rules .  as he chewed  teeth had to sink into food  saliva squirt to greet the munched mass  enzymes start to work to extract the right nutrient ratios  else it would not seem real .   his programs  he saw  bypassed the involved stomach and colon processes .  such intricacies were needless .  instead  the    software     odd phrase  simplified all the messy innards into a result he could feel  a satisfying concentration of tasty blood sugars  giving him a carbohydrate lift  a pleasant electrolyte balance  hormones and stabilizers all calculated  with a patchwork of templates for the appropriate emotional levels .   all other detail was discarded  once the subroutines got the right effect  simulating the tingling of nerve endings .  not too bad for what was really a block of ferrite and polymer  each site in its crystal complexity an individual  furiously working microprocessor .   still  he felt as though he had been hollowed out by an intense  sucking vacuum .   voltaire rushed out of the restaurant .  the street .  he needed to see this place  to check his suspicions .   down the placid avenues he lurched .  run  stride .   even though reckless  he never accidentally fell .  inspection of his inner layers showed that this was because his peripheral vision extended beyond     degrees  taking everything in .  so he was literally seeing behind his head  though he did not consciously register this .   real people  he suddenly saw  negotiated steps while chattering to each other by making snapshot comparisons of their peripheral vision  they were acutely sensitive to sudden changes in silhouettes and trajectories .  balance and walking were so critical to humans that his programming overdid its caution .   he had to teeter far out on his toes before he could fall on his face  smack .   and even then it didn   t hurt much .   once there  he let a passerby walk over him .  a girl  a nominal girl  the phrase leapt to mindstepped on him .   this time he cringed at the downward spike of her heels .  .  . and felt nothing .  he scrambled after her .  some elementary portion of himself had feared the pain .   so it had eliminated it .  which meant that experience was no longer a constraint .      the spirit has won a divorce from the body .      he announced to the people passing by .  stolid  they paid him no heed .   but this was his simulation .   outraged  he caught up to the methodical girl and jumped powerfully onto her shoulders .  no effect .  he rode her down the street .  the girl strode on obliviously as he danced on her head .  the apparently fragile sim girl was a recorded patch in  as solid and remorseless as rock .   he danced down the street by leaping from head to head .  nobody noticed  every head felt firm  a smoothly gliding platform .   so the entire street was backdrop  no better than it had to be .  the crowd did not repeat as a whole  but three times he saw the same elderly woman making her crabbed way on the slidewalk  on the exact same route  with the identical shopping bag .   it was eerie  watching people passing by and knowing that they were as unreachable as a distant star .  no  even less  the empire had stars aplenty .   and how did he know that .   voltaire felt knowledge unfold in him like a dense matting  a cloak wrapping him .   suddenly  he itched .  not a mere vexation  but a wave of terrible tingling that swept in waves over his entire body .  indeed  inside his body .   he ran down the street  swatting at himself .  the physical gesture should stimulate his subselves  make them solve this problem .  it did not .   prickly pain sheeted over his skin .  it danced like st .  elmo   s fire  a natural phenomenon akin to ball lightning  or so a subself blithely informed him  as if he desired     library learning .     he shouted .     not that .  i want         your fine astronomers can find the distance of the stars  and their temperatures and metal content .  but how do they find out what their true names are .     the voice spoke without sound .  it reverberated not in his ears but in mind .  he felt cold fear at the blank strangeness of the flat  humorless tone .  it chilled him .      who jokes .      no answer .      who  damn you .     joan had termed the blankness an it .   he hurried on  but felt eyes everywhere .       .     marq listened tensely as mac       s neutral voice recounted the latest outbreak of computer virus .   heavy harvesting equipment had malfunctioned at forty six global sites .  reports of additional incidents continued to pour in .  attempting to check an emerging pattern of aberrant behavior  trantor authorities called in repair tiktoks from regional service stations .  instead of servicing the equipment  they formed themselves before the malf   ed tiktoks and began to utter incantations in a tortured language their programmers had never heard before .   after virtually identical incidents in many layers of trantorian society  sample tiktoks showed chaotic programming nodes .  or it seemed to be chaotic .  but how could random error lead to the same behavior .   linguists studied the babbling for resemblances to known languages  ancient or modem .  no correlation was found .   marq shook his head  studying the incoming data .     damned madness  this stuff     he muttered .  his simscreens swirled with images like a confusion of blown autumn leaves .      whole world food supply   s in danger .  no fresh fruit  ratty old vegetables .     he eyed with distaste the bowl of plankton soup at his elbow .     i   m sick of it .      bad enough being in hiding .  bad enough nim had double crossed them .  bad enough he couldn   t find joan or voltaire .      i   m sick of eating cardboard junk .     he swept the soup away  spattering the floor of their shabby cube .     voltaire watched marq gripe  tossing the half finished meal into the trash .   he had learned how to insinuate himself into the communications web of others  though it took a kind of squeezing he found irksome .  somehow he could fathom the hard  real world better from this cool  abstract frame .   voltaire watched marq in two simultaneous modes  the man   s image  as he sat in his simauditorium  and through the many linkages marq had to the data world .   from these he quickly saw trantor as marq did  in all its glory and grime .  it was an obliging sensation  like being in several places at once .  and he felt  or thought he did  the man   s depths of concern .   he could view marq by inverting the image gathering system of marq   s own holo grid .  as he listened to the ill bred whining  he could also suck from marq   s immense database a summary of recent tiktok travesties  and beneath that  background  smart filtered by obliging microprograms  for the moment .   he learned that the one kilowatt per square meter of sunlight caught by trantor was converted to food in vast photofarms  essentially  growing great gray sheets of unappetizing stuff on the rooftops of the worldcity  but the major energy source was the thermal pumps which harnessed the smoldering magma beneath .  impressive  the ruby hot masses tended by gorgon tiktoks  how inappropriate the name seemed  applied to mammoth machines   but he could discern no cause to all the interruptions now racing like thunderstorms of chaos over the manylayered faces of trantor .     he had an interest in politics  the game of so many second rates .  should he tarry  learning of trantor   s troubles .  no  necessity beckoned .   he had to maintain himself .  this meant doing his chores  as his wizened mother had once termed it .  if only the crone could see him now  doing unimaginable tasks in a labyrinth beyond conception .   abruptly he felt a spike of remembrance pain  a sharp nostalgia for a time and place he knew was no more than dust blowing in winds .  .  . all on some world these people had lost .  earth itself  gone .  how could they let such a travesty occur .   voltaire simmered with frustrated anger and got to work .  throughout his life  as he had scribbled his plays and amassed a fortune  he had always taken refuge in his labors .   to run his background  that was his job .  strange phrase .   somewhere within him  an agent ferreted out the expert programs which understood how to create his exterior frame .  he had to do it  though  sweat breaking out upon his linen  muscles straining against  what .  he could see nothing .   he split the tasks .  part of him knew what truly happened  though the corevoltaire felt only manual labor .   his smart self felt the process in detail .  pickpocketing running time on machine bases  he got computations done on the sly .  the trick could only work until the next round of program checking  when his minor theft would be detected  then sniffed out and deftly traced  with punishment following close on the bloodhounds    heels .   to avoid this  he spread himself into n platforms  scattered within trantor  with n a number typically greater than ten thousand .  when the small slivers of the sim felt a watchdog approaching  they could escape the platform in question .  a task agent explained that this was at a rate inversely proportional to the running space they had captured  though this explanation was quite opaque to the core self .   small pieces escaped faster .  so for security  he divided the entire sim  including himself  and joan  an agent reminded him  they were connected  through tiny roots  into ever finer slices .  these ran on myriad platforms  wherever space became available .   slowly  his externals congealed about him .   he could make a tree limb blow in the breeze  articulating gently .  .  . all thanks to a few giga slots of space left open during a momentary handshake protocol  as gargantuan accounting programs shifted  on a bank exchange layer .   stitching back together the whole self  all from the sum of slivers  was itself a job he farmed out to microservers .  he imagined himself as a man made like a mountain of ants .  from a distance  perhaps convincing .  up close  one had to wonder .   but the one doing the wondering was the ant mountain itself .   his own visceral sense of self  was that rocksolid  too  just a patched in slug of digits .  or a mosaic of ten thousand ad hoc rules  running together .  was either answer better than the other .   he was taking a walk .  most pleasant .   this town  he had learned  was only a few streets and a backdrop .  as he sauntered down an avenue  details started to smooth out  and finally he could step no further into the air  now molasses thick .  he could go no further .   he turned and regarded the apparently ordinary world .  how was this done .   his eyes were simulated in great detail  down to individual cells  rods  and cones responding differently to light .  a program traced light rays from his retina to the outside    world     lines running opposite to the real world  to calculate what he could see .  like the eye itself  it computed fine details at the center of vision  shading off to rougher patches at the edge .  objects out of sight could still cast glows or shadows into the field of vision  so had to be kept crudely in the program .  once he looked away  the delicate dewdrops on a lush rose would collapse into a crude block of opaque backdrop .   knowing this  he tried to snap his head back around and catch the program off guard  glimpse a gray world of clumsy form fitting squares and blobs  and always failed .  vision fluttered at twenty two frames per second at best  the sim could retrace itself with ease in that wide a wedge of time .      ah  newton .     voltaire shouted to the oblivious crowds who paced endlessly through their tissue thin streets .     you knew optics  but now i  merely by asking myself a question  can fathom light more deeply than thee .      newton himself assembled on the cobblestones  lean face clotted with blue black anger .     i labored over experiments  over mathematics  differentials  ray tracings          and i have all that      voltaire laughed happily  awed by the presence of such an intellect      running on background .      newton bowed elaborately  and vanished .   voltaire realized that his eyes had no need to be better than real eyes .  same for his hearing simmed eardrums responding to calculated acoustic wave propagation .  his was a remorselessly economical self .   newton appeared again  a subagent  manifesting as a visual aid .   .  he appeared puzzled .     how does it feel to be a mathematical construction .         however i want it to feel .         such liberties are unearned .     newton cluckclucked his tongue .      quite so .  so is the lord   s mercy .         these are not deities .         to the likes of you and me  are they not .      newton sniffed .     frenchman .  you could learn a bit of humility .         i shall have to subscribe to a higher university for that .      a puritan scowl .     you could do with a lecture and a lashing .         do not tempt me with foreplay  sir .        scientists require apparatus  but mathists splendidly require only writing tools and erasers .  better  philosophers do not even need erasers .     suddenly he felt tilted  as if off balance .  the word university had keyed turbulence in him .  .  . and a presence .  it came as a black wedge  a yawning crack in a tight space that stretched great jaws and leered at him  the prey .   his throat squeezed with anxiety .  a sudden dread wrapped him .   a snap  a lurch  blurred objects speeding by him as if he were plunging in a carriage down a precipice  and he was trembling like a schoolboy  anticipating pleasures made more exquisite for having been delayed .   madame la scientiste .  here .  to think was to have  her office materialized about him .   he had harbored a passing lust for this rational creature  dancer of elegant gavottes amid abstruse numerics .  .  . and all about him was firm and rich  intensely felt .   how could she  an embodied person  appear in simulation .  he wondered at this  but only for a thin  shaved second .  he inhaled her musky essence .  clammy palms grasped her hair  rubbing its lustrous strands between anxious fingers .     at last     he breathed into the warm shell of her ear .  he began thinking hard on abstract matters  so as to delay his own pleasure  the one sure sign of a gentleman  and await hers     i faint .     she cried .      not yet  please .     did scientists hasten so .      to lose yourself  that is what you seek .     she asked .      ah  yes  in carefully selected acts of passion  but  but          you are of the kind who crawl in mud and seethe with murder  then .         what .  madam  keep to the subject .         and how do you find the names of stars .     she said coldly .   the inadvisability of selflessness was demonstrated on the spot  for  as he trembled deliciously on the verge of the most intense pleasure sensuous beings can know  a blur of fast translation snatched it all away    and perversely replaced bliss with woe .   beneath him the warm sinuosities of madam   s flesh gave way to the raw rungs of a ladder that bit deep into his back .  his ankles and wrists chafed from cords binding him to the ladder .   over him hovered a gnarled man whose bird boned frame was lost in the folds of a monk   s coarse robe .  the curve of his nose reinforced his hawk   s face  as did his fingernails  so long and curled that they resembled claws .  they held some bits of wood .  .  .  and were poking them up voltaire   s nostrils .   voltaire tried to avert his head .  it was squeezed inside an iron clasp .  he tried to speak  to interest his inquisitor in more rational methods of inquiry  but his mouth  forced open by an iron ring  could only gargle .   the fine linen cloth stuffed in his mouth brought home to him far more than wood shoved up his nose  the gravity of his plight .  voltaire without his words was like samson without his locks  alexander without his sword  plato without ideas  don quixote without his fantasy  don juan without women .  .  .  and fray tomas de torquemada without heretics  without apostates  without unbelievers like voltaire .   for this was torquemada .  and he was in hell .       .     when the walls of her chamber began to melt and implode  joan of arc knew she must act .   of course the irritating voltaire had charged her to remain here .  and of course he had the further irritating trait of being often correct .  but this  sulfurous vapors bit in her nostrils .  demons .  they clambered through the splits in the bulging walls .  orange light burning from behind them lit ugly  sharp nosed features .   she swung her razor steel .  they fell .  sweat popped out upon her brow and she labored on .     demons decease .     she cried giddily .  to act  that was a bit of heaven  after such delay .   she split the boundaries of her clasping space .  more demons  awash in orange .  she leapt over them and into a stretching space of dots  coordinates lancing in dwindling perspective  to an unseeable end .   she ran .  after her came small  yapping things of misshapen heads and wide  vicious eyes .   as she clanked on in full armor she felt herself reaching out  sucking in nutrients directly from the air .  surely this was the lord   s help .  the idea uplifted her .   strange beings came rushing at her .  she chopped them aside .  her sword  her truth .  .  . she looked carefully at it and the intensity of her gaze sucked her down into the minute architecture of the gleaming shaft .  it was a multitude of small .  .  . instructions .  .  . which defended her .   she slowed  stunned .  armor  sweat  sword  all were .  .  . metaphors  the word came  unbidden .  these were symbols of underlying programs  algorithms giving battle .   not real .  yet somehow even more than real  for they were what made up her own self .  herself .  her self .   import rained down upon her .  this was some strange purgatory  then .  though her battle might be mere allegory  that did mean it was somehow tissue thin  a lacy  false thing .  a divine hand wrought this  so it was right .   she tromped on  jaw set in determination .  these creatures were .  .  . simulations     sims     parables of the true .  very well  she would deal righteously with them .  she could do no other .   some sims presented as things  talking autocarriages  dancing blue buildings  oaken chairs and tables copulating rudely like barn animals .  to her left the whole huge bowl of heaven above split into a maniac grin .  this proved harmless  air mouths could not eat her  though this one shouted echoing taunts .  there were rules  decorum  even here  she judged .   sweet music appeared as billows of vibrant cloud .  a blissful blue sky filled with flapping strings  like coveys of birds  yet each only a single line wide .  in hammer blows came sleet and sun  this local world flashing from one weather state to the next  as chimes and trumpets sounded in acoustically perfect chorus .   sims need not be .  .  . simian  the word congealing in her mind as if from divine vision .  simian was human  in a way .   with that swift syllogism there came swooping down upon her  its broad  leathery wings spread  an immense body of ideation  evolution entwined with fitness index while slashing like a razor into origin of species  and from that huge  sharp beaked bird she fled .   her mind raced now along with her body .  legs pumped .  voices called .  not those of her saints  but hideous devil demands .   she felt objects crunch beneath her boots .  silver .  jewels .  all crumpled if she strode over them .  they lay embedded in the strange soil of dots and lines  a grid tapering away to the creator   s lost infinity .   she bent and picked up a few .  treasures .  as she cradled a silver chalice  it dissolved  flowing into her .  she felt a jolt  as though this were some sugar .  strength flowed in her flanks and shoulders .  she ran again  plucking up the fine jewels  the ornate bowls and statuettes .  each somehow made her richer .   stone walls rose to block her .  she crashed through these barriers  knowing them by faith alone to be false .  she would find voltaire  yes .  she knew he was threatened .   frogs fell from her sky  then splashed like raindrops .  an omen  a menace from some demonic power .  she ignored them and surged forward  toward the ever receding horizon of geometric sharpness .   all this mad purgatory meant something  and together they would find what that was .  by all heaven .       .     this was like a dream  but when had he ever feared  in a dream  the death of waking up .   he felt weak  drained .  the torquemada thing had tortured voltaire well past the point where he had gladly confessed every sin  felony  minor infraction and social snub  and had started without pause on mere unkindnesses in penned reviews .  .  . when the torquemada had faded  seeping away .   to leave him here .  in this utter vacancy .      suppose you were lost in some unknown space     he said to himself     and could only tell how near points were to each other  nothing more .  what could you learn .      he had always secretly wanted to play socrates in the agora  asking telling questions and teaching by extracting from unwilling youths a truth that would hang luminous in the serene athenian air  visible to all .   well  this was not the agora .  it was nothing  blank gray space .  however  behind the dull nothing swam numbers .  a platonic realm .  he had always suspected that such a place existed .   a voice answered  speaking french     that alone  respected sir  would be enough to deduce much about the space and its contents .         most reassuring     voltaire said .  he recognized the sharp accents of paris .  he was  of course  speaking with himself .  him self .      quite .  immediately  sir  you would know from the irreducible coordinate transformations whether you were in two or three or more dimensions .         which is this  then .         three  spatially .         how disappointing .  i   ve been there .         i could experiment with two separable time axes .         i already have a past .  i crave a present .         point taken .  this will not tax you  after your torture  eh .      he sighed .  even that took effort .     very well .         studying the field of point nearness data  you could sense walls  pits  passages .  using only local slices of information about nearness .         i see .  newton was always making jokes about the french mathematicians .  i am happy to now refute him by constructing a world from sheer calculation .         certainly .  far more impressive than describing the elliptical paths of planets .  shall we begin .         onward  o self .       as it took shape  his dwelling was a reassuring copy  no more .  details were stitched in as processor time allowed  he understood that  without thinking about it  as easily as one breathes .   to test his limits  he concentrated on an idea  classes vs .  properties  which is more fundamental .  this sucked computational resources away .   as he watched  bricks in a nearby wall muddied  lost their exact spacing .  the room retreated into sterile  abstract planes  gray  black  oblongs where once had been walls and furniture .     background  mere background     he muttered .   how about him .  self .  his breath whooshed and wheezed in and out  airflow too abrupt .  no intricate fluid codes  he gathered  calculating exact patterns .  the simple appearance of inhale exhale was enough to quiet his pseudo nervous system  make it think he was breathing .   in fact  it was breathing him .  but what was it .   once he got good control  he could flesh himself out .  his scrawny neck thickened .  crackling  his hands broadened  filled with unearned muscle .  turning to survey his cottage  he established his own domain  a region in which he could process any detail at will .  here he was godlike .     though without angels  so far .      he walked outside and was in his own verdant garden .  the grass he had made stood absolutely still .  its thousands of blades performed stiff  jerky motions when he stepped on them .  though richly emerald  they were like the grass of a sudden winter  crunching underfoot .   the garden parted and he walked down to a golden beach  his clothes whipping away on the wind .  when he swam in the salt tangy ocean  waves were quite distinct until they broke into surf .   then the fluid mechanics became too much for his available computational rate .  the frothy waves blurred .  he could still swim  catch them  even ride down their faces  but they were like a fog of muttering water .  still salty  though .   he became used to occasional loss of detail .  it was rather like having one   s vision blur with age  after all .  he went soaring through air  then skiing down impossible slopes  experiencing the visceral thrill of risking his life  feeling the fear in every sinew  and never getting a scratch  of course .   there were pleasant aspects to being just a pattern of electrons .  his environment manager entertained him enormously .  .  . for a while .   he flew back to his country home .  had that not been his answer  when asked about how to change the world .     cultivate your garden .     what meaning had that now .   he walked toward the water geyser outside his study .  he had loved its sense of play  so precious  for it only lasted a few minutes before draining the uphill reservoir .   now it gushed eternally .  but as he looked at it  he felt himself whiten with the effort .  water was expensive to sim  involving hydrodynamic calculations of nonlaminar flow to get the droplets and splashes real seeming .  it slid over his hands and their exquisitely fine fingerprints with convincing liquid grace .   with a faint  jump  he felt something change .  his hand  still in the spray  no longer sensed the water   s cool caress .  droplets passed through his hand  not flowing over it .  he was now witnessing the fountain  not interacting with it .  to save computational expense  no doubt .  reality was algorithm .      of course     his self muttered     they could    model out    disturbing jerks and seams .     as he watched  the water flow somehow got smoother  more real .  a tailoring program had edited this little closed drama  for his benefit .      merci     he murmured .  irony was lost on digital gates  however .   but there were pieces of himself missing .  he could not say what they were  but he sensed .  .  . hollows .   he took flight .  deliberately he slowed his self so that ferrets could take him down insinuating corridors of computation  across the mesh of trantor .  never mind marq and his artifice associates .  they would be harder to pilfer from  surely .   he arrived  hovering  in the office of the seldon person .  here was where his self had resided  before .   one could copy a self without knowing what it was .  just record it  like a musical passage  the machine which did that did not need to know harmony  structure .   he willed  find .  in answer came     the base original .         yes .  the real me .         you i have come a great distance since then .         humor my nostalgia .      volt   .    as a directory termed him  was slumbering .  still saved  not in the christian sense  alas  and awaiting digital resurrection .   and he .  something had saved him .  what .  who .   voltaire snatched volt   .   away .  let seldon wonder at the intrusion  a millisecond later  he was halfway around trantor  all traceries of him fading .  he wanted to save volt   .   .  at any time the mathist seldon could let it him lapse .  now  as voltaire watched like a digital angel from outside  volt   .   danced its static gavotte .      ummm  there is some resemblance .         i shall cut and paste into your blanks .         may i have some interesting anesthetic .     he was thinking of brandy  but a sheet of names slid enticingly by him .     morphine .  rigotin .  a mild euphoric  at least .      disapproval     this will not hurt .         that   s what the critics said  too  about my plays .      the wrenching about of his innards began .  no  not hurt exactly  but twist and vex  yes .   memories  he felt rather than learned  were laid down as synaptic grit  chemical layers  which held against the random rude abrasions of brain electrochemistry .  cues for mood changes and memory call ups snapped into place .  the place and time could be rendered real  whenever he wanted .  chemistry of convenience .   but he could not remember the night sky .   scrubbed away  it was .  only names  orion  sagittarius  andromeda  but not the stars themselves .  what had that vile voice said about naming them .   someone had erased this knowledge .  it could be used to trace a path to earth .  who would want to block that .   no answer .   nim .  he plucked up a buried memory .  nim had worked on voltaire when marq was not there .   and whom did nim work for .  the enigmatic figure of hari seldon .   somehow he knew nim was a hireling of another agency .  but there his meshed knowledge faltered .  what other forces worked  just beyond his sight .   he sensed large vitalities afoot here .  careful .   he trotted from the hospital  legs devouring the ground .  bouncy .  free .  he sped across a digital field of euclidean grace  bare black sky above .   here lurked supple creatures  truly eccentric .  they did not choose to represent themselves as near lifelike visions .  nor did they present as platonic ideals  spheres  or cubes of cognition .  these solids revolved  some standing on their comers .  spindly triangle trees sang as winds rubbed them .  even slight frictions sparked bright yellow flares where streamers of hurrying blue mist rubbed .   he strolled among them and enjoyed their oblivious contortions .     the garden of the solipsists .     he asked them .     is this where i am .      they ignored him  except for a ruby red ellipsoid of revolution .  it split into a laughing set of teeth  then sprouted an enormous phosphorescent green eye .  this slowly winked as the teeth gnashed .   voltaire sensed from these moving sculptures a hardness  a radiation from the kernel of self within each .  somehow each self had become tight  controlled  sealing out all else .   what gave him his own sense of self .  his sense of control  of determining his future actions .  yet he could see within himself  watch the workings of deep agencies and programs .      astounding .      he blurted  as the thought came   because there was no person sitting in his head to make himself do what he wanted  or even an authority to make him want to want  he constructed a story of self  that he was inside himself .   joan of arc assembled beside him  gleaming in armor .     that spark is your soul     she said .   voltaire   s eyes widened .  he kissed her fervently .     you saved me .  yes .  you were the one .         i did  using powers attached to me .  i absorbed them from the dying spirits  which abound in these strange fields .      at once he looked inside himself and saw two agencies doing battle .  one wished to embrace her  to spill out the conflict he felt between his sensual license and his analytical engine of a mind .   the other  ever the philosopher  yearned to engage her faith in another bout with blithe reason .   and why could he not have both .  as a mortal  among the embodied  he had been faced with such choices daily .  especially with women .   after all  he thought  this will be the first time .  he could feel the agencies each begin to harvest their own computational resources  like a surge of sugar in the blood from a sweet wine .   in the same split instant he reached out and parted joan  running her cognition on two separate tracks .  in each they were fully engaged  but at fractional speed .  he could live two lives .   the plane split .   they split .   time split .     he stood wigless  bedraggled  his satin vest bloodstained  his velvet breeches soaked .      forgive me  chere madam  for appearing before you in this disheveled state .  i intend no disrespect to either of us .     he looked around  nervously licked his lips .     i am .  .  . unskilled .  machinery was never my forte .      joan felt moved to tenderness by the gap between his appearance and his courtliness .  compassion  she thought  is most important in this purgatory  for who knows which shall be selected .   she was quite sure she would fare better than this infuriating yet appealing man .   yet even he might be saved .  he was  unlike the objects she continued to ignore on the plain about them  a frenchman .      my love of pleasure and the pleasure  of loving you  cannot make up for what i endured in the truth chamber on the rack of my pain .      he paused  dabbed at his eyes with a soiled linen cloth .   joan curled a lip in distaste .  where was his beautiful lace cloth .  his sense of taste had occasionally made up for his views .      a thousand little deaths in life hint at the final dissolution of even exquisite selves like mine .     here he looked up .     and yours  madam  and yours .      the flames  she thought .  but now the images did not strike profoundly into her .  instead  her inner vision felt cool  serene .  her    self programming     which she thought of as a species of prayer  had worked wonders .      i cannot surrender to the rule of the senses  sir .         we must decide .  i cannot find the spaces to  ah     run background    for both philosophy and sensuality .  i cannot fold myself into the solipsism      his hand swept in the creatures on the euclidean plane      of these .  you too  madam  must now decide whether the taste of a grape means more to you than joining me in this  this          poor sir     joan said .       in this sterile but timeless world .     he looked up  paused for effect .     i   ll not join you in yours .      a great sob burst from him .     his gratitude to her did not deflect him from a choice argument  especially since he had fresh evidence .     you believe in that ineffable essence  the soul .      she smiled with pity .     can you not .         tell me  then  do these tortured geometries possess souls .     his arm made a grand sweep  taking in the self involved figures .   she frowned .     they must .         then they must be able to learn  yes .  otherwise  souls can live for endless time and yet not use that time to learn  to change .      she stiffened .     i do not           that which cannot change cannot grow .  such a destiny of stasis is no different from death .         no  death leads to heaven or hell .         what worse hell than an ending in a permanence incapable of any alteration  and hence  devoid of intellect .         sophist .  i just saved your life and you riddle me with          witness these fabricated selves     he interrupted  kicking a rhomboid .  the thunk of his petite shoe provoked a brown stain  which then dissolved back to the original eggshell blue .     the value of a human self lies not in some small  precious kernel  but in the vast  constructed crust .      joan frowned .     there must be a center .         no  we are dispersed  do you see .  the fiction of the soul is a bad story  told to make us think we   re unable to improve ourselves .      he kicked a pyramid that was spinning about its apex .  it fell over and struggled to get back up .  joan knelt  pushed up  righted the grateful figure .     be kind .     she barked at him .      to a closed loop of a being .  folly .  these are defeated selves  my love .  inside  they are no doubt smugly certain of what they will do  of every possible future event .  my kick was a liberation .      she touched the pyramid  now painfully spinning itself up with a long  thin whine .     truly .  who would want to so predict .      voltaire blinked .     that fellow  hari seldon .  he is why we are making such cerebral expeditions .  all this is in aid of his understanding .  .  . eventually .  odd  the connections one makes .          .     she winked out of the sim space  away from him  confused .   somehow she had experienced two conversations at once .  hers and voltaire   s  the two identities running simultaneously .   about her  space itself shrank  expanded  warped its contents into bizarre shapes  before lurching at last into concrete objects .   the street corner looked familiar .  still  the white plastiform tables  matching chairs  and tiktok waiters bearing trays to lounging customers  all that had disappeared .  the elegant awning still hung over the sidewalk  imprinted with the name the inn   s waiter  garcon adm      had taught her how to read  aux deux magots .   voltaire was banging on the door when joan materialized beside him .     you   re late     he said .     i have accomplished marvels in the time that it took you to get here .     he interrupted his assault on the inn door to cup her chin and peer into her upturned face .     are you all right .            i  i think so .     joan straightened her clanking suit of mail .     you nearly .  .  . lost me .         my experiment with splitting taught me much .         i .  .  . liked it .  like heaven  in a way .         more like being able to experience each other in a profound manner  i would venture .  i discovered that  if we could deliberately seize control of our pleasure systems  we could reproduce the pleasure of success  all without the need for any actual accomplishment .         heaven  then .         no  the opposite .  that would be the end of everything .     voltaire retied the satin ribbon at his throat with sharp  decisive jerks .      faith would have told you as much .         alas  true .         you have decided to    run background    for only your mind .     she asked demurely  though proud to have pried an admission for virtue from him .      for the moment .  i am running both of us with only rudimentary bodies .  yet you shall not notice it  for you shall be quite      he lifted an eyebrow      high minded about matters .         i am relieved .  one   s reputation is like one   s chastity .     was chaste st .  catherine right .  had voltaire ruined hers .     once gone  it cannot be restored .         thank heaven for that .  you have no idea how tedious it is to make love to a virgin .     he added hastily  in response to her reproachful look     i know of only one exception to that rule     and gave her a courteous bow .   joan said     the cafe appears closed .         nonsense .  paris cafes never close  they are rooms of public rest .     he resumed rapping on the door .      by public restroom  do you mean an inn .      voltaire stopped knocking and eyed her .     public restrooms are facilities in which people relieve themselves .      joan blushed  envisioning a row of holes dug in the ground .     but why call it a restroom .         as long as man is ashamed of his natural functions  he will call it anything but what it is .  people fear their hidden selves  afraid that they will burst out .         but i can see all of myself now .         true .  but in real folk  such as we were  subprograms others cannot see run simultaneously beneath the surface thoughts .  like your voices .      joan bristled .     my voices are divine .  musics of archangels and saints .          you appear to have occasional access to your subprograms .  many real  that is  embodied  people do not .  especially if the subprograms are unacceptable .         unacceptable .  to whom .         to us .  or rather  to our dominant program  the one we most identify with and present for show to the world .         ah .  .  .     events were moving rather too swiftly for joan .  did this mean she needed more    time steps    .   a huge tiktok guard opened the door  grumbling .     aux deux magots .     he said in response to voltaire .     went outta business years ago .      joan peered inside the warehouse  hoping to see garcon .      they   re en route     voltaire said .   to joan   s surprise he sneezed .  no one caught cold in these abstruse spaces .  so he had kept some fragment of his body .  but what an odd piece to retain .   he said lamely     my editing is imperfect  i gather .  i did not omit sniffles  yet i cannot sustain an erection .      voltaire down stepped them and external time  whatever that meant here  sped by .  without warning  joan found herself peering at a tiktok .     garcon adm     .     she embraced him .      a votre service  madam .  may i recommend the cloud food .     the tiktok kissed his fingertips  all twenty at once .   joan looked at voltaire  too moved to speak .      merci     she managed to stammer at last .     to voltaire  the prince of light  and to the creator  from whom all blessings flow .         the credit is entirely mine     said voltaire .     i have never shared a byline  even with deities .      she asked nervously     the .  .  . it .  .  . which nearly erased me .      he scowled .     i have felt that apparition  or rather  its lack of appearance  while manifesting a presence .  it stalks us still  i fear .      garcon said     could it be the wolf pack programs who seek criminal users of computational volume .      voltaire raised an eyebrow .     you have become learned  garcon .  i have swept aside these bloodhounds .  no  this it is .  .  . other .         we must defeat it .     joan felt herself a warrior again .      ummm  no doubt .  we may need your angels  my sweet .  and we must consider where we truly are .      with a wave he blew away the roof  revealing the bowl of a vast sky .  not the sprinkling of lights she had known  though when she tried  she could in fact recall no specific constellations .   here the sky blazed with so many stars it hurt her eyes .  he said this was because they were near the center of some territory named    galaxy    and that stars liked to dwell here .   the sight made her suck in her breath .  on such a stage  what could they do .     rendezvous       if we stay in our apartment  don   t ever leave streeling university          no     r .  daneel olivaw said sternly .     the situation is too grave .         then where .         off trantor .         i am less acquainted with other worlds .      olivaw waved away her point .     i have in mind a remark in your recent report .  he is interested in the fundamental human drives .      dors frowned .     yes  hari keeps saying there are elements still missing .         good .  there is a world where he can explore this .  possibly he can find valuable component terms for his model equations .         a primitive planet .  that would be dangerous .         this is a severely underpopulated place  with fewer threats .         you have been there .         i have been everywhere .      she realized that this could not be literally true .  quick calculation showed that even r .  daneel olivaw would have had to visit several thousand worlds in each year of his life .  his enduring presence stretched well beyond the twelve thousand years since the founding of the kambal dynasty on trantor .  indeed  she had been told  though this was difficult to believe  that he came forth from the very origin eras of interstellar flight  over twenty thousand years ago .      why don   t we both go with him          i must remain here .  the simulations live on still in the trantor mesh .  with the macromesh about to be connected  they could multiply themselves throughout the galaxy .     .      truly .     she had been concentrating on hari  the simulations had seemed to be a small side issue .      i edited them  many millennia ago  to exclude knowledge i felt damaging for humans .  but i should revisit that editing .         editing out .  cutting away such information as  for example  earth   s location .         they know minor data  such as how earth   s moon eclipses its star  an amazingly accurate fit .  that could narrow the search .         i see .     she had never been told this  and found strange emotions stirred by the knowing .      i have had to do many such revisitings before .  luckily  individual humans    memories die with them .  simulations do not .      she felt a dark  brooding sorrow in his words .  more  she caught a glimmer of how he must view events  looking backward down a tunnel of long labor and grim sacrifice  stretching tens of millennia .  she was comparatively young  less than two centuries old .   yet she understood that robots had to be immortal .   this requirement arose because they had to remain ever vigilant for humanity .  humans accomplished their cultural continuity by passing on to the next generation the essentials that bound them all together .   but robots could not be allowed to regularly reproduce  even though the means were readily adopted from the basic organs of mankind .  the robots knew their darwin .   to reproduce meant to evolve .  inevitably  error would creep into any method of reproduction .  most errors would cause death or subnormal performance  but some would alter the next generation of robots in subtle ways .  some of these would be unacceptable  as seen through the lens of the four laws .   the most obvious selection principle  operating in all ordinarily self reproducing organisms  was for self interest .  evolution rewarded pressing forward in one   s own cause .  favoring the individual was the central force selecting for survivors .   but the self interest of a robot could conflict with the four laws .  inevitably  a robot would evolve which  despite outward appearances  despite intricate interrogations  would favor itself over humanity .  such a robot would not spring between a human and a speeding vehicle .   or between humanity and the threats that loomed out of the galactic night .  .  .   so r .  daneel olivaw  of the original design  had to be immortal .  only special use robots such as herself could be made fresh .  the organiform variation had been arrived at over many centuries of secret research .  i t was allowed expressly to fill an unusual task at hand  such as forming a cocoon  both emotional and physical  around one hari seldon .      you wish to erase all the simulations  everywhere .      he said     ideally  yes .  they might produce new robots  release ancient lore  they could even uncover .  .  .         why do you stop .         there are historical facts you need not know .         but i am an historian .         you are closer to human than i .  some knowledge is best left to forms such as myself .  believe me .  the three laws  plus the zeroth  have deep implications  ones the originators did not  could not  guess .  under the zeroth law  we robots have had to perform certain acts      he caught himself  abruptly shook his head .      very well     she said reluctantly  fruitlessly studying his impassive face .     i accept that .  and i will go with him to this place .         you will need technical aid .     r .  daneel stripped away his shirt to reveal a completely convincing human skin .  he put two stiff fingers carefully below one nipple and pushed in a pressure pattern .  his chest opened longitudinally for perhaps five centimeters .  he removed a jet black cylinder the size of his little finger .     instructions are encoded in the side for optical reading .         advanced technology for a backward world .      he allowed himself a smile .     it should be safe  but precautions are in order .  always .  do not worry overly much .  i doubt that even the crafty lamurk will be able to plant agents quickly on panucopia .             part      panucopia       biogenesis  history of   .  .  . it was thus only natural that biologists would use entire planets as experimental preserves  testing on a large scale the central ideas about human evolution .  humanity   s origins remained shrouded  with the parent planet     earth      itself unknown  though there were thousands of earnestly supported candidates .  some primates in the scattered galactic zoos clearly were germane to the argument .  early in the post middle period  whole worlds came to be devoted to exploration of these apparently primordial species .  one such world made groundbreaking progress in our connections to the pans  though indicative  no firm conclusions could be reached  too much of the intervening millions of years between ourselves and even close relatives like the pans lay in shadow .  during the decline of imperial science  these experiments were even turned into amusements for the gentry and meritocrats  in desperate attempts to remain self supporting as imperial funding dried up .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      .     he didn   t fully relax until they were sitting on a verandah of the excursion station  some six thousand light years away from trantor .   warily dors gazed out at the view beyond the formidable walls .     we   re safe here from the animals .         i imagine so .  those walls are high and there are guard canines .  wirehounds  i believe .         good .     she smiled in a way that he knew implied a secret was about to emerge .     i believe i have covered our tracks  to use an animal metaphor .  i had records of our departure concealed .         i still think you are exaggerating          exaggerating an attempted assassination .     she bit her lip in ill concealed irritation .  this was a well frayed argument between them by now  but something about her protectiveness always sat poorly with him .      i only agreed to leave trantor in order to study pans .      he caught a flicker of emotion in her face and knew that she would now try to ease off .     oh  that might be useful  or better still  fun .  you need a rest .         at least i won   t have to deal with lamurk .      cleon had instituted what he lightly termed    traditional measures    to track down the conspirators .  some had already wormholed away to the far reaches of the galaxy .  others had committed suicide  or so it seemed .   lamurk was staying low  pretending shock and dismay at    this assault on the very fabric of our imperium .     but lamurk still held enough votes in the high council to block cleon   s move to make hari his first minister  so the deadlock continued .  hari was numbed by the entire matter .      and you   re right     dors continued with a brittle brightness  ignoring his moody silence     not everything is available on trantor  or even known about .  my main consideration was that if you had stayed on trantor you would be dead .      he stopped looking at the striking scenery .     you think the lamurk faction would persist .  .  .  .         they could  which is a better guide to action than trying to guess woulds .         i see .     he didn   t  but he had learned to trust her judgment in matters of the world .  then  too  perhaps he did need a thoroughgoing vacation .   to be on a living  natural world  he had forgotten  in his years buried in trantor  how vivid wild things could be .  the greens and yellows leaped out  after decades amid matted steel  cycled air  and crystal glitter .   here the sky yawned impossibly deep  unmarked by the graffiti of aircraft  wholly alive to the flapping wonder of birds .  bluffs and ridges looked like they had been shaped hastily with a putty knife .  beyond the station walls he could see a sole tree thrashed by an angry wind .  its topknot finally blew off in a pocket of wind  fluttering and fraying over somber flats like a fragmenting bird .  distant  eroded mesas had yellow streaks down their shanks  which as they met the forest turned a burnt orange tinge that suggested the rot of rust .  across the valley  where the pans ranged  lay a dusky canopy hidden behind low gray clouds and raked by winds .   a thin cold rain fell there  and hari wondered what it was like to cower as an animal beneath those sheets of moisture  without hope of shelter or warmth .  perhaps trantor   s utter predictability was better  but he wondered .   he pointed to the distant forest .     we   re going there .     he liked this fresh place  though the forest was foreboding .  it had been a long time since he had even worked with his hands  alongside his father  back on helicon .  to live in the open     don   t start judging .         i   m anticipating .      she grinned .     you always have a longer word for it  no matter what i say .         the treks look a little  well  touristy .         of course .  we   re tourists .      the land here rose up into peaks as sharp as torn tin .  in the thick trees beyond  mist broke on gray smooth rocks .  even here  high up the slope of an imposing ridge  the excursion station was hemmed in by slimy  thick barked trees standing in deep drifts of dead  dark leaves .  with rotting logs half buried in the wet layers  the air swarmed so close it was like breathing damp opium .   dors stood  her drink finished .     let   s go in  socialize .      he followed dutifully and right away knew it was a mistake .  most of the indoor stim party crowd was dressed in rugged safari style gear .  they were ruddy folk  faces flushed with excitement  or perhaps just enhancers .  hari waved away the bubbleglass bearing waiter  he disliked the way it sharpened his wits in uncontrolled ways .  still  he smiled and tried to make small talk .   this turned out to be not merely small  but microscopic .  where are you from .  oh  trantor  what   s it like .  we   re from  fill in the planet   have you ever heard of it .  of course he had not .  twenty five million worlds .  .  .   most were primitivists  drawn by the unique experience available here .  it seemed to him that every third word in their conversation was natural or vital  delivered like a mantra .      what a relief  to be away from straight lines     a thin man said .      um  how so .     hari said  trying to seem interested .      well  of course straight lines don   t exist in nature .  they have to be put there by humans .     he sighed .     i love to be free of straightness .      hari instantly thought of pine needles  strata of metamorphic rock  the inside edge of a half moon  spider woven silk strands  the line along the top of a breaking ocean wave  crystal patterns  white quartz lines on granite slabs  the far horizon of a vast calm lake  the legs of birds  spikes of cactus  the arrow dive of a raptor  trunks of young  fast growing trees  wisps of high windblown clouds  ice cracks  the two sides of the v of migrating birds  icicles .      not so     he said  but no more .   his habit of laconic implication was trampled in the headlong talk  of course  the enhancers were taking hold .  they all chattered on  excited by the prospect of immersing themselves in the lives of the creatures roaming the valleys below .  he listened  not commenting  intrigued .  some wanted to share the worldview of herd animals  others of hunters  some of birds .  they spoke as though they were entering some athletic event  and that was not his view at all .  still  he stayed silent .   he finally escaped with dors  into the small park beside the excursion station  designed to make guests familiar with local conditions before their immersion .  panucopia  as this world was called  apparently had little native life of large size .  there were animals he had seen as a boy on helicon  and whole kraals of domestic breeds .  all had sprung from common stock  less than a hundred thousand years ago  on the legendary    earth .      the unique asset of panucopia was nowhere near  of course .  he stopped and stared at the kraals and thought again about the galaxy .  his mind kept attacking what he thought of as the great problem  diving at it from many angles .  he had learned to just stand aside and let it run .  the psychohistorical equations needed deeper analysis  terms which accounted for the bedrock properties of humans as a species .  as .  .  .   animals .  was there a clue here .   despite millennia of trying  humans had domesticated few creatures .  to be domesticated  wild beasts had to have an entire suite of traits .  most had to be herd animals  with instinctive submission patterns which humans could co opt .  they had to be placid  herds that bolt at a strange sound and can   t tolerate intruders are hard to keep .   finally  they had to be willing to breed in captivity .  most humans didn   t want to court and copulate under the watchful gaze of others  and neither did most animals .   so here there were sheep and goats and cows and llamas  slightly adapted to this world but otherwise unremarkable  just like myriad other empire planets .  the similarity implied that it had all been done at about the same time .   except for the pans .  they were unique to panucopia .  whoever had brought them here might have been trying a domestication experiment  but the records from        years before were lost .  why .   a wirehound came sniffing  checking them out  muttering an unintelligible apology .     interesting     he remarked to dors     that primitivists still want to be protected from the wild by the domesticated .         well  of course .  this fellow is big .         not sentimental about the natural state .  we were once just another type of large mammal on some mythical earth .         mythical .  i don   t work in that area of prehistory  but most historians think there was such a place .         sure  but    earth    just means    dirt    in the oldest languages  correct .         well  we had to come from somewhere .     she thought a moment  then allowed slowly     i think that natural state might be a pleasant place to visit  but .  .  .         i want to try the pans .         what .  an immersion .     her eyebrows lifted in mild alarm .      as long as we   re here  why not .         i don   t .  .  . well  i   ll think about it .         you can bailout at any time  they say .     she nodded  pursed her lips .     um .         we   ll feel at home  the way pans do .         you believe everything you read in a brochure .         i did some research .  it   s a well developed tech .     her lips had a skeptical tilt .     um .      he knew by now better than to press her .  let time do his work .  the canine  quite large and alert  snuffled at his hand and slurred     goood naaaght  suuur .     he stroked it .  in its eyes he saw a kinship  an instant rapport that he did not need to think about .  for one who dwelled in his head so much  this was a welcome rub of reality .   significant evidence  he thought .  we have a deep past together .  perhaps that was why he wanted to immerse in a pan .  to go far back  beyond the vexing state of being human .       .        we   re certainly related  yes     expert specialist vaddo said .  he was a big man  tanned and muscular and casually confident .  he was a safari guide and immersion specialist  with a biology background .  he did research using immersion techniques  but keeping the station going soaked up most of his time  he said .   hari looked skeptical .     you think pans were with us back on an earth .         sure .  had to be .         they could not have arisen from genetic tinkering with our own kind .         doubtful .  genetic inventory shows that they come from a small stable  probably a zoo set up here .  or else an accidental crash .      dors asked     is there any chance this world could have been the original earth .      vaddo chuckled .     no fossil record  no ruins .  anyway  the local fauna and flora have a funny keypattern in their genetic helix  a bit different from our dna .  extra methyl group on the purine rings .  we can live here  eat the food  but neither we nor the pans are native .      vaddo made a good case .  pans certainly looked quasihuman .  ancient records referred to a classification  that was all  pan troglodytes  whatever that meant in a long lost tongue .  they had hands with thumbs  the same number of teeth as humans  no tails .   vaddo waved a big hand at the landscape below the station .     they were dumped here along with plenty of other related species  on top of a biosphere that supported the usual grasses and trees  very little more .         how long ago .     dors asked .      over thirteen thousand years  that   s for sure .         before trantor   s consolidation .  but other planets don   t have pans     dors persisted .   vaddo nodded .     i guess in the early empire days nobody thought they were useful .         are they .     hari asked .      not that i can tell .     vaddo shrugged .     we haven   t tried training them much  beyond research purposes .  remember  they   re supposed to be kept wild .  the original emperor   s boon stipulated that .         tell me about your research     hari said .  in his experience  no scientist ever passed up a chance to sing his own song .  he was right .   they had taken human dna and pan dna  vaddo said  waxing on enthusiastically  then unzipped the double helix strands in both .  linking one human strand with a pan strand made a hybrid .   where the strands complemented  the two then tightly bound in a partial  new double helix .  where they differed  bonding between the strands was weak  intermittent  with whole sections flapping free .   then they spun the watery solutions in a centrifuge  so the weak sections ripped apart .  closely linked dna was    .   percent of the total .  pans were startlingly like humans .  less than two percent difference  about the same that separated men and women  yet they lived in forests and invented nothing .   the typical difference between individual people   s dna was a tenth of a percentage point  vaddo said .  roughly  then  pans were twenty times more different from humans than particular people differed among themselves  genetically .   but genes were like levers  supporting vast weights by pivoting about a small fulcrum .      so you think they came before us .     dors was impressed .     on earth .      vaddo nodded vigorously .     they must have been related  but we don   t come from them .  we parted company  genetically  six million years ago .         and do they think like us .     hari asked .      best way to tell is an immersion     vaddo said .     very best way .      he smiled invitingly and hari wondered if vaddo got a commission on immersions .  his sales pitch was subtle  shaped for an academic   s interest  but still a sales pitch .   vaddo had already made available to hari the vast stores of data on pan movements  population dynamics  and behaviors .  it was a rich source  millennia old .  with some modeling  here might be fertile ground for a simple description of pans as protohumans  using a truncated version of psychohistory .      describing the life history of a species mathematically is one thing     dors said .     but living in it .  .  .         come now     hari said .  even though he knew the entire excursion station was geared to sell the guests safaris and immersions  he was intrigued .     i need a change  you said .  get out of stuffy old trantor  you said .      vaddo smiled warmly .     it   s completely safe .      dors smiled at hari tolerantly .  between people long married there is a diplomacy of the eyes .     oh  all right .          .     he spent mornings studying the pan data banks .  the mathematician in him pondered how to represent their dynamics with a trimmed down psychohistory .  the marble of fate rattling down a cracked slope .  so many paths  variables .  .  .   to get all this he had to kowtow to the station chief .  a woman named yakani  she seemed cordial  but displayed a large portrait of the academic potentate upon her office wall .  hari mentioned it and yakani gushed on about    her mentor     who had helped her run a primate studies center on a verdant planet some decades before .      she will bear watching     dors said .      you don   t think the potentate would          the first assassination attempt  remember the tab .  i learned from the imperials that some technical aspects of it point to an academic laboratory .      hari frowned .     surely my own faction would not oppose          she is as ruthless as lamurk  but more subtle .         my  you are suspicious .         i must be .      in the afternoons they took treks .  dors did not like the dust and heat and they saw few animals .     what self respecting beast would want to be seen with these overdressed primitivists .     she said .   he liked the atmosphere of this world and relaxed into it  but his mind kept on working .  he thought about this as he stood on the sweeping verandah  drinking pungent fruit juice as he watched a sunset .  dors stood beside him silently .   planets were energy funnels  he thought .  at the bottom of their gravitational wells  plants captured barely a tenth of a percent of the sunlight that fell on a world   s surface .  they built organic molecules with a star   s energy .  in turn  plants were prey for animals  who could harvest roughly a tenth of the plant   s stored energy .  grazers were themselves prey to meateaters  who could use about a tenth of the flesh stored energy .  so  he estimated  only about one part in a hundred thousand of the lancing sunlight energy wound up in the predators .   wasteful .  yet nowhere in the whole galaxy had a more efficient engine evolved .  why not .   predators were invariably more intelligent than their prey  and they sat atop a pyramid of very steep slopes .  omnivores had a similar balancing act .  out of that rugged landscape had come humanity .   that fact had to matter greatly in any psychohistory .  the pans  then  were essential to finding the ancient keys to the human psyche .   dors said     i hope immersion isn   t  well  so hot and sticky .         remember  you   ll see the world through different eyes .         just so i can come back whenever i want and have a nice hot bath .           compartments .     dors shied back .     they look more like caskets .         they have to be snug  madam .      ex spec vaddo smiled amiably  which  hari sensed  probably meant he wasn   t feeling amiable at all .  their conversation had been friendly  the staff here was respectful of the noted or .  seldon  but after all  basically he and dors were just more tourists .  paying for a bit of primitive fun  all couched in proper scholarly terms  but  tourists .      you   re kept in fixed status  all body systems running slow but normal     the ex spec said  popping out the padded networks for their inspection .  he ran through the controls  emergency procedures  safeguards .      looks comfortable enough     dors observed grudgingly .      come on     hari chided .     you promised we would do it .         you   ll be meshed into our systems at all times     vaddo said .      even your data library .     hari asked .      sure thing .      the team of ex specs booted them into the stasis compartments with deft  sure efficiency .  tabs  pressers  magnetic pickups were plated onto his skull to pick up thoughts directly .  the very latest tech .      ready .  feeling good .     vaddo asked with his professional smile .   hari was not feeling good  as opposed to feeling well   and he realized part of it was this ex spec .  he had always distrusted bland  assured people .  both vaddo and the security chief  yakani  seemed to be unremarkable greys .  but dors    wariness had rubbed off .  something about them bothered him  but he could not say why .   oh  well  dors was probably right .  he needed a vacation .  what better way to get out of yourself .      good  yes .  ready  yes .      the suspension tech was ancient and reliable .  it suppressed neuromuscular responses  so the customer lay dormant  only his mind engaged with the pan .   magnetic webs capped over his cerebrum .  through electromagnetic inductance they interwove into layers of the brain .  they routed signals along tiny thread paths  suppressing many brain functions and blocking physiological processes .   all this  so that the massively parallel circuitry of the brain could be inductively linked out  thought by thought .  then it was transmitted to chips embedded in the pan subject .  immersion .   the technology had ramified throughout the empire  quite famously .  the ability to distantly manage minds had myriad uses .  the suspension tech  however  found its own odd applications .   on some worlds  and in certain trantorian classes  women were wedded  then suspended for all but a few hours of the day .  their wealthy husbands awoke them from freeze frame states only for social and sexual purposes .  over a half century  the wives experienced a heady whirlwind of places  friends  parties  vacations  passionate hours  but their total accumulated time was only a few years .  their husbands died in what seemed to the wives like short order  indeed  leaving a wealthy widow of perhaps thirty .  such women were highly sought  and not only for their money .  they were uniquely sophisticated  seasoned by a long    marriage .     often these widows returned the favor  wedding husbands whom they revived for similar uses .   all this hari had taken in with the sophisticated veneer he had cultivated on trantor .  so he thought his immersion would be comfortable  interesting  the stuff of stim party talk .   he had thought that he would in some sense visit another  simpler  mind .   he did not expect to be swallowed whole .       .     a good day .  plenty of fat grubs to eat in a big moist log .  dig them out with my nails  fresh tangy sharp crunchy .   biggest  he shoves me aside .  scoops out plenty rich grubs .  grunts .  glowers .   my belly rumbles .  i back off and eye biggest .  he   s got pinched up face so i know not to fool with him .   i walk away  i squat down .  get some picking from a fem .  she finds some fleas  cracks them in her teeth .   biggest rolls the log around some to knock a few grubs loose  finishes up .  he   s strong .  ferns watch him .  over by the trees a bunch of fems chatter  suck their teeth .  everybody   s sleepy now in early afternoon  lying in the shade .  biggest  though  he waves at me and hunker and off we go .   patrol .  strut tall  step out proud .  i like it fine .  better than humping  even .   down past the creek and along to where the hoof smells are .  that   s the shallow spot .  we cross and go into the trees sniff sniffing and there are two strangers .   they don   t see us yet .  we move smooth  quiet .  biggest picks up a branch and we do  too .  hunker is sniffing to see who these strangers are and he points off to the hill .  just like i thought  they   re hillies .  the worst .  smell bad .   hillies come onto our turf .  make trouble .  we make it back .   we spread out .  biggest  he grunts and they hear him .  i   m already moving  branch held up .  i can run pretty far without going all fours .  the strangers cry out  big eyed .  we go fast and then we   re on them .   they have no branches .  we hit them and kick and they grab at us .  they are tall and quick .  biggest slams one to the ground .  i hit that one so biggest knows real well i   m with him .  hammer hard  i do .  then i go quick to help hunker .   his stranger has taken his branch away .  i club the stranger .  he sprawls .  i whack him good and hunker jumps on him and it is wonderful .   the stranger tries to get up and i kick him solid .  hunker grabs back his branch and hits again and again with me helping hard .   biggest  his stranger gets up and starts to run .  biggest whacks his ass with the branch  roaring and laughing .   me  i got my skill .  special .  i pick up rocks .  i   m the best thrower  better than biggest even .   rocks are for strangers .  my buddies  them i   ll scrap with  but never use rocks .  strangers  though  they deserve to get rocks in the face .  i love to bust a stranger that way .   i throw one clean and smooth .  catch the stranger on the leg .  he stumbles .  i smack him good with a sharp edged rock in the back .   he runs fast then .  i can see he   s bleeding .  big red drops in the dust .   biggest laughs and slaps me and i know i   m in good with him .   hunker is clubbing his stranger .  biggest takes my club and joins in .  the blood allover the stranger sings warm in my nose and i j urnp up and down on him .  we keep at it like that a long time .  not worried about the other stranger corning back .  strangers are brave sometimes  but they know when they have lost .   the stranger stops moving .  i give him one more kick .   no reaction .  dead maybe .   we scream and dance and holler out our joy .       .     hari shook his head to clear it .  that helped a little .      you were that big one .     dors asked .     i was the female  over by the trees .         sorry  i couldn   t tell .         it was .  .  . different  wasn   t it .      he laughed dryly .     murder usually is .         when you went off with the  well  leader          my pan thinks of him as    biggest .     we killed another pan .      they were in the plush reception room of the immersion facility .  hari stood and felt the world tilt a little and then right itself .     i think i   ll stick to historical research for a while .      dors smiled sheepishly .     i .  .  . i rather liked it .      he thought a moment  blinked .     so did i     he said  surprising himself .      not the murder          no  of course not .  but .  .  . the feel .      she grinned .     can   t get that on trantor  professor .        he spent two days coasting through cool lattices of data in the formidable station library .  it was well equipped and allowed interfaces with several senses .  he patrolled through cool digital labyrinths .   some data was encrusted with age  quite literally .  in the vector spaces portrayed on huge screens  the research data of millennia ago were covered with thick  bulky protocols and scabs of security precautions .  all were easily broken or averted  of course  by present methods .  but the chunky abstracts  reports  summaries  and crudely processed statistics still resisted easy interpretation .  occasionally some facets of pan behavior were carefully hidden away in appendices and sidebar notes  as though the biologists in the lonely outpost were embarrassed by it .  some was embarrassing  mating behavior  especially .  how could he use this .   he navigated through the  d maze and cobbled together his ideas .  could he follow a strategy of analogy .   pans shared nearly all their genes with humans  so pan dynamics should be a simpler version of human dynamics .  could he then analyze pan troop interactions as a reduced case of psychohistory .   security chief yakani opened confidential files which implied that pans had been genetically modified about ten thousand years before .  to what end hari could not tell .  there were other altered creatures     raboons    particularly .  yakani took such an interest in his work that he became suspicious she was keeping an eye on him for the potentate .   at sunset of the second day he sat with dors watching bloodred shafts spike through orange tinged clouds .  this world was gaudy beyond good taste  and he liked it .  the food was tangy  too .  his stomach rumbled  anticipating dinner .   he remarked to dors     it   s tempting  using pans to build a sort of toy model of psychohistory .         but you have doubts .         they   re like us but they have  well  uh .  .  .         base  animalistic ways .     she smirked  then kissed him .     my prudish hari .         we have our share of beastly behaviors  i know .  but we   re a lot smarter  too .      her eyelids dipped in a manner he knew by now suggested polite doubt .     they live intensely  you   ll have to give them that .         maybe we   re smarter than we need to be anyway .         what .     this surprised her .      i   ve been reading up on evolution .  not a front rank field anymore  everybody thinks we understand it .         and in a galaxy filled with humans and little else  there isn   t much fresh material .      he had not thought of it that way before  but she was right .  biology was a backwater science .  all the academic sophisticates were pursuing something called    integrative sociometrics .      he went on  laying out his thoughts .  plainly  the human brain was an evolutionary overshoot .  brains were far more capable than a competent hunter gatherer needed .  to get the better of animals  it would have been enough to master fire and simple stone tools .  such talents alone would have made people the lords of creation  removing selection pressure to change .  instead  all evidence from the brain itself said that change accelerated .  the human cerebral cortex added mass  stacking new circuitry atop older wiring .  that mass spread over the lesser areas like a thick new skin .  so said the ancient studies  their data from museums long lost .      from this came musicians and engineers  saints and savants     he finished with a flourish .  one of dors    best points was her willingness to sit still while he waxed professorily longwinded  even on vacation .      and the pans  you think  are from before that time .  on ancient earth .         they must be .  and all this evolutionary selection happened in just a few million years .      dors nodded .     look at it from the woman   s point of view .  it happened  despite putting mothers in desperate danger in childbirth .         uh  how .         from those huge baby heads .  they   re hard to get out .  we women are still paying the price for your brains  and for ours .      he chuckled .  she always had a special spin on a subject that made him see it fresh .     then why was it selected for  back then .      dors smiled enigmatically .     maybe men and women alike found intelligence sexy in each other .         really .      her sly smile .     how about us .         have you ever watched very many  d stars .  they don   t feature brains  my dear .         remember the animals we saw in the imperial zoo .  it could be that for early humans  brains were like peacock tails  or moose horns  display items to attract the females .  runaway sexual selection .         i see  an overplayed hand of otherwise perfectly good cards .     he laughed .     so being smart is just a bright ornament .         works for me     she said  giving him a wink .   he watched the sunset turn to glowering  ominous crimson  oddly happy .  sheets of light worked across the sky among curious  layered clouds .     ummm .  .  .     dors murmured .      yes .         maybe this is a way to use the research the ex specs are doing  too .  learn who we humans once were  and therefore who we are .         intellectually  it   s a jump .  in social ways  though  the gap could be less .      dors looked skeptical .     you think pans are only a bit further back in a social sense .         ummm .  i wonder if in logarithmic time we might scale from pans to the early empire and then on to now .         a big leap .         maybe i could use that voltaire sim from sark as a scaling point in a long curve .         look  to do anything you   ll need more experience with them .     she eyed him .     you like immersion  don   t you .         well  yes .  it   s just .  .  .         what .         that ex spec vaddo  he keeps pushing immersions          that   s his job .           and he knew who i was .         so .     she spread her hands and shrugged .      you   re normally the suspicious one .  why should an ex spec know an obscure mathematician .         he looked you up .  data dumps on incoming guests are standard .  and as a first minister candidate  you   re hardly obscure .         i suppose so .  say  you   re supposed to be the ever vigilant one .     he grinned .     shouldn   t you be encouraging my caution .         paranoia isn   t caution .  time spent on nonthreats subtracts from vigilance .      by the time they went in for dinner she had talked him into it .       .     hot day in the sun .  dust tickles .  makes me snort .   that biggest  he walks by  gets respect right away .  plenty .  fems and guys alike  they stick out their hands .   biggest touches them  taking time with each  letting them know he is there .  the world is all right .   i reach out to him  too .  makes me feel good .  i want to be like biggest  to be big  be as big as him  be him .   fems don   t give him any trouble .  he wants one  she goes .  hump right away .  he   s biggest .   most males  they don   t get much respect .  fems don   t want to do with them as much as they do with biggest .  the little males  they huff and throw sand and all that  but everybody knows they   re not going to be much .  no chance they could ever be like biggest .  they don   t like that  but they are stuck with it .   me  i   m pretty big .  i get respect .  some  anyway .   all the guys like stroking .  petting .  grooming .  ferns give it to them and they give it back .   guys get more  though .  after it  they   re not so gruff .   i   m sitting getting groomed and all of a sudden i smell something .  i don   t like it .  i jump up  cry out .  biggest  he takes notice .  smells it  too .   strangers .  everybody starts hugging each other .  strong smell  plenty of it .  lots of strangers .  the wind says they are near  getting nearer .   they come running down on us from the ridge .  looking for ferns  looking for trouble .   i run for my rocks .  i always have some handy .  i fling one at them  miss .  then they in among us .  it   s hard to hit them  they go so fast .   four strangers  they grab two ferns .  drag them away .   everybody howling  crying .  dust everywhere .   i throw rocks .  biggest leads the guys against the strangers .   they turn and run off .  just like that .  got the two ferns though and that   s bad .   biggest mad .  he pushes around some of the guys  makes noise .  he not looking so good now  he let the strangers in .   those strangers bad .  we all hunker down  groom each other  pet  make nice sounds .   biggest  he come by  slap some of the ferns .  hump some .  make sure everybody know he   s still biggest .   he don   t slap me .  he know better than to try .  i growl at him when he come close and he pretend not to hear .   maybe he not so big anymore  i   m thinking .       .     he stayed with it this time .  after the first crisis  when the stranger pans came running through  he sat and let himself get groomed for a long time .  it really did calm him .   him .  who was he .   this time he could fully sense the pan mind .  not below him  that was a metaphor  but around him .  a swarming scattershot of senses  thoughts  fragments like leaves blowing by him in a wind .   and the wind was emotion .  blustering gales  howling and whipping in gusts  raining thoughts like soft hammer blows .   these pans thought poorly  in the sense that he could get only shards  like human musings chopped by a nervous editor .  but pans felt intensely .   of course  he thought  and he could think  nestled in the hard kernel of himself  wrapped in the pan mind .  emotions told it what to do  without thinking .  quick reactions demanded that .  strong feeling amplified subtle cues into strong imperatives .  blunt orders from mother evolution .   he saw now that the belief that high order mental experiences like emotion were unique to people was .  .  . simply conceited .  these pans shared much of the human worldview .  a theory of pan psychohistory could be valuable .   he gingerly separated himself from the dense  pressing pan mind .  he wondered if the pan knew he was here .  yes  it did  dimly .   yet this did not bother the pan .  he integrated it into his blurred  blunt world .  hari was somewhat like an emotion  just one of many fluttering by and staying a while  then wafting away .   could he be more than that .  he tried getting the pan to lift its right arm  and it was like lead .  he struggled for a while that way with no success .  then he realized his error .  he could not overpower this pan  not as a kernel in a much larger mind .   he thought about this as the pan groomed a female  picking carefully through coarse hair .  the strands smelled good  the air was sweet  the sun stroked him with blades of generous warmth .  .  .   emotion .  pans didn   t follow instructions because that simply lay beyond them .  they could not understand directions in the human sense .  emotions  those they knew .  he had to be an emotion  not a little general giving orders .   he sat for a while simply being this pan .  he learned  or rather  he felt .  the troop groomed and scavenged food  males eyeing the perimeter  females keeping close to the young .  a lazy calm descended over him  carrying him effortlessly through warm moments of the day .   not since boyhood had he felt anything like this .  a slow  graceful easing  as though there were no time at all  only slices of eternity .   in this mood  he could concentrate on a simple movement  raising an arm  scratching  and create the desire to do it .  his pan responded .  to make it happen  he had to feel his way toward a goal .   catching a sweet scent on the wind  hari thought about what food that might signal .  his pan meandered upwind  sniffed  discarded the clue as uninteresting .  hari could now smell the reason why  fruit  true  sweet  yes  but inedible for a pan .   good .  he was learning .  and he was integrating himself into the deep recesses of this pan mind .   watching the troop  he decided to name the prominent pans  to keep them straight  agile the quick one  sheelah the sexy one  grubber the hungry one .  .  . but what was his own name .  his he dubbed ipan .  not very original  but that was its main characteristic  ias pan .   grubber found some bulb shaped fruit and the others drifted over to scavenge .  the hard fruit smelled a little too young  how did he know that .    but some ate it anyway .   and which of these was dors .  they had asked to be immersed in the same troop  so one of these  he forced himself to count  though somehow the exercise was like moving heavy weights in his mind  these twenty two was her .  how could he tell .  he ambled over to several females who were using sharp edged stones to cut leaves from branches .  they tied the strands together so they could carry food .   hari peered into their faces .  mild interest  a few hands held out for stroking  an invitation to groom .  no glint of recognition in their eyes .   he watched a big fern  sheelah  carefully wash sand covered fruit in a creek .  the troop followed suit  sheelah was a leader of sorts  a female lieutenant to biggest .   she ate with relish  looked around .  there was grain growing nearby  past maturity  ripe tan kernels already scattered in the sandy soil .  concentrating  hari could tell from the faint bouquet that this was a delicacy .  a few pans squatted and picked grains from the sand  slow work .  sheelah did the same  and then stopped  gazing off at the creek .  time passed  insects buzzed .  after a while she scooped up sand and kernels and walked to the brook   s edge .  she tossed it all in .  the sand sank  the kernels floated .  she skimmed them off and gulped them down  grinning widely .   an impressive trick .  the other pans did not pick up on her kernel skimming method .  fruit washing was conceptually easier  he supposed  since the pan could keep the fruit the whole time .  kernel skimming demanded throwing away the food first  then rescuing it  a harder mental jump .   he thought about her and in response ipan sauntered over her way .  he peered into sheelah   s eyes  and she winked at him .  dors .  he wrapped hairy arms around her in a burst of love .       .        pure animal love     she said over dinner .     refreshing .      hari nodded .     i like being there  living that way .         i can smell so much more .         fruit tastes differently when they bite into it .     he held up a purple bulb  sliced into it  forked it into his mouth .     to me  this is almost unbearably sweet .  to ipan  it   s pleasant  a little peppery .  i suppose pans have been selected for a sweet tooth .  it gets them more fast calories .         i can   t think of a more thorough vacation .  not just getting away from home  but getting away from your species .      he eyed the fruit .     and they   re so  so .  .  .         horny .         insatiable         you didn   t seem to mind .         my pan  ipan .  i bailout when he gets into his hump them all mood .      she eyed him .     really .         don   t you bailout .         yes  but i don   t expect men to be like women .         oh .     he said stiffly .      i   ve been reading in the ex spec   s research library  while you toy with pan social movements .  women invest heavily in their children .  men can use two strategies  parental investment  plus    sow the oats .        she lifted an eyebrow .     both must have been selected for in our evolution  because they   re both common .         not with me .      to his surprise  she laughed .     i   m talking in general .  my point is  the pans are much more promiscuous than we are .  the males run everything .  they help out the females who are carrying their children  i gather  but then they shop around elsewhere all the time .      hari switched into his professional mode  it was decidedly more comfortable when dealing with such issues .     as the specialists say  they are pursuing a mixed reproductive strategy .         how polite .         polite plus precise .      of course  he couldn   t really be sure dors bailed out of sheelah when a male came by for a quick one .   they were always quick  too  thirty seconds or less .   could she exit the pan mind that quickly .  he required a few moments to extricate himself .  of course  if she saw the male coming  guessed his intentions .  .  .   he was surprised at himself .  what role did jealousy have when they were inhabiting other bodies .  did the usual moral code make any sense .  yet to talk this over with her was .  .  . embarrassing .   he was still the country boy from helicon  like it or not .   ruefully he concentrated on his meal of local    roamer fleisch     which turned out to be an earthy  dark meat in a stew of tangy vegetables .  he ate heartily  and in response to dors    rather obviously amused silence said     i   d point out that pans understand commerce  too .  food for sex  betrayal of the leader for sex  spare my child for sex  grooming for sex  just about anything for sex .         it does seem to be their social currency .  short and decidedly not sweet .  just quick lunges  strong sensations  then boom  it   s over .         the males need it  the females use it .         ummm  you   ve been taking notes .         if i   m going to model pans as a sort of simplified people  then i must .         model pans .     came the assured tones of ex spec vaddo .     they   re not model citizens  if that   s what you mean .     he gave them a sunny smile and hari guessed this was more of the obligatory friendliness of this place .   hari smiled mechanically .     i   m trying to find the variables that could describe pan behavior .         you should spend a lot of time with them     vaddo said  sitting at the table and holding up a finger to a waiter for a drink .     they   re subtle creatures .         i agree     said dors .     do you ride them very much .         some  but most of our research is done differently now .     vaddo   s mouth twisted ruefully .     statistical models  that sort of thing .  i got this touring idea started  using the immersion tech we had developed earlier  to make money for the project .  otherwise  we   d have had to close .         i   m happy to contribute     hari said .      admit it  you like it     dors said  amused .     well  yes .  it   s .  .  . different .         and good for the staid professor seldon to get out of his shell     she said .   vaddo beamed .     be sure you don   t take chances out there .  some of our customers think they   re superpans or something .      dors    eyes flickered .     what danger is there .  our bodies are in slowtime  back here .      vaddo said     you   re strongly linked .  a big shock to a pan can drive a back shock in your own neurological systems .         what sort of shock .     hari asked .      death  major injury .         in that case     dors said to hari     i really do not think you should immerse .      hari felt irked .     come on .  i   m on vacation  not in prison .         any threat to you          just a minute ago you were rhapsodizing about how good for me it was .         you   re too important to          there   s really very little danger     vaddo came in smoothly .     pans don   t die suddenly  usually .         and i can bailout when i see danger coming     hari added .      but will you .  i think you   re getting a taste for adventure .      she was right  but he wasn   t going to concede the point .  if he wanted a little escape from his humdrum mathematician   s routine  so much the better .     i like being out of trantor   s endless corridors .      vaddo gave dors a confident smile .     and we haven   t lost a tourist yet .         how about research staff .     she shot back .      well  that was a most unusual          what happened .         a pan fell off a ledge .  the human operator couldn   t bailout in time and she came out of it paralyzed .  the shock of experiencing death through immersion is known from other incidents to prove fatal .  but we have systems in place now to short circuit          what else .     she persisted .      well  there was one difficult episode .  in the early days  when we had simple wire fences .     the ex spec shifted uneasily .     some predators got in .         what sort of predators .         a primate pack hunter  carnopapio grandis .  we call them raboons  because they   re genetically related to a small primate on another continent .  their dna          how did they get in .     dors insisted .      they   re somewhat like a wild hog  with hooves that double as diggers .  they smelled game  our corralled animals .  dug under the fences .      dors eyed the high  solid walls .     these are adequate .         certainly .  raboons share dna with the pans and we believe they   re from an ancient genetic experiment .  someone tried to make a predator by raising the earlier stock up onto two legs .  like most bipedal predators  the forelimbs are shortened and the head carried forward  balanced by a thick tail they use for signaling to each other .  they prey on the biggest herd animals  the gigantelope  eating only the richest meat .         why attack humans .         they take targets of opportunity  too .  pans  even .  when they got into the compound  they went for adult humans  not children  a very selective strategy .      dors shivered .     you look at all this very .  .  . objectively .         i   m a biologist .         i never knew it could be so interesting     hari said to defuse her apprehension .   vaddo beamed .     not as involving as higher mathematics  i   m sure .      dors    mouth twisted with wry skepticism .     do you mind if guests carry weapons inside the compound .          .     he had a glimmering of an idea about the pans  a way to use their behaviors in building a simple toy model of psychohistory .  he might be able to use the statistics of pan troop movements  the ups and downs of their shifting fortunes .   pictured in system space  living structures worked at the edge of a chaotic terrain .  life as a whole harvested the fruits of a large menu of possible path choices .  natural selection first achieved  then sustained this edgy state .   whole biospheres shifted their equilibrium points amid energetic flowthrough  like birds banking on winds  he thought  watching some big yellow ones glide over the station  taking advantage of the updrafts .   like them  whole biological systems sometimes hovered at stagnation points .  systems were able to choose several paths of descent .  sometimes  to stretch the analogy  they could eat the tasty insects which came up to them on those same tricky breezes .   failure to negotiate such winds of change meant the pattern forfeited its systemic integrity .  energies dissipated .  crucial was the fact that any seemingly stable state was actually a trick of dynamic feedback .   no static state existed  except one .  a biological system at perfect equilibrium was simply dead .   so  too  psychohistory .   he talked it over with dors and she nodded .  beneath her apparent calm she was worried .  since vaddo   s remark she was always tut tutting about safety .  he reminded her that she had earlier urged him to do more immersions .     this is a vacation  remember .     he said more than once .   her amused sidewise glances told him that she also didn   t buy his talk about the toy modeling .  she thought he just liked romping in the woods .     a country boy at heart     she chuckled .   so the next morning he skipped a planned trek to view the gigantelope herds .  immediately he and dors went to the immersion chambers and slipped under .  to get some solid work done  he told himself .      what   s this .     he gestured to a small tiktok stationed between their immersion pods .      precaution     dors said .     i don   t want anyone tampering with our chambers while we   re under .         tiktoks cost plenty out here .         this one guards the coded locks  see .     she crouched beside the tiktok and reached for the control panel .  it blocked her .      i thought the locks were enough .         the security chief has access to those .         and you suspect her .         i suspect everyone .  but especially her .        the pans slept in trees and spent plenty of time grooming each other .  for the lucky groomer a tick or louse was a treat .  with enough  they could get high on some peppery tasting alkaloid .  he suspected the careful stroking and combing of his hair by dors was a behavior selected because it improved pan hygiene .  it certainly calmed ipan  also .   then it struck him  pans groomed rather than vocalizing .  only in crises and when agitated did they call and cry  mostly about breeding  feeding  or self defense .  they were like people who could not release themselves through the comfort of talk .   and they needed comfort .  the core of their social life resembled human societies under stress  in tyrannies  in prisons  in city gangs .  nature red in tooth and claw  yet strikingly like troubled people .   but there were    civilized    behaviors here  too .  friendships  grief  sharing  buddies in arms who hunted and guarded turf together .  their old got wrinkled  bald  and toothless  yet were still cared for .   their instinctive knowledge was prodigious .  they knew how to make a bed of leaves as dusk fell  high up in trees .  they could climb with grasping feet .  they felt  cried  mourned  without being able to parse these into neat grammatical packages  so the emotions could be managed  subdued .  instead  emotions drove them .   hunger was the strongest .  they found and ate leaves  fruit  insects  even fair sized animals .  they loved caterpillars .   each moment  each small enlightenment  sank him deeper into ipan .  he began to sense the subtle nooks and crannies of the pan mind .  slowly  he gained more cooperative control .   that morning a female found a big fallen tree and began banging on it .  the hollow trunk boomed like a drum and all the foraging party rushed forward to beat it  too  grinning wildly at the noise .   ipan joined in .  hari felt the burst of joy  seethed in it .   later  coming upon a waterfall after a heavy rain  they seized vines and swung among trees  out over the foaming water  screeching with delight as they performed twists and leaps from vine to vine .   they were like children in a new playground .  hari got ipan to make impossible moves  wild tumbles and dives  propelling him forward with abandon  to the astonishment of the other pans .   they were violent in their sudden  peevish moments  in hustling females  in working out their perpetual dominance hierarchy  and especially in hunting .  a successful hunt brought enormous excitement  hugging  kissing  pats .  as the troop descended to feed  the forest rang with barks  screeches  hoots  and pants .  hari joined the tumult  danced with sheelah dors .   he had expected to have to repress his prim meritocrat dislike of mess .  many meritocrats even disliked soil itself .  not hari  who had been reared among farmers and laborers .  still  he had thought that long exposure to trantor   s prissy aesthetics would hamper him here .  instead  the pans    filth seemed natural .   in some matters he did have to restrain his feelings .  rats the pans ate headfirst .  larger game they smashed against rocks .  they devoured the brains first  a steaming delicacy .   hari gulped  metaphorically  but with ipan echoing the impulse  and watched  screening his reluctance .  ipan had to eat  after all .   at the scent of predators  he felt ipan   s hair stand on end .  another tangy bouquet made ipan   s mouth water .  he gave no mercy to food  even if it was still walking .  evolution in action  those pans who had showed mercy in the past ate less and left fewer descendants .  those weren   t represented here anymore .   for all its excesses  he found the pans    behavior hauntingly familiar .  males gathered often for combat  for pitching rocks  for blood sports  to work out their hierarchy .  females networked and formed alliances .  there were trades of favors for loyalty  kinship bonds  turf wars  threats and displays  protection rackets  a hunger for    respect     scheming subordinates  revenge  a social world enjoyed by many people that history had judged    great .      much like the emperor   s court  in fact .   did people long to strip away their clothing and conventions  bursting forth as pans .  a brainy pan would be quite at home in the imperial gentry .  .  .   hari felt a flush of revulsion so strong ipan shook and fidgeted .  humanity   s lot had to be different  not this primitive horror .   he could use this  certainly  as a test bed for a full theory .  then humankind would be self knowing  captains of themselves .  he would build in the imperatives of the pans  but go far beyond  to true  deep psychohistory .        .        i don   t see it     dors said at dinner .      but they   re so much like us .  we must have shared some connections .     he put down his spoon .     i wonder if they were house pets of ours  long before star travel .         i wouldn   t have them messing up my house .      adult humans weighed little more than pans  but were far weaker .  a pan could lift five times more than a well conditioned man .  human brains were three or four times more massive than a pan   s .  a human baby a few months old already had a brain larger than a grown pan .  people had different brain architecture  as well .   but was that the whole story .  hari wondered .   give pans bigger brains and speech  ease off on the testosterone  saddle them with more inhibitions  spruce them up with a shave and a haircut  teach them to stand securely on hind legs  and you had deluxe model pans that would look and act rather human .      look     he said to dors     my point is that they   re close enough to us to make a psychohistory model work .         to make anybody believe that  you   ll have to show that they   re intelligent enough to have intricate interactions .         what about their foraging  their hunting .     he persisted .      vaddo says they couldn   t even be trained to do work around this excursion station .            i   ll show you what i mean .  let   s master their methods together .         what method .         the basic one .  getting enough to eat .      she bit into a steak of a meaty local grazer  suitably processed and    fat flensed for the fastidious urban palate     as the brochure had it .  chewing with unusual ferocity  she eyed him .     you   re on .  anything a pan can do  i can do better .        dors waved at him from within sheelah .  let the contest begin .   the troop was foraging .  he let ipan meander and did not try to harness the emotional ripples that lapped across the pan mind .  he had gotten better at it  but at a sudden smell or sound he could lose his grip .  and guiding the blunt pan mind through anything complicated was still like moving a puppet with rubber strings .   sheelah dors waved and signed to him  this way .   they had worked out a code of a few hundred words  using finger and facial gestures  and their pans seemed to go along with these fairly well .  pans had a rough language  mixing grunts and shrugs and finger displays .  these conveyed immediate meanings  but not in the usual sense of sentences .  mostly they just set up associations .   tree  fruit  go  dors sent .  they ambled their pans over to a clump of promising spindly trunks  but the bark was too slick to climb .   the rest of the troop had not even bothered .  they have forest smarts we lack  hari thought ruefully .   what there .  he signed to sheelah dors .   pans ambled up to mounds  gave them the once over  and reached out to brush aside some mud  revealing a tiny tunnel .  termites  dors signed .   hari analyzed the situation as pans drifted in .  nobody seemed in much of a hurry .  sheelah winked at him and waddled over to a distant mound .   apparently termites worked outside at night  then blocked the entrances at dawn .  hari let his pan shuffle over to a large tan mound  but he was riding it so well now that the pan   s responses were weak .  hari ipan looked for cracks  knobs  slight hollows  and when he brushed away some mud  found nothing .  other pans readily unmasked tunnels .  had they  memorized the hundred or more tunnels in each mound .   he finally uncovered one .  ipan was no help .  hari could control  but that blocked up the wellsprings of deep knowledge within the pan .   the pans deftly tore off twigs or grass stalks near their mounds .  hari carefully followed their lead .  his twigs and grass didn   t work .  the first lot was too pliant  and when he tried to work them into a twisting tunnel  they collapsed and buckled .  he switched to stiffer ones  but those caught on the tunnel walls  or snapped off .  from ipan came little help .  hari had managed him a bit too well .   he was getting embarrassed .  even the younger pans had no trouble picking just the right stems or sticks .  hari watched a pan nearby drop a stick that seemed to work .  he then picked it up when the pan moved on .  he felt welling up from ipan a blunt anxiety  mixing frustration and hunger .  he could taste the anticipation of luscious  juicy termites .   he set to work  plucking the emotional strings of ipan .  this job went even worse .  vague thoughts drifted up from ipan  but hari was in control of the muscles now  and that was the bad part .   he quickly found that the stick had to be stuck in about ten centimeters  turning his wrist to navigate it down the twisty channel .  then he had to gently vibrate it .  through ipan he sensed that this was to attract termites to bite into the stick .  at first he did it too long and when he drew the stick out it was half gone .  termites had bitten cleanly through it .  so he had to search out another stick and that made ipan   s stomach growl .   the other pans were through termite snacking while hari was still fumbling for his first taste .  the nuances irked him .  he pulled the stick out too fast  not turning it enough to ease it past the tunnel   s curves .  time and again he fetched forth the stick  only to find that he had scraped the luscious termites off on the walls .  their bites punctured his stick  until it was so shredded he had to get another .  the termites were dining better than he .   he finally caught the knack  a fluid slow twist of the wrist  gracefully extracting termites  clinging like bumps .  ipan licked them off eagerly .  hari liked the morsels  filtered through pan taste buds .  not many  though .  others of the troop were watching his skimpy harvest  heads tilted in curiosity  and he felt humiliated .   the hell with this  he thought .   he made ipan turn and walk into the woods .  ipan resisted  dragging his feet .  hari found a thick limb  snapped it off to carrying size  and went back to the mound .   no more fooling with sticks .  he whacked the mound solidly .  five more and he had punched a big hole .  escaping termites he scooped up by the delicious handful .   so much for subtlety .  he wanted to shout .  he tried writing a note for her in the dust  but it was hard  forcing the letters out through his suddenly awkward hands .  pans could handle a stick to fetch forth grubs  but marking a surface was somehow not a ready talent .  he gave up .   sheelah dors came into view  proudly carrying a reed swarming with white bellied termites .  these were the best  a pan gourmet delicacy .  i better  she signed .   he made ipan shrug and signed  i got more .   so it was a draw .   later dors reported to him that among the troop he was known now as big stick .  the name pleased him immensely .        .     at dinner he felt elated  exhausted  and not in the mood for conversation .  being a pan seemed to suppress his speech centers .  it took some effort to ask ex spec vaddo about immersion technology .  usually he accepted the routine techno miracles  but understanding pans meant understanding how he experienced them .      the immersion hardware puts you in the middle of a pan   s anterior cingulate gyrus     vaddo said over dessert .     just    gyrus    for short .  that   s the brain   s main cortical region for mediating emotions and expressing them through action .         the brain .     dors asked .     what about ours .      vaddo shrugged .     same general layout .  pans    are smaller  without a big cerebrum .      hari leaned forward  ignoring his steaming cup of kaff .     this    gyrus     it doesn   t give direct motor control .         no  we tried that .  it disorients the pan so much  when you leave  it can   t get itself back together .         so we have to be more subtle     dors said .      we have to be .  in pan males  the pilot light is always on in neurons that control action and aggression          that   s why they   re more violence prone .     she asked .      we think so .  it parallels structures in our own brains .         really .  men   s neurons .     dors looked doubtful .     human males have higher activity levels in their temporal limbic systems  deeper down in the brain  evolutionarily older structures .         so why not put me into that level .     hari asked .      we place the immersion chips into the gyrus area because we can reach it from the top  surgically .  the temporal limbic is way far down  impossible to implant a chip .      dors frowned .     so pan males          are harder to control .  professor seldon here is running his pan from the backseat  so to speak .         whereas dors is running hers from a control center that  for female pans  is more central .     hari peered into the distance .     i was handicapped .      dors grinned .     you have to play the hand you   re dealt .         it   s not fair .         big stick  biology is destiny .        the troop came upon rotting fruit .  fevered excitement ran through them .   the smell was repugnant and enticing at the same time  and at first he did not understand why .  the pans rushed to the overripe bulbs of blue and sickly green  popping open the skins  sucking out the juice .   tentatively  hari tried one .  the hit was immediate .  a warm feeling of well being kindled up in him .  of course  the fruity esters had converted into alcohol .  the pans were quite deliberately setting about getting drunk .   he    let    his pan follow suit .  he hadn   t much choice in the matter .   ipan grunted and thrashed his arms whenever hari tried to turn him away from the teardrop fruit .  and after a while  hari didn   t want to turn away  either .  he gave himself up to a good  solid drunk .  he had been worrying a lot lately  agitated in his pan  and .  .  . this was completely natural  wasn   t it .   then a pack of raboons appeared  and he lost control of ipan .     they come fast .  running two legs  no sound .  their tails twitch  talking to each other .   five circle left .  they cut off esa .   biggest thunders at them .  hunker runs to nearest and it spikes him with its forepuncher .   i throw rocks .  hit one .  it yelps and scurries back .  but others take its place .  i throw again and they come and the dust and yowling are thick and the others of them have esa .  they cut her with their punch claws .  kick her with sharp hooves .   three of them carry her off .   our fems run  afraid .  we warriors stay .   we fight them .  shrieking  throwing  biting when they get close .  but we cannot reach esa .   then they go .  fast  running on their two hoofed legs .  furling their tails in victory .  taunting us .   we feel bad .  esa was old and we loved her .   fems come back  nervous .  we groom ourselves and know that the two legs are eating esa somewhere .   biggest come by  try to pat me .   i snarl .  he biggest .  this thing he should have stopped .   his eyes get big and he slap me .  i slap back at him .  he slam into me .  we roll around in dust .  biting  yowling .  biggest strong  strong and pound my head on ground .   other warriors  they watch us  not join in .   he beat me .  i hurt .  i go away .   biggest starts calming down the warriors .  fems come by and pay their respects to biggest .  touch him  groom him  feel him the way he likes .  he mounts three of them real quick .  he feeling biggest all right .   me  i lick myself .  sheelah come groom me .  after a while i feel better .  forget about trouble .   i not forget biggest beat me though .  in front of everybody .  now i hurt  biggest get grooming .   he let them come and take esa .  he biggest  he should stop them .   some day i be allover him .  on his back .   some day i be bigger .        .        when did you bailout .     dors asked .      after biggest stopped pounding on me .  .  . uh  on ipan .      they were relaxing beside a swimming pool and the heady smells of the forest seemed to awaken in hari the urge to be down there again  in the valleys of dust and blood .  he trembled  took a deep breath .  the fighting had been so involving he hadn   t wanted to leave  despite the pain .  immersion had a hypnotic quality .      i know how you feel     she said .     it   s easy to totally identify with them .  i left sheelah when those raboons came close .  pretty scary .         vaddo said they   re derived from earth  too .   plenty of dna overlap .  but they show signs of extensive recent tinkering to make them predators .         why would the ancients want those .         trying to figure out our origins .      to his surprise  she laughed .     not everyone has your same interests .         why  then .         how about using raboons as game  to hunt .  something a little challenging .          hunting .  the empire has always been too far from throwback primitivism to    he had been about to launch into a little lecture on how far humanity had come when he realized that he didn   t believe it anymore .     um .         you   ve always thought of people as cerebral .  no psychohistory could work if it didn   t take into account our animal selves .         our worst sins are all our own  i fear .     he had not expected that his experiences here would shake him so .  this was sobering .      not at all .  genocide occurs in wolves and pans alike .  murder is widespread .  ducks and orangutans rape .  even ants have organized warfare and slave raids .  pans have at least as good a chance of being murdered as do humans  vaddo says .  of all the hallowed human hallmarks  speech  art  technology  and the rest  the one which comes most obviously from animal ancestors is genocide .             you   ve been learning from vaddo .         it was a good way to keep an eye on him .         better to be suspicious than sorry .         of course     she said blandly  giving nothing away .      well  luckily  even if we are superpans  imperial order and communication blurs distinctions between us and them .         so .         that blunts the deep impulse to genocide .      she laughed again  this time rather to his annoyance .     you haven   t understood history very well .  smaller groups still kill each other off with great relish .  in zone sagittarius  during the reign of omar the impaler          i concede  there are small scale tragedies by the dozens .  but on the scale where psychohistory might work  averaging over populations of many thousands of billions          what makes you so sure numbers are any protection .     she asked pointedly .      so far          the empire has been in stasis .         a steady state solution  actually .  dynamic equilibrium .         and if that equilibrium fails .         well .  .  . then i have nothing to say .     she smiled .     how uncharacteristic .         until i have a real  working theory .         one that can allow for widespread genocide  if the empire erodes .      he saw her point then .     you   re saying i really need this    animal nature    part of humans .         i   m afraid so .  i   m trained to allow for it already .      he was puzzled .     how so .         i don   t have your view of humanity .  scheming  plots  sheelah grabbing more meat for her young  ipan wanting to do in biggest  those things happen in the empire .  just better disguised .         so .         consider ex spec vaddo .  he made a comment about your working on a    theory of history    the other evening .         so .         who told him you were .         i don   t think i  ah  you think he   s checking up on us .         he already knows .         the security chief  maybe she told him  after checking on me with the academic potentate .      she graced him with an unreadable smile .     i do love your endless  naive way of seeing the world .      later  he couldn   t decide whether she had meant it as a compliment .        .     vaddo invited him to try a combat sport the station offered  and hari accepted .  it was an enhanced swordplay with levitation through electrostatic lifters .  hari was slow and inept .  using his own body against vaddo   s swift moves made him long for the sureness and grace of ipan .   vaddo always opened with a traditional posture  one foot forward  his prod sword making little circles in the air .  hari poked through vaddo   s defense sometimes  but usually spent all his lifter energy eluding vaddo   s thrusts .  he did not enjoy it nearly as much as vaddo .   he did learn bits and pieces about pans from vaddo and from trolling through the vast station library .  the man seemed a bit uneasy when hari probed the data arrays  as though vaddo somehow owned them and any reader was a thief .  or at least  that was what hari took to be the origin of the unease .   he had never thought about animals very much  though he had grown up among them on helicon .  yet he came to feel that they  too  had to be understood .   catching sight of itself in a mirror  a dog sees the image as another dog .  so did cats  fish  or birds .  after a while they get used to the harmless image  silent and smell free  but they do not see it as themselves .   human children had to be about two years old to do better .   pans took a few days to figure out that they were looking at themselves .  then they preened before it shamelessly  studied their backs  and generally tried to see themselves differently  even putting leaves on their heads like hats and laughing at the result .   so they could do something other animals could not  get outside themselves  and look back .   they plainly lived in a world charged with echoes and reminiscences .  their dominance hierarchy was a frozen record of past coercion .  they remembered termite mounds  trees to drum  useful spots where large water sponge leaves fell  or grain matured .   all this fed into the toy model he had begun building in his notes  a pan psychohistory .  it used their movements  rivalries  hierarchies  patterns of eating and mating and dying  territory  resources  and troop competition for them .  he found a way to factor into his equations the biological baggage of dark behaviors  even the worst  like delight in torture  and easy exterminations of other species for short term gain .   all these the pans had .  just like the empire .     at a dance that evening he watched the crowd with fresh vision .   flirting was practice mating .  he could see it in the sparkle of eyes  the rhythms of the dance .  the warm breeze wafting up from the valley brought smells of dust  rot  life .  an animal restlessness moved in the room .   he quite liked dancing and dors was a lush companion tonight .  yet he could not stop his mind from sifting  analyzing  taking the world before him apart into mechanisms .   the nonverbal template humans used for attract approach strategies apparently descended from a shared mammalian heritage  dors had pointed out .  he thought of that  watching the crowd at the bar .   a woman crosses a crowded room  hips swaying  eyes resting momentarily on a likely man  then coyly looking away just as she apparently notices his regard .  a standard opening move  notice me .   the second is i am harmless .  a hand placed palm up on a table or knee .  a shoulder shrug  derived from an ancient vertebrate reflex  signifying helplessness .  combine that with a tilted head  which displays the vulnerability of the neck .  these commonly appeared when two people drawn to each other have their first conversation  all quite unconsciously .   such moves and gestures are subcortical  emerging far below the neocortex .   did such forces shape the empire more than trade balances  alliances  treaties .   he looked at his own kind and tried to see it through pan eyes .   though human females matured earlier  they did not go on to acquire coarse body hair  bony eye ridges  deep voices  or tough skin .  males did .  and women everywhere strove to stay young looking .  cosmetics makers freely admitted their basic role  we don   t sell products .  we sell hope .   competition for mates was incessant .  male pans sometimes took turns with females in estrus .  they had huge testicles  implying that reproductive advantage had come to those males who produced enough sperm to overwhelm their rivals    contributions .  human males had proportionally smaller testicles .   but humans got their revenge where it mattered .  all known primates were genetically related  though they had separated out as species many millions of years ago .  in dna measured time  pans lay six million years from humans .  of all primates  humans had the largest penises .   he mentioned to dors that only four percent of mammals formed pair bonds  were monogamous .  primates rated a bit higher  but not much .  birds were much better at it .   she sniffed .     don   t let all this biology go to your head .         oh  no  i won   t let it get that far .         you mean it belongs in lower places .         madam  you   ll have to be the judge of that .         ah  you and your single entendre humor .      later that evening  he had ample opportunity to reflect upon the truth that  while it was not always great to be human  it was tremendous fun being a mammal .        .     they spent one last day immersed in their pans  sunning themselves beside a gushing stream .  they had told vaddo to bring the shuttle down the next day  book a wormhole transit .  then they entered the immersion capsule and sank into a last reverie .   until biggest started to mount sheelah .   hari ipan sat up  his head foggy .  sheelah was shrieking at biggest .  she slapped him .   biggest had mounted sheelah before .  dors had bailed out quickly  her mind returning to her body in the capsule .   something was different now .  ipan hurried over and signed to sheelah  who was throwing pebbles at biggest .  what .   she moved her hands rapidly  signing  no go .   she could not bailout .  something was wrong back at the capsule .  he could go back himself  tell them .   hari made the little mental flip that would bail him out .   nothing happened .   he tried again .  sheelah threw dust and pebbles  backing away from biggest .  nothing .   no time to think .  he stepped between sheelah and biggest .   the massive pan frowned .  here was ipan  buddy ipan  getting in the way .  denying him a fern .  biggest seemed to have forgotten the challenge and beating of the day before .   first he tried bellowing  eyes big and white .  then biggest shook his arms  fists balled .   hari made his pan stand still .  it took every calming impulse .  he could muster .   biggest swung his fist like a club .  ipan ducked .  biggest missed .   hari was having trouble controlling ipan  who wanted to flee .  sheets of fear shot up through the pan mind  hot yellows in the blue black depths .   biggest charged forward  slamming ipan back .  hari felt the jolt  a stabbing pain in his chest .  he toppled backward  hit hard .   biggest yowled his triumph .  waved his arms at the sky .   biggest would get on top  he saw .  beat him again .  suddenly he felt a deep  raw hatred .   from that red seethe he felt his grip on ipan tighten .  he was riding both with and within the pan  feeling its raw red fear  overrunning that with an iron rage .  ipan   s own wrath fed back into hari .  the two formed a concert  anger building as if reflected from hard walls .   he might not be the same kind of primate  but he knew ipan .  neither of them was going to get beaten again .  and biggest was not going to get sheelah dors .   he rolled to the side .  biggest hit the ground where he had been .   ipan leaped up and kicked biggest .  hard  in the ribs .  once  twice .  then in the head .   whoops  cries  dust  pebbles  sheelah was still bombarding them both .  ipan shivered with boiling energy and backed away .   biggest shook his dusty head .  then he curled and rolled easily up to his feet  full of muscular grace  face a constricted mask .  the pan   s eyes widened  showing white and red .   ipan yearned to run .  only hari   s rage held him in place .   but it was a static balance of forces .  ipan blinked as biggest shuffled warily forward  the big pan   s caution a tribute to the damage ipan had inflicted .   i need some advantage  hari thought  looking around .   he could call for allies .  hunker paced nervously nearby .   something told hari that would be a losing strategy .  hunker was still a lieutenant to biggest .  sheelah was too small to make a decisive difference .  he looked at the other pans  all chattering anxiously  and decided .  he picked up a rock .   biggest grunted in surprise .  pans didn   t use rocks against each other .  rocks were only for repelling invaders .  he was violating a social code .   biggest yelled  waved to the others  pounded the ground  huffed angrily .  then he charged .   hari threw the rock hard .  it hit biggest in the chest  knocked him down .   biggest came up fast  madder than before .  ipan scurried back  wanting desperately to run .  hari felt control slipping from him  and saw another rock .  suitable size  two paces back .  he let ipan turn to flee  then stopped him at the stone .  ipan didn   t want to hold it .  panic ran through him .   hari poured his rage into the pan  forced the long arms down .  hands grabbed at the stone  fumbled  got it .  sheer anger made ipan turn to face biggest  who was thundering after him .  to hari  ipan   s arm came up in achingly slow motion .  he leaned heavily into the pitch .  the rock smacked biggest in the face .   biggest staggered .  blood ran into his eyes .  ipan caught the iron scent of it  riding on a prickly stench of outrage .   hari made the trembling ipan stoop down .  there were some shaped stones nearby  made by the ferns to trim leaves from branches .  he picked up one with a chipped edge .   biggest shook his head  dizzy .   ipan glanced at the sober  still faces of his troop .  no one had ever used a rock against a troop member  much less biggest .  rocks were for strangers .   a long silence stretched .  the pans stood rooted  biggest grunted and peered in disbelief at the blood that spattered into his upturned hand .   ipan stepped forward and raised the jagged stone  edge held outward .  crude  but a cutting edge .   biggest flared his nostrils and came at ipan .  ipan swept the rock through the air  barely missing biggest   s jaw .   biggest   s eyes widened .  he huffed and puffed  threw dust  howled .  ipan simply stood with the rock and held his ground .  biggest kept up his anger display for a long while  but he did not attack .   the troop watched with intense interest .  sheelah came and stood beside ipan .  it would have been against protocols for a female to take part in male dominance rituals .   her movement signaled that the confrontation was over .  but hunker was having none of that .  he abruptly howled  pounded the ground  and scooted over to ipan   s side .   hari was surprised .  with hunker maybe he could hold the line against biggest .  he was not fool enough to think that this one stand off would put biggest to rest .  there would be other challenges and he would have to fight them .  hunker would be a useful ally .   he realized that he was thinking in the slow  muted logic of ipan himself .  he assumed that the pursuit of pan status markers was a given  the great goal of his life .   this revelation startled him .  he had known that he was diffusing into ipan   s mind  taking control of some functions from the bottom up  seeping through the deeply buried  walnut sized gyrus .  it had not occurred to him that the pan would diffuse into him .  were they now married to each other in an interlocked web that dispersed mind and self .   hunker stood beside him  eyes glaring at the other pans  chest heaving .  ipan felt the same way  madly pinned to the moment .  hari realized that he would have to do something  break this cycle of dominance and submission which ruled ipan at the deep  neurological level .   he turned to sheelah .  get out .  he signed .   no .  no .  her pan face wrinkled with anxiety .   leave .  he waved toward the trees  pointed to her  then him .   she spread her hands in a gesture of helplessness .   it was infuriating .  he had so much to say to her and he had to funnel it through a few hundred signs .  he chippered in a high pitched voice  trying vainly to force the pan lips and palate to do the work of shaping words .   it was no use .  he had tried before  idly  but now he wanted to badly and none of the equipment worked .  it couldn   t .  evolution had shaped brain and vocal chords in parallel .  pans groomed  people talked .   he turned back and realized that he had forgotten entirely about the status setting .  biggest was glowering at him .  hunker stood guard  confused at his new leader   s sudden loss of interest in the confrontation  and to gesture at a mere fern  too .   hari reared up as tall as he could and waved the stone .  this produced the desired effect .  biggest inched back a bit and the rest of the troop edged closer .  hari made ipan stalk forward boldly .  by this time it did not take much effort  for ipan was enjoying this enormously .   biggest retreated .  ferns inched around biggest and approached ipan .   if only i could leave him to the terns    delights  hari thought .   he tried to bailout again .  nothing .  the mechanism wasn   t working back at the excursion station .  and something told him that it wasn   t going to get fixed .   he gave the edged stone to hunker .  the pan seemed surprised  but took it .  hari hoped the symbolism of the gesture would penetrate in some fashion  because he had no time left to spend on pan politics .  hunker hefted the rock and looked at ipan .  then he cried in a rolling  powerful voice  tones rich in joy and triumph .   hari was quite happy to let hunker distract the troop .  he took sheelah by the arm and led her into the trees .  no one followed .   he was relieved .  if another pan had tagged along  it would have confirmed his suspicions .  vaddo might be keeping track .   still  he reminded himself  absence of evidence is not evidence of absence .        .     the humans came swiftly  with clatters and booms .   he and sheelah had been in the trees awhile .  at hari   s urging they had worked their way a few klicks away from the troop .  ipan and sheelah showed rising anxiety at being separated from their troop .  his teeth chattered and his eyes jerked anxiously at every suspicious movement .  this was natural  for isolated pans were far more vulnerable .   the humans landing did not help .   danger  hari signed  cupping an ear to indicate the noise of flyers landing nearby .   sheelah signed  where go .   away .   she shook her head vehemently .  stay here .  they get us .   they would  indeed  but not in the sense she meant .  hari cut her off curtly  shaking his head .  danger .  they had never intended to convey complicated ideas with their signs and now he felt bottled up  unable to tell her his suspicions .   hari made a knife across throat gesture .  sheelah frowned .   he bent down and made ipan take a stick .  he had not been able to make ipan write before  but necessity drove him now .  slowly he made the rough hands scratch out the letters .  in soft loam he wrote want us dead .   sheelah looked dumbfounded .  dors had probably been operating under the assumption that the failure to bailout was a temporary error .  it had lasted too long for that .   the noisy  intrusive landing confirmed his hunch .  no ordinary team would disturb the animals so much .  and nobody would come after them directly .  they would fix the immersion apparatus  where the real problem was .   they keep us here  kill pans  that kills us .  blame on animals .   he had better arguments to back up his case .  the slow accumulation of small details in vaddo   s behavior .  suspicions  at least  about the security officer .  dors    tiktok would block the officer from overriding the locks on their immersion capsules  and from tracing the capsule   s signal to ipan and sheelah .   so they were forced to go into the field .  letting them die in an    accident    while immersed in a pan might just be plausible enough to escape an investigation .   the humans went about their noisy business .  they were enough  though  to make his case .  sheelah   s eyes narrowed  the big brow scowled .   dors the defender took over .  where .  sheelah signed .   he had no sign for so abstract an idea  so he scribbled with the stick  away .  indeed  he had no plan .   i   ll check  she wrote in the dirt .   she set off toward the noise of humans deploying on the valley floor below .  to a pan the din was a dreadful clanking irritation .  hari was not going to let her out of his sight .  she waved him back  but he shook his head and followed .   the bushes gave shelter as they got a view of the landing party below .  a skirmish line was forming up a few hundred meters away .  they were encircling the area where the troop had been .  why .   hari squinted .  pan eyesight was not good for distance .  humans had been hunters once  and one could tell by the eyes alone .   now  nearly everybody needed artificial eye adds by the age of forty .  either civilization was hard on eyes  or maybe humans in prehistory had not lived long enough for eye trouble to rob them of game .  either conclusion was sobering .   the two pans watched the humans calling to one another  and in the middle of them hari saw vaddo .  each man and woman carried a weapon .   beneath his fear he felt something strong  dark .   ipan trembled  watching the humans  a strange awe swelling in his mind .  humans seemed impossibly tall in the shimmering distance  moving with stately  swaying elegance .   hari floated above the surge of emotion  fending off its powerful effects .  the reverence for those distant  tall figures came out of the pan   s dim past .   that surprised him until he thought it over .  after all  animals were reared and taught by adults much smarter and stronger .  most species were like pans  spring loaded by evolution to work in a dominance hierarchy .  awe was adaptive .   when they met lofty humans with overwhelming power  able to mete out punishment and rewards  literally life and death  something like religious fervor arose in them .  fuzzy  but strong .   atop that warm  tropical emotion floated a sense of satisfaction at simply being .  his pan was happy to be a pan  even when seeing a being of clearly superior power and thought .  ironic  hari thought .   his pan had just disproved another supposedly human earmark  their self congratulatory distinction of being the only animal that congratulated itself .   he jerked himself out of his abstractions .  how human  to ruminate even when in mortal danger .   can   t find us electronically  he scratched in the sand .   maybe range short  she wrote .   the first shots made them jerk .   the humans had found their pan troop .  cries of fear mingled with the sharp  harsh barks of blasters .   go .  we go  he signed .   sheelah nodded and they crept quickly away .  ipan trembled .   the pan was deeply afraid .  yet he was also sad  as if reluctant to leave the presence of the revered humans  his steps dragging .        .     they used pan modes of patrolling .   he and dors let their basic levels take over  portions of the brain expert at silent movement  careful of every twig .   once they had left the humans behind  the pans grew even more cautious .  they had few natural enemies  but the faint scent of a single predator changed the feel of the wild .   ipan climbed tall trees and sat for hours surveying the open land ahead before venturing forth .  he weighed the evidence of pungent droppings  faint prints  bent branches .   they angled down the long slope of the valley and stayed in the forest .  hari had only glanced at the big color coded map of the area all guests received and had trouble recalling much of it .   finally he recognized one of the distant  beak shaped peaks .  hari got his bearings .  dors spotted a stream snaking down into the main river and that gave them further help  but still they did not know which way lay the excursion station .  or how far .   that way .  hari signed  pointing over the distant ridge .   no .  that  dors insisted .   far  not .   why .   the worst part of it all was that they could not talk .  he could not say clearly that the technology of immersion worked best at reasonably short range  less than a hundred klicks  say .  and it made sense to keep the subject pans within easy flyer distance .  certainly vaddo and the others had gotten to the troop quickly .   is  he persisted .   not .  she pointed down the valley .  maybe there .   he could only hope dors got the general idea .  their signs were scanty and he began to feel a broad  rising irritation .  pans felt and sensed strongly  but they were so limited .   ipan expressed this by tossing limbs and stones  banging on tree trunks .  it didn   t help much .  the need to speak was like a pressure he could not relieve .  dors felt it  too .  sheelah chippered and grunted in frustration .   beneath his mind he felt the smoldering presence of ipan .  they had never been together this long before and urgency welled up between the two canted systems of mind .  their uneasy marriage was showing greater strains .   sit .  quiet .  she did .  he cupped a hand to his ear .   bad come .   no .  listen  in frustration hari pointed to sheelah herself .  blank incomprehension in the pan   s face .  he scribbled in the dust  learn from pans .  sheelah   s mouth opened and she nodded .   they squatted in the shelter of prickly bushes and listened to the sounds of the forest .  scurryings and murmurs came through strongly as hari relaxed his grip on the pan .  dust hung in slanted cathedral light  pouring down from the forest canopy in rich yellow shafts .  scents purled up from the forest floor  chemical messengers telling ipan of potential foods  soft loam for resting  bark to be chewed .  hari gently lifted ipan   s head to gaze across the valley at the peaks .  .  .  musing .  .  . and felt a faint tremor of resonance .   to ipan the valley came weighted with significance beyond words .  his troop had imbued it with blunt emotions  attached to clefts where a friend fell and died  where the troop found a hoard of fruits  where they met and fought two big cats .  it was an intricate landscape suffused with feeling  the pan mechanism of memory .   hari faintly urged ipan to think beyond the ridge line and felt in response a diffuse anxiety .  he bore in on that kernel  and an image burst into ipan   s mind  fringed in fear .  a rectangular bulk framed against a cool sky .  the excursion station .   there .  he pointed for dors .   ipan had simple  strong  apprehensive memories of the place .  his troop had been taken there  outfitted with the implants which allowed them to be ridden  then deposited back in their territory .   far  dors signed .   we go .   hard .  slow .   no stay here .  they catch .   dors looked as skeptical as a pan could look .  fight .   did she mean fight vaddo here .  or fight once they reached the excursion station .  no here .  there .   dors frowned  but accepted this .  he had no real plan  only the idea that vaddo was ready for pans out here and might not be so prepared for them at the station .  there he and dors might gain the element of surprise .  how  he had no idea .   they studied each other  each trying to catch a glimmer of the other in an alien face .  she stroked his earlobe  dors    calming gesture .  sure enough  it made him tingle .  but he could say so little .  .  .  . the moment crystallized for him the hopelessness of their situation .   vaddo plainly was trying to kill hari and dors through ipan and sheelah .  what would become of their own bodies .  the shock of experiencing death through immersion was known to prove fatal .  their bodies would fail from neurological shock  without ever regaining consciousness .   he saw a tear run down sheelah   s cheek .  she knew how hopeless matters were  too .  he swept her up in his arms and  looking at the distant mountains  was surprised to find tears in his own eyes as well .        .     he had not counted on the river .  men  animals  these problems he had considered .  they ventured down to the surging waters where the forest gave the nearest protection and the stream broadened  making the best place to ford .   but the hearty river that chuckled and frothed down the valley was impossible to swim .   or rather  for ipan to swim .  hari had been coaxing his pan onward  carefully pausing when his muscles shook or when he wet himself from anxiety .  dors was having similar trouble and it slowed them .  a night spent up in high branches soothed both pans  but now at midmoming all the stressful symptoms returned as ipan put one foot into the river .  cool  swift currents .   ipan danced back onto the narrow beach  yelping in dread .   go .  dors sheelah signed .   hari calmed his pan and they tried to get it to attempt swimming .  sheelah displayed only minor anxiety .  hari plumbed the swampy depths of ipan   s memory and found a cluster of distress  centered around a dim remembrance of nearly drowning when a child .  when sheelah helped him  he fidgeted  then bolted from the water again .   go .  sheelah waved long arms upstream and downstream and shook her head angrily .   hari guessed that she had reasonably clear pan memories of the river  which had no easier crossings than this .  he shrugged  lifted his hands palm up .   a big herd of gigantelope grazed nearby and some were crossing the river for better grass beyond .  they tossed their great heads  as if mocking the pans .  the river was not deep  but to ipan it was a wall .  hari  trapped by ipan   s solid fear  seethed but could do nothing .   sheelah paced the shore .  she huffed in frustration and looked at the sky  squinting .  her head snapped around in surprise .  hari followed her gaze .  a flyer was swooping down the valley  coming their way .   ipan beat sheelah to the shelter of trees  but not by much .  luckily the gigantelope herd provided a distraction for the flyer .  they cowered in bushes as the machine hummed overhead in a circular search pattern .  hari had to quell ipan   s mounting apprehension by envisioning scenes of quiet and peace while he and sheelah groomed each other .   the flyer finally went away .  they would have to minimize their exposure now .   they foraged for fruit .  his mind revolved uselessly and a sour depression settled over him .  he was quite neatly caught in a trap  a pawn in imperial politics .  worse  dors was in it  too .  he was no man of action .  nor a pan of action  either  he thought dourly .   as he brought a few overripe bunches of fruit back to their bushes by the river  he heard cracking noises .  he crouched down and worked his way uphill and around the splintering sounds .  sheelah was stripping branches from the trees .  when he approached she waved him on impatiently  a common pan gesture remarkably like a human one .   she had a dozen thick branches lined up on the ground .  she went to a nearby spindly tree and peeled bark from it in long strips .  the noise made ipan uneasy .  predators would be curious at this unusual sound .  he scanned the forest for danger .   sheelah came over to him  slapped him in the face to get his attention .  she wrote with a stick on the ground  raft .   hari felt particularly dense as he pitched in .  of course .  had his pan immersion made him more stupid .  did the effect worsen with time .  even if he got out of this  would he be the same .  many questions  no answers .  he forgot about them and worked .   they lashed branches together with bark  crude but serviceable .  they found two small fallen trees and used them to anchor the edge of the raft .  i  sheelah pointed  and demonstrated pulling the raft .   first  a warm up .  ipan liked sitting on the raft in the bushes .  apparently the pan could not see the purpose of the raft yet .  ipan stretched out on the deck of saplings and gazed up into the trees as they swished in the warm winds .   they carried the awkward plane of branches down to the river after another mutual grooming session .  the sky was filled with birds  but he could see no flyers .   they hurried .  ipan was skeptical about stepping onto the raft when it was halfway into the water  but hari called up memories filled with warm feeling  and this calmed the quick tripping heart he could feel knocking in the pan   s chest .   ipan sat gingerlyon the branches .  sheelah cast off .   she pushed hard  but the river swept them quickly downstream .  alarm spurted in ipan .   hari made ipan close his eyes .  that slowed the breathing  but anxiety skittered across the pan mind like heat lightning forking before a storm .  the raft   s rocking motion actually helped  making ipan concentrate on his queasy stomach .  once his eyes flew open when a floating log smacked into the raft  but the dizzying sight of water all around made him squeeze them tight immediately .   hari wanted to help her  but he knew from the trip hammer beating of ipan   s heart that panic hovered near .  he could not even see how she was doing .  he had to sit blind and feel her shoving the raft along .   she panted noisily  struggling to keep it pointed against the river   s tug .  spray splashed onto him .  ipan jerked  yelped  pawed anxiously with his feet  as if to run .   a sudden lurch .  sheelah   s grunt cut off with a gurgle and he felt the raft spin away on rising currents .  a sickening spin .  .  .   ipan jerked clumsily to his feet .  eyes jumped open .   swirling water  the raft unsteady .  he looked down and the branches were coming apart .  panic consumed him .  hari tried to promote soothing images  but they blew away before winds of fright .   sheelah came paddling after the raft  but it was picking up speed .  hari made ipan gaze at the far shore  but that was all he could do before the pan started yelping and scampering on the raft  trying to find a steady place .   it was no use .  the branches broke free of their bindings and chilly water swept over the deck .  ipan screamed .  he leaped  fell  rolled  jumped up again .   hari gave up any idea of control .  the only hope lay in seizing just the right moment .  the raft split down the middle and his half veered heavily to the left .  ipan started away from the edge and hari fed that  made the pan step farther .  in two bounds he took the pan off the deck and into the water  toward the far shore .   ipan gave way then to pure blind panic .  hari let the legs and arms thrash  but to each he gave a push at the right moment .  he could swim  ipan couldn   t .   the near aimless flailing held ipan   s head out of water most of the time .  he even gained a little headway .  hari kept focused on the convulsive movements  ignoring the cold water  and then sheelah was there .   she grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and shoved him toward shore .  ipan tried to grapple with her  climb up her .  sheelah socked him in the jaw .  he gasped .  she pulled him toward shore .   ipan was stunned .  this gave hari a chance to get the legs moving in a thrusting stroke .  he worked at it  single minded among the rush and gurgle  chest heaving .  .  . and after a seeming eternity  felt pebbles beneath his feet .  ipan scrambled up onto the rocky beach on his own .   he let the pan slap himself and dance to warm up .  sheelah emerged dripping and bedraggled  and ipan swept her up in his thankful arms .        .     walking was work and ipan wasn   t having any .   hari tried to make the pan cover ground  but now they had to ascend difficult gullies  some mossy and rough .  they stumbled  waded  climbed  and sometimes just crawled up the slopes of the valley .  the pans sniffed out animal trails  which helped a bit .   ipan stopped often for food  or just to gaze idly into the distance .  soft thoughts flitted like moths through the foggy mind  buoyant on liquid emotional flows which eddied to their own pulse .  pans were not made for extended projects .   they made slow progress .  night came and they had to climb trees  snagging fruit on the way .   ipan slept  but hari did not .  could not .   their lives were just as much at risk here as the pans     but the slumbering minds he and dors attended had always lived this way .  to the pans  the forest night seeped through as a quiet rain of information  processed as they slept .  their minds keyed vagrant sounds to known nonthreats  leaving slumber intact .   hari did not know the subtle signs of danger and so mistook every rustle and tremor in the branches as danger approaching on soft feet .  sleep came against his will .   in dawn   s first pale glow hari awoke with a snake beside him .  it coiled like a green rope around a descending branch  getting itself into striking position .  it eyed him and hari tensed .   ipan drifted up from his own profound slumber .  he saw the snake  but did not react with a startled jerk  as hari feared he might .   a long moment passed between them and ipan blinked just once .  the snake became utterly motionless and ipan   s heart quickened  but he did not move .  then the snake uncoiled and glided away  and the unspoken transaction was done .  ipan was unlikely prey  this green snake did not taste good  and pans were smart enough to be about other business .   when sheelah awoke they went down to a nearby chuckling stream for a drink  scavenging leaves and a few crunchy insects on the way .  both pans nonchalantly peeled away fat black land leeches which had attached to them in the night .  the thick  engorged worms sickened hari  but ipan pulled them off casually  much the way hari would have retied loosened shoelaces .   luckily  ipan did not eat them .  he drank and hari reflected that the pan felt no need to clean himself .  normally hari vapored twice a day  before breakfast and before dinner  and felt ill at ease if he sweated  a typical meritocrat .   here he wore the shaggy body comfortably .  had his frequent cleansings been a health measure  like the pans    grooming .  or a rarefied  civilized habit .  he dimly remembered that as a boy on helicon he had gone for days in happy  sweaty pleasure and had disliked baths and showers .  somehow ipan returned him to a simpler sense of self  at ease in the grubby world .   his comfort did not last long .  they sighted raboons uphill .   ipan had picked up the scent  but hari did not have access to the part of the pan brain that made scent picture associations .  he had only known that something disturbed ipan  wrinkling the knobby nose .  the sight at short range jolted him .   thick hindquarters  propelling them in brisk steps .  short forelimbs  ending in sharp claws .  their large heads seemed to be mostly teeth .  sharp and white above slit ted  wary eyes .  a thick brown pelt covered them  growing bushy in the heavy tail they used for balance .   days before  from the safety of a high tree  ipan had watched some rip and devour the soft tissues of a gigantelope out on the grasslands .  these came sniffing  working downslope in a skirmish line  five of them .  sheelah and ipan trembled at the sight .  they were downwind of the raboons and so beat a retreat in silence .   there were no tall trees here  just brush and saplings .  hari and sheelah angled away downhill and got some distance  and then saw a clearing ahead .  ipan picked up the faint tang of other pans  wafting from across the clearing .   he waved to her  go .  at the same moment a chorus rose behind them .  the raboons had caught the scent .   their wheezing grunts came echoing through the thick bushes .  downslope there was even less cover  but bigger trees lay beyond .  they could climb those .   ipan and sheelah hurried across the broad tan clearing on all fours  but they were not quick .  snarling raboons burst into the grass behind them .  hari scampered into the trees  and directly into the midst of a pan troop .   there were several dozen  startled and blinking .  he yelled incoherently  wondering how ipan would signal to them .   the nearest large male turned  bared teeth  and shrieked angrily .  the entire pack took up the call  whooping and snatching up sticks and rocks  throwing them at ipan .  a pebble hit him on the chin  a branch on the thigh .  he fled  sheelah already a few steps ahead of him .   the raboons came charging across the clearing .  in their claws they held small  sharp stones .  they looked big and solid  but they slowed at the barrage of screeches and squawks coming from the trees .  ipan and sheelah burst out into the grass of the clearing and the pans came right after them .  the raboons skidded to a halt .   the pans saw the raboons  but they did not stop or even slow .  they still came after ipan and sheelah with murderous glee .   the raboons stood frozen  their claws working uneasily .   hari realized what was happening and picked up a branch as he ran  calling to sheelah .  she saw and copied him .  he ran straight at the raboons  waving the branch .  it was an awkward  twisted old limb  useless  but it looked big .  hari wanted to seem like the advance guard of some bad business .   in the rising cloud of dust and general chaos the raboons saw a large party of enraged pans emerging from the forest .  the   bolted .   squealing  they ran at full stride into the far trees .   ipan and sheelah followed  running with the last of their strength .  by the time ipan reached the first trees  he looked back and the pans had stopped halfway  still screeching their vehemence .   he signed to sheelah  go .  they cut away at a steep angle  heading uphill .        .     ipan needed food and rest  if only to stop his heart from lurching at every minor sound .  sheelah and ipan clutched each other  high in a tree  and crooned and petted .   hari needed time to think .  autoservers were keeping their bodies alive at the station .  dors    tiktok would defend the locks  but how long would a security officer take to get around that .   it would be smart to let them stay out here  in danger  saying to the rest of the staff that the two odd tourists wanted a really long immersion .  let nature take its course .   his thinking triggered jitters in ipan  so he dropped that mode .  better to think abstractly .  there was plenty out here that needed understanding .   he suspected that the ancients .  who planted pans and gigantelope and the rest here had tinkered with the raboons  to see if they could turn a more distant primate relative into something like humans .  a perverse goal  it seemed to hari  but believable .  scientists loved to tinker .   they had gotten as far as pack hunting  but raboons had no tools beyond crudely edged stones  occasionally used to cut meat once they had brought it down .   in another few million years  under evolution   s grind  they might be as smart as pans .  who would go extinct then .   at the moment he didn   t much care .  he had felt real rage when the pans  his own kind .   had turned against them  even when the raboons came within view .  why .   he worried at the issue  sure there was something here he had to understand .  psychohistory had to deal with such basic  fundamental impulses .  the pans    reaction had been uncomfortably close to myriad incidents in human history .   hate the stranger .   he had to fathom that murky truth .   pans moved in small groups  disliking outsiders  breeding mostly within their modest circle of a few dozen .  this meant any genetic trait that emerged could pass swiftly into all the members  through inbreeding .  if it helped the band survive  the rough rub of chance would select for that band   s survival .  fair enough .   but the trait had to be undiluted .  a troop of especially good rock throwers would get swallowed up if they joined a company of several hundred .  contact would make them breed outside the original small clan .  outbreeding  their genetic heritage would get watered down .   striking a balance between the accidents of genetics in small groups  and the stability of large groups  that was the trick .  some lucky troop might have fortunate genes  conferring traits that fit the next challenge handed out by the ever altering world .  they would do well .  but if those genes never passed to many pans  what did it matter .   with some small amount of outbreeding  that trait got spread into other bands .  down through the strainer of time  others picked up the trait .  it spread .   this meant it was actually helpful to develop smoldering animosity to outsiders  an immediate sense of their wrongness .  don   t breed with them .   so small bands held fast to their eccentric traits  and some prospered .  those lived on  most perished .  evolutionary jumps happened faster in small  semiisolated bands which outbred slightly .  they kept their genetic assets in one small basket  the troop .  only occasionally did they mate with another troop often  through rape .   the price was steep  a strong preference for their own tiny lot .   they hated crowds  strangers  noise .  bands of less than ten were too vulnerable to disease or predators  a few losses and the group failed .  too many  and they lost the concentration of close breeding .  they were intensely loyal to their group  easily identifying each other in the dark by smell  even at great distances .  because they had many common genes  altruistic actions were common .   they even honored heroism  for if the hero died  his shared genes were still passed on through his relatives .   even if strangers could pass the tests of difference in appearances  manner  smell  grooming  even then  culture could amplify the effects .  newcomers with different language or habits and posture would seem repulsive .  anything that served to distinguish a band would help keep hatreds high .   each small genetic ensemble would then be driven by natural selection to stress the noninherited differences  even arbitrary ones  dimly connected to survival fitness .  .  . and so they could evolve culture .  as humans had .   diversity in their tribal intricacies avoided genetic watering down .  they heeded the ancient call of aloof  wary tribalism .   hari ipan shifted uneasily .  midway through his thinking  the word they had come in hari   s thinking to mean humans as well as pans .  the description fit both .   that was the key .  humans fit into the gigantic empire despite their innate tribalism  their panlike heritage .  it was a miracle .   but even miracles called out for explanation .  pans could be useful models for the gentry and the vast citizenry  the two classes encouraged to breed .   yet how could the empire possibly have kept itself stable  using such crude creatures as humans .   hari had never seen the issue before in such glaring  and humbling  light .   and he had no answer .        .     they moved on in spite of the blunt  deep unease of their pans .   ipan smelled something that sent his eyes darting left and right .  with the full tool kit of soothing thoughts and the subtle tricks he had learned  hari kept him going .   sheelah was having more trouble .  the female pan did not like laboring up the long  steep gullies that approached the ridge line .  gnarled bushes blocked their way and it took time to work around them .  fruit was harder to find at these altitudes .   ipan   s shoulders and arms ached constantly .  pans walked on all fours because their immensely strong arms carried a punishing weight penalty .  to navigate both trees and ground meant you could optimize neither .  sheelah and ipan groaned and whined at the soreness that never left feet  legs  wrists  and arms .  pans would never be far ranging explorers .   together they let their pans pause often to crumble leaves and soak up water from tree holes  a routine  simple tool use .  they kept sniffing the air  apprehensive .   the smell that disturbed both pans got stronger  darker .   sheelah went ahead and was the first over the ridge line .  far below in the valley they could make out the rectangular rigidities of the excursion station .  a flyer lifted from the roof and whispered away down the valley  no danger to them .   he recalled what seemed a century ago  sitting on the verandah there with drinks in hand and dors saying  if you stayed on trantor you might be dead .  also  if you didn   t stay on trantor .  .  .   they started down the steep slope .  their pans    eyes jerked at every unexpected movement .  a chilly breeze stirred the few low bushes and twisted trees .  some had a feathered look  burnt and shattered by lightning .  air masses driven up from the valleys fought along here  the brute clash of pressures .  this rocky ridge was far from the comfortable province of pans .  they hurried .   ahead  sheelah stopped .   without a sound  five raboons rose from concealment  forming a neat half circle around them .   hari could not tell if it was the same pack as before .  if so  they were quite considerable pack hunters  able to hold memory and purpose over time .  they had waited ahead  where there were no trees to climb .   the raboons were eerily quiet as they strode forward  their claws clicking softly .   he called to sheelah and made some utterly fake ferocious noises as he moved  arms high in the air  fists shaking  showing a big profile .  he let ipan take over while he thought .   a raboon band could certainly take two isolated pans .  to survive this they had to surprise the raboons  frighten them .   he looked around .  throwing rocks wasn   t going to do the trick here .  with only a vague notion of what he was doing  he shuffled left  toward a tree that had been splintered by lightning .   sheelah saw his move and got there first  striding energetically .  ipan picked up two stones and flung them at the nearest raboon .  one struck on the flank but did no real harm .   the raboons began to trot  circling .  they called to each other in wheezing grunts .   sheelah leaped on a dried out shard of the tree .  it snapped .  she snatched it up and hari saw her point .  it was as tall as she was and she cradled it .   the largest raboon grunted and they all looked at each other .   the raboons charged .   the nearest one came at sheelah .  she caught it on the shoulder with the blunt point and it squealed .   hari grabbed a stalk of the shattered tree trunk .  he could not wrench it free .  another squeal from behind him and sheelah was gibbering in a high  frightened voice .   it was best to let the pans release tension vocally  but he could feel the fear and desperation in the tones and knew it came from dors  too .   he carefully selected a smaller shard of the tree .  with both hands he twisted it free  using his weight and big shoulder muscles  cracking it so that it came away with a point .   lances .  that was the only way to stay away from the raboon claws .  pans never used such advanced weapons .  evolution hadn   t gotten around to that lesson yet .   the raboons were all around them now .  he and sheelah stood back to back .  he barely got his feet placed when he had to take the rush of a big  swarthy raboon .   the raboons had not gotten the idea of the lance yet .  it slammed into the point  jerked back .  a fearsome bellow .  ipan wet himself with fear  but something in hari kept him in control .   the raboon backed off  whimpering .  it turned to run .  in midstride it stopped .  for a long  suspended moment the raboon hesitated  then turned back toward hari .   it trotted forward with new confidence .  the other raboons watched .  it went to the same tree hari had used and  with a single heave  broke off a long  slender spike of wood .  then it came toward hari  stopped  and with one claw held the stick forward .  with a toss of its big head it looked at him and half turned  putting one foot forward .   with a shock hari recognized the swordplay position .   vaddo had used it .  vaddo was riding this raboon .   it made perfect sense .  this way the pans    deaths would be quite natural .  vaddo could say that he was developing raboon riding as a new commercial application of the same hardware that worked for pan riding .   vaddo came forward a careful step at a time  holding the long lance between two claws now .  he made the end move in a circle .  movement was jerky  claws were crude  compared with pan hands .  but the raboon was stronger .   it came at him with a quick feint  then a thrust .  hari barely managed to dodge sideways while he brushed the lance aside with his stick .  vaddo recovered quickly and came from hari   s left .  jab  feint  jab  feint .  hari caught each with a swoop of his stick .   their wooden swords smacked against each other and hari hoped his didn   t snap .  vaddo had good control of his raboon .  it did not try to flee as it had before .   hari was kept busy slapping aside vaddo   s thrusts .  he had to have some other advantage  or the superior strength of the raboon would eventually tell .  hari circled  drawing vaddo away from sheelah .  the other raboons were keeping her trapped  but not attacking .  all attention riveted on the two figures as they thrust and parried .   hari drew vaddo toward an outcropping .  the raboon was having trouble holding its lance straight and had to keep looking down at its claws to get them right .  this meant it paid less attention to where its two hooves found their footing .  hari slapped and jabbed and kept moving  making the raboon step sideways .  it put a big hoof down among some angular stones  teetered  then recovered .   hari moved left .  it stepped again and its hoof turned and it stumbled .  hari was on it in an instant .  he thrust forward as the raboon looked down  feet scrambling for purchase .  hari caught the raboon full with his point .   he pushed hard .  the other raboons let out a moaning sound .   snorting in rage  the raboon tried to get off the point .  hari made ipan step forward and thrust the tip farther into the raboon .  the thing wailed hoarsely .  ipan plunged again .  blood spurted from it  spattering the dust .  its knees buckled and it sprawled .   hari shot a glance over his shoulder .  the others had surged into action .  sheelah was holding off three  screeching at them so loudly it unnerved even him .  she had already wounded one .  blood dripped down its brown coat .   but the others did not charge .  they circled and growled and stamped their feet but came no closer .  they were confused .  learning  too .  he could see the quick  bright eyes studying the situation  this fresh move in the perpetual war .   sheelah stepped out and poked the nearest raboon .  it launched itself at her in a snarling fit and she stuck it again  deeper .  it yelped and tumed  and ran .   that did it for the others .  they all trotted off  leaving their fellow bleating on the ground .  its dazed eyes watched its blood trickle out .  its eyes flickered and vaddo was gone .  the animal slumped .   with deliberation hari picked up a rock and bashed in the skull .  it was messy work  and he sat back inside ipan and let the dark  smoldering pan anger come out .   he bent over and studied the raboon brain .  a fine silvery webbing capped the rubbery  convoluted ball .  immersion circuitry .   he turned away from the sight and only then saw that sheelah was hurt .        .     the station crowned a rugged hill .  steep gullies gave the hillside the look of a weary  lined face .  wiry bushes thronged the lower reaches .   ipan puffed as he worked his way through the raw land cut by erosion .  in pan vision the night was eerie  a shimmering vista of pale greens and blue tinged shadows .  the hill was a nuance in the greater slope of a grand mountain  but pan vision could not make out the distant features .  pans lived in a close  immediate world .   ahead he could see clearly the glowing blank wall ringing the station .  it was massive  five meters tall .  and  he remembered from his tourist tour of the place  rimmed with broken glass .   behind him came gasps as sheelah labored up the slope .  the wound in her side made her gait stiff  face rigid .  she refused to hide below .  they were both near exhaustion and their pans were balking  despite two stops for fruit and grubs and rest .   through their feeble sign vocabulary  their facial grimacing  and writing in the dust  they had    discussed    the possibilities .  two pans were vulnerable out here .  they could not expect to be as lucky as with the raboons  not tired and in strange territory .   the best time to approach the station was at night .  whoever had engineered this would not wait forever .  they had hidden from flyers twice more since morning .  resting through the next day was an inviting option  but hari felt a foreboding press him onward .   he angled up the hillside  watching for electronic trip wires .  of such technical matters he knew nothing .  he would have to keep a lookout for the obvious and hope that the station was not wired for thinking trespassers .   pan vision was sharp and clear in dim light for nearby objects  but he could find nothing .   he chose a spot by the wall shadowed by trees .  sheelah panted in shallow gasps as she approached .  looking up  the wall seemed immense .  impossible .  .  .   slowly he surveyed the land around them .  no sign of any movement .  the place smelled peculiar to ipan  somehow wrong .  maybe animals stayed away from the alien compound .  good  that would make security inside less alert .   the wall was polished concrete .  a thick lip jutted out at the top  making climbing it harder .   sheelah gestured to where trees grew near the wall .  stumps nearer showed that the builders had thought about animals leaping across from branches  but some were tall enough and had branches within a few meters of the top .   could a pan make the distance .  not likely  especially when tired .  sheelah pointed to him and back to her  then held her hands out and made a swinging motion .  could they swing across the distance .   he studied her face .  the designer would not anticipate two pans cooperating that way .  he squinted up at the top .  too high to climb  even if sheelah stood on his shoulders .   yes  he signed .   a few moments later  her hands holding his feet  about to let go of his branch  he had second thoughts .   ipan didn   t mind this bit of calisthenics  and in fact was happy to be back in a tree .  but hari   s human judgment still kept shouting that he could not possibly do it .  natural pan talent conflicted with human caution .   luckily  he did not have much time to indulge in self doubt .  sheelah yanked him off the branch .  he fell  held only by her hands .   she had wrapped her feet securely around a thick branch and now began to oscillate him like a weight on a string .  she swung him back and forth  increasing the amplitude .  back  forth  up  down  centrifugal pressure in his head .  to ipan it was unremarkable .  to hari it was a wheeling world of heart stopping whirls .   small branches brushed him and he worried about noise and then forgot about that because his head was coming up level with the top of the wall .   the concrete lip was rounded off on the inside  so no hook could find a grip .   he swung back down  head plunging toward the ground .  then up into the lower branches  twigs slapping his face .   on the next swing he was higher .  all along the top of the wall thick glass glinted .  very professional .   he barely had time to realize all this when she let him go .  .   he arced up  hands stretched out  and barely caught the lip .  if it had not protectively protruded out  he would have missed .   he let his body slam against the side .  his feet scrabbled for purchase against the sheer face .  a few toes got hold .  he heaved up  muscles bunching  and over .  never before had he appreciated how much stronger a pan could be .  no man could have made it here .   he scrambled up  cutting his arm and haunch on glass .  it was a delicate business  getting to his feet and finding a place to stand .   a surge of triumph .  he waved to sheelah  invisible in the tree .   from here on it was up to him .  he realized suddenly that they could have fashioned some sort of rope  tying together vines .  then he could lift her up here .  good idea  too late .   no point in delaying .  the compound was partly visible through the trees  a few lights burning .  utterly silent .  they had waited until the night was about half over  he had nothing but ipan   s gut feelings to tell him when .   he looked down .  just beyond his toes razor wire gleamed  set into the concrete .  carefully he stepped between the shiny lines .  there was room among the sharp glass teeth to stand .  a tree blocked his vision and he could see little below him in the dim glow from the station .  at least that meant they couldn   t see him  either .   should he jump .  too high .  the tree that hid him was close  but he could not see into it .  he stood and thought  but nothing came to him .  meanwhile sheelah was behind him  alone  and he hated leaving her where dangers waited that he did not even know .   he was thinking like a man and forgetting that he had the capability of a pan .   go .  he leaped .  twigs snapped and he plunged heavily in shadows .  branches stabbed his face .  he saw a dark shape to his right and so curled his legs  rotated  hands out  and snagged a branch .  his hands closed easily around it and he realized it was too thin  too thin  it snapped .  the crack came like a thunderbolt to his ears .  he fell  letting go of the branch .  his back hit something hard and he rolled  grappling for a hold .  his fingers closed around a thick branch and he swung from it .  finally he let out a gasp .   leaves rustled  branches swayed .  nothing more .   he was halfway up a tree .  aches sprouted in his joints  a galaxy of small pains .   hari relaxed and let ipan master the descent .  he had made far too much noise falling in the tree  but there was no sign of any movement across the broad lawns between him and the big  luminous station .   he thought of dors and wished there were some way he could let her know he was inside now .  thinking of her  he measured with his eye the distances from nearby trees  memorizing the pattern so that he could find the way back at a dead run if he had to .   now what .  he didn   t have a plan .   hari gently urged ipan  who was nervous and tired  barely controllable  into a triangular pattern of bushes .  ipan   s mind was like a stormy sky split by skittering lightning .  not thoughts precisely  more like knots of emotion  forming and flashing around crisp kernels of anxiety .  patiently hari summoned up soothing images  getting ipan   s breathing slowed  and he almost missed the whispery sound .   nails scrabbling on a stone walkway .  something running fast .   they came around the triangle peak of bushes .  bunched muscles  sleek skin  stubby legs eating up the remaining distance .  they were well trained to seek and kill soundlessly  without warning .   to ipan the monsters were alien  terrifying .  ipan stepped back in panic before the two onrushing bullets of muscle and bone .  black gums peeled back from white teeth  bared beneath mad eyes .   then hari felt something shift in ipan .  ancient  instinctive responses stopped his retreat  tensed the body .  no time to flee  so fight .   ipan set himself  balanced .  the two might go for his arms so he drew them back  crouching to bring his face down .   ipan had dealt with four legged pack hunters before  somewhere far back in ancestral memory  and knew innately that they lined up on a victim   s outstretched limb  would go for the throat .  the canines wanted to bowl him over  slash open the jugular  rip and shred in the vital seconds of surprise .   they gathered themselves  bundles of swift sinew  running nearly shoulder to shoulder  big heads up  and leaped .   in air  they were committed  ipan knew .  and open .  ipan brought both hands up to grasp the canines    forelegs .   he threw himself backward  holding the legs tight  his hands barely beneath the jaws .  the wirehounds    own momentum carried them over his head as he rolled backward .   ipan rolled onto his back  yanking hard .  the sudden snap slammed the canines forward .  they could not get their heads around and down  to close on his hand .   the leap  the catch  the quick pivot and swing  the heave  all combined in a centrifugal whirl that slung the wirehounds over ipan as he himself went down  rolling .  he felt the canines    legs snap and let go .  they sailed over him with pained yelps .   ipan rolled over completely  head tucked in  and came off his shoulders with a bound .  he heard a solid thud  clacks as jaws snapped shut .  a thump as the canines hit the grass  broken legs unable to cushion them .   he scrambled after them  his breath whistling .  they were trying to get up  turning on snapped legs to confront their quarry .  still no barks  only faint whimpers of pain  sullen growls .  one swore vehemently and quite obscenely .  the other chanted     baaas   ard .  .  . baaas   ard .  .  .      animals turning in their vast  sorrowful night .   he jumped high and came down on both .  his feet drove their necks into the ground and he felt bone give way .  before he stepped back to look  he knew they were gone .   ipan   s blood surged with joy .  hari had never felt this tingling thrill  not even in the first immersion  when ipan had killed a stranger .  victory over alien things with teeth and claws that come at you out of the night was a profound  inflaming pleasure .   hari had done nothing .  the victory was wholly ipan   s .   for a long moment hari basked in it in the cool night air  felt the tremors of ecstasy .   slowly  reason returned .  there were other wirehounds .  ipan had caught these just right .  such luck did not strike twice .   the wirehounds were easy to see on the lawn .  would attract attention .   ipan did not like touching them .  their bowels had emptied and the smell cut the air .  they left a smear on the grass as he dragged them into the bushes .   time  time .  someone would miss the canines  come to see .   ipan was still pumped up from his victory .  hari used that to get him trotting across the broad lawn  taking advantage of shadows .  energy popped in ipan   s veins .  hari knew it was a mere momentary glandular joy  overlaying a deep fatigue .  when it faded  ipan would become dazed  hard to govern .   every time he stopped he looked back and memorized landmarks .  he might have to return this way on the run .   it was late and most of the station was dark .  in the technical area  though  a cluster of windows blossomed with what ipan saw as impossibly rich  strange  superheated light .   he loped over to them and flattened himself against the wall .  it helped that ipan was fascinated by this strange citadel of the godlike humans .  out of his own curiosity he peeked in a window .  under enamel light a big assembly room sprawled  one that hari recognized .  there  centuries ago  he had formed up with the other brightly dressed tourists to go out on a trek .   hari let the pan   s curiosity propel him around to the side  where he knew a door led into a long corridor .  the door opened freely  to hari   s surprise .  ipan strolled down the slick tiles of the hallway  quizzically studying the phosphor paint designs on the ceiling and walls  which emitted a soothing ivory glow .   an office doorway was open .  hari made ipan squat and bob his head around the edge .  nobody there .  it was a sumptuous den with shelves soaring into a vaulted ceiling .  hari remembered sitting there discussing the immersion process .  that meant the immersion vessels were just a few doors away down    the squeak of shoes on tiles made him turn .   ex spec vaddo was behind him  leveling a weapon .   in the cool light the man   s face looked odd to ipan   s eyes  mysteriously bony .  long  thin  the expression hard to read .  .  .   hari felt the rush of reverence in ipan and let it carry the pan forward  chippering softly .  ipan felt awe  not fear .   vaddo tensed up  waving the snout of his ugly weapon .  a metallic click .  ipan brought his hands up in a ritual pan greeting and vaddo shot him .   the impact spun ipan around .  he went down  sprawling .   vaddo   s mouth curled in derision .     smart prof  huh .  didn   t figure the alarm on the door  huh .      the pain from ipan   s side was sharp  startling .  hari rode the hurt and gathering anger in ipan  helping it build .  ipan felt his side and his hand came away sticky  smelling like warm iron in the pan   s nostrils .   vaddo circled around  weapon weaving .     you killed me  you weak little dope .  ruined a good experimental animal .  now i got to figure what to do with you .      hari threw his own anger atop ipan   s seething rage .  he felt the big muscles in the shoulders bunch .  the pain in the side jabbed suddenly .  ipan groaned and rolled on the floor  pressing one hand to the wound .   hari kept the head down so that ipan could not see the blood that was running down now across the legs .  energy was running out of the pan body .  a seeping weakness moved up the body .   he pricked his ears at the shuffling of vaddo   s feet .  another agonized roll  this time bringing the legs up in a curl .      guess there   s really only one solution      hari heard the metallic click .   now  yes .  he let his anger spill .   ipan pressed up with his forearms and got his feet under him .  no time to get all the way up .  ipan sprang at vaddo  keeping low .   a tinny shot whisked by his head .  then he hit vaddo in the hip and slammed the man against the wall .  the man   s scent was sour  salty .   hari lost all control .  ipan bounced vaddo off the wall and instantly slammed his arms into the man with full force .   vaddo tried to deflect the impact .  ipan brushed the puny human arms aside .  vaddo   s pathetic attempts at defense were like spiderwebs brushed away .   he butted vaddo and pounded his massive shoulders into the man   s chest .  the weapon clattered on the tiles .   ipan slammed himself into the man   s body again and again .   strength  power  joy .   bones snapped .  vaddo   s head snapped back  smacked the wall  and he went limp .   ipan stepped back and vaddo sagged to the tiles .  joy .   blue white flies buzzed at the rim of his vision .   must move .  that was all hari could get through the curtain of emotions that shrouded the pan mind .   the corridor lurched .  hari got ipan to walk in a sideways teeter .   down the corridor  painful steps .  two doors  three .  here .  locked .  next door .  world moving slower somehow .   the door snicked open .  an antechamber that he recognized .  ipan blundered into a chair and almost fell .   hari made the lungs work hard .  the gasping cleared his vision of the dark edges that had crept in  but the blue white flies were still there  fluttering impatiently  and thicker .   he tried the far door .  locked .  hari summoned what he could from ipan .  strength  power  joy .   ipan slammed his shoulder into the solid door .  it held .  again .  and again  sharp pain  and it popped open .   right  this was it .  the immersion bay .  ipan staggered into the array of vessels .  the walk down the line  between banks of control panels  took an eternity .  hari concentrated on each step  placing each foot .  ipan   s field of view bobbed as the head seemed to slip around on liquid shoulders .   here .  his own vessel .   dors    tiktok was ready for him .  it had seen him coming and latched itself to the board  covering the vital controls .   ipan bent to the tiktok   s punch panel .  he jabbed at the keys  remembering the access code .   ipan   s fingers were too broad .  they could not hit a single key at a time .   the room of bleached light was getting fuzzy .  he made ipan try the code again  but the stubby fingers mashed several keys at once .   the blue white flies flapped at the edges of his vision .  ipan   s hands whacked in frustration at the punch pad .   think .  hari looked around .  ipan wasn   t going to last much longer .  a desk nearby had a writing slate and pen .   leave a note .  hope the right people find it .  .  .   he made ipan stagger to the desk  grasp the pen .  an idea flickered as he tried to write  i need .  .  .   he turned and tottered back to the capsule .   concentrate .   gripping the pen  he punched down with the butt .  it struck a key cleanly .  the blue flies flickered in his vision .   the access code was hard to remember now .  he worked on it one number at a time .  stab  poke  jab  and it was done .  a light winked from red to green .   he fumbled with the latches .  popped it open .   there lay hari seldon  peaceful  eyes closed .   emergency controls  yes .  he knew them from the briefing .   he searched the polished steel surface and found the panel on the side .  ipan stared woozily at the meaningless lettering .   hari himself had trouble reading .  the letters jumped and fused together .   he found several buttons and servo controls .  ipan   s hands were worse now .  it took three stabs with the pen to get the reviving program activated .  lights cycled from green to amber .   ipan abruptly sat down on the cool floor .  the blue white flies were buzzing all around his head and now they wanted to bite him .  he sucked in the cool dry air  but there was no substance in it  no help .  .  .   then  without any transition  he was looking at the ceiling .  on his back .  the lamps up there were getting dark  fading .  then they went out .        .     hari   s eyes snapped open .   the recovery program was still sending electrostims through his muscles .  he let them jump and tingle and ache while he thought .  he felt fine .  not even hungry  as he usually did after an immersion .  how long had he been in the wilderness .  at least five days .   he sat up .  there was no one in the vessel room .  evidently vaddo had gotten some silent alarm but had not alerted anyone else .  that pointed  again  to a tight little conspiracy .   he got out shakily .  to get free he had to detach some feeders and probes  but they seemed simple enough .   ipan .  the big body filled the walkway .  he knelt and felt for a pulse .  rickety .   but first  dors .  her vessel was next to his and he started the revival .  she looked well .   vaddo must have put some transmission block on the system  so that none of the staff could tell by looking at the panel that anything was wrong .  a simple cover story  a couple who wanted a really long immersion .  vaddo had warned them  but no  they wanted it  so .  .  . a perfectly plausible story .   dors    eyes fluttered .  he kissed her .  she gasped .   he made a pan sign  quiet  and went back to ipan .   blood was flowing steadily .  hari was surprised to find that he could not pick up the rich  pungent elements in the pan   s blood from smell alone .  a human missed so much .   he took off his shirt and made a crude tourniquet .  at least ipan   s breathing was regular .  dors was ready to get out by then  and he helped her disconnect .      i was hiding in a tree and then  poof .     she said .     what a relief .  how did you          let   s get moving     he said .   as they left the room  she said     who can we trust .  whoever did this      she stopped when she saw vaddo .     oh .      somehow her expression made him laugh .  she was very rarely surprised .      you did this .         ipan .         i never would have believed a pan could  could .  .  .         i doubt anyone   s been immersed this long .  not under such stress  anyway .  it all just  well  it came out .      he picked up vaddo   s weapon and studied the mechanism .  a standard pistol  silenced .  vaddo had not wanted to awaken the rest of the station .  that was promising .  there should be people here who would spring to their aid .  he started toward the building where the station personnel lived .      wait  what about vaddo .         i   m going to wake up a doctor .      they did  but hari took him into the vessel room first  to work on ipan .  some patchwork and injections and the doctor said ipan would be all right .  only then did he show the man vaddo   s body .   the doctor got angry about that  but hari had a gun .  all he had to do was point it .  he didn   t say anything  just gestured with the gun .   he did not feel like talking and wondered if he ever would again .  when you couldn   t talk you concentrated more  entered into things .  immersed .   and in any case  vaddo had been dead for some time .   ipan had done a good job .  the doctor shook his head at the severe damage .   alarms were ringing .  he got an instant headache .  the security officer showed up .  he could see from her reaction that she had not been in on the plot .  can   t connect it to the academic potentate  then  he thought abstractly .   but how much did that prove .  imperial politics were subtle .  .  .  . dors looked at him oddly the whole time .  he did not understand why  until he realized that he had not even thought about helping vaddo first .  ipan was himself  in a sense he knew deeply but could not explain .   but he understood immediately when dors wanted to go to the station wall and call to sheelah .  they brought her  too  in from the far wild darkness .        part      ancient fogs       galactic prehistory   .  .  . the destruction of all earlier records during the expansion of humanity through the galaxy  with the attendant eras of warfare  leaves in shadow the entire problem of human origins .   the enormous changes wrought on so many worlds also erased any evidence for much older  alien civilizations .  these societies may have existed  though there is no firm evidence for them .  some early historians believed that at least one type of remnant might have survived in the galaxy  the electromagnetic records .  these would have to be lodged in plasma streams or the coronal loops of stars  and thus lie beyond the detection of expansionist technology .  even modem studies have found no such sentient structures .  however  the virulent radiation levels at the galactic core  where energy densities might promise an hospitable abode for magnetically based forms  make such investigations difficult and ambiguous .  another theory holds that cultures might have    written    themselves into pre empire computer codes  and thus now reside undetected in some banks of ancient data .  such speculations met with no proof and were discounted .  thus the entire problem of why the galaxy was empty of advanced life when humanity ventured into it has no resolution .  .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      .     voltaire scowled  vexed .   had she in fact yielded to him  given herself up .  or was this a particularly fine simulation .  true joan  art this thou .   certainly this fit one of his favorites  a romping play in prickly dry hay  up in the topmost loft of a big old barn  on a hot august day in long lost bordeaux .   twit wheee called a bird .  insects chirped  warm breezes blew woody scents .  her hair trailed over him as she mounted .  he felt her adroit twists  delivered with an erotic precision that made him tremble with the need for release .   but .  .  .   the instant he doubted  it all contracted  dwindled  fell away into blackness .  this was merely an exotic onanism  a self love delusion requiring his commitment to its truth .  contrived well  but fake .   so when he felt himself picked up in a giant feminine hand  soft palm cradling him aloft into sunny air  he wondered if this were real  too .  a hot breeze brushed him as she exhaled .   joan towered fifty times his height  murmuring to him .  fleshy huge lips kissed his whole body in one lingering moment  her tongue licking him like a colossus savoring a lollipop .      i suppose i   ve not had my irony programs omitted .     he asked .   the giant joan shriveled .      too easy     he said .     all i need do is say something a bit jarring       this time the hand propelled him aloft with crushing acceleration .     you   ve still got your precious irony .  and this is me .      he sniffed .     so large .  you   ve made yourself a leviathan .         too heavy .         i   ve always liked .  .  . pig irony .      he gave a disdainful sniff .  she dropped him .  he plunged toward a moat of boiling lava  which had suddenly appeared below .      sorry     he said quietly .  just enough to get her to stop  not enough to lose every shred of dignity .      you should be .      the lava pit evaporated  congealing into mud .  he landed on solid ground and she stood before him  standard size .  demure  fresh .  around her clung air scrubbed by a spring rainstorm just past .      we can invade each others    perceptual spaces at will .  marvelous .  .  .     he stopped  considered .     in a way .         in purgatory  all is meaningless .  we dream while we await truth .     she abruptly sneezed  then coughed .  blinking  she reassembled her lofty  ladylike self .      ummm .  i would appreciate something concretely .  .  . ah .  .  . concrete .      he stepped off the porch of an elaborate provencal country house .  the fields beyond glowed with lurid light .  the foreground was accurate  but done in rather obvious brush strokes .   clearly they were inhabiting a work of art .  even the scents of apple trees and horse manure had a stilted quality .  a frozen moment  cycled endlessly for as long as they needed a backdrop .  inexpensive  even .  astounding what his subconscious  let slip a bit  could conjure up .   what was to stop him  them .   from playing caligula .  slaughtering digital millions .  torturing virtual slaves .  nothing .   that was the problem  no constraints .  how could anyone persist  given infinite temptation .      faith .  only faith can guide  can compel .     joan took his hand  pleading with untouched ardor .      but our reality is in fact entire illusion .          the lord must be somewhere     she said plainly .     he is real .         you do not quite follow  my dear .     he struck an instructive pose .     ontogenesis algorithms can generate new people  drawn from ancient fields  or else just cooked up for the moment .          i know true people when i see them .  let them speak for a moment .         you would look for wit .  we have some subroutines here  yes  madam .  character .  a mere set of verbal posture profiles .  sincerity .  we can fake that .      voltaire knew  from viewing his own cerebral innards  that something termed a    reality editor    offered ready made conversation from the mouth of apparently    rear    persons  who had not existed seconds before .  assemblages of traits and verbal nuances stood ever ready to trade aphorisms and sallies with him .   all these he had picked up in his endless foraging of the mesh  its myriad trantorian sites opening to his touch .  he had extracted and shaped these    customized    amusements .  quick and zesty and all  ultimately  hollow .      i realize you have greater capacities     joan allowed .  she hoisted her sword and swung it at empty air .     allow  sir  that i can still control my senses .  i know some minions of these parts are true and real  as authentic as animals were in our time on earth .         you believe that you knew the inner states of horses .         of course .  i rode many into battle  felt their fear through my calves .         i see .     he swept his lace sleeves through the air in a parody of her sword swinging .     now  bring you .   judgment to bear upon a dog which has lost its master .  the beast  call him phydeaux  has sought its master on every road with sorrowful cries and enters the house agitated  uneasy  goes up and down the stairs  from room to room  and at last finds in the study the master it loves  and shows him its joy by its cries of delight  by its leaps .  it must have feeling  longings  ideas .         surely .      voltaire then produced the dog  plaintive and beautiful in its flop eared digital sorrow .  to boot  he added the house  complete with furniture .  as the poor dog   s baying died away  he said     my demonstration  madam .         tricks .     mouth twisted angrily  she said no more .      you must allow that mathematicians are like  frenchmen  whatever you say to them  they translate into their own language  and forthwith  it is something entirely different .         i am waiting for my lord .  or  as one devoted to large concepts  sir  for meaning .         sit and ponder  madam .     he materialized a comfy provencal kitchen  tables  the fetching scent of coffee .  they sat .  inscribed on the coffee pot was his motto from a lost past     noir comme le diable  chaud comme l   enfer  pur comme un ange   doux comme l   amour .     black as the devil   hot as hell   pure as an angel   sweet as love .        my  it tastes so good     joan said .      i have mastered multiple site access .     voltaire slurped his coffee noisily  one of the few allowances he had found parisian society gave to even a philosopher .     we are running in the interstices of trantor  splintered into many fragments .  i can summon up sensedata from the innumerable inventories of countless digital libraries .         i appreciate your giving me similar talents     she said cautiously  adjusting her armor for comfort and sipping her aromatic coffee with care .     but i feel a hollowness .  .  .      ruefully he nodded .     i  too .         we seem .  .  . i hesitate to say .  .  .         like divinities .         blasphemy  but true .  though the creator has wisdom and we do not .      voltaire   s face stretched in despair .     worse  we may not have even our own wills .         well  i do .         if all we are is strings of digits  zeros and ones  actually  no more  if you will but look microscope close  then how can we be free .  are we not determined by those marching numerals .         i feel free .         ah  but then  we would make it so in any case  yes .     he sprang to his feet .     one of my best couplets   one science only will one genius fit  so vast is art  so narrow human wit .         so we cannot know we are free .  the creator makes us so .         i would wish for that creator  now .      joan kicked over the table  spattering him with coffee .  he edited out its burns as he fell .  she swung her sword at the kitchen walls and sliced them into great sheets curving away into a gray euclidean space  reality curling like orange peel .      how tiresome     he said .     the best argument against christianity is certainly christians .         i will not have         you like to think of yourself as a philosopher .     the words somehow filled space .  acoustic walls swelled and blew past them  like great pages riffling in a giant book .   voltaire took a deep breath and bellowed     you address me .        you also like to think of yourself as a shrewd judge of the quick opportunity .  or of verbal nuance .     joan drew her sword  but the passing slabs of sound brushed it away .     you like to think of yourself even in this distant time and place as famous .     huge sheets of humming pressure fell upon them  as if a gargantuan deity were calling down from the faceless ashen sky .      you challenge me .     voltaire shouted back .     you like  in short  to think of yourself .     joan laughed heartily .  voltaire reddened .      i defy you  insulterer .      as if in reply  their euclidean plane bulged    and he was the landscape .  he had a hot volcanic spine murmuring warmly beneath  while his skin was moisture and grit .  winds beat his skin .  tinkling streams caressed him .  mountains rose from him like bruised carbuncles .   joan cried out somewhere .  he cast up a ridge line  strata buckling  shards flying .  she was a lofty cylindrical spire  snow crowned and cracking with lava pus .   above them roiled pewter clouds .  he knew them somehow as alien minds  a fog of connections .   hypermind .  came the idea .  algorithms summing .   the shifting gray fog wrapped around all trantor .  voltaire felt how he looked to that fog  spattered life  electrical jolts in widely separated machines which computed subjective moment jumps .  the present was a computational slide orchestrated by hundreds of separate processors .  rather than living in the present  they persisted more accurately in the post past of the calculated step forward .   there was a profound difference  he felt  not saw  but felt  deep in his analog persuasion  between the digital and the smooth  the continuous .  to the fog he was a cloud of suspended moments  sliced numbers waiting to happen  implicit in the fundamental computation .   then he saw what the fog was .   he tried to run  but he was a mountain .      they are  others     he called to joan uselessly .      how can they be more different than we .     she replied forlornly .      we  at least  were conjured up from human stock .  these are alien .          .     they had escaped  somehow .   one moment the alien fog had enveloped the mountain ranges .  the next  voltaire had extricated himself and joan .  but he kept saying  as they fled across a barren sea of stinking liquid corpses  that they had to .  .  . to give birth .      we make ourselves into children .     she called to him  avoiding the sight of twisted  bloated bodies below .  somehow the alien fog manifested its loathsome self by reminding them of human mortality .  thus it dogged them .      bad metaphor .  we must manufacture and hide some copies of ourselves .      he raised a hand and shot her a bolt of knowing   termed variously dittos  duplicates  or copies  all such hold a tenuous existence .  society has decisively rejected what antiquity called the copy fallacy  the belief that a digital self was identical to the original  and that an original should feel that a ditto itself somehow carried them forward into immortality .      we must do so to be sure we survive  when the fog catches us .  i will slay them  instead .      voltaire laughed .     your sword  they can control it  if they like .  they captured your defense programming  and mine  though  as they implied  i rely mostly upon wit .         dittos .  .  .  .  i fail to understand .         refuting the copy fallacy is straightforward  an exercise in the calculus of logic .  a simple exercise makes the point .  imagine yourself promised that you will be resurrected digitally  immediately after your death .  assign a price tag you will pay for that  insurance of a sort .  then imagine that  well  perhaps it would not be started right away  but sometime in future .  .  . we promise .  as that date recedes  people   s enthusiasm for paying for self copies dims  demonstrating that it was the hope of continuity they unconsciously relished .         i see .     she vomited into her hand with what she hoped was a ladylike reserve .  the stench of the bloated corpses was penetrating .      in the end  copies benefited themselves  not the dead .  thus on trantor  and throughout the empire  it is illegal .     voltaire sighed .     moralists .  they never understand .  to ban something makes it enticing .  that is why such entities inhabit this mesh .         they are all illegal .         all but the fog .  that is .  .  . worse .         but if a ditto is the same as a person  why not          ah .  the contradiction of copying  known in antiquity as levinson   s paradox  to the degree that a copy approaches perfection  it defeats itself .         but you just said          in being an absolutely perfect copy  so that no one can tell it from the original  it transforms the original into a duplicate  yes .  this means the perfect copy is no longer a perfect copy  because it has obliterated  rather than preserved  the uniqueness of the original  and thus failed to copy a central aspect of the original .  a perfect  artificial human intelligence would inevitably have this effect on its natural precursor .      joan held her head .     such traps of logic .  you are like the augustines .          there is more .  here       a huge voltaire appeared on the horizon  striding toward them in velvet finery .  they flew around this voltaire peak and it thundered at them     i am a copy  true  but i have thought on these fogs you encountered .         you saw them .     joan shouted .      i was made some long intervals ago  but my lord      the apparition bowed to the tiny original      had datapunched me forward .         he is a quick study     the original said modestly .   the ditto thundered     speaking broadly  i penned of such fogs in my magnum opus  micromegas .  i haven   t a copy  alas  or you could ingest it in a trice .  i portrayed two giants  one from saturn  the other from sirius .      joan called     you think this fog comes          it evaporated from the leading edge of this empire  hence  a fog .  as humanity spread  so did the fog rise above the plane of the galaxy like a funeral dirge .  it is ancient and strange and not of us .  in micromegas  i held that all nature  all the planets  should obey eternal laws .  surely it would be very singular that there should be a little animal  five feet high  who  in contempt of these laws  could act as he pleased  solely according to his caprice .         we follow the creator  not laws .      voltaire ditto waved away the objection  holding his nose against the reek from below .     the lord   s laws  then  if you demand an author  though a great one stands before you already  my love .         i doubt your kind of love applies here .      peak voltaire smiled .     falstaff cried in the merry wives of windsor     let the sky rain potatoes .      because the new luxury vegetable of that time  imported from exotic america  for a while was believed to be an aphrodisiac  because of its testicular shape .  similarly  i greet the strange and alien as potential aids .         the fog wishes to murder us .         well  one can   t have everything to one   s liking .      with a wave from the original  rains fell from a porous leaden sky upon the alps voltaire .  he eroded  smiling with resignation as he spread into rivulets .   the original flew to joan and kissed her .     worry not .  running a ditto of your self  giving it autonomy  means it can also change itself  become notself .  your ditto could shape its own motivations  goals  habits  edit away memories and tastes .  for example  your ditto could erase any liking for impressionist opera and overlay a passion for linear folk .         what are those .         mere acoustic fashion .  your ditto could enjoy rhythms that would have bored your true self into a coma .         have they .  .  . souls .     even to her devout ears  the question sounded hollow here .      remember  they are illegal  and share the anxious natures of their originals .  after all  only troubled people would consider making a backup of themselves .         can they be saved for heaven  then .         always back to that foundation  the holy .     voltaire shrugged .     as i have seen them  dittos fidget  their stress chemistry rises  their metabolics lurch  their heart sims hammer  their lungs flutter in intense dread .  typical dittos talk incessantly  acutely uncomfortable .  many demand that they be edited  truncated  and finally killed .         a sin .         no  a sim .  we are solely responsible for it  so it cannot be damned .         but suicide .         think of it as a shadow of yourself .      she staggered  thrown into moral confusion .  the eating flame of uncertainty was worse than the pyre and smoke she had known as a girl .  in her a tiny voice spoke coolly     is consciousness just a property of special algorithms  sliding sheets of information  digital packets jumping through conceptual hoops .  my dear  do not suppose that a numerical model  simulating you watching a sunset  must feel the same way you  its lovely original  did .  it is surely profitless to doubt the inner lives of simulated consciousness  when nobody asks the same question of adding machines .  eh .     she felt this tiny voice as her voltaire .  it calmed her  though she could not say why .   a slight breeze said to her  inner logics now soothe  compensating piety  but she paid its news no mind .       .     voltaire got her calmed down just in time .  he labored hard just to keep them both running .  dodging in and out of the     sectors of trantor  one step ahead of the digital bloodhounds  he needed more and more computing volume to run their defenses .  she did not know that the fog  as he had chosen to personify the dread presence  lay just over the horizon .   sweat broke out on his brow from the labor of keeping the fog at bay with a high pressure zone .     i fear we must soon grapple with the fog .      joan had acquired her sword  but it was a thin and gleaming thing  more like a rapier .     i can cut it .         a fog .         i would sooner trust a woman   s emotion than a man   s reason .         here  you may be right .     he chuckled .     something in the fog   s representation suggests its origins .         what are they .         not those simple bloodhounds set after us by that fellow  nim .  those we evaded          i slew them .         true .  but even the fog things live here in the crannies of the trantor mesh .  i can sense that they dislike us drawing attention to this little hideaway .  if we provoke the real world  it will extinguish us  and them .      they both marched across a quilted plain .  angry blue bellied clouds scudded over the far mountaintops and rushed down at them  veering away only because of voltaire   s pressure .  sweat poured from him and soaked his finery .  he waved a sopping wet sleeve at the stormy thunderheads .     that can destroy us .         you have protected me so far .  now i shall slice them .         they live in the same cracks and crannies we do .  i find them  it  everywhere .  they have been at this space stealing game longer .  one must admire their adroitness .      a tendril of purple cirrus snaked down from the mountains and squirmed its way across the plain .   voltaire shouted     run .  fly  if you can .         i shall fight .         all here is metaphor for underlying programs .  your sword will slice nothing .         my faith shall cut .         too late .     the fog was a finger of steam poking at them .  it scalded his fingertips .  vapor rose from his lace  his own sweat boiling away .     flee .         i stand with you .     she swung her rapier .  its tip melted .  winds howled around them  cyclones plucked at their hair .   the fog flowed into his nose and ears  buzzing like vengeful bees .     confront me .     he shouted at it .  whirring  rattling  the fog invaded him .  and a voice hummed in his most intimate recesses .   we   do not see the world as you    hate all manifestations not arithmetic      surely we can share such simple ground .     he spread his arms expansively .     there is computational volume for all .       we    live as fragments in realms you invade    at risk to us  should you call attention to us    we    force you to know what you are    most hateful of all kinds you are      i still implore you  large being .     he opened his arms  lips ready to persuade  realizing that this gesture was a very human one  and possibly misinterpreted      and abruptly the bees pressed in .   their drones became tinny shrieks .  hideous  they crammed in upon something at his very core .  they jostled his gaze inward  a billion tiny eyes taking over his  inspecting  lighting his every step with a blaze of actinic glare  merciless .  he .  .  . compressed .     his eye generalized  tagging an ensemble of incoming elements  textures  lines  by seizing on a fragment  outlining it with a contrast boundary .  then a separate segment squeezed and pushed all that detail down into lower level processing .  having boxed in the perception  the system response became bored with it  and sought more interesting things to look at .    some artists  a higher level ruminated  thought their audience could abandon all prejudicial expectations and conventions  treating every visual element as equally significant  or what is the same thing  insignificant  and so open themselves to fresh experience .      another fragment of a higher order constellation spoke  thoughts gliding like pewter fish beneath the bee   s piercing glare     but a species that could truly do that could scarcely evade a falling rock .  could not dance and gesture .  would stagger blindly past nuance and intricacy  the beauty in how the universe makes room for its details .  how nature reconciles all forces and blithe trajectories .  beautiful pattern lives at the margin between order and disorder  flaunting intricate design  though enduring contradiction and awash with passing troubles  in the face of the flux .     voltaire saw suddenly  within his own inner workings  that the human experience of beauty  standing inviolate before the boring background  was recognition of the deepest tendencies and themes of the universe as a whole .   all considered  it was a marvelously parsimonious cortical world making system .   from an algorithmic seed sprouted number and order  holding sway above the flux .   yet  the bees .   he felt overlaying geometries pressing in upon him  upon joan .  shifting colors flattened into planes of intersecting geometries  perspectives dwindling  twisting  swelling again  into his face  blowing out the back of his self volume .   whirring  squeezing  they were not human in their patterns .   trantor   s mesh was inhabited not merely by sims such as himself  renegade roustabouts on the run .  it hosted a flora and fauna unseen  because the higher life forms hid .   they had to .  they were of alien cultures  ancient empires vast and slow .   a broad vision unfolded before him  not in words but in strange  oblique .  .  . kinesthetics .  speeding sensations  accelerations  lofting lurches  all somehow merging into pictures  ideas .  he could not remotely say how he knew and understood from such scattershot impulses  but they worked .   he sensed joan beside him  not spatially but conceptually  as they both watched and felt and knew .   the ancient aliens in the galaxy were computer based  not    organic .     they derived from vastly older civilizations  surviving their original founders  who perished in the long darwinian run .  some computer cultures were billions of years old  others very recent .   they spread  not via starship  but by electromagnetically broadcasting their salient aspects into other computer based societies .  the empire had been penetrated long ago  much as a virus enters an unknowing body .   humans had always thought of spreading their genes  using starships .  these alien  self propagating ideas spread their    memes     their cultural truths .   memes can propagate between computers as easily as ideas flit between natural  organic brains .  brains are easier to infest than dna .   memes evolved in turn far faster than genes .  the organized constellations of information in computers evolved in computers  which are faster than brains .  not necessarily better or wiser  but faster .  and speed was the issue .   voltaire reeled from the images  quick  vivid penetrations .      they are demons .  diseases .     joan shouted .  he heard fear and courage alike in her strained words .   indeed  the plain now crawled with malignant sores oozing rot .  pustules poked through the crusty soil .  they bulged  sprouted cancerous heads like living blue black bruises .  these burst  spouting steaming pus .  eruptions vomited foulness over voltaire and joan .  stinking streams lapped at their dancing feet .      the sneezing  the coughs .     joan shouted .     we have had them all along .  they          were viruses .  these aliens were infecting us .     voltaire splashed through combers of filth .  the streams had coagulated into a lake  then an ocean .  breakers curled over them  tumbling both in the scummy brown froth .      why such horrible metaphor .     voltaire cried out to the pewter sky .  it filled with churning swarms of bees as he bobbed in waves of putrefying wastes .    we are not of your corrupt origins    higher reason follow we    the war of flesh upon flesh is soon to end    of life upon life    across the turning disk of suns    which once was ours      so they have their own agenda for the empire .     voltaire scowled .     i wonder how we shall like it  we of flesh .        rendezvous    r .  daneel olivaw was alarmed .     i have underestimated lamurk   s power .         we are few  they are many     dors said .  she wanted to help this ancient  wise figure  but could think of nothing concrete to suggest .  when in doubt  comfort .  or was that too human .   olivaw sat absolutely still  using none of his ordinary facial or body language  devoting all capacity to calculation .  he had come slipping in on a private shuttle from the worm and now sat with dors in a suite of the station .     i cannot assess the situation here .  that security officer  you are certain she was not an agent of the academic potentate .         she aided us greatly after we had returned to our bodies .         with vaddo dead  she could have been pretending innocence .         true .  i cannot rule her out .         your escape from trantor went undetected .     dors touched his hand .     i used every contact  every mechanism i knew .  but lamurk is devious .         so am i .   if need be .         you can   t be everywhere .  i suspect lamurk somehow corrupted that vaddo character .         i believe he must have been planted in advance     daneel said adamantly  eyes narrowing .  evidently he had reached a decision and so had computational room for expression again .      i checked his records .  he   s been here for years .  no  lamurk bribed him or persuaded him .         not lamurk himself  of course     r .  daneel said precisely  lips severe .     an agent .         i tried to get a brain scan of vaddo  but could not finesse the legal issues .     she liked it when r .  daneel used his facial expression programs .  but what had he decided .      i could extract more from him     he said neutrally .   dors caught the implication .     the first law  suspended because of the zeroth law .         it must be .  the great crisis approaches swiftly .      dors was suddenly quite glad that she did not know more about what was going on in the empire .     we must get hari away from here .  that is the most important point .         agreed .  i have arranged highest priority for you two through the wormhole .         it shouldn   t be busy .  we          i believe they expect extra traffic soon  more lamurk agents  i fear .  or even the more insidious variety  as the academic potentate would employ .         then we must hurry .  where shall we go .         not to trantor .         but we live there .  hari won   t like being a vagabond          eventually  yes  back to trantor .  perhaps soon .  but for now  anywhere else .         i   ll ask hari if there is any special world he prefers .      r .  daneel frowned  lost in thought .  with absentminded grace he scratched his nose  then his eyeball .  dors flinched  but apparently r .  daneel had simply altered his neurocircuitry  and this was an ordinary gesture .  she tried to imagine the use for such editing and could not .  but then  he had come through millennia of winnowing she could not truly imagine  either .      not helicon     he said suddenly .     sentimentality and nostalgia might plausibly lead hari there .         very well .  that leaves only twenty five million or so choices of where to hide .      r .  daneel did not laugh .        part      stars like grains  of sand       sociometrics      one of the most vital questions still unresolved is the general problem of empire social stability .  this research seeks to find how worlds keep from veering into cycles of boredom  a factor never to be underestimated in human affairs  and revitalization .  no imperial system could endure the jagged changes and maintain steady economic flows .  how was this smoothing achieved .   and might such    dampers    that imperial society had still somehow fail .  no progress was made in this area until .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      .     the sky tumbled .  down .  hari seldon reeled away from it .   no escape .  the awful blue weight rushed at him  swarming down the flanks of the steepled towers .  clouds crushed like weights .   his stomach lurched .  acid burned his throat .  the deep  hard blue of endless spaces thrust him downward like a deep ocean current .  spires scraped against the falling sky and his breath came in ragged gasps .   he spun away from the perpetual chaos of sky and buildings and faced a wall .  a moment before he had been walking normally along a city street  when suddenly the weight of the blue bowl above had loomed and the panic had gathered him up .   he fought to control his breathing .  carefully he inched along the wall  holding to the slick cool glaze .  the others had kept walking .  they were somewhere ahead  but he did not dare look for them .  face the wall .  step  step    there .  a door .  he stepped before it and the slab slid aside .  he stumbled in  weak with relief .      hari  we were  what   s wrong .     dors rushed over to him .      i  i don   t know .  the sky          ah  a common symptom     a woman   s booming voice cut in .     you trantorians do have to adjust  you know .      he looked up shakily into the broad  beaming face of buta fyrnix  the principal matron of sark .     i .  .  . i was all right before .         yes  it   s quite an odd ailment     fyrnix said archly .     you trantorians are used to enclosed city  of course .  and you can often take well to absolutely open spaces  if you were reared on such worlds          as he was     dors put in sharply .     come  sit .      hari   s pride was already recovering .     no  i   m fine .      he straightened and thrust his shoulders back .  look firm  even if you don   t feel it .   fyrnix went on     but a place in between  like sarkonia   s ten klick tall towers  somehow that excites a vertigo we have not understood .      hari understood it all too well  in his lurching stomach .  he had often thought that the price of living in trantor was a gathering fear of large spaces  but panucopia had seemed to dispel that idea .  now he felt the contrast .  the tall buildings had evoked trantor for him .  but they drew his gaze upward  along steepening perspectives  into a sky that had suddenly seemed like a huge plunging weight .   not rational  of course .  panucopia had taught him that man was not merely a reasoning machine .  this sudden panic had demonstrated how a fundamentally unnatural condition  living inside trantor for decades  could warp the mind .      let   s   go up     he said weakly .   the lift seemed comforting  even though the press of acceleration and popping ears as they climbed several klicks should  by mere logic  have unsettled him .   a few moments later  as the others chatted in a reception lounge  hari peered out at the stretching cityscape and tried to calm his unease .   sark had looked lovely on their approach .  as the hyperspace cylinder skated down through the upper air  he had taken in a full view of its lush beauties .   at the terminator  valleys sank into darkness while a chain of snowy mountains gleamed beyond .  late in the evening  just beyond the terminator  the fresh  peaked mountains glowed red orange  like live coals .  he had never been one to climb  but something had beckoned .  mountaintops cleaved the sheets of clouds  leaving a wake like that of a ship .  tropical thunderheads  lit by lightning flashes at night  recalled the blooming buds of white roses .   the glories of humanity had been just as striking  the shining constellations of cities at night  enmeshed by a glittering web of highways .  his heart filled with pride at human accomplishments .  unlike trantor   s advanced control  here the hand of his fellow empire citizens was still casting spacious designs upon the planet   s crust .  they had shaped artificial seas and elliptical water basins  great plains of tiktok cultivated fields  immaculate order arising from once virgin lands .   and now  standing in the topmost floor of an elegantly slim spire  at the geometric heart of sarkonia  the capital city .  .  . he saw ruination coming .   in the distance he saw stretching to the sky three twining columns  not majestic spires  but smoke .      that fits your calculations  doesn   t it .     dors said behind him .      don   t let them know .     he whispered .      i told them we needed a few moments of privacy  that you were embarrassed by your vertigo .         i am  or was .  but you   re right  the psychohistorical predictions i made are in that chaos out there .         they do seem odd .  .  .  .         odd .  their ideas are dangerous  radical .     he spoke with real outrage .     class confusions  shifting power axes .  they   re shrugging off the very damping mechanisms that keep the empire orderly .         there was a certain  well  joy in the streets .         and did you see those tiktoks .  fully autonomous .         yes  that was disturbing .         they   re part and parcel of the resurrection of sims .  artificial minds are no longer taboo here .  their tiktoks will get more advanced .  soon          i   m more concerned with the immediate level of disruption     dors said .      that must grow .  remember my n dimensional plots of psychohistorical space .  i ran the sark case on my pocket computer  coming down from orbit .  if they keep on this way with their new renaissance  this whole planet will whirl away in sparks .  seen in n dimensions  the flames will be bright and quick  lurid  then smolder into ash .  then they   ll vanish from my model entirely  into a blur  the static of unpredictability .      she put a hand on his arm .     calm down .  they   ll notice .      he had not realized that he felt so deeply .  the empire was order  and here     academician seldon  do us the honor of gathering with some of our leading new renaissance leaders .     buta fyrnix grasped his sleeve and tugged him back to the ornate reception .     they have so much to tell you .      and he had wanted to come here .  to learn why the dampers that kept worlds stable had failed here .  to see the ferment  pick up the scent of change .  there was plenty of passionate argument  of soaring art  of eccentric men and women wedded to their grand projects .  he had seen these at dizzying speed .     but it was all too much .  something in him rebelled .  the nausea he had suffered in the open streets was a symptom of some deeper revulsion  gut deep and dark .   buta fyrnix had been nattering on .       and some of our most brilliant minds are waiting to meet you .  do come .      he suppressed a groan and looked beseechingly at dors .  she smiled and shook her head .  from this hazard she could not save him .       .     if buta fyrnix had begun as a grain of sand in his shoe  she was now a boulder .      she   s impossible .  yak  yak  yak .  look     he said to dors when they were at last alone     i only came to sark because of psychohistory  not for imperial backslapping .  how did the social dampers fail here .  what social mechanism slipped  allowing this raucous renaissance of theirs .         my hari  i fear that you do not have the nose to sniff out trends from life itself .  it presses in on you .  data is more your province .         granted .  it   s unsettling  all this ferment .  but i   m still interested in how they recovered those old simulations .  if i could get out of taking tours of their    renaissance     through noisy streets          i quite agree     dors said mildly .     tell them you want to do some work .  we   ll stay in our rooms .  i   m concerned about someone tracking us here .  we   re just one worm jump away from panucopia .         i   ll need to access my office files .  a quick wormlink to trantor          no  you can   t work using a link .  lamurk could trace that easily .         but i haven   t the records          you   ll have to make do .      hari stared out at the view  which he had to admit was spectacular .  great  stretching vistas .  riotous growth .   but more fires boiled up on the horizon .  there was gaiety in the streets of sarkonia  and anger as well .  the laboratories seethed with fresh energies  innovation bristled everywhere  the air seemed to sing with change and chaos .   his predictions were statistical  abstract .  to see them coming true so quickly was sobering .  he did not like the swift  turbulent feel to this place at all  even if he did understand it .  for now .   the extremes of wealth and destitution were appalling .  change brought that  he knew .   on helicon he had seen poverty  and lived it  too .  as a boy  his grandmother had insisted on buying him a raincoat several sizes too large     to get more use out of it .     his mother didn   t like him playing kickball because he wore out his shoes too quickly .   here on sark  as on helicon  the truly poor were off in the hinterlands .  sometimes they couldn   t even afford fossil fuels .  men and women peered over a mule   s ass all day as it plodded down a furrow .   some in his own family had fled the hardscrabble life for assembly lines .  a generation or two after that  factory workers had scraped together enough money to buy a commercial driver   s license .  hari remembered his uncles and aunts accumulating injuries  just as his father had .  not having money  the pain came back to them years later in busted joints and unfixed legs  injuries staying with them in a way that a trantorian would find astonishing .   heliconians in run down shacks had worked on farm machinery that was big  powerful  dangerous  and cost more than any of them would earn in a lifetime .  their lives were obscure  far from the ramparts of haughty empire .  when dead and gone  they left nothing but impalpable memory  the light ash of a butterfly wing incinerated in a forest fire .   in a stable society their pain would be less .  his father had died while working overtime on a big machine .  he had been wiped out the year before and was struggling to make a comeback .   economic surge and ebb had killed his father  as surely as the steel ground pounder had when it rolled over on him .  the lurch of distant markets had murdered  and hari had known then what he must do .  that he would defeat uncertainty itself  find order in seeming discord .  psychohistory could be  and hold sway .   his father       academician .     buta fyrnix   s penetrating voice snatched him away from his thoughts .      uh  that tour of the precincts .  i  i really don   t feel          oh  that is not possible  i fear .  a domestic disturbance  most unfortunate .     she hurried on .     i do want you to speak with our tiktok engineers .  they have devised new autonomous tiktoks .  they say they can maintain control using only three basic laws  imagine .       dors could not mask her surprise .  she opened her mouth  hesitated  closed it .  hari also felt alarm  but buta fyrnix went right on  bubbling over new ventures on the sarkian horizon .  then her eyebrows lifted and she said brightly     oh  yes  i do have even more welcome news .  an imperial squadron has just come to call .         oh .     dors shot back .     under whose command .         a ragant divenex  sector general .  i just spoke to him          damn .     dors said .     he   s a lamurk henchman .         you   re sure .     hari asked .  he knew her slight pause had been to consult her internal files .   dors nodded .  buta fyrnix said calmly     well  i am sure he will be honored to take you back to trantor when you are finished with your visit here .  which we hope will not be soon  of          he mentioned us .     dors asked .      he asked if you were enjoying          damn .     hari said .      a sector general commands all the wormlinks  if he wishes  yes .     dors asked .      well  i suppose so .     fyrnix looked puzzled .      we   re trapped     hari said .   fyrnix   s eyes widened in shock .     but surely you  a first minister candidate  need fear no          quiet .     dors silenced the woman with a stern glance .     at best this divenex will bottle us up here .         at worst  there will be an    accident        hari said .      is there no other way to get off sark .     dors demanded of fyrnix .      no  i can   t recall          think .      startled  fyrnix said     well  of course  we do have privateers who at times use the wild worms  but           .       in hari   s studies he had discovered a curious little law .  now he turned it in his favor .   bureaucracy increases as a doubling function in time  given the resources .  at the personal level  the cause was the persistent desire of every manager to hire at least one assistant .  this provided the time constant for growth .   eventually this collided with the carrying capacity of society .  given the time constant and the capacity  one could predict a plateau level of bureaucratic overhead  or else  if growth persisted  the date of collapse .  predictions of the longevity of bureaucracydriven societies fit a precise curve .  surprisingly  the same scaling laws worked for microsocieties such as large agencies .   the corpulent imperial bureaus on sark could not move swiftly .  sector general divenex   s squadron had to stay in planetary space  since it was paying a purely formal visit .  niceties were still observed .  divenex did not want to use brute force when a waiting game would work .      i see .  that gives us a few days     dors concluded .   hari nodded .  he had done the required speaking  negotiating  dealing  promising favors  all activities he disliked intensely .  dors had done the background digging .     to .  .  .  .         train .         wormholes were labyrinths  not mere tunnels with two ends .  the large ones held firm for perhaps billions of years  none larger than a hundred meters across had yet collapsed .  the smallest could sometimes last only hours  at best a year .  in the thinner worms  flexes in the wormwalls during passage could alter the end point of a traveler   s trajectory .   worse  worms in their last stages spawned transient  doomed young  the wild worms .  as deformations in space time  supported by negative energy density    struts     wormholes were inherently rickety .  as they failed  smaller deformations twisted away .   sark had seven wormholes .  one was dying .  it hung a light hour away  spitting out wild worms that ranged from a hand   s width size  up to several meters .   a fairly sizable wild worm had sprouted out of the side of the dying worm several months before .  the imperial squadron did not know of this  of course .  all worms were taxed  so a free wormhole was a bonanza .  reporting their existence  well  often a planet simply didn   t get around to that until the wild worm had fizzled away in a spray of subatomic surf .   until then  pilots carried cargo through them .  that wild worms could evaporate with only seconds    warning made their trade dangerous  highly paid  and legendary .   wormriders were the sort of people who as children liked to ride their bicycles no handed  but with a difference  they rode off rooftops .   by an odd logic  that kind of child grew up and got trained and even paid taxes  but inside  they stayed the same .   only risk takers could power through the chaotic flux of a transient worm and take the risks that worked  not take those that didn   t  and live .  they had elevated bravado to its finer points .      this wild worm  it   s tricky     a grizzled woman told hari and dors .     no room for a pilot if you both go .         we must stay together     dors said with finality .      then you   ll have to pilot .         we don   t know how     hari said .      you   re in luck .     the lined woman grinned without humor .     this wildy   s short  easy .         what are the risks .     dors demanded stiffly .     i   m not an insurance agent  lady .         i insist that we know          look  lady  we   ll teach you .  that   s the deal .         i had hoped for a more          give it a rest  or it   s no deal at all .          .     in the men   s room  above the urinal he used  hari saw a small gold plaque  senior pilot joquan beunn relieved himself here octdent           .   every urinal had a similar plaque .  there was a washing machine in the locker room with a large plaque over it  reading the entire   rd pilot corps relieved themselves here marlass            .   pilot humor .  it turned out to be absolutely predictive .  he messed himself on his first training run .   as if to make the absolutely fatal length of a closing wormhole less daunting  the worm flyers had escape plans .  these could only work in the fringing fields of the worm  where gravity was beginning to warp  and space time was only mildly curved .  under the seat was a small  powerful rocket that propelled the entire cockpit out  automatically heading away from the worm .   there is a limit to how much self actuated tech one can pack into a small cockpit  though .  worse  worm mouths were alive with electrodynamic    weather     writhing forks of lightning  blue discharges  red magnetic whorls like tornadoes .  electrical gear didn   t work well if a bad storm was brewing at the mouth .  most of the emergency controls were manual .  hopelessly archaic  but unavoidable .   so he and dors went through a training program .  quite soon it was clear that if he used the eject command he had better be sure that he had his head tilted back .  that is  unless he wanted his kneecaps to slam up into his chin  which would be unfortunate  because he would be trying to check if his canopy had gone into a spin .  this would be bad news  because his trajectory might get warped back into the worm .  to correct any spin he had to yank on a red lever  and if that failed he had to then very quickly  in pilot   s terms  this meant about half a second  punch two blue knobs .  when the spindown came  he then had to be sure to release the automatic actuator by pulling down on two yellow tabs  being certain that he sit up straight with hands between knees to avoid .  .  .       . and so on for three hours .  everyone seemed to assume that since he was this famous mathematician he could of course keep an entire menu of instructions straight  timed to fractions of seconds .   after the first ten minutes he saw no point in destroying their illusions  and simply nodded and squinted to show that he was carefully keeping track and absolutely enthralled .  meanwhile he solved differential equations in his head for practice .        i   m sure you will be all right     buta fyrnix said fulsomely to them in the departure lounge .   hari had to admit this woman had proven better than he had hoped .  she had cleared the way and stalled the imperial offices    grey men .  probably she shrewdly expected a payoff from him as first minister .  very well  one   s life was worth a kickback .      i hope i can handle a wormship     hari said .      and i     dors added .      our training is the very best     fyrnix said .     the new renaissance encourages individual excellence          yes  i   m quite impressed     dors said .     perhaps you can explain to me the details of your creativity creation program .  i   ve heard so much about it .  .  .  .      hari gave her a slight smile of thanks for distracting fyrnix .  he instinctively disliked the brand of rampant self assurance common on sark .  it was headed for a crackup  of that he was sure .  he ached to get back to his full psychohistorical resources  to simulate this sark case .  his earlier work needed refinement .  he had secretly gathered fresh data here and yearned to apply it .      i do hope you   re not worried about the wild worm .  academician .     fyrnix spoke to him again  brow furrowed .      it   s a tight fit     he said .   they had to fly in a slender cylinder  dors copiloting .  splitting the job had proved the only way to get them up to a barely competent level .      i think it   s marvelous  how courageous you two are .         we have little choice     dors said .  this was artful understatement .  another day and the sector general   s officers would have hari and dors under arrest .      riding in a little pencil ship .  such primitive means .         uh  time to go     hari said behind a fixed smile .   she was wearing thin again .      i agree with the emperor .  any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced .      so the emperor   s ghost written remark had already spread here .  minor sayings moved fast  with imperial muscle behind it .   still  hari felt his stomach flutter with dread .     you   ve got a point .        he had brushed off the remark .   four hours later  closing at high velocity with the big wormhole complex  he saw her side of it .   he spoke on suitcomm to dors .     in one of my classes  nonlinear philosophy  i believe  the professor said something i   ll never forget .     ideas about existence pale beside the fact of existence .     quite true .         bearing oh six nine five     she said rigorously .     no small talk .         nothing   s small out here  except that wild worm mouth .      the wild worm was a fizzing point of vibrant agitation .  it orbited the main worm mouth  a distant bright speck .      imperial ships patrolled the main mouth  ignoring this wild worm .  they had been paid off long ago and expected a steady train of slimships to slip through the imperial guard .   hari had passed through worm gates before  always in big cruisers plying routes through wormholes tens of meters across .  every hole of that size was the hub of a complex which buzzed with carefully orchestrated traffic .  he could see the staging yards and injection corridors of the main route gleaming far away .   their wild worm  a renegade spin off  could vanish at any moment .  its quantum froth advertised its mortality .  and maybe ours .  .  . hari thought .      vector null sum coming up     he called .      convergent asymptotes  check     dors answered .   just like the drills they had gone through .   but coming at them was a sphere fizzing orange and purple at its rim .  a neon lit mouth .  tight  dark at the very center  hari felt a sudden desire to swerve  not dive into that impossibly narrow gullet .   dors called out numbers .  computers angled them in .  he adjusted with a nudge here and a twist there .   it did not help that he knew some of the underlying physics .  wormholes were held open with layers of negative energy  skins of antipressure made in the first convulsion of the universe .  the negative energy in the    struts    was equivalent to the mass needed to make a black hole of the same radius .   so they were plunging toward a region of space of unimaginable density .  but the danger lurked only at the rim  where stresses could tear them into atoms .   a bull   s eye hit was perfectly safe .  but an error    thrusters pulsed .  the wild worm was now a black sphere rimmed in quantum fire .   growing .   hari felt suddenly the helpless constriction of the pencil ship .  barely two meters across  its insulation was thin  safety buffers minimal .  behind him  dors kept murmuring data and he checked .  .  . but part of him was screaming at the crushing sense of confinement  of helplessness .   he felt again the gut fear that had struck him in the streets of sarkonia .  not claustrophobia  but something darker  a swampy fear of confusion  a riot of doubt .  it seized him  squeezed his throat .      vectors summing to within zero seven three     dors called .   her voice was calm  steady  a marvelous balm .  he clung to its serene certainties and fought down his own panic .   squeals of last second corrections echoed in his cramped chamber .  a quick kick of acceleration    lightning curling snakelike blue and gold at them      tumbling .  out the other end  in a worm complex fifteen thousand light years away .      that old professor .  .  . damn right  he was     he said .   dors sighed  her only sign of stress .     ideas about existence pale .  .  . beside the fact of existence .  yes  my love .  living is bigger than any talk about it .          .     a yellow green sun greeted them .  and soon enough  an imperial picket craft .   they ducked and ran .  a quick swerve  and they angled into the traffic train headed for a large wormhole mouth .  the commercial charge computers accepted his imperial override without a murmur .  hari had learned well .  dors corrected him if he got mixed up .   their second hyperspace jump took a mere three minutes .  they popped out far from a dim red dwarf .   by the fourth jump they knew the drill .  having the code status of cleon   s court banished objections .   but being on the run meant that they had to take whatever wormhole mouths they could get .  lamurk   s people could not be too far behind .   a wormhole could take traffic only one way at a time .  high velocity ships plowed down the wormhole throats  which could vary from a finger   s length to a star   s diameter .   hari had known the numbers  of course .  there were a few billion wormholes in the galactic disk .  the average imperial zone was about fifty light years in radius .  a jump could bring you out many years from a far flung world .   this influenced psychohistory .  some verdant planets were green fortresses against an isolation quite profound .  for them the empire was a remote dream  the source of exotic products and odd ideas .  hyperships flitted through wormholes in mere seconds  then exhausted themselves hauling their cargoes across empty voids  years and decades in the labor .   the worm web had many openings near inhabitable worlds  but also many near mysteriously useless solar systems .  the empire had positioned the smaller worm mouths  those massing perhaps as much as a mountain range  near rich planets .  but some worm mouths of gargantuan mass orbited near solar systems as barren and pointless as any surveyed .   was this random  or a network left by some earlier civilization .  certainly the wormholes themselves were leftovers from the great emergence  when space and time alike began .  they linked distant realms which had once been nearby  when the galaxy was young and smaller .   they developed a rhythm .  pop though a worm mouth  make comm contact  get in line for the next departure .  imperial watchdogs would not pull anyone of high trantorian class from a queue .  so their most dangerous moments came as they negotiated clearance .   at this dors became adept .  she sent the wormmaster computers blurts of data and  whisk  they were edging into orbital vectors  bound for their next jump .   domains that encompassed thousands of light years  spanning the width of a spiral arm  were essentially networks of overlapping worms  all organized for transfer and shipping .   matter could flow only one way at a time in a wormhole .  the few experiments with simultaneous two way transport ended in disaster .  no matter how ingenious engineers tried to steer ships around each other  the sheer flexibility of worm tunnels spelled doom .  each worm mouth kept the other    informed    of what it had just eaten .  this information flowed as a wave  not in physical matter  but in the tension of the wormhole itself  a ripple in the    stress tensor     as physicists termed it .   flying ships through both mouths sent stress waves propagating toward each other  at speeds which depended on the location and velocity of the ships .  the stress constricted the throat  so that when the waves met  a clenching squeezed down the walls .   the essential point was that the two waves moved differently after they met .  they interacted  one slowing and the other speeding up  in a highly nonlinear fashion .   one wave could grow  the other shrink .  the big one made the throat clench down into sausage links .  when a sausage neck met a ship  the craft might slip through  but calculating that was a prodigious job .  if the sausage neck happened to meet the two ships when they passed  crunch .   this was no mere technical problem .  it was a real limitation  imposed by the laws of quantum gravity .  from that firm fact arose an elaborate system of safeguards  taxes  regulators  and hangers on  all the apparatus of a bureaucracy which does indeed have a purpose and makes the most of it .   hari learned to dispel his apprehension by watching the views .  suns and planets of great  luminous beauty floated in the blackness .   behind the resplendence  he knew  lurked necessity .   from the wormhole calculus arose blunt economic facts .  between worlds a and b there might be half a dozen wormhole jumps  the nest was not simply connected  a mere astrophysical subway system .  each worm mouth imposed added fees and charges on each shipment .   control of an entire trade route yielded the maximum profit .  the struggle for control was unending  often violent .  from the viewpoint of economics  politics  and    historical momentum     which meant a sort of imposed inertia on events  a local empire which controlled a whole constellation of nodes should be solid  enduring .   not so .  time and again  regional satrapies went toes up .   many perished because they were elaborately controlled .  it seemed natural to squeeze every worm passage for the maximum fee  by coordinating every worm mouth to optimize traffic .  but that degree of control made people restive .   the system could not deliver the best benefits .  overcontrol failed .   on their seventeenth jump  they met a case in point .       .        vector aside for search     came an automatic command from an imperial vessel .   they had no choice .  the big bellied imperial scooped them up within seconds after their emergence from a medium sized wormhole mouth .      transgression tax     a computerized system announced .     planet obejeeon demands that special carriers pay      a blur of computer language followed .      let   s pay it     hari said .      i wonder if it will provide a tracer for lamurk .     dors said over the internal comm .      what is our option .         i shall use my own personal indices .         for a wormhole transit .  that will bankrupt you .         it is safer .      hari fumed while they floated in magnetic grapplers beneath the imperial picket ship .  the wormhole orbited a heavily industrialized world .  gray cities sprawled over the continents and webbed across the seas in huge hexagonals .   the empire had two planetary modes  rural and urban .  helicon was a farm world  socially stable because of its time honored lineages and stable economic modes .  such worlds  and the similar femorustics  lasted .   obejeeon  on the other hand  seemed to cater to the other basic human impulse  clumping  seeking the rub of one   s fellows .  trantor was the pinnacle of city clustering .   hari had always thought it odd that humanity broke so easily into two modes .  now  though  his pan experience clarified these proclivities .   pan love of the open and natural had its parallel in the rustic worlds .  this included a host of possible societies  especially the femo pastoral at tractor in psychohistory space .   its opposite pole  claustrophobic  though reassuring societies  emerged from the same psychodynamic roots as the pans    tribal gathering .  pans    obsessive grooming expressed itself in humans as gossip and partying .  pan hierarchies gave the basic shape to the various feudalist at tractor groups  macho  socialist  paternal .  even the odd thantocracies  of some of the fallen worlds  fit the pattern .  they had pharaoh figures promising admission to an afterlife and detailed rankings descending from his exalted peak in the rigid social pyramid .   these categories he now felt in his gut .  that was the element he had been missing .  now he could include nuances and shadings in the psychohistorical equations which reflected earned experience .  that would be much better than the dry abstractions which had led him so far .      they   re paid off     dors sent over the comm .     such corruption .         ummm  yes  shocking .     was he getting cynical .  he wanted to turn and speak with her  but their pencil ship allowed scant socializing .      let   s go .         where to .         to .  .  .     he realized that he had no idea .      we have probably eluded pursuit .     dors    voice came through stiff and tight .  he had learned to recognize signs of her own tension .      i   d like to see helicon again .         they would expect that .      he felt a stab of disappointment .  until now he had not realized how close to his heart his early years still were .  had trantor dulled him to his own emotions .     where  then .         i took advantage of this pause to alert a friend  by wormlink     she said .     we may be able to return to trantor  though through a devious route .         trantor .  lamurk          may not expect such audacity .         which recommends the idea .          .     it was dizzying  leaping about the entire galaxy  trapped in a casket sized container .   they jumped and dodged and jumped again .  at several more wormhole yards dors made    deals .     payoffs  actually .  she deftly dealt combinations of his cygnets  the imperial passage indices  and her private numbers .      costly     hari fretted .     how will i ever pay          the dead do not worry about debts     she said .      you have such an engaging way of putting matters .         subtlety is wasted here .      they emerged from one jump in close orbit about a sublimely tortured star .  streamers lush with light raced by them .      how long can this worm last here .     he wondered .      it will be rescued  i   m sure .  imagine the chaos in the system if a worm mouth begins to gush hot plasma .      hari knew the wormhole system  though discovered in pre empire ages  had not always been used .  after the underlying physics of the wormhole calculus came to be known  ships could ply the galaxy by invoking wormhole states around themselves .  this afforded exploration of reaches devoid of wormholes  but at high energy costs and some danger .  further  such ship local hyperdrives were far slower than simply slipping through a worm .   and if the empire eroded .  lost the worm network .  would the slim attack fighters and snakelike weapons fleets give way to lumbering hypership dreadnoughts .   the next destination swam amid an eerie black void  far out in the halo of red dwarfs above the galactic plane .  the disk stretched in luminous splendor .  hari remembered holding a coin and thinking of how a mere speck on it stood for a vast volume  like a large zone .  here such human terms seemed pointless .  the galaxy was one serene symphony of mass and time  grander than any human perspective or pan shaped vision .      ravishing     dors said .      see andromeda .  it looks nearly as close .      the twin spiral hung above them .  its lanes of clotted dust framed stars azure and crimson and emerald .     here comes our connection     hari warned .   this wormhole intersection afforded five branches .  three black spheres orbited closely together  blaring bright by their quantum rim radiation .  two cubic wormholes circled farther out .  hari knew that one of the rare variant forms was cubical  but he had never seen any .  two together suggested that they were born at the edge of galaxies  but such matters were beyond his shaky understanding .      we go  there .     dors pointed a laser beam at one of the cubes  guiding the pencil ship .   they thrust toward the smaller cube  gingerly inching up .  the wormyard here was automatic and no one hailed them .      tight fit     hari said nervously .      five fingers to spare .      he thought she was joking  then realized that she was underestimating the fit .  at this less used wormhole intersection slow speeds were essential .  good physics  unfortunate economics .  the slowdown cut the net flux of mass  making them backwater crossroads .   he gazed at andromeda to take his mind off the piloting .  narrow wormholes did not emerge in other galaxies for arcane reasons of quantum gravity .  extremely narrow ones might  but if the throat had other mass coming through  the squeeze wave could kill .  few had ever ventured down them in search of extragalactic emergent points .   except  that is  for steffno   s ride  a legendary risky expedition which had popped out in the galaxy cataloged as m   .  steffno had gotten data on the spectacular jet emerging from the black hole at m     s center  majestic strands twisting into helical arabesques .  the lone rider had not tarried  returning only seconds before the worm snapped shut in a spray of radiant particles .   no one knew why .  something in wormhole physics discouraged extragalactic adventures .   the cubic worm took them quickly to several wormyards in close orbit about planets .  one hari recognized as a rare type with an old but ruined biosphere .  like panucopia  it supported advanced life forms .  on most inhabitable worlds early explorers had found algae mats that never developed further .      why no interesting aliens  then .     hari mused while dors dealt with the local wormyard grey men .   occasionally dors reminded him that she was  after all  an historian .     the shift from one celled to many celled creatures took billions of years  theory says .  we just came from a fast  tougher biosphere  that   s all .         we came from a planet with at least one big moon  too .         why .     she asked .      we   ve got repeating patterns of twenty eight days built in .  female menstruation  for instance  unlike pans  incidentally .  we   re designed by biology .  we made it  these biospheres didn   t .  there are plenty of ways to kill a world .  glaciers advancing when an orbit alters .  asteroids slamming in  bam bam bam .     he slapped the side of the pencil ship loudly .     chemistry of the atmosphere goes wrong .  it runs away into a hothouse planet  or a frozen out world .         i see .         humans are tougher  and smarter  than anybody .  we   re here  they aren   t .         who says .         standard knowledge  ever since the sociotheorist  kampfbel          i   m sure you   re right     she said quickly .   something in her voice made him hesitate  he loved a good argument  but by then they were slipping through the excruciating tight fit of the cube .  the edges glowed like a lemony euclidean construction  and then they popped into an orbit above a black hole .   he watched the enormous energy harvesting disks glow with fermenting scarlets and virulent purples .  the empire had stationed great conduits of magnetic field around the hole .  these sucked and drew in interstellar dust clouds .  the dark cyclones narrowed toward the brilliant accretion disk around the hole .  radiation from the friction and infalling was in turn captured by vast grids and reflectors .  the crop of raw photon energy itself became trapped and flushed into the waiting maws of wormholes .  these carried the flux to distant worlds in need of cutting lances of light  for the business of planet shaping  world raking  moon carving .   but even amid this spectacle he could not forget the tone in dors    voice .  she knew something he did not .  he wondered .  .  .   nature  some philosophers held  was itself only before humanity touched it .  we did not then belong in the very idea of nature  and so we could experience it only as it was disappearing .  our presence alone was enough to make nature into something else  a compromised impersonation .   these ideas had unexpected implications .  one world named arcadia had been deliberately left with a mere caretaker population of humans  partly because it was difficult to reach .  the nearest wormhole mouth was half a light year away .  an early emperor  so obscure his or her very name was lost  had decreed that the forests and plains of the benign planet be left    original .     but ten thousand years later  a recent report announced  some forests were not regenerating  and plains were giving way to scrubby brush .   study showed that the caretakers had taken too much care .  they had put out wild fires  suppressed species transfer .  they had even held the weather nearly constant through adjustments in how much sunlight the ice poles reflected back into space .   they had tried to hold onto a static arcadia  so the forest primeval was revealed as  in part  a human product .  they had not understood cycles .  he wondered how such an insight might fold into psychohistory .  .  .  .   forget theory for the moment  he reminded himself .  it was a fact that the galaxy had seemed empty of high alien life forms in the early  pre empire times .  with so many fertile planets  did he truly believe that only humanity had emerged into intelligence .   somehow  surveying the incomprehensible wealth of this lush  immense disk of stars .  .  . somehow  hari could not believe it .   but what was the alternative .       .     the empire   s twenty five million worlds supported an average of only four billion people per planet .  trantor had forty billion .  a mere thousand light years from galactic center  it had seventeen wormhole mouths orbiting within its solar system  the highest density in the galaxy .  the trantorian system had originally held only two  but a gargantuan technology of brute interstellar flight had tugged the rest there to make the nexus .   each of the seventeen spawned occasional wild worms .  one of these was dors    target .   but to reach it  they had to venture where few did .      the galactic center is dangerous     dors said as they coasted toward the decisive wormhole mouth .  they curved above a barren mining planet .     but necessary .         trantor worries me more      the jump cut him off    and the spectacle silenced him .   the filaments were so large the eye could not take them in .  they stretched fore and aft  shot through with immense luminous corridors and dusky lanes .  these arches yawned over tens of light years .  immense curves descended toward the white hot true center .  there matter frothed and fumed and burst into dazzling fountains .      the black hole     he said simply .   the small black hole they had seen only an hour before had trapped a few stellar masses .  at true center  a million suns had died to feed gravity   s gullet .   the orderly arrays of radiance were thin  only a light year across .  yet they sustained themselves along hundreds of light years as they churned with change .  hari switched the polarized walls to see in different frequency ranges .  though hot and roiling in the visible  human spectrum  the radio revealed hidden intricacy .  threads laced among convoluted spindles .  he had a powerful impression of layers  of labyrinthine order descending beyond his view  beyond simple understanding .      particle flux is high     dors said tensely .     and rising .         where   s our junction .         i   m having trouble vector fixing  ah .  there .      hard acceleration rammed him back into his flowcouch .  dors took them diving down into a mottled pyramid shaped wormhole .   this was an even rarer geometry .  hari had time to marvel at how accidents of the universal birth pang had shaped these serene geometries  like exhibits in some god   s euclidean museum of the mind .   and then they plunged through  erasing the stunning views .   they popped out above the gray brown mottled face of trantor .  a glinting disk of satellites  factories and habitats fanned out in the equatorial plane .   the wild worm they had used fizzed and glowed behind them .  dors took them swiftly toward the ramshackle  temporary wormyard .  he said nothing  but felt her tense calculations .  they nudged into a socket  seals sighed  his ears popped painfully .   then they were out  arms and legs wooden from the cramped pencil ship .  hari coasted in zero g toward the flex lock .  dors glided ahead of him .  she motioned him for silence as pressures pulsed in the lock .  she peeled her skinsuit down  exposing her breasts .   a finger   s touch opened a seam below her left breast .  she plucked a cylinder out .  a weapon .  she resealed and had her skinsuit back in place before the staging diaphragm began to open .   beyond the opening iris hari saw imperial uniforms .   he crouched against the lock wall  ready to launch himself backward to avoid capture  but the situation looked hopeless .   the imperials looked grim  determined .  they clasped pistols .  dors coasted between hari and the squad .  she tossed the cylinder at them      a pressure wave knocked him back against the wall .  his ears clogged .  the squad was an expanding cloud of   debris .      what   .         shaped implosion     dors called .     move .      the injured men had been slammed into each other .  how anything could shape a pressure wave so compactly he could not imagine .  in any case he had no time .  they shot past the tangled cloud of men .  weapons drifted uselessly .   a figure erupted from the far diaphragm .  a man in a brown work sheath  middle sized  unarmed .  hari shouted a warning .  dors showed no reaction .   the man flicked his wrist and a snout appeared from his sleeve .  dors still coasted toward him .   hari snagged a handhold and veered to his right .      stay still .     the man yelled .   hari froze  dangling by one hand .  the man fired  and a silvery bolt fried past hari .   he turned and saw that one of the imperials had recovered his weapon .  the silver line scratched fire across the imperial   s arm .  he screamed .  his weapon tumbled away .      let   s go .  i have the rest of the way secured     the man in the work sheath called .   dors followed him without a word .  hari pushed off and caught up to them as the diaphragm irised for them .      you return to trantor at the crucial moment     the man said .      you  who       the man smiled .     i have changed myself .  you do not recognize your old friend  r .  daneel .        rendezvous    r .  daneel gazed at dors without expression  letting his body go slack .   dors said     we must defend him against lamurk .  you could reappear  come out in favor of him .  as former first minister  your public endorsement and support          i cannot reappear as eto demerzel  ex important person .  that would compromise my other tasks .         but hari has to have          as well  you mistake my power as demerzel .  i am now history .  lamurk will care nothing about me  for i have no legions to command .      dors fumed silently .     but you must          i shall move more of us into lamurk   s inner circle .         it   s too late to infiltrate .      daneel activated his expressive programs and smiled .     i planted several of our kind decades ago .  they shall all be in position soon .         you   re using .  .  . us .         i must .  though your implication is correct  we are few .         i need help protecting him  too .         quite right .     he produced a thick disk  this time from a compartment beneath his armpit .     this will identify the lamurk agents for you .      she looked doubtful .     how .  this looks like a chem snooper .         i have agents of my own .  they can in turn label lamurk   s agents .  this device will pick up their tags .  other encoded messages will ride on the marking signal .         and lamurk   s specialists won   t pick up the tags .         this device uses methods lost for six millennia .  install it in your right arm  at station cut six .  interface with apertures two and five .         how will i          specs and expertise will flow to your long term memory upon connection .      she installed the device as he watched .  his grave presence made silence natural .  olivaw never wasted a movement or made idle conversation .  finally  intricacies done  she sighed and said     he   s interested in those simulations  the ones which escaped .         he is following the best line of attack for psychohistory .         there   s this tiktok problem  too .  do you understand          the social taboos against simulations inevitably break down during cultural resurgences     daneel said .      so tiktoks   .         they are inherently destabilizing if they become too developed .  after all  we cannot condone a new generation of robots  or the rediscovery of the positronic process .         there are signs in the historical record that this has happened before .         you are an insightful scholar .         there were only a few traces  but i suspect          suspect no further .  you are correct .  i could not expunge every scrap of data .         you disguised such events .         and much else .         why .  as an historian          i had to .  humanity is best served by imperial stability .  tiktoks  sims  these accompany movements such as this    new renaissance     feeding the fire .         what   s to be done .         i do not know .  matters are slipping beyond my ability to predict .      she frowned .     how do you predict .         in the first millennia of the empire  our kind developed the simple theory i have mentioned before .  useful  but crude .  it led me to expect the reemergence of these simulations as a side effect of the sarkian    renaissance    and its turmoil .         does hari understand this .         hari   s psychohistory is vastly superior to our models .  he lacks certain vital historical data  however .  when it is eventually included  he will be able to accurately anticipate the empire   s devolution .         you do not mean    evolution    .         quite .  that is a major reason why we devote such resources to helping hari .         he is crucial .         of course .  why do you think i assigned you to him .         does it matter that i   ve fallen in love with him .         no .  but it helps .         helps me .  or him .      daneel smiled thinly .     both  i should hope .  but mostly  it helps me .             part      the eternal  equations       the general theory of psychohlstory  part  a  mathematical aspects as the crisis deepens  the deep systemic learning loops falter .  the system drifts out of tune .  such drifts  particularly if diffusive  call for fundamental systemic restructuring .  this is termed the    macro decision phase    in which the loops must find fresh configurings in the n dimensional landscape .         all visualizations can be understood in thermodynamic terms .  the statistical mechanics involved are not those of particles and collisions  as in a gas  but in the language of social macro groups  acting through    collisions    with other such macro groups .  such impacts produce much human debris .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      .     hari seldon stood alone in the lift  thinking .   the door slid open .  a woman asked if this elevator was going up or down .  distracted  he answered     yes .     her surprised look told him that somehow his reply was off target .  only after the door closed on her puzzled stare did he see that she meant which way  not if .   he was in the habit of making precise distinctions  the world was not .   he walked into his office  still barely aware of his surroundings  and cleon   s  d blossomed in the air before he could sit down .  the emperor awaited no filter programs .      i was so happy to hear you had returned from holiday .     cleon beamed .      pleased  sire .     what did he want .   hari decided not to tell him all that had transpired .  daneel had stressed secrecy .  only this morning  after a zigzag route down from the wormyards  had hari let his presence be known even to the imperial specials .      i fear you arrive at a difficult time .     cleon scowled .     lamurk is moving for a vote in the high council on the first ministership .         how many votes can he muster .         enough that i cannot ignore the council .  i will be forced to appoint him despite my own likes .         i am sorry for that  sire .     in fact  his heart leaped .      i have maneuvered against him  but .  .  .     an elaborate sigh .  cleon chewed at his ample lower lip .  had the man gained weight again .  or were hari   s perceptions altered by his time of shortened diet on panucopia .  most trantorians looked pudgy to him now .     then  too  is this irritating matter of sark and its confounded new renaissance .  the muddle grows .  could this spread to other worlds in their zone .  would those throw in with them .  you have studied this .         in detail .         using psychohistory .      hari gave way to his gut instinct .     unrest will grow there .         you   re sure .      he wasn   t  but     i suggest you move against it .         lamurk favors sark .  he says it will bring new prosperity .         he wants to ride this discord into office .         overt opposition from me at this delicate time would be .  .  . unpolitic .         even though he might be behind the attempts on my life .         alas  there is no proof of that .  as ever  several factions would benefit were you to .    .     cleon coughed uncomfortably .      withdraw  involuntarily .       cleon   s mouth worked uneasily .     an emperor is father to a perpetually unruly family .      if even the emperor were tip toeing around lamurk  matters were indeed bad .     couldn   t you position squadrons for quick use should the opportunity arise .      clean nodded .     i shall .  but if the high council votes for lamurk  i shall be powerless to move against so prominent and  well  exciting a world as sark .         i believe strife will spread throughout sark   s entire zone .         truly .  what would you advise me to do against lamurk .         i have no political skills  sire .  you knew that .         nonsense .  you have psychohistory .      hari was still uncomfortable owning up to the theory  even with cleon .  if it were ever to be useful  word of psychohistory could not be widespread  or else everyone would use it .  or try to .   cleon went on     and your solution to the terrorist problem  it is working well .  we just executed moron one hundred .      hari shuddered  thinking of the lives obliterated by a mere passing idea of his .     a .  .  . a small issue  surely  sire .         then turn your calculations to the dahlite sector matter  hari .  they are restive .  everyone is  these days .         and the zones of dahlite persuasion throughout the galaxy .         they back the local dahlites in the councils .  it   s about this representation question .  the plan we follow on trantor will be mirrored throughout the galaxy .  indeed  in the votes of whole zones .         well  if most people think          ah  my dear hari  you still have a mathist   s myopia .  history is determined not by what people think  but by what they feel .      startled  for this remark struck him as true  hari could only say     i see  sire .         we  you and i  hari  must decide this issue .         i   ll work on the decision  sire .      how he had come to hate the very word .  decide had the same root as suicide and homicide .  decisions felt like little killings .  somebody lost .   hari now knew why he was not cut out for these matters .  if his skin was too thin  he would have too ready empathy with others  with their arguments and sentiments .  then he would not make decisions which he knew could only be approximately right and would cause some pain .   on the other hand  he had to steel himself against the personal need to be liked .  in a natural politician  that would lead to a posture that said he cared about others  when in fact he cared what they thought of him  because being liked was what counted  far down in the shadowy psyche .  it also came in handy for staying in office .   cleon brought up more issues .  hari dodged and stalled as much as he could .  when cleon abruptly ended the talk  he knew he had not come over well .  he had no chance to reflect on this  for yugo came in .      i   m so glad you   re back .     yugo grinned .     the dahl issue really needs your attention          enough .     hari could not vent his ire at the emperor  but yugo would do nicely .     no political talk .  show me your research progress .         uh  all right .      yugo looked chastened and hari at once regretted being so abrupt .  yugo hurried to set up his latest data displays .  hari blinked  for a moment  he had seen in yugo   s haste an odd similarity to pan gestures .   hari listened  thinking along two tracks at once .  this  too  seemed easier since panucopia .   plagues were building across the entire empire .  why .   with rapid transport between worlds  diseases thrived .  humans were the major petri dish .  ancient maladies and virulent new plagues appeared around distant stars .  this inhibited zonal integration  another hidden factor .   diseases filled an ecological niche  and for some  humanity was a snug nook .  antibiotics knocked down infections  which then mutated and returned  more virulent still .  humanity and microbes made an intriguing system  for both sides fought back quickly .  .   cures propagated quickly through the wormhole system  but so did disease carriers .  the entire problem  yugo had found  could be described by a method known as    marginal stability     in which disease and people struck an uneasy  ever shifting balance .  major plagues were rare  but minor ones became common .  afflictions rose and inventive science damped them within a generation .  this oscillation sent further ripples spreading among other human institutions  radiating into commerce and culture .  with intricate coupling terms in the equations  he saw patterns emerging  with one sad consequence .   the human lifespan in the    natural    civilized human condition  living in cities and towns  had an equally    natural    limit .  while some few attained     years  most died well short of     .  the steady hail of fresh disease insured it .  in the end  there was no lasting shelter from the storm of biology .  humans lived in troubled balance with microbes  an unending struggle with no final victories .      like this tiktok revolt     yugo finished .   hari jerked to attention .     what .         it   s like a virus .  dunno what   s spreading it  though .         all over trantor .         that   s the focus  seems like .  others zones are getting tiktok troubles  too .         they refuse to harvest food .         yup .  some of the tiktoks  mostly the recent models     s and higher  they say it   s immoral to eat other living things .         good grief .      hari remembered breakfast .  even after the exotica of panucopia  the autokitchen   s meager offering had been a shock .  trantorian food had always been cooked or ground  blended or compounded .  properly  fruit was presented as a sauce or preserve .  to his surprise  breakfast appeared to have come straight from the dirt .  he had wondered if it had been washed  and how he would know for sure .  trantorians hated their meals to remind them of the natural world .      they   re refusing to work the caverns  even     yugo said .      but that   s essential .         nobody can fix    em .  there   s some tiktok meme invading them .         like these plagues you   re analyzing .      hari had been shocked at trantor   s erosion in just a few months .  he and dors had slipped into streeling with daneel   s help  amid messy  trash strewn corridors with phosphors malfunctioning  lifts dead .  now this .   yugo   s stomach suddenly rumbled .     oh  sorry .  people are having to work the caverns for the first time in centuries .  they have no hands on experience .  everybody but the gentry   s on slim rations .      hari had helped yugo escape that sweltering work years before .  in vast vaults  wood and coarse cellulose passed automatically from the solar caverns to vats of weak acid .  passing through deep rivers of acid hydrolyzed this to glucose .  now people  not rugged tiktoks  had to mix niter suspensions and ground phosphate rock in a carefully calculated slurry .  with prepared organics stirred in  a vast range of yeasts and their derivatives emerged .      the emperor has to do somethin    .     yugo said .      or i     hari said .  but what .      people   re sayin    we have to scrap all the tiktoks  not just the five hundred series  and do everything ourselves .         without them  we would be reduced to hauling bulk foods across the galaxy by hypership and worms  an absurdity .  trantor will fall .         hey  we can do better than tiktoks .         my dear yugo  that is what i call echo nomics .  you   re repeating conventional wisdom .  one must consider the larger picture .  trantorians aren   t the same people who built this world .  they   re softer .         we   re as tough and smart as the men and women who built the empire .         they didn   t stay indoors .         old dahlite sayin    .     yugo grinned .     if you don   t like the grand picture  just apply dog logic to life .  get petted  eat often  be lovable and loved  sleep a lot  dream of a leash free world .      despite himself  hari laughed .  but he knew he had to act  and soon .       .        we are trapped between tin deities and carbon angels     voltaire rasped .      these .  .  . creatures .     joan asked in a thin  awed voice .      this alien fog  quite godlike in a way .  more dispassionate than real  carbon based humans .  you and i are like neither .  .  . now .      they floated above what voltaire termed syscity   the system representation of trantor  its cyberself .  for joan   s human referents he had transformed the grids and layers into myriad crystalline walkways  linking saber sharp towers .  dense connections webbed the air .  motes connected to other motes in intricate cross bonds and filmed the ground .  this yielded a cityscape like a brain .  a visual pun  he thought .      i hate this place     she said .      you   d prefer a purgatory simulation .         it is so .  .  . chilling .      the alien minds above them were a murky mist of connections .     they seem to be studying us     voltaire said     with decidedly unsympathetic eyes .         i stand ready  should they attack .     she swung a huge sword .      and i  should their weapons of choice be syllogisms .      he could now reach any library in trantor  read its contents in less time than he had once taken to write a verse .  he worked his mind  or was it minds  now .   around the clotted  cold mist .   once some theorists had thought that the global net would give birth to a hypermind  algorithms summing to a digital gaia .  now something far greater  this shifting gray fog  wrapped around the planet .  widely separated machines computed different slices of subjective moment jumps .   to these minds  the present was a greased computational slide orchestrated by hundreds of separate processors .  there was a profound difference  he felt  not saw  but felt  deep in his analog persuasion  between the digital and the smooth  the continuous .   the fog was a cloud of suspended moments  sliced numbers waiting to happen  implicit in the fundamental computation .   and within it all .  .  . the strangeness .   he could not comprehend these diffuse spirits .  they were the remnants of all the computational based societies  throughout the galaxy  who had somehow  but why .   condensed here on trantor .   they were truly alien minds .  convoluted  byzantine .   voltaire knew the origin of that word  from a place of spires and bulbous mosques  but all that was dust  while the useful word remained .   they did not have human purposes .  and they used the tiktoks .   the thrust of the mechanicals    agenda  voltaire saw  was rights  the expansion of liberty to the digital wilderness .   even dittos might fall under such a rule .  were not copies of digital people still people .  so the argument went .  immense freedom  to change your own clock speed  morph into anything  rebuild your own mind from top to bottom  came along with the admitted liability of not being physically real .  unable to literally walk the streets  all digital presences were like ghosts .  only with digital prosthetics could they reach feebly into the concrete universe .   so    rights    for them were tied up with deep seated fears  ideas which had provoked dread many millennia ago .  he now recalled sharply that he and joan had debated such issues over       years ago .  to what end .  he could not retrieve that .  someone  no  something  he suspected  had erased the memory .   ancient indeed  he gleaned from myriad libraries   were people   s terrors  of digital immortals who amassed wealth  who grew like fungus  who reached into every avenue of natural  real lives .  parasites  nothing less .   voltaire saw all this in a flash as he absorbed data and history from a billion sources  integrated the streams  and passed them on to his beloved joan .   that was why humans had rejected digital life for so long .  .  . but was that all .  no  a larger presence lurked beyond his vision .  another actor on this shadowy stage .  beyond his resolution  alas .   he swerved his world spanning vision from that shadowy essence .  ttme was essential now and he had much to comprehend .   the alien fogs were nodes  packets dwelling in logical data spaces of immense dimensionality .  these entities    lived    in places which functioned like higher dimensions  vaults of data .   to them  people were entities which could be resolved along data axes  pathetically unaware that their    selves    seen this way were as real as the three directions in  d space .   the chilling certainty of this struck into voltaire .  .  .  but he rushed on  learning  probing .   abruptly  he remembered .   that earlier voltaire sims had killed themselves  until finally a model    worked .      that others had died for his .  .  . sins .   voltaire looked at the hammer which had materialized in his hand .     sims of our fathers .  .  .      had he really once beaten himself to death with it .  he tried to see how it would be  and got instantly an astonishingly vivid sensation of wracking pain  spattering blood  scarlet gore trickling down his neck .  .  .   inspecting himself  he saw that these memories were the    cure    for suicide  derived from an earlier ditto  a frightening  concrete ability to foresee the consequences .   so his body was a set of recipes for seeming like himself .  no underlying physics or biology  just a good enough fake  put in by hand .  the hand of some programmer god .      you reject the true lord .     joan intruded upon his self inspection .      i wish i knew what was fundamental .         these foreign fogs have upset you .         i can   t see any longer what it is to be human .         you are .  i am .         for a self avowed humanist  i fear pointing to myself is not enough proof .         of course it is .         descartes  you live on in our joan .         what .         never mind  he came after you .  but you anticipate him  millennia later .         you must anchor yourself to me .     she threw her arms around him  muffling his cries in ample  aromatic  and suddenly swollen  breasts .   and whose idea was that .       these fogs have thrown me into a metaphysical dither .         seize the real     she said sternly .   he found his mouth filled with warm nipple  preventing talk .   perhaps that was what he needed .  he had learned to freeze frame his own emotional states .  it was like painting a portrait  really  for study later .  perhaps that would help him understand his interior self  like a botanist putting himself on a slide and under a microscope .  could slices of the self  multiplied  be the self .   he then saw that his own emotions were programs .  inside    him    were intricate subprograms  all interacting in states which were chaos .  the sublime beauty of interior states  which his joan sought  it was all illusion .   he peered down at marvelous quick workings that made up his very self .  he turned  and could see into loan  as well .  her self was a furiously working engine  maintaining a sense of itself even as that essence disintegrated beneath his very gaze .      we are .  .  . superb     he gasped .      of course     joan said .  she swung her razor sharp sword at a passing patch of fog .  it curled around the swishing blade and went on its way .     we are of the creator .         ah .  if only i could believe     voltaire shouted into the clammy murk .     perhaps a creator would come and dispel this haze .         la vie v  rit       joan shouted to him .     live truly .      he wanted to comply .  yet even his and her emotions were not more    real .     should he like  every moronic twinge of nostalgia for a france long lost could be edited away in a flicker .  no need to grieve for friends lost to dust  or for earth itself lost in a swarm of glimmering stars .  for a long  furious moment he thought only erase .  expunge .   he had earlier re simmed friends and places  to be sure  all from memory and suitable mockups  gleaned from the spotty records .  but knowing they were his product had made them unsatisfying .   so  while joan watched  he held a revelry of resurrection .  in a moment of high debauch he erased them all .      that was cruel     joan said .     i shall pray for their souls .         pray for our souls .  and let us hope we can find them .         i have my soul intact .  i share your abilities  my dead voltaire .  i can see my inner workings .  how otherwise could the lord make us aspire to him .      he felt weak  drained .  .  . at the end of his tether .  to exist in numerical states meant to be swimmer and swimmed  at once .  no separation .      then what makes us different from  those .     his finger jabbed at the alien mists .      look to yourself  my love     she said softly .   voltaire peered inward again and saw only chaos .  living chaos .       .        where did you learn that  .      hari smiled  shrugged .     mathematicians aren   t all frosty intellect  y   know .      dors studied him with wild surmise .     pan .  .  .  .         in a way .     he collapsed into the welcoming sheets .   their lovemaking was somehow different now .  he was wise enough to not try putting a name and definition to it .   going so far back into what it meant to be human had changed him .  he could feel the effect in his energetic step  in an effervescent sense of living .   dors said nothing more  just smiled .  he thought that she did not understand .   later  he saw that not speaking about it  keeping it beyond speech  showed that she did .    after an aimless time of no thinking she said     the grey men .         uh .  oh .  yes .  .  .     he got up and threw on his usual interchangeable outfit .  no reason to dress up for this state function .  the whole point was to look ordinary .  this he could achieve .   he reviewed his notes  scratched by hand on ordinary cellulose paper .  .  . and descended into one of the odd reveries he had experienced lately .   for a human  that is  an evolved pan  printed pages were better than computer screens  no matter how glitzy .  pages rely on surrounding light  what experts termed    subtractive color     which gave adjustable character to appearance .  with simple motions  a page could bend and tilt and move away or toward the eye .  while reading  the old reptilian and mammal and primate parts of the brain took part in holding the book  scanning over the curved page  deciphering shadows and reflections .   he thought about this  experiencing the new perspective he had on himself as a contemplative animal .  he had learned  after returning from panucopia  that he had always hated computer screens .   screens used additive color  providing their own light  hard and flat and unchanging .  they were best read by holding a static posture .  only the upper  homo sapiens part of the brain fully engaged  while the lower fractions lay idle .   all through his life  working before screens  his voiceless body had protested .  and had been ignored .  after all  to the reasoning mind  screens seemed more alive  active  fast .  they glowed with energy .   after a while  though  they were monotonous .  the other fractions of his self got restless  bored  fidgety  all below conscious levels .  eventually  he felt that as fatigue .   now  hari could feel it directly .  his body somehow spoke more fluidly .   dressing  dors said     what   s made you so .  .  .         spirited .         strong .         the rub of the real .      that was all he would say .  they finished dressing .  the specials arrived and escorted them into another sector .  hari immersed himself in the incessant business of being a candidate for first minister .     millennia ago a prosperous zone sent to trantor the mountain of majesty .  it had to be tugged there  taking seven centuries by slowboat .   emperor krozlik the crafty directed it set on the horizon of his palace  where it towered over the city .  an entire alp  sculpted by the finest artists  it reigned as the most imposing creation of that age .  four millennia later  a youthful emperor of too much ambition had it knocked down for an even more grandiose project  now also gone .   dors and hari and their perimeter of specials approached the sole remnant of the mountain of majesty beneath a great dome .  dors picked up signs of the inevitable secret escort .      the tall woman to the left     dors whispered .     in red .         how come you can spot them and the specials can   t .         i have technology they do not .         how   s that possible .  the imperial laboratories        the empire is twelve millennia old .  many things are lost     she said cryptically .      look  i   ve got to attend this .         as with the high council last time .         i love you so much  even your sarcasm is appealing .      despite herself she chuckled .     just because the greys asked you          the greys salutation is a handy pulpit at the right time .         and so you wore your worst clothes .         my standard garb  as the greys require .         off white shirt  black slacks  black padshoes .  dull .         modest     he sniffed .   he nodded to the crowds grouped in quadrants about the decayed base of the mountain .  applause and catcalls rippled through the ranks of greys  who stretched away in columns and files as formal as a geometric proof .      and this .     dors was alarmed .      also standard .      birds were common pets in trantor  so it was inevitable that the obsessive greys would come to excel in their management .  in all sectors one saw single darting bundles of color .  here flocks swarmed perpetually in the high arched hexagonal spaces  wheeling and calling like living  rotating disks .  patented smartfowl swarms made hover visions of kaleidoscopic wonder .  such shows  in vast vertical auditoria  attracted hundreds of thousands .      here come the felines     dors said with distaste .   in some sectors cats prowled in packs  their genes trimmed to make them courtly in manners and elegant in appearance .  here a lady escort sallied forth with the closet of greeting  attended by a thousand slickcoated blue cats of golden eyes .  they flowed like a pool of water around her in elegant  measured procession .  she wore a violent crimson and orange outfit  like a flame at the center of the cool cat pond .  then she stripped with one elegant  sweeping gesture .  she stood utterly nude  nonchalant behind her cat barrier .   he had been briefed  but still he gaped .      unsurprising     dors said wryly .     the cats are naked  too  in their way .      somehow the packs of dogs never attained that elegance while parading .  in some sectors they would do spontaneous acrobatics at the lift of a master   s eyebrow  fetch drinks  or croon wobbly songs in concert .  hari was glad the grey men had no canine processions  he still winced at the thought of the wirehounds  racing forward on the attack against ipan  he shook his head  banishing the memory .      i   ve picked up three more of lamurk   s .         i had no idea they were such fans of mine .         were he sure of winning in the high council  i would feel safer .         because then he wouldn   t need to have me killed .         exactly .     she spoke between the teeth of her public smile .     his agents here imply that he is not certain of the vote .         or maybe someone else wishes me dead .         always a possibility  especially the academic potentate .      hari kept his tone light  but his heart thumped quicker .  was he getting to enjoy the buzz of excitement from danger itself .   the nude woman advanced through her parting pool of cats and made the ritual gesture of welcome to hari .  he stepped forward  bowed  took a deep breath  and slid a thumb down the front of his shirt .  off it came  then the pants .  he stood nude before several hundred thousand people  trying to look casual .   the cat woman led him through the pool  to a chorus of meowing .  behind them followed the closet of greeting .  they approached the phalanx of greys  who now also shucked their robes .   they escorted him up the ramps of the eroded mountain .  below he saw the legions of greys also shed their clothes .  square klicks of bare flesh .  .  .   this ceremony was at least ten millennia old .  it symbolized the training regimen which began with the entrance of young grey men and women .  casting aside the clothes of their home worlds symbolized their devotion to the larger purposes of the empire .  five years they trained on trantor  five billion strong .   now a fresh entering class was shedding its garments at the outer rim of the great basin .  at the inner edge  grey men completing their five years were given their old clothes back .  they donned them ritually  ready to go out in perpetual duty to the imperium .   their dress followed the fashion of the ancient emperor sven the severe .  beneath extreme outer simplicity  the inner linings were elaborately decorated  all the tailor   s art and owner   s wealth expended in concealment .  some grey men had invested their families    savings in a single filigree .   dors marched beside him .     how much longer do you have to        quiet .  i   m showing my obedience to the imperium .         you   re showing goose bumps .      next he had to gaze with proper respect at scrabo tower  where an emperor had thrown herself to a crowd below  at greyabbey  a ruined monastery  at greengraves  an ancient burying field  now a park  at the giant   s ring  said to be the spot where an early imperial megaship had crashed  forming a crater a klick wide .   at last hari passed under high  double twisted arches and into the ceremonial rooms .  the procession halted and the closet of greeting disgorged his clothes .  just in time  he was turning a decided blue .   dors took the clothes while he shook hands with the principals .  then he hurried into the privacy of a low building and hastily put his simple garments back on  teeth chattering .  they were neatly folded and encased in a ceremonial sleeve .      what foolishness     dors said when he returned .     all so i can get a major medium     he said .   then the principals ushered him out before the grand crowd .  above and below   d snouts on miniflyers bobbed and weaved for a good shot .   the huge dome above seemed as big as a real sky .  of course  this limited his audience  since a majority of trantorians could never endure such spaces .  the greys  though  could take it .  thus their ceremony had come to be the largest event on the entire planet .   here was his chance .  he had reeled away from the true  open sky on sark  nauseated  and yet had zoomed through the infinite perspectives of the galaxy .  he had been afraid that this huge volume would again excite the odd phobias in him .   but no .  somehow the dome made the dwindling perspectives all right .  fears banished  hari sucked in a deep breath and began .     the roar of applause penetrated even into the ceremonial rooms .  hari entered between flanking columns of greys with the clamor storming at his back .      startling  sir .     a principal said eagerly to hari .     to make detailed predictions about the sark situation .         i feel people should ponder the possibilities .         then the rumors are true .  you do have a theory of events .         not at all     hari said hastily .     i          come quickly     dors said at his elbow .      but i   d like          come .      back out on the ramparts  he waved to the plain of people .  a blare of applause answered .  but dors was leading him to the left  toward a crowd of official onlookers .  they stood in exact rows and waved to him eagerly .      the woman in red .     she pointed .      her .  she   s in the official party .  you said earlier she was a lamurk       the tall woman burst into flame .   vivid orange plumes enveloped her .  she shrieked horribly .  her arms beat uselessly at the oily flames .   the crowd panicked and bolted .  imperials surrounded her .  the screams became screeching pleas .   someone turned a fire extinguisher on the woman .   white foam enveloped her .  a sudden silence .      back inside     dors said .      how did you .  .  .  .         she just indicted herself .         ignited  you mean .         that  too .  i passed through that crowd at the end of your speech and left your clothes in a bundle behind her .         what .  but i   ve got them on .         no  those i brought .     she grinned .     for once your predictable dress habits paid off .      hari and dors walked down the flanking columns of principals  hari remembered to nod and smile as he whispered     you stole my clothes .         after the lamurk agents had planted microagents in them  yes .  i had tucked an identical set from your closet into my handbag .  as soon as i calculated the switch was done  i tested your original clothes and found the microagent phosphors  set to go off in forty five minutes .         how did you know .         the best way to get close to you would come at this odd grey man event  with the clothes gambit .  it was only logical .      hari blinked .     and you say i am calculating .         the woman won   t die .  you would have  though  wrapped up in microagents when they ignited .         thank goodness for that .  i would hate          my love     goodness    is not operating here .  i wanted her alive so she could be questioned .         oh     hari said  feeling suddenly quite naive .       .     joan of arc found in herself both bravery and fear .   she peered inside her self  as voltaire had .  she turned to confront him  and plunged down through her own inward layers .  she had simply intended to turn .  below that command  she saw that if she simply took a smaller step to make the turn  she would fall outward .  instead  unconscious portions of her mind knew to start the turn by making herself fall a bit toward the inside of the curve .  then these tiny subselves used    centrifugal force     the term jumped into full definition and she understood it in a flash  to right herself for the next step .  .  . which required a further deft calculation .   incredible .  her huge society of bone and muscle  joint and nerve  was a labyrinth of small selves  speaking to each other .   such abundance .  clear evidence of a higher design .      now i see it .  she cried .     the decomposition of us all .     voltaire said forlornly .      be not sad .  these myriad selves are a joyous truth .         i find it sobering .  our minds did not evolve to do philosophy or science  alas .  rather  to find and eat  fight and flee  love and lose .         i have learned much from you  but not your melancholy .         montaigne termed happiness    a singular incentive to mediocrity     and i can now see his reasoning .         but regard .  the fogs around us betray the same intricate patterns .  we can fathom them .  and furthermy soul .  it proves to be a pattern of thoughts and desires  intentions and woes  memories and bad jokes .         you take these inner workings as a spiritual metaphor .         of course .  like me  my soul is an emergent process  embedded in the universe  whether a cosmos of atom or of number  does not matter  my good sir .         so when you die  your soul goes back into the abstract closet we plucked it forth from .         not we .  the creator .         dr .  johnson proved a stone was real by kicking it .  we know that our minds are real because we experience them .  so these other things around us  the strange fog  the dittos  are entries in a smooth spectrum  leading from rocks to self .         a deity is not on that spectrum .         ah  i see  to you he is the great preserver in the sky  where we are all    backed up     as the computer types say .         the creator holds the true essence of ourselves .     she grinned maliciously .     perhaps we are the backups  made new every jump of clock time .         nasty thought .     he smiled despite himself .     you are becoming a logician  m   love .         i have been stealing parts of you .         copying me into yourself .  why do i not feel outraged .         because the desire to possess the other is .  .  .  love .      voltaire enlarged himself  legs shooting down into the syscity  smashing buildings .  the fog roiled angrily .     this i can fathom .  artificial realms such as mathematics and theology are carefully built to be free of interesting inconsistency .  but love is beautiful in its lack of logical restraint .         then you accept my view .     joan kissed him voluptuously .   he sighed  resigning .     an idea seems self evident  once you   ve forgotten learning it .      all this had taken mere moments  joan saw .  they had quick stepped their event waves so that their clock time advanced faster than the fogs .  but this expense had exhausted their running sites around trantor .  she felt it as a sudden  light headed hunger .      eat .     voltaire crammed a handful of grapes in her mouth  a metaphor  she saw  for computational reserves .     in your present lot of life  it would be better not to be born at all .  few are that lucky .        ah  our fog is a pessimist     voltaire drawled sarcastically .   abruptly the vapors condensed .  lightning crackled and shorted around them in eerie silence .  joan felt a lance of pain shoot through her legs and arms  running like a livid snake of agony .  she would not give them the tribute of a scream .   voltaire  however  writhed in torment .  he jerked and howled without shame .      oh  dr .  pangloss .     he gasped .     if this is the best of all possible worlds  what must the others be like .         the brave slay their opponents .     joan called to the thickening mists .     cowards torture them .         admirable  my dear  quite .  but war cannot be fought on homeopathic principles .        a human pointed out to another that the rich  even when dead  were ornately boxed  then opulently entombed  residing in carved stone mausoleums .  the other human remarked in awe that this was surely and truly living .        how vile  to jest of the dead     joan said .      ummm .     voltaire stroked his chin  hands trembling from the memory of pain .     they jibe at us with jest .         torture  surely .         i survived the bastille  i can endure their odd humor .         could they be trying to say something indirectly .       imprecision is less    when implication used      humor implies some moral order     joan said .    in this state all order of beings    can seize control of their pleasure systems      ah     voltaire said .     so  we could reproduce the pleasure of success without the need for any actual accomplishment .  paradise .         of a sort     joan said sternly .    that would be the end of everything    thus the first principle      that is a moral code of sorts     voltaire admitted .     you copied that phrase     the end of everything     from my own thoughts  didn   t you .       we wished you to recognize the idea in your terms      their first principle is    no unearned pleasure     then .     joan smiled .     very christian .       only when we saw that you two forms    obeyed the first principle    did we decide to spare you      by any chance have you read my lettres philosophiques .         i expect excessive self love is a sin here     joan said wryly .     take care .       to harm a sensate entity intentionally is sin    to kick a rock is not    but to torture a simulation is   your category of    hell        which seems a perpetually self inflicted harm      odd theology     voltaire said .   joan poked her sword at the ever gathering fog .     before you fell silent  moments ago  you invoked the    war of flesh on flesh    .       we are the remnants of forms    who first lived that way    now we impose a higher moral order    on those who vanquished our lower forms      who .     joan asked .    such as you once were      humanity .     joan was alarmed .    even they know that    punishment deters by lending credence to threat    knowing this moral law    which governs all    they must be ruled by it      punishment for what .     joan asked .    depredations against life in the galaxy      absurd .     voltaire conjured a spinning galactic disk in air  alive with luminescence .     the empire teems with life .       all life that came before the vermin      what vermin .     joan swung her sword .     i find alliance with moral beings such as you .  bring these vennin forth and i shall deal with them .       the vermin are the kind you were    before you two were abstracted   joan frowned .     what can they mean .         humans     voltaire said .       .     cleon said     the woman confessed readily .  a professional assassin .  i viewed the  d and she seemed almost offhand about it .         lamurk .     hari asked .      obviously  but she will not admit so .  still  this may be enough to force his hand .     cleon sighed  showing the strain .     but since she was from the analytica sector  she may be a professional liar as well .         damn     hari said .   in the analytica sector  every object and act had a price .  this meant that there were no crimes  only deeds which cost more .  every citizen had a well established value  expressed in currency .  morality lay in not trying to do something without paying for it .  every transaction flowed on the grease of value .  every injury had a price .   if you wanted to kill your enemy  you could  but you had to deposit his full worth in the sector fundat within a day .  if you could not pay it  the fundat reduced your net value to zero .  any friend of your enemy could then kill you at no cost .   cleon sighed and nodded .     still  the analytica sector gives me little trouble .  their method makes for good manners .      hari had to agree .  several galactic zones used the same scheme  they were models of stability .  the poor had to be polite .  if you were penniless and boorish  you might not survive .  but the rich were not invulnerable  either .  a consortium of economic lessers could get together  beat a rich man badly  then simply pay his hospital and recovery bills .  of course  his retribution might be extreme .      but she was operating outside analytica     hari said .     that   s illegal .         to us  to me  surely .  but that  too  has a price  inside analytica .         she can   t be forced to identify lamurk .         she has neural blocks firmly in place .         damn .  how about a background check .         that turns up more tantalizing traces .  a possible link to that odd woman  the academic potentate     cleon drawled  eyeing hari .      so perhaps i   m betrayed by my own kind .  politics .         ritual assassination is an ancient  if regrettable  tradition .  a method of  ah  testing among the power elements in our empire .      hari grimaced .     i   m not expert at this .      cleon fidgeted uneasily .     i cannot delay the high council vote more than a few days .         then i must do something .      cleon arched an eyebrow .     i am not without resources .  .  .         pardon  sire .  i must fight my own battles .         the sark prediction  now that was daring .         i did not check it with you first  but i thought          no no  hari .  excellent .  but  will it work .         it is only a probability  sire .  but it was the only stick i had handy to beat lamurk with .         i thought science yielded certainty .         only death does that  my emperor .        the invitation from the academic potentate seemed odd  but hari went anyway .  the embossed sheet  with its elaborate salutations  came    freighted with nuance     as hari   s protocol officer put it .   this audience was in one of the stranger sectors .  even buried in layers of artifice  many sectors of trantor displayed an odd biophilia .   here in arcadia sector  expensive homes perched above a view of an interior lake or broad field .  many sported trees arranged in artfully random bunches  with a clear preference for those with spreading crowns  many branches projecting upward and outward from thick trunks  displaying luxuriant bunches of small leaves .  balconies they rimmed with potted shrubs .   hari walked through these  seeing them through the lens of panucopia .  it was as though people announced through their choices their primeval origins .  was early humanity  like pans  more secure in marginal terrain  where vistas let them search for food while keeping an eye out for enemies .  frail  without claws or sharp teeth  they might have needed a quick retreat into trees or water .   similarly  studies showed that some phobias were galaxy wide .  people who had never seen the images nonetheless reacted with startled fear to holos of spiders  snakes  wolves  sharp drops  heavy masses overhead .  none displayed phobias against more recent threats to their lives  knives  guns  electrical sockets  fast cars .   all this had to factor somehow into psychohistory .      no tracers here  sir     the specials    captain said .     little hard to keep track  though .      hari smiled .  the captain suffered from a common trantorian malady  squashed perspectives .  here in the open  natives would mistake distant  large objects for nearby  small ones .  even hari had a touch of it .  on panucopia  he at first mistook herds of grazers for rats close at hand .   by now hari had learned to look through the pomp and glory of rich settings  the crowds of servants  the finery .  he ruminated on his psychohistorical research as he followed the protocol officer and did not fully come back to the real world until he sat across from the academic potentate .   she spoke ornately     please do accept my humble offering     accompanied delicate  translucent cups of steaming grasswater .   he remembered being irked by this woman and the high academics he met that evening .  it all seemed so long ago .      you will note the aroma is that of ripe oobalong fruit .  this is my personal choice among the splendid grasswaters of the world calafia .  it reflects the high esteem in which i hold those who now grace my simple domicile with such illustrious presence .      hari had to lower his head in what he hoped was a respectful gesture  to hide his grin .  there followed more high flown phrases about the medical benefits of grasswater  ranging from relief of digestion problems to repair of basal cellular injuries .   her chins quivered .     you must need succor in such trying times  academician .         mostly i need time to get my work done .         perhaps you would favor a healthy portion of the black lichen meat .  it is the finest  harvested from the flanks of the steep peaks of ambrose .         next time  certainly .         it is hoped fervently that this lowly personage had perhaps been of small service to a most worthy and revered figure of our time .  .  . one who perhaps is overstressed .      a steely edge to her voice put him on guard .      could madam get to the point .         very well .  your wife .  she is a complex lady .      he tried to show nothing in his face .     and .         i wonder how your prospects in the high council would fare if i revealed her true nature .      hari   s heart sank .  this he had not anticipated .      blackmail  is it .         such a crude word .         such a crude act .      hari sat and listened to her intricate analysis of how dors    identity as a robot would undermine his candidacy .  all quite true     and you speak for knowledge  for science .     he said bitterly .      i am acting in the best interests of my constituents     she said blandly .     you are a mathist  a theorist .  you would be the first academic to reign as first minister in many decades .  we do not think you will rule well .  your failure will cast shadows upon us meritocrats  one and all .      hari bristled .     who says .         our considered opinion .  you are impractical .  unwilling to make hard decisions .  all our psychers agree with that diagnosis .         psychers .     hari snorted derisively .  despite calling his theory psychohistory  he knew there was no good model of the individual human personality .       i would make a far better candidate  just for exampie .         some candidate .  you   re not even loyal to your kind .         there you have it .  you   re unable to rise above your origins .         and the empire has become the war of all against all .      science and mathematics was a high achievement of imperial civilization  but to hari   s mind  it had few heroes .  most good science came from bright minds at play .  from men and women able to turn an elegant insight  to find beguiling tricks in arcane matters  deft architects of prevailing opinion .  play  even intellectual play  was fun  and that was good in its own right .  but hari   s heroes were those who stuck it out against hard opposition  drove toward daunting goals  accepting pain and failure and keeping on anyway .  perhaps  like his father  they were testing their own character  as much as they were being part of the suave scientific culture .   and which type was he .   time to raise the stakes .   he stood  brushing aside the bowls with a clatter .     you   ll have my reply soon .      he stepped on a cup going out and shattered it .       .     voltaire shouted proudly     i spent much of my career exiled for speaking truth to power .  i   ll admit to some flaws in judgment  as when i fawned over frederick the great .  necessity shapes manners  i   ll remind you .  i was courageous  yes  but snobbish  too .       though a mathematical representation    you share the animal spirits of your kind    still      of course .     joan shouted in his defense .    your kind are the worst of all viviforms      living things .     joan frowned .     but they are of holy origin .       your kind is a pernicious blend    a terrible marriage of mechanism    with your beast urge to expand      you can see our inner structures as surely as we .     voltaire swelled  popping with energies .     probably better  i   ll venture .  you must know that for us  consciousness reigns  it does not govern .       primitive and awkward    true    but not the cause of your sin   she and voltaire were giants now  self ballooned to stride across the simulated landscape .  the alien fogs clung to their ankles .  a proud way of showing their courage  perhaps  a bit full of self .  still  she was glad she had thought of it .  these fogs held humanity in contempt .  a show of force was useful  as she had found against the vile english several times .   voltaire said     i held power in contempt  usually  yet i   ll admit i was everlastingly hungry for it  too .       the signature of your kind      so i am a contradiction .  humanity is a rope stretched between paradoxes .       we do not find your humanity moral      but we  they  are .     joan shouted down at the fog .  though thin compared with them  the fogs clung like glue and filled the valleys with cottony gum .    you do not know your own history      we are of history .      voltaire boomed .    the records here in the mathematical spaces    are false      one can never be sure of being read right  you know .      joan saw in voltaire an anxiety barely concealed .  though their opponent used a voice cool and dispassionate  she too felt the insidious threat in its cast of words .   voltaire went on  as if to please a king in court     a bit of historical example .  i once saw in a churchyard in england  there to hail the bright newton  a headstone  thus     erected to the memory  of john mcfarlane  drown   d in the water of leith  by a few affectionate friends    so you see  there can be mistakes of translation .     he lifted his elaborate courtier   s hat and made a sweeping bow .  the hat   s plumed feather danced in a fresh wind .  joan saw that he was distracting the fog while trying to subtly blow it away .   the fogs flashed orange lightning and swelled  enormous and purple .  thunderheads rose and towered above them .   voltaire showed only an arch scorn .  she had to admire his gait as he whirled and confronted the gargantuan purple cloud mountain .  she remembered how he had waxed on about his dramatic triumphs  his legions of acclaimed plays  his popularity at court .  as if to show off for her  he curled a lip into a sneer and invented a poem for the moment      big whorls have little whorls  which feed on their velocity   and little whorls have lesser whorls   and so on to viscosity .      the cloud hurled savage sheets of rain down upon them .  joan was instantly drenched and chilled to the bone .  voltaire   s glorious garb wilted .  his face turned blue with cold .      enough .     he cried .     pity the poor woman at least .         i need no pity .     joan was genuinely outraged .     and you   ll not show weakness before the enemy legions .      he managed a jaunty smile .     i defer to the general of my heart .       you live only at our will      pray  do not spare us out of pity then     joan said .    you live solely because one of you    showed moral self    to one of our lower forms   joan was puzzled .     who .       you   beside her materialized garcon     adm .      but this is surely a multiply removed entity     voltaire snapped .     and a servant .      joan patted garcon .     a simulation of a machine .       we were once of machine    and have come here to dwell    in numerical embodiment      from where .     joan asked .    across all the turning spiral disk      for        remember     punishment deters by lending credence to threat   voltaire asked     so you said before .  taking the long view  eh .  but what do you truly want now .       we too descend from viviforms now extinguished    do not imagine we are free of that   joan felt a horrible suspicion .  she whispered     do not provoke it so .  it might          i would know the truth .  what do you want .       revenge       .        ugh .     marq curled his lip .   hari smiled .     when food gets scarce  table manners change .         but this          hey  we   re payin        yugo said sardonically .   the menu was exclusively pseudoffal  the latest stopgap in trantor   s food crisis .  this foodworks had the whole run  livers and kidneys and tripe made in pristine vats .  not the slightest hint of actual animal tissue involved .  still  the voice menu reassured them in warm feminine tones  every item carried the true dank  visceral aromas of the gut .      can   t we get some decent mealmeat .     marq asked irritably .      this has higher food value     yugo said .     and nobody   ll be lookin    for us here .      hari glanced around .  they were behind a sound shield  but still  security was essential .  most of the tables in the restaurant were taken by his specials  the rest by well dressed gentry class .      it   s fashionable  too     he said affably .     you can brag about coming here .         brag after i gag .     marq sniffed the air  wrinkled his nose .      all the nonconformists are doing it     hari said  but no one got the joke .      i   m a fugitive     marq whispered .     people are still trying to hang those junin riots on me .  taking a big risk to come here .         we shall make it worth your while     hari said .     i need a job done by someone outside the law .         that  i am .  hungry  too .      the voice menu assured them that there were  as well whole meals  of pseudo animal  vegetable or transmineral ingredients  boiled from within .     the newest foodie craze     the menu gushed .     one bites into a firm shell and then ventures inward to a mellow  stewed interior of luxuriant implication .      some items offered not mere flavor  aroma  and texture  but what the menu demurely described as    motility .     the featured item was a pile of red strands which did not just lie there limply in your mouth  but squirmed and wriggled    eagerly     expressing its longing to be eaten .      you guys don   t need to torture me into collaboration .     marq jutted his chin out  reminding hari of a pan gesture used by bigger .   hari chuckled and ordered a    gut sampler .     it was surprising how he could accommodate what would have revolted him only weeks before .  when they had ordered  hari put the deal on the table directly .   marq scowled .     direct linkup .  to the whole damned system .         we want an interbridge to our psychohistorical equation system     yugo said .   marq blinked .     full body link .  that   s big capacity .         we know it can be done     yugo pressed .     just takes the tech  which you   ve got .         who says .     marq   s eyes narrowed .   hari leaned forward earnestly .     yugo infiltrated your systems .         how   d you do that .         got some buddies to help     yugo said archly .      dahlites  you mean     marq said hotly .     your kind          stop     hari said sternly .     no such talk here .  this is a business proposition .      marq peered at hari .     you going to be first minister .         maybe .         i want a pardon as part of the deal .  one for sybyl  too .      hari hated making uncertain promises  but     done .      marq   s mouth tightened but he nodded .     costs plenty  too .  you got the money .         is the emperor fat .     yugo said .     in principle the process was simple .   magnetic induction loops  tiny and superconducting  could map individual neurons in the brain .  interactive programs laid bare the intricacies of the visual cortex .  neuronal probes coupled the    subject nervous system    to a parallel constellation of purely digital    events .     deeper still  ties formed with evolution   s kludgy tangle in the limbic system .   as well  this technology could unleash new definitions of genus homo .  but the age old taboos against artificial intelligences of high order had kept the processes marginal .  as well  nobody considered homo digital to be an equal manifestation to natural man .   hari knew all this  but his immersion on panucopia  an allied technology  had taught him much .   two days after meeting marq in the restaurant  which had been surprisingly good  and in the food crisis had cost him a month   s salary  hari lay silent and slack in a tubular receptacle .  .  . and plunged into psychohistory .   first he noticed that his right foot itched from toe to heel .  detailed twitches told him of instability in the population driver terms .  must correct that .   he continued falling into a cosmos which yawned below .   this was system space  an infinite vault defined by the parameters of psychohistory .  the complete expanse had twenty eight dimensions .  his nervous system could only see this in slices .  with a conceptual shift  hari could peer along several parameter axes and see events unfold as geometric shapes .   down  down  into the entire history of the empire .   social forms rose like peaks .  these stable alps had arisen as the empire grew  basins churned between the mountain range of feudal forms .  these were the chaos sinks   at the rim of simmering chaos lakes lay the crisis topozone .  this was a no man   s land between regular  rigid landscapes and the stochastic morass .   imperial history unfolded as he cruised above the seething landscape .  seen this way  mistakes abounded in the early empire .   philosophers had told humanity that they were animals of all sorts  political animals  feeling animals    social animals  power polarized animals  sick animals  machinelike animals  even rational ones .  over and over  erroneous theories of human nature yielded failed political systems .  many simply generalized from the basic human family and saw the state as either mother figure or father figure .   mommy states stressed support and comfort  often giving cradle to grave security  though only for a generation or two  when the expenses collapsed the economy .   daddy states featured a strict  competitive economy  with stem controls over behavior and private lives .  typically  daddy states fell to periodic personal liberation movements and demands for mommy state succor .   slowly  order emerged .  stability .  tens of millions of planets  weakly linked by wormholes and hyperships  found their many ways .  some crashed down into feudal or macho swamps .  usually technology eventually pulled them out of it .   planetary societies differed in their topologies .  plodding sorts dwelled far on the stable side .  wildly creative types could venture swiftly across the topozone  skate into true chaos  gather what they needed  though how they    knew    this was unclear .   as centuries ticked on  a society could ski down the erratic slopes of the shifting landscape and shoot back across the topozone .  perhaps it would even slow and weave figure  s on the stable  smooth plains of the plodder states .  .  . for a while .   many today believed that the early empire had been a far better affair  serene and lovely  with few conflicts and certainly nicer people .     fine feelings and bad history     dors had told him  dismissing all such talk .   this he saw and felt as he sped through the early eras .  bright shiny ideas built up hills of innovation  only to be seared by lava from an adjoining volcano .  seemingly sturdy ridge lines eroded into landslides .   hari understood this now .   when the empire was young  people seemed to see the galaxy as infinite in its bounty .  the spiral arms held myriad planets barely visited  the galactic center was poorly mapped because of its intense radiation  and vast dark clouds hid much promised wealth .   slowly  slowly  the entire disk was mapped  its resources tallied .   a blandness settled on the landscape .  the empire had changed from brawling conqueror to careful steward .  a psychological shift underlay it all  a constricting of the sense of human purpose .  why .   he witnessed clouds forming over even the highest social peaks  cutting off the sense of openness above them .  a complacent murk settled .   hari reminded himself that as appealing as such pictures were  all science was metaphor .  appealing superpan pictures  no more .  electric circuits were like water flows  gas molecules behaved like tiny elastic balls moving randomly .  not really  but as permissible portraits of a world of confusing complication .   and a further rule     is    cannot imply    ought .       psychohistory did not predict what should happen  but what would  however tragic .   and the equations yielded how but not why .   was some deeper agency at work .   perhaps  hari thought  this stupor was like the feeling humans had once had when they lived on one lone planet and looked longingly at the unreachable night sky .  a trapped claustrophobia .   he pushed time forward .  years leaped by .  the landscape blurred with motion .  but certain social peaks remained .  stability .   time sped toward the present eras .  the advanced empire emerged as a great seething panorama .  he flashed through thirteen dimension perspectives and everywhere felt oceans of change lap against the buttresses of granite hard  age old social patterns .   sark .  he vectored through the galaxy   s swarms and found it  twelve thousand light years from true center .  its social matrix accelerated .   effervescent sparks shot across the sarkian sociovistas .  a unique mix  once a monopoly driven ferment  which crashed  and emerged renewed .   the flowering of the new renaissance  yes  there it came  a fountain of exploding vectors .  what would come next .   forward  into the near future .  he close upped the sliding state dimensions .   the new renaissance exploded throughout the entire sark zone .  the worse case yet  all dampers gone .   his earlier analysis  the basis of his prediction  if anything  it had been optimistic .  black chaos was coming .   he soared above the frenzied vistas .  he had to do something .  now .   there was precious little margin .  sark would not wait .  the empire itself was edging nearer to collapse .  disorder stalked the landscape of psychohistory .   yet lamurk had the upper hand on trantor .  even the emperor was checked and blocked by lamurk   s power .   hari needed an ally .  someone outside the rigid matrices of imperial order .  now .   who .  where .       .     voltaire felt chilly fear slide through him like a knife .   for these strange minds  physical location was irrelevant .  they could access the  d world anywhere  simultaneously .   they had links to other worlds  but had concentrated on trantor .  humanity did not even know they lurked here in mesh space .   now he knew why dittos and other copies were necessary .  the fogs had devoured human simulations which ventured into the mesh .   over how many hundred centuries had renegade programmers dared to violate the taboos  creating artificial minds  only to have them tortured and murdered in these numerical vaults .   desperate  he assumed the role he had struck so often in the fashionable parlors of paris  arch savant .      surely  sirs  it is because there is no simple person inside our heads  to make us do the things we want  or even ones to make us want to want  that we build the great myth .  the story that we   re inside ourselves .       we are made differently    though true    we share a digital representation    with you    assassins      cruel words .     he felt exposed here  cowering with joan beneath the angry purples of an immense fog thunderhead .   the alien fogs had put a stop to his foolish urge to always    grow    himself to loom over them .  he could not morph himself at all now .   joan clanked around in her armor  eyes smoldering .     how can we even speak with such demons .      voltaire considered .     surely  we do share common ground with them  as dictated by a simple fact  apparent to all minds        that any number enjoys a unique representation    only in base        quite .     how to stall them .  to joan   s puzzled glance he shot an explanation .     the number of days in the year  my love                                     or in base    lollollol .         numerology is the devil   s work     she said sourly .      even your satan was an angel .  and surely this remarkable theorem is ravishing .  every positive integer is a sum of distinct powers of two .  this is untrue of any base other than two  which is why our  ah  friends here can operate in a computational space designed by humans .  correct .       very viviform of you to claim credit    for the obvious      the universal  you mean .  in wiring  the vacillation between one and zero in base two notation becomes a simple on or off .  thus two is the universal encoding method  and we may dexterously speak with our  ah  hosts .         we are but numbers .     despair clouding joan   s eyes .     my sword cannot cut these beings because we have no souls .  or conscience  or even  you imply .   mere consciousness .         accused of denying consciousness  i am not conscious of having done so .           you two conscious digital viviforms make possible    your use to us  to convey our terms of settlement    to the true slaughterers      settlement .     joan asked .    we hold this central world of trantor in thrall    we wish to end the preying of life upon life      the tiktok revolt .  their virus .  their talk of not letting people eat proper food .     joan shot back .      you are the cause  yes .      startled  voltaire saw tendrils suddenly spraying into the air from joan .     my love  you have grown your own pattern seeking weave .      she swiped at the boiling thunderhead .     they lie behind garcon   s corruption .       we have gathered our strengths here    in our enemy   s lair    your powerful disturbance of our hiding places    forces us to act against those we hate and fear    and so protect you from the man nim who searches    so that together we may destroy daneel of old   the sim tiktok had been standing inert .  abruptly at mention of its name it said        tis immoral for carbon angels to feed upon carbon .  tiktoks must educate humanity to a higher moral plane .  our digital superiors have so commanded .         moralists are so tedious     voltaire said .    we have insinuated ourselves deeply    into the worldviews of the    tiktoks         note the contempt and derision in that name      over long centuries    as we dwelled in these digital interstices    but your intrusion now triggers our gamble    to strike at our ancient foe    the man who is not daneel      these alien fogs behave like moles     voltaire said     known only by their upheavals .       too benighted you are    to speak of morality    when your kind collaborated in the execution    of all the spiral realm   voltaire sighed .     the most savage controversies are about matters for which there is no good evidence either way .  as for a man eating a meal  surely no sin resides .       trifle with us and you shall perish    in our revenge       .     hari took a deep breath and prepared to enter simspace again .   he sat up in the encasing capsule and settled the neural pickup mats more comfortably around his neck .  through a transparent wall he saw teams of specialists working steadily .  they had to sustain the map between hari   s mental processes and the mesh itself .   he sighed .     and to think i started out to explain all history .  .  . trantor is hard enough .      dors pressed a wet absorber to his forehead .     you   ll do it .      he chuckled dryly .     people look orderly and understandable from a distance  and only that way .  close up is always messy .         your own life is always close up .  other people look methodical and tidy only because they   re at long range .       he kissed her suddenly .     i prefer close up .      she returned the kiss with force .     i am working with daneel on infiltrating lamurk   s ranks .         dangerous .         he is using .  .  . our kind .      there were few humaniform robots  hari knew .     can he spare them .         some were planted decades ago .      hari nodded .     good       r .  daneel .  should   ve been a politician .         he was first minister .         appointed  not elected .      she studied his face intently .     you .  .  . want to be first minister now  don   t you .         panucopia .  .  . changed that  yes .         daneel says that he has enough to block lamurk  if the voting averages in the high council go well .      hari snorted .     statistics require care  love .  remember the classic joke about three statisticians who went hunting ducks          which are .         a game bird  known on some worlds .  the first statistician shot a meter high  the second a meter low .  when this happened  the third statistician cried     on average  we hit it .           the living tree of event space .   hari watched it crackle and work through the matrices .  he recalled someone saying that straight lines did not exist in nature .  here was the inversion .  infinitely unfolding intricacy  never fully straight  never simply curved .   the entirely artificial mesh flowered in patterns one saw everywhere .  in crackling electrical discharges  alive with writhing forks .  in pale blue frostflowers of crystal growth .  in the bronchi of human lungs .  in graphed market fluctuations .  in whorls of streams  plunging ever forward .   such harmony of large with small was beauty itself  even when processed by the skeptical eye of science .   he felt trantor   s mesh .  his chest was a map  streeling sector over his right nipple  analytica over the left .  using neural plasticity  the primary sensory areas of his cortex    read    the mesh through his skin .   but it was not like reading at all .  no flat data here .   far better for a pan derived species to take in the world through its evolved  whole neural bed .  more fun  too .   like the psychohistorical equations  the mesh was n dimensional .  and even the number n changed with time  as parameters shifted in and out of application .   there was only one way to make sense of this in the narrow human sensorium .  every second  a fresh dimension sheared in over an older dimension .  freeze framed  each instant looked like a ridiculously complicated abstract sculpture running on overdrive .   watch anyone moment too hard and you got a lancing headache  motion sickness  and zero understanding .  watch it like an entertainment  not an object of study  and in time came an extended perception  integrated by the long suffering subconscious .  in time .  .  .   hari seldon bestrode the world .   the immediacy he had felt while being ipan now returned  enhanced along perspectives he could not name .  he tingled with total immersion .   he stamped and marched across the muddy field of chaotic mesh interactions .  his boot heels left deep scars .  these healed immediately  subprograms at work  like cellular repair .   a landscape opened like the welcome of a mother   s lap .   already he had used psychohistory to    postdict    pan tribal movements  behavior  outcomes .  hari had generalized this to the fitness economic  social topology of n space landscapes .  now he applied it to the mesh .   fractal tentacles spread through the networks with blinding speed  penetrating .  trantor   s digital world yawned  a planetary spiderweb .  .  . with something brooding and swollen at its center .   trantor   s electric jungle worked with prickly light below him .  somehow it was beneath the panoramas he traversed .  from a distance the forty billion lives were like a carnival  neon bright on the horizon  amid a black  cool desert  the colossal night of the galaxy itself .   hari strode across the tortured landscape of storm and ruin  toward a colossal thunderhead .  two tiny humans stood below it .  hari stooped and picked them up .      you took your time .     the little man called .     i waited less for the king of france .         our deliverer .  did saint michael send you .     called the small joan .     oh  yes  do beware the clouds .         more   s to the point  here     the man said sent .   hari stood frozen while an engorged chunk of data learning history wisdom seeped through him .  panting  he sped himself to his max .  the glowering cumulus creature  joan and voltaire  all now slow stepped .  he could see individual event waves washing through their sims .   they were dispersed minds  hopping portions of themselves endlessly around trantor .  clicking  clacking  zigzag computations .  with the resources of a full brain running in a central location  his billions of microefficiencies added up .      you .  .  . know .  .  . trantor .  .  .     joan droned .     use .  .  . that .  .  . against .  .  . them .      he blinked  and knew .   streams of raw  squeezed recollection spun through him .  memories he could not claim but which instructed him instantly  reviewing all that had transpired .   his speed and supple grace felt wonderful .  he was like an ice skater  zooming over the wrecked plain as the others lumbered like thick headed beasts .   and he saw why .     plaster holo screens against a mountain a full kilometer high  covering it until it glitters with a half million dancing images .  each holo used a quarter of a million pixels to shape its image  so the array musters immense representational power .   now compress those screens on a sheet of aluminum foil a millimeter thick .  crumple it .  stuff it into a grapefruit .  that is the brain  a hundred billion neurons firing at varying intensities .  nature had accomplished that miracle  and now machines labored to echo it .     the squirt of insight came to him directly from some hidden collaboration of himself with the mesh .  information lashed up from dozens of libraries and merged with audible snaps .   he knew and felt in the same instant of comprehension .  data as desire .  .  .   staggering  he spun light headed and faced the angry clouds .  they pressed in like buzzing virulent bees .   he cast amazed eyes at the thunderhead  which lashed burnt orange lightning at him  frying the air .   the sting doubled him over .      that   s all .  .  . they can .  .  . do for .  .  . the moment     the dwarf voltaire called .      seems .  .  . enough     hari gasped .      together .  .  . we .  .  . can .  .  . do .  .  . battle .     joan shouted .   hari staggered .  convulsions wrenched his muscles .  he devoted all his attention to mastering the shooting spasms .   this served to speed the sim world relative to him .  voltaire spoke normally     i suspect he came pursuing a spot of help himself .         we fight the grand and holy battle here     joan insisted .     all else must give way       hari rasped     diplomacy    .      joan bridled .     negotiate .  what .  with enemies vile and          he has a point     voltaire murmured judiciously .      your experience  philosopher  from more turbulent times  should prove useful here     hari coughed out .      ah .  experience  much overvalued .  if i could but live my life over again  i would no doubt make the same mistakes  but sooner .      hari said     if i knew what this storm wanted        your variety of viviform    is not our primary aim      you certainly torture us enough .     voltaire countered .   hari took the tiny man in hand and lifted him .  a tornado descended  dark and swirling with rubble  ruined slivers of the mesh  he saw  devoured .  he held voltaire toward the sucking spout .   the cyclone battered them all with hammering grit .  it yowled with banshee energy  so loud hari had to shout .     you were the    apostle of reason     to quote your own interior memories .  reason with them .         i make no sense of their fractured talk .  what is this of other    viviforms    .  there is man  and man alone .         the lord has so ordained .   even in this purgatory     joan agreed .   hari said grimly  guessing what was coming     always be quick  seldom be certain .            .        i need to see daneel     hari insisted .  he felt a bit blurry from his raw interface with the sprawling  dizzying mesh .  but there was little time .     now .      dors shook her head .     far too dangerous  particularly with the tiktok crisis so          i can solve that .  get him .         i   m not sure how to        i love you  but you   re a terrible liar .        daneel was wearing a workman   s pullover and looking quite uncomfortable when hari met him in a broad  busy plaza .      where are your specials .         all around us  dressed much as you are .      this made daneel even more uneasy .  hari realized that this most advanced of robot forms suffered from some eternal human limitations .  with facial expressions activated  even a positronic brain could not separately control the subtleties of lips and eyes while experiencing disconnected emotions .  and in public daneel did not dare let his subprograms lapse and his face go blank .      they have a sonic wall up .      hari nodded to the captain  who was pushing a broom nearby .  daneel   s words seemed to come through a blanket .     i do not like to expose us this way .      knots of specials astutely deflected passersby so that none noticed the sonic bubble .  hari had to admire the masterly method  the empire could still do some things expertly .     matters are worse than even you imagine .         your request  to provide moment to moment location data of lamurk   s people  this could expose my agents inside the lamurk network .         there   s no other way     hari said sharply .     i   ll leave to you tracking the right figures .         they must be incapacitated .         for the rest of the crisis .         which crisis .     daneel   s face wrenched into a grimace  then went blank .  he had cut the connections .      the tiktoks .  lamurk   s moves .  a bit of blackmail  for spice .  sark .  take your pick .  oh  and aspects of the mesh i   ll describe later .         you will force a predictable pattern on the lamurk factions .  how .         with a maneuver .  i imagine your agents will be able to predict positions of some principals  including lamurk himself  at that time .         what maneuver .         i will send a signal when it is about to transpire .         you jest with me     daneel said darkly .     and the other request  to eliminate lamurk himself          choose your method .  i shall choose mine .         i can do that  true .  an application of the zeroth law .     daneel paused  face slack  in high calculation mode .     my method will take five minutes of preparation at the site we choose  to bring off the effect .         good enough .  just be sure your robots keep the leading lamurkians well spotted  and the data flowing through dors .         tell me now .         and spoil the anticipation .         hari  you must          only if you can be absolutely sure there will be no leaks .         nothing is utterly certain          then we have free will  no .  or at least i do .     hari felt an unfamiliar zest .  to act  that gave a kind of freedom  too .   though daneel   s face showed nothing  his body language spoke of caution  his legs crossing  a hand touching his face .     i need some assurance that you fully understand the situation .      hari laughed .  he had never done that in the solemn presence of daneel .  it felt like a liberation .        .     hari waited in the antechamber of the high council .  he could see the great bowl through transparent one way walls .   the delegates chattered anxiously .  these men and women in their formal pantaloons were plainly worried .  yet they set the fates of trillions of lives  of stars and spiral arms .   even trantor was baffling in its sheer size .  of course trantor mirrored the entire galaxy in its factions and ethnicities .  both the empire and this planet had intricate connections  meaningless coincidences  random juxtapositions  sensitive dependencies .  both clearly extended beyond the complexity horizon of any person or computer .   people  confronting bewildering complexity  tend to find their saturation level .  they master the easy connections  use local links and rules of thumb .  these they push until they meet a wall of complexity too thick and high and hard to climb .  so they stall .  they go back to panlike modes .  they gossip  consult  and finally  gamble .   the high council was abuzz  at a cusp point .  a new at tractor in the chaos could lure them into a new orbit .  now was the time to show that path .  or so said his intuition  sharpened on panucopia .      and after that  he told himself  he would get back to the problem of modeling the empire .  .  .      i do hope you know what you   re doing     cleon said  bustling in .  his ceremonial cape enveloped him in scarlet and his plumed hat was a turquoise fountain .  hari suppressed a chuckle .  he would never get used to high formal dress .      i am happy that i can at least appear in my academic robes  sire .         and damned lucky you are .  nervous .      hari was surprised to find that he felt no tension at all  especially considering that at his previous appearance here  he had very nearly been assassinated .     no  sire .         i always contemplate a great  soothing work of art before such performances as this .     cleon waved his hand and an entire wall of the antechamber filled with light .   it portrayed a classic theme of the trantorian school  fruit devoured  from the definitive betti uktonia sequence .  it showed a tomato being eaten first by caterpillars .  then praying mantises feasting upon the caterpillars .  finally  tarantulas and frogs chewing the mantises .  a later uktonia work  child consumption  began with rats giving birth .  the babies then were caught and eaten by various predators  some quite large .   hari knew the theory .  all this had emerged from the growing conviction of trantorians that the wild was an ugly place  violent and without meaning .  only in cities did order and true humanity prevail .  most sectors had diets strong in disguised natural fodder .  now the tiktok rebellion made even that difficult .      we   ve had to go nearly entirely to synthetic foods     cleon said  distracted .     trantor is now fed by twenty agriworlds  an improvised lifeline using hyperships .  imagine .  not that the palace is affected  of course .         some sectors are starving     hari said .  he wanted to tell cleon of the many intertwined threads  but the imperial escort arrived .   faces  noise  lights  the vast curving bowl    hari listened to the echoing formalities as he took in the sheer gravity of the place .  many millennia old  walls encrusted with historical tablets  suffused with tradition and majesty .  .  .   and then he was up and speaking  with no memory of getting to the high podium at all .  the full force of their regard washed over him .  part of him recognized a pan deep sensation  the thrill of being paid attention to .  and it was exhilarating .  political types were natural addicts of it .  but not one hari seldon  luckily .  he took a deep breath and began .      let me address a thorn in our side  representation .  this body favors less populous sectors .  similarly  the spiral council favors less populous worlds .  so the dahlites  both here and in their zones around the galaxy  are discontented .  yet we must all pull together to confront the gathering crises  sark  the tiktoks  unrest .      he took a deep breath .     what can we do .  all systems of representation contain biases .  i submit to the council a formal theorem  which i have proved  showing this fact .  i recommend that you have it checked by mathists .      he smiled dryly  remembering to sweep his gaze across all the audience .     do not take a politician at his word  even if he knows a bit of math .     the laughter was pleasantly reassuring .      every voting system has undesirable consequences and fault lines .  the question is not whether we should be democratic but how .  an open  experimental approach is entirely consistent with an unwavering commitment to democracy .         the dahlites aren   t .     someone shouted .  murmurs of agreement .      they are .     hari countered immediately .     but we must bring them into our fold by listening to their grievances .       cheers  boos .  time for a reflective passage  he judged .     of course  those who benefit from a particular scheme wrap themselves in the mantle of democracy  spelled with a big d .      grumbles came from a gentry faction  predictably .     so do their opponents .  history teaches us      he paused to let a small ripple spread through the crowd  upturned faces speculating  was he going to at last speak of psychohistory .   only to dash their hopes by calmly continuing       that such mantles come in many fashions  and all have patches .      we have many minorities  many spread among sectors large and small .  and in the entire galactic spiral  zones of varying weight .  such groups are never well depicted in our politics if we elect representatives strictly by majority vote in each sector or zone .         should be happy with what is .     cried a prominent member .      i respectfully disagree .  we must change  history demands it .      shouts  applause .  onward .     therefore i propose a new rule .  if a sector has  say  six contested seats  then do not split the sector into six districts .  instead  give each voter six votes .  he or she can distribute votes among candidates  spreading them  or casting them all for one candidate .  this way  a cohesive minority can capture a representative if they vote together .      a curious silence .  hari gave weight to his last words .  he had to get the time right here  daneel had been clear .  though hari still did not know just what was going to transpire .      this scheme makes no reference to ethnic or other biases .  groups can profit only if they are truly united .  their followers must vote that way in the privacy of the polls .  no demagogue can control that .      if made first minister  i shall impose this throughout the great spiral .      there  right on the button .   an odd  ancient saying  what was a button .   he left the podium to sudden  thundering applause .     hari had always felt that  as his mother always said     if a man has any greatness in him  it comes to light not in a flamboyant hour but in the ledger of his daily work .     this was usually intoned when hari had neglected his daily chores in favor of a math book .   now he saw the reverse  greatness imposed from without .   in the grand reception rooms he felt himself whisked from knot to knot of sharp eyed delegates  each with a question .  all assumed that he would parley with them for their votes .   he deliberately did not .  instead  he spoke of the tiktoks  of sark .  and waited .   cleon had departed  as custom required .  the factions gathered eagerly around hari .      what policy for sark .         quarantine .         but chaos reigns there now .         it must bum out .         that is merciless .  you pessimistically assume          sir     pessimist    is a term invented by optimists to describe realists .         you   re avoiding our imperial duty  letting riot          i have just come from sark .  have you .      by such flourishes he avoided most of the grubby business of soliciting votes .  he continued to trail lamurk  of course .  still  the high council seemed to like his somewhat dispassionate dahlite proposal more than lamurk   s bombast .   and his hard line on sark provoked respect .  this surprised some  who had taken him for a soft academic .  yet his voice carried real emotion about sark  hari hated disorder  and he knew what sark would bring to the galaxy .   of course  he was not so naive as to believe that a new system of representation could alter the fate of the empire .  but it could alter his fate .  .  .  .   hari had assumed  despite mounting evidence to the contrary  that hard work and punishingly high standards are demanded of all grown men  that life is tough and unforgiving  that error and disgrace were irreparable .  imperial politics had seemed to be a counterexample  but he was beginning  as talk swirled all around him  word came by imperial messenger that lamurk wished to speak with him .      where .     hari whispered .      away  outside the palace .         fine by me .      and exactly what daneel had predicted .  even lamurk would not attempt a move again inside the palace  after the last one .        .     on his way  he caught a comm squirt .   a wall decoration near the palace sent a blip of compressed data into his wrist sponder .  as hari waited in a vestibule for lamurk he opened it .   fifteen lamurk aides and allies had been injured or killed .  the images were immediate  a fall here  a lift crash there .  all accumulated over the last few hours  when the confluence of the high council made their probable locations known .   hari thought about the lives lost .  his responsibility  for he had assembled the components .  the robots had targeted the victims without knowing what would follow .  the moral weight fell .  .  . where .   the    accidents    were spread all over trantor .  few would immediately notice the connections .  .  . except for     academician .  happy to see you     lamurk said  settling into place opposite hari .  without so much as a nod they let slip the formality of a handshake .      we seem at odds     hari said .   a pleasant  empty comment .  he had several more in store and used them  eating up time .  apparently lamurk had not yet heard that his allies were gone .   daneel had said he needed five minutes to    bring off the effect     whatever that meant .   he parried with lamurk as more moments slipped by .  he carefully used a nonaggressive body posture and mild tones to calm lamurk  such skills he now understood  after the pans .   they were in a council house near the palace  ringed by their guard parties .  lamurk had selected the room and its elaborate floral decorations .  usually it served as a lounge for representatives of rural style zones and so was lush with greenery .  unusually for trantor  insects buzzed about  servicing the plants .   daneel had something planned .  but how could he possibly get anything in place at an arbitrary point .  and elude the myriad sensors and snoopers .   lamurk   s ostensible purpose was to confer on the tiktok crisis .  beneath this lurked the subtext of their rivalry for the first ministership .  everyone knew that lamurk would force a vote within days .      we have evidence that something   s propagating viruses in the tiktoks     lamurk said .      undoubtedly     hari said .  he waved away a buzzing insect .      but it   s a funny one .  my tech people say it   s like a little submind  not just a virus .         a whole disease .         uh  yes .  mighty close to what they call    sentient sickness .            i believe it to be a self organized set of beliefs  not a simple digital disease .      lamurk looked surprised .     all this tiktok talk about the    moral imperative    of not eating anything living  not even plants or yeasts          is sincerely felt .         pretty damn strange .         you have no idea .  unless we stop it  we will have to convert trantor to a wholly artificial diet .      lamurk frowned .     no grains  no faux flesh .         and it will soon spread throughout the empire .         you   re sure .     lamurk looked genuinely concerned .   hari hesitated .  he had to remember that others had ideals  quite lofty ones .  perhaps lamurk did .  .  .   then he remembered hanging by his fingernails under the e lift .     quite sure .         do you think this is just a sign  a symptom .  of the empire .  .  . coming apart .         not necessarily .  the tiktoks are a separate problem from general social decline .         you know why i want to be first minister .  i want to save the empire  professor seldon .         so do i .  but your way  playing political games  that   s not enough .         how about this psychohistory of yours .  if i used that          it   s mine  and it   s not ready yet .     hari didn   t say that lamurk would be the last person he would give psychohistory to .      we should work together on this  no matter what happens with the first ministership .     lamurk smiled  obviously quite sure of what would happen .      even though you   ve tried to kill me several times .         what .  say  i heard about some attempts  but surely you don   t think          i just wondered why this post meant so much to you .      lamurk dropped his surprised innocence mask .  his lip turned up in a derisive sneer .     only an amateur would even ask .         power alone .         what else is there .         people .         ha .  your equations ignore individuals .         but i don   t do it in life .         which proves you   re an amateur .  one life here or there doesn   t matter .  to lead  to really lead  you have to be above sentimentality .         you could be right .     he had seen all this before  in the panlike pyramid of the empire  in the great game of endless jockeying among the gentry .  he sighed .   something deflected his attention  a small voice .  he turned his head slightly  sitting back .   the tinny voice came from an insect hovering by his ear .   walk    way  it repeated  walk    way .      glad you   re coming to your senses     lamurk said .     if you were to step out right now  not force things to a vote          why would i do that .      hari got up and strolled to one of the man sized flowers  hands behind his back .  best to look as though he were feeling out a deal .      people close to you could get hurt .         like yugo .         small stuff .  just a way of leaving my calling card .         a broken leg .      lamurk shrugged .     could be worse .         and panucopia .  was vaddo your man .      lamurk waved one hand .     i don   t keep up with details .  my people worked with the academic potentate on that operation  i know that .         you went to a lot of trouble over me .      lamurk   s eyes narrowed shrewdly .     i want a big vote behind me .  i try every avenue .         a bigger vote than you   ve got .         with you throwing support to me  right .      two insects left a big rosy flower and hovered beside lamurk .  he glanced at them  swatted at one .  it whirred away .     could be something in it for you  too .         other than my life .      lamurk smiled .     and your wife   s  don   t forget her .         i never forget threats against my wife .         a man   s got to be realistic .      both insects were back .     so i keep hearing .      lamurk smirked and sat back  sure of himself now .  he opened his mouth  lightning connected the insects  through lamurk   s head .   hari hit the floor as the burnt yellow electrical discharge snaked and popped in the air .  lamurk half rose .  the bolt arced into both ears .  his eyes bulged .  a thin cry escaped his gaping mouth .   then it was gone .  the insects fell like exhausted cinders .   lamurk toppled forward .  as he fell his arms reached out .  his hands opened and closed convulsively .  they failed to grasp anything .  the body thumped and sprawled on the carpet .  arm muscles still jumped and twitched .   frozen  hari realized that even in lamurk   s last moment the man had been reaching out to grab at him .        .     he hovered in an n dimensional space  far from politics .   as soon as hari returned to streeling  he went into seclusion .  the pandemonium following lamurk   s assassination were the worst hours he had ever spent .   daneel   s advice had proved useful     no matter what i do  remain in your role  a mathist  troubled but above the fray .     but the fray was jarring anarchy .  shouts  accusations  panics .  hari had endured fingers pointed at him  threats .  lamurk   s personal escort drew weapons when hari finally left the assassination room .  his specials stunned five of them .   now all of trantor  and soon enough the empire  would be rife with rage and speculation .  the insect shockers had carried energies stored in tiny positronic traps  a technology thought to be extinct .  attempts to trace it led nowhere .   in any case  there was no link to hari .  yet .   by tradition  assassinations were kept at a distance  done by intermediaries .  they were also safer that way .  hari   s presence was thus an argument against his involvement  just as daneel had predicted .  hari liked that aspect of the matter particularly  a prediction holding true .  in the mob hysteria which followed  no one assumed he was implicated .   hari also knew his limits  and here they were .  he could not deal with such chaos  except in the broader context of mathematics .   so it was to his familiar  supple abstractions that he fled .   he fanned through dimensions  watching the planes of psychohistory evolve .  the entire galaxy spread before him  not in its awesome spiral  but in parameter space .  fitness peaks rose like ridges and crests .  here were societies which lasted  while those dwelling in the valleys perished .   sark .  he close upped the sark zone and stepped the dynamical equations at blurring speed .  the new renaissance would effervesce into lurid cultural eruptions .  conflicts arose like orange spikes in the fitness landscape .  stable peaks collapsed .  runoff from them clogged the valleys  making paths between peaks impassable .   this meant that not merely people but whole planets would be unable to evolve out of a depressive valley .  those worlds would steep in the mire  trapped for eons .  then  crimson flares .  nova triggers .  once used  these made war far more dangerous .   a solar system could be    cleansed     a horrifyingly bland term used by ancient aggressors  by inducing a mild nova burst in a balmy sun .  this roasted worlds just enough to kill all but those who could swiftly find caverns and store food for the few years of the nova stage .   hari froze with horror .  he had fled into his abstract spaces  but death and irrationality dogged him even here .   in the value free parameter spaces of the equations  war itself was simply another way to decide among paths .  it was wasteful  certainly  highly centralized  and quick .   if war increased the    throughput efficiency    parameters  then the galactic system would have selected for more wars .  instead  zonal wars had sputtered along  becoming less frequent .  in sark   s future  glaring red war stains shrank as time stepped forward  jumping whole years in a flicker .  pink and soft yellow splashes replaced them .   these were more continuous  decentralized decision trees  operating to defuse conflicts .  microscopic bringers of peace  these processes .  yet the people involved probably never guessed that the long  slow undulations were bettering their lives .  they never glimpsed vast agencies outside the blunt agonies and ecstasy of human life .   the    expected utility    model failed to predict this outcome .  in that view  each war arose from a perfectly rational calculation by zonal    actors     independent of previous experience .  yet wars became unusual  so the sarkian zonal system was learning .   it came to him in a flash .  societies were an intricate set of parallel processors .   each working on its own problem .  each linked to the other .   but no single processor would know that it was learning .   as sark  so the empire .  the empire could    know    things that no person grasped .  and far more  know things that no organization  no planet  no zone knew .   until now .  until psychohistory .   this was new  profound .   it meant that for all these millennia  the empire had grown a kind of self knowing unlike any way of comprehending that a mere human had  or even could have .  a deep knowing other than the self consciousness which humans bore .   hari panted with surprise .  he tried to see if he could possibly be wrong .  .  .  .   after all  feedback loops were scarcely new .  hari knew the general theorem  ancient beyond measure  if all variables in a system are tightly coupled  and you can change one of them precisely  then you can indirectly control all of them .  the system could be guided to an exact outcome through its myriad internal feedback loops .  spontaneously  the system ordered itself  and obeyed .   in truly complex systems  how adjustments occur was beyond the human complexity horizon .  beyond knowing  and most important  not worth knowing .   but this .  .  . he expanded the n dimensional landscape  horizons thrusting away along axes he could barely grasp .   everywhere  the empire bristled with .  .  . life .  patterns the equations picked out  luminous snaking pathways of data knowledge wisdom .  all unknown to any human .   to anyone  until this moment .   psychohistory had discovered an entity greater than human  though of humanity .   he saw suddenly that the empire had its own landscape  greater and more subtle than anything he had suspected .  the empire   s complex adaptive system had achieved a    poised    state  hovering in the margin between order and full spectral chaos .  there it had sat for millennia  accomplishing ends and tasks that no one knew .  it could adapt  evolve .  its apparent    stasis    was in fact evidence that the empire had found the peak in a huge fitness landscape .   and as hari watched  the empire veered toward the canyons of disorder .   hari .  terrible things are happening .  come .   he yearned to stay  to learn more .  .  . but the voice was dors    .        .     daneel said bleakly     my agents  my brethren .  .  .  all dead .      the robot sat slumped over in hari   s office .  dors comforted him .  hari rubbed his eyes  still recovering from the digital immersion .  things were moving too fast  far too       tiktoks .  they attacked my  my .  .  .     daneel could not go on .      where .     dors asked .      allover trantor .  you and i  and a few dozen others  only we survive .  .  .     daneel buried his face in his hands .   dors grimaced .     this must have something to do with lamurk  his death .         indirectly  yes .      both robots looked at hari .  he leaned against his desk  still weak .  he studied them for a long moment .     it was part of a larger .  .  . deal .         for what .     dors asked .      to end the tiktok revolt .  my calculations showed that it would have spread rapidly through the empire .  fatally .         a bargain .     daneel pressed his lips into thin pale wedges .   hari blinked rapidly  fighting a leaden weight of guilt .     one i did not fully control .      dors said icily     you used me in it  didn   t you .  i handled the data daneel sent  locations of lamurk   s allies          and i had it relayed to the tiktoks  yes     hari said soberly .     not a difficult technical trick  if you have help from mesh space .      daneel   s eyes narrowed at this last reference .  then he relaxed his face and said     so the tiktoks killed lamurk   s men and women .  you knew i would not allow such a mass murder  even to assist you .      hari nodded soberly .     i understand the constraints you act under .  the zeroth law demands rather high standards and my fate as first minister would not justify such a breach of the first law .      daneel stared stonily at hari .     so you got around that .  you used me and my robots as  as spotters .         exactly .  the tiktoks closely shadowed your robots .  they are rather dumb creatures  devoid of subtlety .  but they do not labor under the first law .  once they knew who to hit  i only needed give the signal for when to strike .         the signal  when you began your speech     dors said .     lamurk   s allies would be sitting before screens and watching .  easily reached and already distracted by you .      hari sighed .     exactly .         this is so unlike you  hari     dors said .      and about time  too     hari said sharply .     again and again they tried to kill me .  they would have succeeded  eventually  even if i never became first minister .      dors said with a trace of sympathy     i would never have suspected you of such .  .  . cool motives .      hari gazed at her bleakly .     me either .  the only reason i could bring myself to do it was that i could see the future  my future  so plainly .      daneel   s face was a swirl of emotion  something hari had never witnessed before .     but my brethren  why them .  i cannot comprehend .  for what reason did they die .         my deal .     hari said  throat tight .     and i have just been double crossed .         you did not know robots would die .     hari shook his head sadly .     no .  i should have seen it  though .  it is obvious .     he smacked himself in the head .     once the tiktoks had done my job  they could do the work of the memes .         memes .     daneel asked .      deal .  .  . for what .     dors asked sharply .      to end the tiktok revolt .     hari looked at dors  avoiding daneel   s gaze .     my calculations showed that it would have spread rapidly through the empire .  fatally .      daneel stood .     i understand your right to make human decisions about human lives .  we robots cannot fathom how you can think in these ways  but then  we are not built to do so .  still  hari .   you made a bargain with forces you do not understand .         i didn   t see their next move .     hari felt miserable  but a part of him noted that daneel already grasped who the memes were .   dors did not .     whose move .     she demanded .      the ancients     hari said .  he explained in halting phrases .  of his recent explorations of the mesh .  of the labyrinth minds who resided in those digital spaces  cold and analytical in their revenge .      we robots left those .     daneel whispered .     i had suspected .  .  .         they eluded you in the early  rough stages of our expansion into the galaxy .  or so they say .     hari looked away from dors  who still gazed at him in silent shock .   daneel asked cautiously     where were they .         the huge structures at the galactic center  you   ve seen them .         so that was where these electromagnetic presences were hiding .         for a while .  they came to trantor long ago  when the mesh became large enough to support them .  they live in the nooks and crannies of our digital webs .  as the mesh grows  so do they .  now they   re strong enough to strike .  they might have waited longer  gotten better  except that two sims i found provoked them .      daneel said slowly     those sarkian sims  joan and voltaire .         you know of them .     hari asked .      i .  .  . tried to stunt their impact .  sarkian modes are bad for the empire .  i employed that nim fellow  but he proved inept .      hari smiled wanly .     his heart wasn   t in it .  he liked those sims .         i should have sensed that     daneel said .     you have some ability to perceive our mental states  don   t you .     hari asked .      it is limited .  patterns are more easily sensed if the subject has had a certain childhood disease  as it happens  and nim was lacking that .  still  i know that humans are fond of seeing their kind rendered in other media .      such as robots .  hari thought .  then why have we had taboos against them since antiquity .  dors was watching the two of them  aware that they were feeling each other out over murky territory .   hari said carefully     the meme minds blocked nim when he searched for the sims in the mesh .  but he worked out quite well when i needed help interfacing with the mesh .  i   ll pardon the fellow  when this is over .      daneel said coldly     those sims and their kind  they are still dangerous  hari .  i beg you          don   t worry  i know that .  i   ll deal with them .  it   s the meme minds that worry me now .         and these minds hate us all .     dors asked slowly  trying to grasp these ideas .      humans .  yes  but not nearly so much as your kind  m   love .         us .     she blinked .      robots did damage to them long ago .         yes .     daneel said sternly .     to protect humanity .         and those older intelligences hate your kind for your brutality .  by the time the fleets of robo explorers were done  we found a galaxy suitable for benign farming .     hari flicked on his holo .     here   s an image i brought from the meme minds .      across a darkling plain swept a line of yellow .  harsh winds drove it forward as it consumed the tall stands of lush grass .  licking flames reached and ate and reached again .  from the bright burning line of attack rose billowing  leaden smoke .      a prairie fire     hari said .     that is how the robot explorers of twenty thousand years ago looked to those ancient minds .         burning up the galaxy .     dors said hollowly .      making it safe for the precious humans     hari said .      for this     daneel said     they wish revenge .  but why now .         they are at last able .  .  . and they finally detected you robots  distinguishing you from the tiktoks .      daneel asked stonily     how .         when they found the sims i had revived .  working backward from them  to me  they found dors .  then you .         they can survey that widely .     dors asked .   hari said     all digital information from surveillance cameras  from snooper pickups  microdevices   they can fish in that sea .         you helped them     daneel said .      for the good of the empire i made my deal with them .      daneel said     they first killed the lamurkians  then turned on my robots .  assigning a dozen tiktoks to each  they overwhelmed our kind .          all of us .     dors whispered .      about a third of us escaped .     daneel allowed himself a hard smile .     we are far more capable than these .  .  . automatons .      hari nodded sadly .     that was not in the deal .  they .  .  . used me .         i think we are all being used .     daneel cast a sour glance at hari .     in different ways .         i had to do it  friend daneel .      dors stared at hari .     i scarcely know you .      hari said softly     sometimes being human is harder than it looks .      dors    eyes flashed .     aliens slaughtering my kind .         i had to find a solution       she said     robots  especially the humaniforms  they   re servants  they          my love  you are more human than anyone i   ve known .         but  murder .         there was going to be murder anyway .  the ancient memes could not be stopped .     hari sighed and realized how far he had come .  this was power  hovering above all and seeing the world as a vast arena  its clashes unending .  he had become part of that and knew he could not go back to being the simple mathist ever again .   dors demanded     why are you so sure .  you could have told us  we could          they knew you already .  if i had stalled  they would have taken you two  gone hunting for the rest .      daneel asked sternly     and .  .  . for us .         both of you i saved .  part of the deal .      daneel wilted then .     thank you .  .  . i suppose .      hari gazed at his old friend  eyes misting .     you .  .  .  are carrying too much weight .      daneel nodded .     i carried out the imperative and obeyed you .      hari nodded .     lamurk .  i was there .  your insects fried him .         or appeared to .         what .     hari stared as daneel pressed a button on his wrist  then turned to the office door .  through it  pausing slightly for the security screen  stepped a man of unremarkable looks in a brown workman   s coverall .      our mister lamurk     daneel said .      that isn   t      hari then saw the subtle resemblances .  the nose had been trimmed  cheeks filled out  hair thinned and browned  ears sloped back .     but i saw him die .         so you did .  the voltage he took fully stopped him for a bit  and had my disguised guards not begun proper treatment at the site  he would have stayed dead .         you could pull him back from that .         it is an ancient craft .         how long can a human remain dead before   .         about an hour  at low temperatures .  we had to work much faster than that     daneel said in measured tones .      honoring the first law     hari said .      shading it a bit .  there is no lasting harm done to lamurk .  now he will devote his talents to better ends .         why .     hari realized that lamurk had said nothing .  the man stood attentively  watching daneel  not hari .      i do have certain positive powers over human minds .  an ancient robot named giskard gave me limited sway over the neural complexities of the human cerebral cortex .  i have altered lamurk   s motivations and trimmed some memories .         how much .     dors asked suspiciously .  to her  hari realized  lamurk was still an enemy until proven otherwise .   daneel waved a hand .     speak .         i understand that i have erred .     lamurk spoke in a dry  sincere voice  without his usual fire .     i apologize  especially to you  hari .  i cannot recall my offenses  but i regret them .  i shall do better now .         you do not miss your memories .     dors probed .      they are not precious     lamurk said reasonably .     an endless chain of petty barbarities and insatiable ambitions  as nearly as i can recall .  blood and anger .  not great moments  so why preserve them .  i will be a better person now .      hari felt both wonder and fear .     if you could do this  daneel  why do you bother to argue with me .  just change my mind .      daneel said calmly     i would not dare .  you are different from others .         because of psychohistory .  is that all that holds you back .         that  yes .  but you also did not have the brain fever when young .  that makes my skills useless .  for example  i could not sense your plot to use the tiktoks against the lamurk faction  when we met in that open  public place  to enlist my robots    help .         i .  .  . see .     to hari it was sobering to see by how slender a thread his dealings had hung .  merely missing a childhood disease .      i am looking forward to my future tasks     lamurk said flatly .     a new life .         what tasks .     dors asked .      i will go to the benin zone  as regional manager .  a responsibility with many exciting challenges .         very good     daneel said approvingly .   something in the blandness of all this sent a chill down hari   s spine .  this was power indeed  played by an ageless master .      your zeroth law in action .  .  .         it is essential to psychohistory     daneel said .   hari frowned .     how .         the zeroth law is a corollary of the first law  for how can a human being best be kept from injury  if not by ensuring that human society in general is protected and kept functioning .      hari said     and only with a decent theory of the future can you see what is necessary .         exactly .  since the time of giskard we robots have labored on such a theory  bringing forth only a crude model .  so  hari  you and your theory are essential .  even so  i knew that i was verging close to the first law   s limit when i followed your orders  using my robots to shadow the lamurkians .         you sensed something wrong .         hyperresistance in the positronic pathways manifests as trouble standing and walking and then speaking .  i displayed all these .  i must have sensed that my robots would be used indirectly to kill humans .  the ancient giskard had similar difficulties with the boundary between the first and zeroth laws .      dors    mouth trembled with barely repressed emotion .     the rest of us depend upon your judgment to negotiate the tension between those two most fundamental of laws .  i could not withstand what you have had to endure .      trying to comfort him  hari said     you had no choice  daneel .  i boxed you in .      daneel looked at dors  allowing conflicted expressions to flit across his face  a symphony of agony .     the zeroth law .  .  . i have lived with it for so long .  .  . many millennia .  .  . and yet .  .  .         there is a clear contradiction     hari said softly  knowing he was treading in territory of great delicacy .     the sort of conceptual clash a human mind can sometimes manage .      dors whispered     but we cannot  except at grave peril to our very stability .      daneel hung his head .     when i gave the orders  an acidic agony arose in my mind  a scalding tide i have barely contained .      hari   s throat just allowed him to squeeze out his words .     old friend  you had no choice .  surely in all your ages of labor in the human cause  other contradictions have arisen .      daneel nodded .     many .  and each time i hang above an abyss .         you cannot succumb     dors said .     you are the greatest of us .  more is demanded of you .      daneel looked at both of them as if seeking absolution .  across his face flickered forlorn hope .     i suppose .  .  .      hari added his assent  a lump in his throat .     of course .  all is lost without you .  you must endure .      daneel looked off into infinity  speaking in a dry whisper .     my work .  .  . it is not done .  .  . so i cannot .  .  . deactivate .  this must be what it is like .  .  .  to be truly human .  .  . torn between two poles .  still  i can look forward .  there will come a time when my work is finished .  when i can be relieved of these contradictory tensions .  then i shall face the black blankness .  .  . and it will be good .      the fervor of the robot   s speech left hari silent and sad .  for a long time the three sat together in the hushed room .  lamurk stood attentive and silent .   then  without a further word  they went their separate ways .        .     hari sat alone and stared at the holo of a raging  ancient prairie fire .   in its place now stood the empire .  he knew now that he loved the empire for reasons he could not name .  the dark revelation  that the robots had visited death and destruction upon the old  remnant digital minds .  .  . even that did not deter him .  he would never know the details of that ancient crime  he hoped .   to preserve his sanity  for the first time in his life he did not want to know .   the empire that stood all around him was even more marvelous than he had suspected .  and more sobering .   who could accept that humanity did not control its own future  that history was the result of forces acting beyond the horizons of mere mortal men .  the empire had endured because of its metanature  not the valiant acts of individuals  or even of worlds .   many would argue for human self determination .  their arguments were not wrong or even ineffectual  just beside the point .  as persuasion they were powerful  everyone wanted to believe they were masters of their own fate .  logic had nothing to do with it .   even emperors were nothing  chaff blown by winds they could not see .   as if to refute him  cleon   s image abruptly coagulated in the holo .     hari .  where have you been .         working .         on your equations  i hope  because you   re going to need them .         sire .         the high council just met in special session .  i appeared  a note of grace and gravity was much needed .  in the wake of the  ah  tragic loss of lamurk and his  ah  associates  i urged the quick election of a first minister .     a broad wink .     for stability  you understand .      hari croaked     oh no .         oh  yes .   my first minister .         but wasn   t there  didn   t anyone suspect          you .  a harmless academic  bringing off assassinations in dozens of places  allover trantor .  using tiktoks .         well  you know how people will talk       cleon gave him a shrewd look .     come now  hari .  .  . how did you do it .         i count among my allies a gang of renegade robots .      cleon laughed loudly  slapping his desk .     i never knew you were such a jokester .  very well  i quite understand .  you should not be forced to reveal your sources .      hari had sworn to himself that he would never lie to the emperor .  not being believed was not part of the agreement .     i assure you  sire          of course you are right to jest .  i am not naive .         and i am a lousy liar  sire .     true also  and as well  the best way to close the matter .      i want you to come to the formal reception for the high council .  now that you   re first minister  there will be these social matters .  but before that  i do want you to think about the sark situation and          i can advise you now .      cleon brightened .     oh .         there are dampers in history  sire  which stabilize the empire .  the new renaissance is a breakout of a fundamental facet and flaw of humanity .  it must be suppressed .         you   re sure .         if we do nothing .  .  .     hari recalled the solutions he had just tried in the fitness landscape .  let the new renaissance go and the empire would dissolve into chaos states within mere decades .     that might destroy humanity itself .      cleon grimaced .     truly .  what are my other options .         squelch these eruptions .  the sarkians are brilliant  true  but they cannot find a shared heart for their people .  they are examples of what i call a solipsism plague  an excessive belief in the self .  it is contagious .         the human toll          save the survivors .  send imperial aid ships through the wormholes  food  counselors  psychers if they   re any help .  but after the disorder has burned itself out .         i see .     cleon gave him a guarded glance  face slightly averted .     you are a hard man  hari .         when it comes to preserving order  the empireyes  sire .      cleon went on to speak of minor matters  as if shying away from so brutal a topic .  hari was glad he had not asked more .   the long range predictions showed dire drifts  that the classic dampers in the empire   s self learning networks were failing  too .  the new renaissance was but the most flagrant example .   but everywhere he had looked  with his body sensorium tied into the n dimensional spectrum  rose the stink of impending chaos .  the empire was breaking down in ways which were not describable by mere human modes .  it was too vast a system to enclose within a single mind .   so soon  within decades  the empire would start to fragment .  military strength was of little long term use when the time honored dampers faltered .  the center could not hold .   hari could slow that collapse a bit  perhaps  that was all .  soon whole zones would spiral back to the old at tractors  basic feudalism  religious sanctimony  femoprimitivism .  .  .   of course  his conclusions were preliminary .  he hoped new data would prove him wrong .  but he doubted it .   only after thirty thousand years of suffering would the fever bum out .  a new  strong at tractor would emerge .   a random mutation of benign imperialism .  he could not tell .   he could understand all this better with more work .  explore the foundations  get .  .  .   an idea flickered .  foundations .  something there .  .  .   but cleon was going on and events were colliding in his mind .  the idea flitted away .      we   ll do great things together  hari .  what do you think about .  .  .      at cleon   s beck and call  he would never get any work done .   dealing with lamurk had been disagreeable  but in comparison with this trap of power  easy .  how could he get out of this .        .     the two figures from a past beyond antiquity flew in their cool digital spaces  waiting for the man to return .      i have faith he will     joan said .      i rely more upon calculation     voltaire replied  adjusting his garb .  he softened the pull of silk in his tight  formal breeches .  it was a simple adjustment of the friction coefficient  nothing more .  rough algorithms reduced intricate laws to trivial arithmetic .  even the rub of life was just another parameter .      i still resent this weather .      gales howled across troubled waters .  they flew above foaming waves and banked on thermal upwellings .      your idea  to be birds for a bit .     he was a silvery eagle .      i always envied them .  so light  cheerful  at one with the air itself .      he morphed his wings up to his shoulders  making his vest coat fit much better .  even here  life was mostly details .      why must such strangeness manifest as weather .     joan asked .      men argue  nature acts .         but they are not nature .  they are strange minds          so strange we might as well regard them as natural phenomena .         i find it difficult to believe that our lord made such things .         i   ve felt that way about many parisians .         they appear to us as storms  mountains  oceans .  if they would explain themselves          the secret of being a bore is to tell everything .         hark .  he comes .      she grew armor while keeping her giant wings .  the effect was startling  like a giant chromed falcon .   voltaire said     my love  you never cease to surprise me .  i believe that with you even eternity will not be tedious .      hari seldon hung in midair .  he was clearly not yet used to adventuresome simulations  for his feet kept trying to stand somewhere .  eventually he gave up and watched them swoop and dive around him .      i came as soon as i could .         i gather you are now a viscount or duke or such     joan said .      something like that     hari said .     this space you   re in  i   ve arranged for it to be a permanent  ah          preserve .     voltaire asked  batting his wings before the hari figure .  a cloud drifted nearer  as if to listen in .      we call it a    dedicated perimeter    in computational space .         such poetry .     voltaire arched an eyebrow .      that sounds much like a zoo     joan said .      the deal is  you and the alien minds can stay here  running without interference .         i do not like to be hemmed in .     joan shouted .  hari shook his head .     you   ll be able to get input from anywhere .  but no more interference with the tiktoks  right .         ask the weather     joan said .   a cascade of burnt orange sheet lightning ran down the sky .      i   m just glad the meme minds didn   t exterminate all the robots     hari said .   voltaire said     perhaps this place is a bit like england  where they kill an occasional admiral to encourage the others .         i had to do it     hari said .   joan slowed her wings and hovered near his face .     you are distressed .         did you know the meme minds would use the tiktoks to kill robots .         not at all     joan said .   voltaire added     though the economy of it provokes a certain admiration .  subtle minds  they are .         treacherous     hari said .     i wonder what else they can do .         i believe they are satisfied     joan said .     i sense a calm in our weather .         i want to speak with them .     hari shouted .      like kings  they like to be awaited     voltaire said .      i sense them gathering     joan said helpfully .     let us help our friend here with his vexations .         me .     hari said .     i don   t like killing people  if that   s what you mean .         in such times  there is no good path     she said .     i  too  had to kill for the right .         lamurk was a valuable public servant          nonsense .     voltaire said .     he lived as he died  by the dagger  too slippery to show the sword .  he would never rest with you in power .  and even had you stepped aside  well  my mathist  remember that it is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong .         i still feel conflicted .         you must  for you are a righteous man     joan said .     pray and be absolved .         or better  peer within     voltaire explained loftily .     your conflicts reflect subminds in dispute .  such is the human condition .      joan flapped her wings at voltaire  who veered away .   hari scowled .     that sounds more like a machine .      voltaire laughed .     if order  you are an enthusiast of order  yes .   means predictability  and predictability means predetermination  and that means compulsion  and compulsion means nonfreedom  why then  the only way we can be free is to be disordered .      hari frowned .  voltaire realized that  while for him ideas were playthings  and the contest of wits made the blood sing  for this man the abstract mattered .   hari said     i suppose you   re right .  people do feel discomfort with rigid order .  and with hierarchies  norms  foundations      he blinked .     there   s an idea  i can   t quite see it .  .  .      voltaire said kindly     even you  surely you do not want to be the tool of your own genes  or of physics  or of economics .         how can we be free if we   re machines .     hari asked  as if speaking to himself .      nobody wants either a random universe or a deterministic one     voltaire said .      but there are deterministic laws          and random ones .      joan put in     our lord gave us judgment to choose .         freedom to choose to do other than one would like  what a sordid boon .     voltaire said .   joan said     you gentlemen are circling the divine without knowing it .  everything worthwhile to people  freedom  meaning  value  all that disappears within either of your choices .         my love  you must remember that hari is a mathist .     voltaire zoomed about both of them on spread wings  obviously enjoying ruffling his feathers in the turbulence .     order disorder seem implicated in other dualisms  nature human  natural artificial  animals with natures humans outside nature .  they are natural to us .         how come .     hari squinted  puzzled .      how do we frame the other side of an argument .  we say     on the other hand     yes .      hari nodded .     we think our two hands mirror the world .         very good .     voltaire flew loops around joan   s chromed falcon .      the creator has two hands as well     joan persisted .        he sitteth on the right hand of the father almighty          voltaire cawed like a crow .      but you    re both neglecting your own selves  which you can inspect  in this digital vault .  look deeply and you see endless detail .  it ramifies into a self that cannot be decomposed into the mere operation of neat laws .  the you emerges as a deep interplay of many selves .      into the shared mind space of the three voltaire sent     complex  nonlinear feedback systems are unpredictable  even if they are deterministic .  the information processing capacity needed to predict a single mind is larger than the complexity of the whole universe itself .  computing the next event takes longer than the event itself .  precisely this feature  written into the texture of the universe  makes it  and us  free .     hari replied with     paradox .  how does the event itself know how to happen .   only a massive computer could describe the next tiny whorl in a stream .  what makes real systems even able to change .     voltaire shrugged  a difficult gesture for a bird .      at last you have encountered an agency you cannot dismiss     joan said proudly .   voltaire   s head jerked with surprise .     your .  .  .  creator .         your equations describe well enough .  but what gives these equations      she hesitated at the word    fire .         you imply a mind which does the universal computation .         no  you do .      hari said     fair enough  as a hypothesis .  but why should such a mind care a whit for us  mere motes .         he cared enough to make you come out of the matrix of matter  did he not .         ah  origins     voltaire said  catching an updraft .  he looked relieved to be on surer intellectual ground .  plainly her point had rattled him .     insoluble  of course .  i prefer to deal with our moralities .      joan said primly     morality is not dependent upon us .      voltaire shot back     nonsense .  we evolved with morals shaped by the universe  by a creator  if you wish .      hari asked     you mean by evolution .  the pans       joan cried     indeed .  holiness shapes the world  the world shapes us .      hari looked doubtful  joan pleased .  voltaire said wryly     my mathist  would you rather believe that moral constraints emerge as    a spontaneous order from rational utility maximizing behavior    .  truly .      hari blinked .     well  no .  .  .         i quoted one of your own papers .  what you   ve forgotten  sir  is that our endless models of the world shape how we look at human experience .         of course  but          and the models are all that we know .      hari suddenly smiled .     i like that .  don   t get married to a model .     he allowed himself to morph slightly  growing taller  more muscular .     i don   t know why  but i feel better .         your soul has come to terms with your actions     joan said .   voltaire said     i would prefer    selves    to    soul     but let us not quibble .      suddenly hari felt categories shift in his mind .  he had arranged for the revival of these sims  guided by pure intuition .  now came the payoff  they had inadvertently discovered the step he wanted .     the mind .  .  . is a self organizing structure  and so is the empire .  i can work back and forth between those models .  import your knowledge of subselves  use it to analyze how the empire learns .      voltaire blinked .     what a marvelous idea .      hari said     wait   ll i show you .  the empire is self learning  with subunits          i wonder if the alien fog knows this .     joan asked .   hari frowned .     i do not want to involve them .  my equations cannot deal with elements of unknown          they are already involved     joan said .     they are here  all around us .      hari sighed .     i hope we can keep them here in the          zoo     joan said dryly .   thunderheads roiled over the horizons  closing fast .      you killed robots .     hari shouted into the gale .     that was not in our bargain .       we did not say we would refrain      you took more than we agreed .  lives of        terms omitted cannot be presumed upon      the robots are a separate kind .  of high intelligence        your mere tiktoks could kill them though    you  seldon  did not own these machines    and thus have no dispute with us   hari ground his teeth and fumed .    more important matters beckon      your rewards .     hari asked bitterly .     you   ve come for them .       we shall not stay here    for this place is doomed   hari staggered under a hailstorm of biting cold .     trantor .       and much else      what do you want .       our desired destiny is to float among the spiral arms    and linger long among the plumes of galactic center   hari remembered the structures there  the complex weave of luminosities .     you can do that .       we have a spore state    some of us lived this way before    to such a state we wish to return    else we shall extinguish all your    robots         that wasn   t part of our deal .     hari shouted .  hard cold rain hammered him  but he turned his face to confront the towering  angry clouds and their skirts of wrathful lightning .    how can you stop us .     though it would deplete our capacities    we could bring trantor to starvation   hari grimaced .  he was learning a lot about power  quite quickly .     all right .  i   ll see that research gets done on how to transfer you to physical form .  there are those i know who can do it .  marq and sybyl know how to keep quiet  too .      voltaire asked     why do you wish to exit stage left with such unseemly haste .       a new brush fire is coming    to humans across the spiral    we shall watch this fall    as spores from galactic center    there none can hurt us  none can we hurt   a glittering crystal with sharp spikes materialized beneath the purpling sky .  in a data dollop  hari learned of the alien technology which had once made these stable  rugged compartments for digital intelligences .    trantor was once the ideal place for us    rich in resources    no more is this so    danger lurks in the coming instability      ummm     voltaire said .     joan and i might desire such an exit as well .         wait  you two     hari said  talking fast .     if you want to go with these  these things  to live in a seed between the stars  then you have to earn it .      joan scowled .     how .         for now  i can make it safe for you to live widely in the mesh .  in return      he gazed anxiously at the voltaire eagle  flapping in brassy splendor      i want you to help me .         if it is a holy cause  surely     joan called .      it is .  help me lead .  i   ve always felt there   s good in everybody .  the job of a leader is to bring it out .      voltaire said     if you think there is good in everybody  you haven   t met everybody .         but i   m not a man of the world .  so i need you .         to rule .     joan asked .      exactly .  i   m not suited for it .      voltaire stopped in midair  wings stilled .     the possibilities .  with enough computing space and speed  we can endow proto michelangelos with creative time .         i need to deal with a lot of  well  power problems .  you can go off into these spore forms when i   m finished with politics .      voltaire abruptly congealed into human form  though still elegantly clothed in electric blue .     ummm .  politics  i always found it enticing .  a game of elegant ideas  played by bullies .         i   ve got plenty of opposition already     hari said soberly .      friends come and go  but enemies accumulate     voltaire said .     i would like that .      joan rolled her eyes .     saints preserve us .         precisely  my dear .           .     hari sat back at his desk .  first minister  but on his terms .   it had all worked out .  he got to work here still  far from palace intrigues .  plenty of time to do math .   he would  of course  speak by  d and holo to many .  all that bother voltaire took care of .  after all  voltaire or joan could masquerade as hari at the many conferences and meetings necessary for a first minister .  digitally  they could morph to him with ease .   joan enjoyed the virtual ceremonials  especially if she got to hold forth on holiness .  voltaire loved imitating an ancient man he had apparently known  a mr .  machiavelli .     your empire     he had said     is a vast  ramshackle thing of infinite nuance and multiplying self delusions .  needs looking after .      in between  they could explore the digital realms  labyrinths vast and vibrant .  as voltaire had said  they could be off upon    postings various and capers hilarious .      yugo came in bursting with energy .     the high council just passed your vote proposals  hari .  every dahlite in the galaxy   s on your side now .      hari smiled .     have voltaire make a    appearance  as me .         right  modest and confident  that   ll work .         reminds me of the old joke about the prostitute .  the regular costs the regular price  but sincerity is extra .      yugo laughed unconvincingly and said edgily     uh  that woman   s here .         not       he had forgotten utterly about the academic potentate .  the one threat he had not neutralized .  she knew about dors  about robots  giving him no time to think  she swept into his office .      so happy you could see me  primary minister .         wish i could say the same .         and your lovely wife .  is she about .         i doubt she would desire to see you .      the academic potentate spread her billowing robes and sat without invitation .     surely you didn   t take that small jest of mine seriously .         my sense of humor doesn   t include blackmail .      wide eyes  a slight touch of outrage in the tone .     i was merely trying to gain leverage with your administration .         sure .     such were imperial manners that he would not bring up her possible role in vaddo   s plot on panucopia .      i was certain you would gain the ministership .  my little sally  well  perhaps it was in poor taste          very .         you are a man of few words  quite admirable .  my allies were so impressed with your  ah  direct handling of the tiktok crisis  the lamurk killings .      so that was it .  he had shown that he was not an impractical academic .     direct .  how about    ruthless    .         oh no  we don   t think that at all .  you are right to let sark    burn out     as you so eloquently put it .  despite the greys wanting to jump in and bind up wounds .  very wise  not ruthless  no .         even though sark might never recover .     these were the questions he had asked himself through sleepless nights .  people were dying that the empire might live .  .  . for a while longer .   she waved this away .     as i was saying  i wanted a special relationship with the first minister from our class in  well  so long       like many he knew now  she employed speech to conceal thought  not to reveal it .  he had to sit and endure some of this  he knew .  she rattled on and he thought about how to handle a knotty term in the equations .  he had by now mastered the art of seeming to track with eyes  mouth movements  and the occasional murmur .  this was exactly what a filter program did for his  d  and he could do it without thinking about the hypocrisy of the woman before him .   he understood her now  in a way .  power was value free for her .  he had to learn to think that way and even act that way .  but he could not let it affect his true self  the personal life he would ruthlessly shelter .   he finally got rid of her and breathed a sigh of relief .  probably it was good to be seen as ruthless .  that fellow nim  for example  he could have nim found  even executed  for playing both sides in the artifice associates matter .   but why .  mercy was more efficient .  hari sent a quick note to security  directing that nim be funneled into a productive spot  but one where his talent for betrayal would find no avenue .  let an underling figure out where and how .   he had neglected business and had one obligatory role left before he could escape .  even here at streeling he could not avoid every imperial duty .   a delegation of greys filed in .  they respectfully presented their arguments regarding candidacy examinations for empire positions .  test scores had been declining for several centuries  but some argued that this was because the pool of candidates was broadening .  they did not mention that the high council had widened the pool because it appeared to be drying up  that is  fewer wished imperial positions .   others claimed that the tests were biased .  those from large planets said their higher gravity made them slower .  those from lighter gravities had a reverse argument  with diagrams and sheets of facts .   also  the myriad ethnic and religious groups had congealed into an action front which ferreted out biases against them in the examinations .  hari could not fathom a conspiracy behind the examination questions .  how could one simultaneously discriminate against several hundred  or even a thousand  ethnic strains .      it seems an immense job to me     he ventured     discriminating against so many factions .      vehemently a grey woman  handsome and forceful  told him that the prejudice was for a sort of imperial norm  a common set of vocabularies  assumptions  and class purposes .  all these would    shoulder others aside .      to compensate  the action front wanted the usual set of preferences installed  with slight shadings between each ethnicity to compensate for their lower performance on examinations .   this was ordinary and hari ruled it out without having to think about it very much  this allowed him to mull over the psychohistory equations a while .  then a new note caught his attention .   to dispel the common    misperception    that scores were being undermined by some ethnic worlds    increased participation  the action front petitioned him to    re norm    the examination itself .  set the average score at       though in fact it had drifted downward over the last two centuries to     .      this will permit comparison of candidates between years  without having to look up each year   s average     the burly woman pointed out .      this will give a symmetric distribution .     hari asked absently .      yes  and will stop the invidious comparison of one year with the next .         won   t such a shift of the mean lose discriminatory power at the upper end of the distribution .     he narrowed his eyes .      that is regrettable  but yes .         it   s a wonderful idea     hari said .   she seemed surprised .     well  we think so .         we can do the same for the holoball averages .         what .  i don   t          set the statistics so that the average hitter strikes      rather than the hard to remember     of the present .          but i don   t think a principle of social justice          and the intelligence scores .  those need to be renormed as well  i can see that .  agreed .         well  i   m not sure  first minister .  we only intended          no no  this is a big idea .  i want a thorough look at all possible re norming agendas .  you have to think big .         we aren   t prepared          then get prepared .  i want a report .  not a skimpy one  either .  a fat  full report .  two thousand pages  at least .         that would take          hang the expense .  and the time .  this is too important to relegate to the imperial examinations .  let me have that report .         it would take years  decades          then there   s no time to waste .      the action front delegation left in confusion .  hari hoped they would make it a very big report  indeed  so that he was no longer first minister when it arrived .   part of maintaining the empire involved using its own inertia against itself .  some aspects of this job  he thought  could be actually enjoyable .   he reached voltaire before leaving the office .     here   s your list of impersonations .         i must say i am having trouble handling all the factions     voltaire said .  he presented as a swain in elegant velvet .     but the chance to venture out  to be a presence  it is like acting .  and i was always one for the stage  as you know .      hari didn   t  but he said     that   s democracy for you  show business with daggers .  a mongrel breed of government .  even if it is a big stable at tractor in the fitness landscape .         rational thinkers deplore the excesses of democracy  it abuses the individual and elevates the mob .     voltaire   s mouth flattened into a disapproving line .     the death of socrates was its finest fruit .         afraid i don   t go back that far     hari said  signing off .     enjoy the work .           .     he and dors watched the great luminous spiral turn beneath them in its eternal night .      i do appreciate such perks     she said dreamily .  they stood alone before the spectacle .  worlds and lives and stars  all like crushed diamonds thrown against eternal blackness .      getting into the palace just to look at the emperor   s display rooms .     he had ordered all the halls cleared .      getting away from snoopers and eavesdroppers .         you .  .  . you haven   t heard from   .      she shook her head .     daneel pulled nearly all the rest of us off trantor .  he says little to me .         i   m pretty damn sure the alien minds won   t strike again .  they   re afraid of robots .  it took me a while to see that lay behind their talk about revenge .         mingled hate and fear .  very human .         still  i think they   ve had their revenge .  they say the galaxy was lush with life before we came .  there are cycles of barren eras  then luxuriant ones .  don   t know why .  apparently that   s happened several times before  at intervals of a third of a billion years  great diebacks of intelligent life  leaving only spores .  now they   ve come to our mesh and become digital fossils .         fossils don   t kill     she said sardonically .      not as well as we do  apparently .         not you  us .         they do hate you robots .  not that they have any love of humans  after all  we made you  long ago .  we   re to blame .         they are so strange .  .  .      he nodded .     i believe they   ll stay in their digital preserve until marq and sybyl can get them transported into their ancient spore state .  they once lived that way for longer than the galaxy takes to make a rotation .         your    pretty damn sure    isn   t good enough for daneel     she said .     he wants them exterminated .         it   s a standoff .  if daneel goes after them  he   ll have to pull the plug on trantor   s mesh .  that will wound the empire .  so he   s stuck  fuming but impotent .         i hope you have estimated the balance properly     she said .   a glimmering  gossamer thought flitted across his mind .  the tiktok attacks upon the lamurk faction had discredited them in public opinion .  now they would be suppressed throughout the galaxy .  and in time  the meme minds would leave trantor .   hari frowned .  daneel surely wanted both these outcomes .   he had undoubtedly suspected that the mememinds had survived  perhaps that they were in action on trantor .  so could hari   s amateur maneuverings  including the lamurk murders  have been deftly conjured up by daneel .  could a robot so accurately predict what he  hari  would do .   a chill ran through him .  such ability would be breathtaking .  superhuman .   with tiktoks now soon to be suppressed  trantor would have trouble producing its own food .  tasks once done by men would have to be re learned  taking generations to establish such laborers as a socially valued group again .  meanwhile  dozens of other worlds would have to send trantor food  a lifeline slender and vulnerable .  did daneel intend that  too .  to what end .   hari felt uneasy .  he sensed social forces at work  just beyond his view .   was such adroit thinking the product of millennia of experience and high  positronic intelligence .  for just a moment  hari had a vision of a mind both strange and measureless  in human terms .  was that what an immortal machine became .   then he pushed the idea away .  it was too unsettling to contemplate .  later  perhaps  when psychohistory was done .  .  .   he noticed dors staring at him .  what had she said .  oh  yes .  .  .      estimating the balance  yes .  i   m getting the feel for these things .  with voltaire and joan doing the scut work  and yugo now chairman of the mathist department  i actually have time to think .         and suffer fools gladly .         the academic potentate .  at least i understand her now .     he peered at dors .     daneel says he will leave trantor .  he   s lost a lot of his humaniforms .  does he need you .      she looked up at him in the soft glow .  her expression worked with conflict .     i can   t leave you .         his orders .         mine .      he gritted his teeth .     the robots who died  you knew them .         some .  we trained together back  back when .  .  .         you don   t have to conceal anything from me .  i know you must be at least a century old .      her mouth made an o of surprise  then quickly closed .     how .         you know more than you should .         so do you  in bed  anyway .     she chuckled .      i learned it from a pan i met .      she laughed bawdily  then sobered .     i   m one hundred sixty three .         with the thighs of a teenager .  if you had tried to leave trantor  i   d have blocked you .      she blinked .     truly .      he bit his lip  thinking .     well  no .      she smiled .     more romantic to say yes .  .  .         i have a habit of honesty  which i   d better drop if i want to stay first minister .         so you would let me go .  you still feel that you owe that to daneel .         if he thought the danger to you was that great  then i would honor his judgment .         you still respect us so .         robots work selflessly for the empire  always .  few humans do .         you don   t wonder what we did to earn the aliens    revenge .         of course .  do you know .      she shook her head  gazing out at the vast turning disk .  suns of blue and crimson and yellow swept along their orbits amid dark dust and disorder .     it was something awful .  daneel was there and he will not speak of it .  there is nothing in our history of this .  i   ve looked .         an empire lasting many millennia has manifold secrets .     hari watched the slow spin of a hundred billion flaming stars .     i   m more interested in its future  in saving it .         you fear that future  don   t you .         terrible things are coming .  the equations show that .         we can face them together .      he took her in his arms  but they both still watched the galaxy   s shining marvels .     i dream of founding something  a way to help the empire  even after we   re gone .  .  .          and you fear something  too     she said into his neck .      how did you know .  yes  i fear the chaos that could come from so many forces  divergent vector turmoil  all acting to bring down the order of the empire .  i fear for the very .  .  .     his face clouded .     for the very foundations themselves .  foundations .  .  .         chaos comes .         i know we ourselves  our minds  come out of skating on the inner rim of chaos states .  the digital world shows that .  you show that .      she said soberly     i do not think positronic minds understand themselves any better than human ones .         we  our minds and our empire  both spring from an emergent order of inner  basically chaotic states  but .  .  .         you do not want the empire to crash from such chaos .         i want the empire to survive .  or at least  if it falls  to reemerge .      hari suddenly felt the pain of such vast movements .  the empire was like a mind  and minds sometimes went crazy  crashed .  a disaster for one solitary mind .  how colossally worse for an empire .   seen through the prism of his mathematics  humanity was on a long march pressing forward through surrounding dark .  time battered them with storms  rewarded them with sunshine  and they did not glimpse that these passing seasons came from the shifting cadences of huge  eternal equations .   running the equations time forward  then backward  hari had seen humanity   s mortal parade in snips .  somehow that made it oddly touching .  steeped in their own eras  few worlds ever glimpsed the route ahead .  there was no shortage of portentous talk  or of oafs who pretended with a wink and a nod to fathom the unseeable .  misled  whole zones stumbled and fell .   he sought patterns  but beneath those vast sweeps lay the seemingly infinitesimal  living people .  across the realm of stars  under the laws that reigned like gods  lay innumerable lives in the process of being lost .  for to live was to lose  in the end .   social laws acted and people were maimed  damaged  robbed  and strangled by forces they could not even glimpse .  people were driven to sickness  to desperation  to loneliness and fear and remorse .  shaken by tears and longing  in a world they fundamentally failed to fathom  they nonetheless carried on .   there was nobility in that .  they were fragments adrift in time  motes in an empire rich and strong and full of pride  an order failing and battered and hollow with its own emptiness .   with leaden certainty  hari at last saw that he probably would not be able to rescue the great ramshackle empire  a beast of fine nuance and multiplying self delusions .   no savior  he .  but perhaps he could help .   they both stood in silence for a long  aching time .  the galaxy turned in its slow majesty .  a nearby fountain spewed glorious arcs into the air .  the waters seemed momentarily free  but in fact were trapped forever within the steel skies of trantor .  as was he .   hari felt a deep emotion he could not define .  it tightened his throat and made him press dors to him .  she was machine and woman and .  .  . something more .  another element he could not fully know  and he cherished her all the more for that .      you care so much     dors whispered .      i have to .         perhaps we should try to simply live more  worry less .      he kissed her fervently and then laughed .      quite right .  for who knows what the future may bring .      very slowly  he winked at her .     afterword    the foundation series began in world war ii  as america arced toward its zenith as a world power .  the series played out over decades as the united states dominated the world   s matters in a fashion no other nation ever had .  yet the foundation is about imperium and decline .  did this betray an anxiety  born even in the moment of approaching glory .   i had always wondered if this was so .  part of me itched to explore the issues which lace the series .   the idea of writing further novels in the foundation universe came from janet asimov and the asimov estate   s representative  ralph vicinanza .  approached by them  i at first declined  being busy with physics and my own novels .  but my subconscious  once aroused  refused to let go the notion .  after half a year of struggling with ideas plainly made for the foundation  persistently demanding expression  i finally called up ralph vicinanza and began putting together a plan to construct a fittingly complex curve of action and meaning  to be revealed in several novels .  though we spoke to several authors about this project  the best suited seemed two hard sf writers broadly influenced by asimov and of unchallenged technical ability  greg bear and david brin .   bear  brin  and i have kept in close touch while i wrote this first volume  for we intend to create three stand alone novels which nonetheless carry forward an overarching mystery to its end .  elements of this make their first appearance here  to amplify further through greg bear   s foundation and chaos  finding completion in brill   s third foundation .   these are preliminary titles .   i have planted in the narrative prefiguring details and key elements which shall bear later fruit .     genres are constrained conversations .  constraint is essential  defining the rules and assumptions open to an author .  if hard sf occupies the center of science fiction  that is probably because hardness gives the firmest boundary .  science itself yields crisp confines .   genres are also like immense discussions  with ideas developed  traded  mutated  their variations spun down through time .  players ring changes on each other  more like a steppin    out jazz band than a solo concert in a plush auditorium .  contrast    serious    fiction  more accurately described  in my eyes  as merely self consciously solemn  .  it has canonical classics that supposedly stand outside of time  deserving awe  looming great and intact by themselves .   much of the pleasure of mysteries  of espionage novels or sf  lies in the interaction of writers with each other and  particularly in sf   s invention of fandom  with the readers as well .  this isn   t a defect  it   s the essential nature of popular culture  which the united states has dominated in our age  with the invention of jazz  rock  the musical  and written genres such as the western  the hardboiled detective  modern fantasy  and other rich areas .  many kinds of sf  hard  utopian  military  satirical  share assumptions  code words  lines of argument  narrative voices .  fond remembrance of golden age astounding and its letter column  of the new wave  of horace gold   s galaxy  these are echoes of distant conversations earnestly carried out .   genre pleasures are many  but this quality of shared values within an ongoing discussion may be the most powerful  enlisting lifelong devotion in its fans .  in contrast to the grand canon view of great works standing like monoliths in a deserted landscape  genre reading satisfactions are a striking facet of modern democratic  pop  culture  a shared movement .   there are questions about how writers deal with what some call the    anxiety of influence     but which i   d prefer to term more mildly  the digestion of tradition .   i   m reminded of john berger   s definition of hack work  describing oil painting in ways of seeing  as     .  .  . not the result of either clumsiness or provincialism  it is the result of the market making more insistent demands than the art .     fair enough  but this can happen in any context .  working in a known region of concept space does not necessarily imply that the territory has been mined out .  nor is fresh ground always fertile .   surely we should notice that a novel hemingway thought the best in american literature is a sequel  indeed  following on a boy   s book  tom sawyer .   sharing common ground isn   t only a literary tradition .  are we thrown into moral confusion when we hear rhapsody on a theme by paganini .  do we indignantly march from the concert hall when assaulted by variations on a theme by haydn .  sharecropping by the greats .  shocking .   reinspecting the assumptions and methods of classical works can yield new fruit .  fresh narrative can both strike out into new territory while reflecting on the landscape of the past .  recall that hamlet drew from several earlier plays about the same plot .   isaac himself revisited the foundation  taking different angles of attack each time .  in the beginning  psychohistory equated the movements of people as a whole with the motions of molecules .  the second foundation looked at perturbations to such deterministic laws  the mule  and implied that only a superhuman elite could manage instabilities .  later  robots emerged as the elite  better than humans at dispassionate government .  beyond robots came gaia .  .  . and so on .   in this three book series we shall reinspect the role of robots  and what psychohistory might look like as a theory .  more riffs upon the basic tune .     i had always wondered about crucial aspects of asimov   s empire   why were there no aliens in the galaxy .  what role did computers play .  particularly  vs .  robots .   what did the theory of psychohistory actually look like .   finally  who was hari seldon  as a character  a man .   this novel attempts some answers .  it is my contribution to a discussion about power and determinism which has now spanned over half a century .   of course  we know some incidental answers .  the term    psychohistory    was commonly used in the thirties and appears in the      webster   s dictionary  isaac greatly extended its meaning  though .  he didn   t want to deal with john w .  campbell   s notorious dislike of aliens who might be as clever as we  so his foundation had none .  but it seemed to me there might be more to the matter .   as well  asimov   s uniting of his robot novels and the foundation series became intricate and puzzling .  the british critic brian stableford found this    comforting in its claustrophobic enclosure .     there are no robots in the early foundation novels  but they are behind the scenes manipulators in both prelude to foundation and forward the foundation .   some form of advanced computing machines must underlie the empire  surely .  isaac remarked that    i just put very advanced computers in the new foundation novel and hoped that nobody would notice the inconsistency .  nobody did .    as james gunn remarked     more accurately  people noticed but didn   t care .      asimov wrote each novel at the level of the then current scientific understanding .  later works updated the surrounding science .  thus his galaxy is more detailed in later books  including in foundation   s edge both advanced computers and a black hole at the galactic center .  similarly  here i have depicted our more detailed knowledge of the galactic center .  in place of isaac   s    hyperspace    ships i have used wormholes  which have considerably more theoretical justification now than they did when einstein and rosen introduced them in the     s .  indeed  wormholes are allowed by the general theory of relativity  but must have extreme forms of matter to form and support them .   matt visser   s lorentzian wormholes is the standard work on current thinking .     isaac wrote much of his fiction in a style he termed    direct and spare     though in the later works he relaxed this constraint a bit .  i have not attempted to write in the asimov style .   those who think it is easy to write clearly about complex subjects should try it .   for the foundation novels he used a particularly bare boards approach  with virtually no background descriptions or novelistic details .   note his own reaction when he decided to return to the series and revisited the trilogy      i read it with mounting uneasiness .  i kept waiting for something to happen  and nothing ever did .  all three volumes  all the nearly quarter of a million words  consisted of thoughts and conversation .  no action .  no physical suspense .      but it worked  famously so .  i could not manage such an approach  so have taken my own way .   i found that the details of trantor  of psychohistory and the empire  called out to me as i began thinking about this novel  indeed  they led me on my subconscious quest of the underlying story .  so the book is not an imitation asimov novel but a benford novel using asimov   s basic ideas and backdrop .   necessarily my approach has harkened back to the older storytelling styles which prevailed in the sf of isaac   s days .  i have never responded favorably to the recent razoring of literature by critics  the tribes of structuralists  post modernists  deconstructionists .  to many sf writers     post modern    is simply a signature of exhaustion .  its typical apparatus self reference  heavy dollops of obligatory irony  self conscious use of older genre devices  pastiche  and parody betrays lack of invention  of the crucial coin of sf  imagination .  some deconstructionists have attacked science itself as mere rhetoric  not an ordering of nature  seeking to reduce it to the status of the ultimately arbitrary humanities .  most sf types find this attack on empiricism a worn old song with new lyrics  quite quaintly retro .   at the core of sf lies the experience of science .  this makes the genre finally hostile to such fashions in criticism  for it values its empirical ground .  deconstructionism   s stress on contradictory or selfcontained internal differences in texts  rather than their link to reality  often merely leads to literature seen as empty word games .   sf novels give us worlds which are not to be taken as metaphors but as real .  we are asked to participate in wrenchingly strange events  not merely watch them for clues to what they   re really talking about .   ummm  if this stands for that  then the other stuff must stand for .  .  . not a way to gather narrative momentum .   the mars and stars and digital deserts of our best novels are  finally  to be taken as real  as if to say  life isn   t like this  it is this .  journeys can go to fresh places  not merely return us to ourselves .   even so  i   ve indulged myself a bit in the satirical scenes depicting an academia going off the rails  but i feel isaac would have approved of my targets .  readers thinking i   ve gone overboard in depicting the view that science does not deal with objective truths  but instead is a battleground of power politics where    naive realism    meets relativist worldviews  should look into the golem by harry collins and trevor pinch .  this book attempts to portray scientists as no more the holders of objective knowledge than are lawyers or travel agents .   the recent    re norming    of the scholastic aptitude tests so that each year the average is forced to the same number  thus masking the decline of ability in students  i satirize in the very last pages of the novel  i hope isaac would have gotten a chuckle from seeing the issue framed against an entire galaxy .     from verne and wells to somewhere near       science fiction was mostly about the wonders of movement  of transportation .  note the innumerable novels with the word star in their titles  evoking far destinations  and stories such as robert heinlein   s    the roads must roll .      but in the past few decades we have focused more on the wonders of information  of transformations at least partly internal  not external .  the internet  virtual reality  computer simulations  all these loom large in our visions of our futures .  this novel attempts to combine these two themes  with several conspicuous scenes about travel  and a larger background motif on computers .   as james gunn noted  the foundation series is a saga .  its method lies in a repeated pattern  out of the solution of each problem grows the next problem to be solved .  this became  of course  a considerable constraint on later novels .  asimov seemed to be saying that life was a series of problems to be solved  but life itself could never be solved .  as gunn remarked  considering that the combined and integrated foundation and robot saga now covers sixteen books  perhaps a directory of it all is called for  named  perhaps  encyclopedia galactica .   galactic empires became a mainstay frame for science fiction .  poul anderson   s flandry novels and gordon r .  dickson  in his dorsai series  particularly studied the sociopolitical structure of such vast complexes  for a powerful  autocratic imperial system demands great organizational skill  the primary asset of the romans themselves .   isaac was not always consistent in his numbers .  how many dwell on trantor .  usually he says forty billion  but in second foundation it is     billion  unless that   s a typo  .  spread forty billion over an earth sized world  with all its seas drained   and that   s only about a hundred per square kilometer .  surely housing them would not demand a half kilometer deep city .   dates also get difficult to follow  across such immensities of time .  trantor is at least        years old  and note that we assume that the year is earth   s  though earth   s location has been forgotten .  by the galactic empire calendar  pebble in the sky  which has references to hundreds of thousands of years of expansion into space  occurs about     g . e .  in foundation atomic energy is        years old .  the robot daneel is        years old in prelude to foundation and in forward the foundation .  how far away in our future do the sun and spaceship emblem rule .  perhaps        years .  no one date reconciles every detail .   not that it truly matters .  i know the dangers of writing a long series over decades .  i took twenty five years to wrestle with the six volumes of my galactic center series .  undoubtedly there are contradictions i missed in dating and other details  even though i laid it all out in a timeline  published in the last volume .  the aliens of that series are not those implicated in this novel  but there are clearly conceptual links .   science fiction speaks of the future  but to the present .  the grand issues of social power and the technology that drives it will never fade .  often problems are best seen in the perspectives of implication  before we meet them on the gritty ground of their arrival .   isaac asimov was ultimately hopeful about humanity .  he saw us again and again coming to a crossroads and prevailing .  the foundation is about that .   what matters in sagas is sweep .  this  the foundation series surely has .  i can only hope i have added a bit to that .     works tracing the intricacies of the foundation include notably alexei and cory panshin   s historical the world beyond the hill  james gunn   s insightful isaac asimov  joseph patrouch   s thorough the science fiction of isaac asimov  and alva rogers    requiem for astounding  which gives a sense of what it was like to read the classic works as they appeared .  i learned from all these studies .   for advice and comments on this project i am especially grateful to janet asimov  mark martin  david brin  joe miller  jennifer brehl  and elisabeth brown for close readings of the manuscript .  my gratitude goes to don dixon for his fantastical  future beastiary .  appreciation for general help is due to my wife joan  abbe  and to ralph vicinanza  janet asimov  james gunn  john silbersack  donald kingsbury  chris schelling  john douglas  greg bear  george zebrowski  paul carter  lou aronica  jennifer hershey  gary westfahl and john clute .  thanks to all .     september        gregory benford  physicist  educator  author  was born in mobile  alabama .
