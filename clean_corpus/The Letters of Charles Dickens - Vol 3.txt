preface .   since our publication of  the letters of charles dickens  we have received the letters addressed to the late lord lytton  which we were unable to procure in time for our first two volumes in consequence of his son s absence in india .  we thank the earl of lytton cordially for his kindness in sending them to us very soon after his return .  we also offer our sincere thanks to sir austen h .  layard  and to the senders of many other letters  which we now publish for the first time .   with a view to making our selection as complete as possible  we have collected together the letters from charles dickens which have already been published in various biographies  and have chosen and placed in chronological order among our new letters those which we consider to be of the greatest interest .   as our narrative was finished in our second volume  this volume consists of letters only  with occasional foot notes wherever there are allusions requiring explanation .   mamie

seen the examiner .  it is rather depreciatory of the opera  but  like all inveterate critiques against braham  so well done that i cannot help laughing at it  for the life and soul of me .  i have seen the sunday times  the dispatch  and the satirist  all of which blow their critic trumpets against unhappy me most lustily .  either i must have grievously awakened the ire of all the  adapters  and their friends  or the drama must be decidedly bad .  i haven t made up my mind yet which of the two is the fact .   i have not seen the john bull or any of the sunday papers except the spectator .  if you have any of them  bring  em with you on tuesday .  i am afraid that for  dirty cummins   allusion to hogarth i shall be reduced to the necessity of being valorous the next time i meet him .   believe me  most faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    furnival s inn  monday afternoon    o clock        .   my dear hullah   mr .  hogarth has just been here  with news which i think you will be glad to hear .  he was with braham yesterday  who was far more full of the opera    than he was  speaking highly of my works and  fame    .    and expressing an earnest desire to be the first to introduce me to the public as a dramatic writer .  he said that he intended opening at michaelmas  and added  unasked  that it was his intention to produce the opera within one month of his first night .  he wants a low comedy part introduced  without singing  thinking it will take with the audience  but he is desirous of explaining to me what he means and who he intends to play it .  i am to see him on sunday morning .  full particulars of the interview shall be duly announced .   perhaps i shall see you meanwhile .  i have only time to add that i am  most faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    petersham  monday evening        .   dear hullah   since i called on you this morning i have not had time to look over the words of  the child and the old man .   it occurs to me  as i shall see you on wednesday morning  that the best plan will be for you to bring the music  if you possibly can  without the words  and we can put them in then .  of course this observation applies only to that particular song .   braham having sent to me about the farce  i called on him this morning .  harley wrote  when he had read the whole of the opera  saying   it s a sure card  nothing wrong there .  bet you ten pound it runs fifty nights .  come  don t be afraid .  you ll be the gainer by it  and you mustn t mind betting  it s a capital custom .   they tell the story with infinite relish .  i saw the fair manageress     who is fully of harley s opinion  so is braham .  the only difference is  that they are far more enthusiastic than harley  far more enthusiastic than ourselves even .  that is a bold word  isn t it .  it is a true one  nevertheless .    depend upon it  sir   said braham to hogarth yesterday  when he went there to say i should be in town to day   depend upon it  sir  that there has been no such music since the days of sheil  and no such piece since  the duenna .     everybody is delighted with it   he added  to me to day .   i played it to stansbury  who is by no means an excitable person  and he was charmed .   this was said with great emphasis  but i have forgotten the grand point .  it was not   i played it to stansbury   but   i sang it  all through .  .  .    i begged him  as the choruses are to be put into rehearsal directly the company get together  to let us have  through mrs .  braham  the necessary passports to the stage  which will be forwarded .  he leaves town on the  th of september .  he will be absent a month  and the first rehearsal will take place immediately on his return  previous to it  i mean the first rehearsal  not the return  i am to read the piece .  his only remaining suggestion is  that miss rainforth will want another song when the piece is in rehearsal   a bravura  something in the  soldier tired  way .   we must have a confab about this on wednesday morning .   harley called in furnival s inn  to express his high delight and gratification  but unfortunately we had left town .  i shall be at head quarters by    wednesday noon .   believe me  dear hullah  most faithfully yours .   p . s .   tell me on wednesday when you can come down here  for a day or two .  beautiful place  meadow for exercise  horse for your riding  boat for your rowing  room for your studying  anything you like .    sidenote  mr .  george hogarth .           furnival s inn  tuesday evening  january   th       .   my dear sir   as you have begged me to write an original sketch for the first number of the new evening paper  and as i trust to your kindness to refer my application to the proper quarter  should i be unreasonably or improperly trespassing upon you  i beg to ask whether it is probable that if i commenced a series of articles  written under some attractive title  for the evening chronicle  its conductors would think i had any claim to some additional remuneration  of course  of no great amount  for doing so .   let me beg of you not to misunderstand my meaning .  whatever the reply may be  i promised you an article  and shall supply it with the utmost readiness  and with an anxious desire to do my best  which i honestly assure you would be the feeling with which i should always receive any request coming personally from yourself .  i merely wish to put it to the proprietors  first  whether a continuation of light papers in the style of my  street sketches  would be considered of use to the new paper  and  secondly  if so  whether they do not think it fair and reasonable that  taking my share of the ordinary reporting business of the chronicle besides  i should receive something for the papers beyond my ordinary salary as a reporter .   begging you to excuse my troubling you  and taking this opportunity of acknowledging the numerous kindnesses i have already received at your hands since i have had the pleasure of acting under you   i am  my dear sir  very sincerely yours .    sidenote  mrs .  hogarth .    doughty street  thursday night  october   th       .   my dear mrs .  hogarth   i need not thank you for your present    of yesterday  for you know the sorrowful pleasure i shall take in wearing it  and the care with which i shall prize it  until  so far as relates to this life  i am like her .   i have never had her ring off my finger by day or night  except for an instant at a time  to wash my hands  since she died .  i have never had her sweetness and excellence absent from my mind so long .  i can solemnly say that  waking or sleeping  i have never lost the recollection of our hard trial and sorrow  and i feel that i never shall .   it will be a great relief to my heart when i find you sufficiently calm upon this sad subject to claim the promise i made you when she lay dead in this house  never to shrink from speaking of her  as if her memory must be avoided  but rather to take a melancholy pleasure in recalling the times when we were all so happy  so happy that increase of fame and prosperity has only widened the gap in my affections  by causing me to think how she would have shared and enhanced all our joys  and how proud i should have been  as god knows i always was  to possess the affections of the gentlest and purest creature that ever shed a light on earth .  i wish you could know how i weary now for the three rooms in furnival s inn  and how i miss that pleasant smile and those sweet words which  bestowed upon our evening s work  in our merry banterings round the fire  were more precious to me than the applause of a whole world would be .  i can recall everything she said and did in those happy days  and could show you every passage and line we read together .   i see now how you are capable of making great efforts  even against the afflictions you have to deplore  and i hope that  soon  our words may be where our thoughts are  and that we may call up those old memories  not as shadows of the bitter past  but as lights upon a happier future .   believe me  my dear mrs .  hogarth  ever truly and affectionately yours .   footnotes        the village coquettes .        mrs .  braham .       printed in  forty years  recollections of life  literature  and public affairs   by charles mackay .       a chain made of mary hogarth s hair  sent to charles dickens on the first anniversary of her birthday  after her death .                 diary       .   monday  january  st       .   a sad new year s day in one respect  for at the opening of last year poor mary was with us .  very many things to be grateful for since then  however .  increased reputation and means  good health and prospects .  we never know the full value of blessings till we lose them  we were not ignorant of this one when we had it  i hope  .  but if she were with us now  the same winning  happy  amiable companion  sympathising with all my thoughts and feelings more than anyone i knew ever did or will  i think i should have nothing to wish for  but a continuance of such happiness .  but she is gone  and pray god i may one day  through his mercy  rejoin her .  i wrote to mrs .  hogarth yesterday  taking advantage of the opportunity afforded me by her sending  as a new year s token  a pen wiper of poor mary s  imploring her  as strongly as i could  to think of the many remaining claims upon her affection and exertions  and not to give way to unavailing grief .  her answer came to night  and she seems hurt at my doing so  protesting that in all useful respects she is the same as ever .  meant it for the best  and still hope i did right .   saturday  january  th       .   our boy s birthday  one year old .  a few people at night  only forster  the de gex s  john ross  mitton  and the beards  besides our families  to twelfth cake and forfeits .   this day last year  mary and i wandered up and down holborn and the streets about for hours  looking after a little table for kate s bedroom  which we bought at last at the very first broker s which we had looked into  and which we had passed half a dozen times because i didn t like to ask the price .  i took her out to brompton at night  as we had no place for her to sleep in  the two mothers being with us   she came back again next day to keep house for me  and stopped nearly the rest of the month .  i shall never be so happy again as in those chambers three storeys high  never if i roll in wealth and fame .  i would hire them to keep empty  if i could afford it .   monday  january  th       .   i began the  sketches of young gentlemen  to day .  one hundred and twenty five pounds for such a little book  without my name to it  is pretty well .  this and the  sunday     by the bye  are the only two things i have not done as boz .   tuesday  january  th       .   went to the sun office to insure my life  where the board seemed disposed to think i work too much .  made forster and pickthorn  my doctor  the references  and after an interesting interview with the board and the board s doctor  came away to work again .   wednesday  january   th       .   at work all day  and to a quadrille party at night .  city people and rather dull .  intensely cold coming home  and vague reports of a fire somewhere .  frederick says the royal exchange  at which i sneer most sagely  for      thursday  january   th       .   to day the papers are full of it  and it was the royal exchange  lloyd s  and all the shops round the building .  called on browne and went with him to see the ruins  of which we saw as much as we should have done if we had stopped at home .   sunday  january   th       .   to church in the morning  and when i came home i wrote the preceding portion of this diary  which henceforth i make a steadfast resolution not to neglect  or paint .  i have not done it yet  nor will i  but say what rises to my lips  my mental lips at least  without reserve .  no other eyes will see it  while mine are open in life  and although i daresay i shall be ashamed of a good deal in it  i should like to look over it at the year s end .   in scott s diary  which i have been looking at this morning  there are thoughts which have been mine by day and by night  in good spirits and bad  since mary died .    another day  and a bright one to the external world again opens on us  the air soft  and the flowers smiling  and the leaves glittering .  they cannot refresh her to whom mild weather was a natural enjoyment .  cerements of lead and of wood already hold her  cold earth must have her soon .  but it is not  .   .   .   she  who will be laid among the ruins .   .   .   .  she is sentient and conscious of my emotions somewhere  where  we cannot tell  how  we cannot tell  yet would i not at this moment renounce the mysterious yet certain hope that i shall see her in a better world  for all that this world can give me .               i have seen her .  there is the same symmetry of form  though those limbs are rigid which were once so gracefully elastic  but that yellow masque with pinched features  which seems to mock life rather than emulate it  can it be the face that was once so full of lively expression .  i will not look upon it again .    i know but too well how true all this is .   monday  january   th       .   here ends this brief attempt at a diary .  i grow sad over this checking off of days  and can t do it .               sidenote  mr .  w .  l .  sammins .        doughty street  london  january   st       .   sir   circumstances have enabled me to relinquish my old connection with the  miscellany     at an earlier period than i had expected .  i am no longer its editor  but i have referred your paper to my successor  and marked it as one  requiring attention .   i have no doubt it will receive it .   with reference to your letter bearing date on the  th of last october  let me assure you that i have delayed answering it  not because a constant stream of similar epistles has rendered me callous to the anxieties of a beginner  in those doubtful paths in which i walk myself  but because you ask me to do that which i would scarce do  of my own unsupported opinion  for my own child  supposing i had one old enough to require such a service .  to suppose that i could gravely take upon myself the responsibility of withdrawing you from pursuits you have already undertaken  or urging you on in a most uncertain and hazardous course of life  is really a compliment to my judgment and inflexibility which i cannot recognize and do not deserve  or desire  .  i hoped that a little reflection would show you how impossible it is that i could be expected to enter upon a task of so much delicacy  but as you have written to me since  and called  unfortunately at a period when i am obliged to seclude myself from all comers   i am compelled at last to tell you that i can do nothing of the kind .   if it be any satisfaction to you to know that i have read what you sent me  and read it with great pleasure  though  as you treat of local matters  i am necessarily in the dark here and there  i can give you the assurance very sincerely .  with this  and many thanks to you for your obliging expressions towards myself   i am  sir  your very obedient servant .    sidenote  mr .  j .  p .  harley .    doughty street  thursday morning .      my dear harley   this is my birthday .  many happy returns of the day to you and me .   i took it into my head yesterday to get up an impromptu dinner on this auspicious occasion  only my own folks  leigh hunt  ainsworth  and forster .  i know you can t dine here in consequence of the tempestuous weather on the covent garden shores  but if you will come in when you have done trinculizing  you will delight me greatly  and add in no inconsiderable degree to the  conviviality  of the meeting .   lord bless my soul .  twenty seven years old .  who d have thought it .  i never did .   but i grow sentimental .   always yours truly .    sidenote  mr .  edward chapman .       devonshire terrace    th december       .   my dear sir   the place where you pledge yourself to pay for my beef and mutton when i eat it  and my ale and wine when i drink it  is the treasurer s office of the middle temple  the new building at the bottom of middle temple lane on the right hand side .  you walk up into the first floor and say  boldly  that you come to sign mr .  charles dickens s bond  which is already signed by mr .  sergeant talfourd .  i suppose i should formally acquaint you that i have paid the fees  and that the responsibility you incur is a very slight one  extending very little beyond my good behaviour  and honourable intentions to pay for all wine glasses  tumblers  or other dinner furniture that i may break or damage .   i wish you would do me another service  and that is to choose  at the place you told me of  a reasonable copy of  the beauties of england and wales .   you can choose it quite as well as i can  or better  and i shall be much obliged to you .  i should like you to send it at once  as i am diving into all kinds of matters at odd minutes with a view to our forthcoming operations .   faithfully yours .   footnotes       this fragment of a diary was found amongst some papers which have recently come to light .  the editors give only those paragraphs which are likely to be of any public interest .  the original manuscript has been added to  the forster collection   at the south kensington museum .        sunday  under three heads   a small pamphlet published about this time .        bentley s miscellany .        no other date  but it must have been  th february       .

compelled to say  prevent me from contributing a paper to your new local magazine .      but i beg you to set me down as a subscriber to it  and foremost among those whose best wishes are enlisted in your cause .  it will afford me real pleasure to hear of your success  for i have many happy recollections connected with kent  and am scarcely less interested in it than if i had been a kentish man bred and born  and had resided in the county all my life .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  thompson .        devonshire terrace  tuesday    th december       .   my dear thompson   i have received a most flattering message from the head turnkey of the jail this morning  intimating that  there warn t a genelman in all london he d be gladder to show his babies to  than muster dickins  and let him come wenever he would to that shop he wos welcome .   but as the governor  who is a very nice fellow and a gentleman  is not at home this morning  and furthermore as the morning itself has rather gone out of town in respect of its poetical allurements  i think we had best postpone our visit for a day or two .   faithfully yours .   footnotes       mr .  adams  the hon .  secretary of the chatham mechanics  institute  which office he held for many years .         the kentish coronal .         an intimate friend .                   .    sidenote  rev .  thomas robinson .           devonshire terrace  york gate  regent s park  thursday  april  th       .   dear sir   i am much obliged to you for your interesting letter .  nor am i the less pleased to receive it  by reason that i cannot find it in my conscience to agree in many important respects with the body to which you belong .   in the love of virtue and hatred of vice  in the detestation of cruelty and encouragement of gentleness and mercy  all men who endeavour to be acceptable to their creator in any way  may freely agree .  there are more roads to heaven  i am inclined to think  than any sect believes  but there can be none which have not these flowers garnishing the way .   i feel it a great tribute  therefore  to receive your letter .  it is most welcome and acceptable to me .  i thank you for it heartily  and am proud of the approval of one who suffered in his youth  even more than my poor child .   while you teach in your walk of life the lessons of tenderness you have learnt in sorrow  trust me that in mine  i will pursue cruelty and oppression  the enemies of all god s creatures of all codes and creeds  so long as i have the energy of thought and the power of giving it utterance .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  the countess of blessington .        devonshire terrace  june  nd       .   dear lady blessington   the year goes round so fast  that when anything occurs to remind me of its whirling  i lose my breath  and am bewildered .  so your handwriting last night had as startling an effect upon me  as though you had sealed your note with one of your own eyes .   i remember my promise  as in cheerful duty bound  and with heaven s grace will redeem it .  at this moment  i have not the faintest idea how  but i am going into scotland on the   th to see jeffrey  and while i am away  i shall return  please god  in about three weeks  will look out for some accident  incident  or subject for small description  to send you when i come home .  you will take the will for the deed  i know  and  remembering that i have a  clock  which always wants winding up  will not quarrel with me for being brief .   have you seen townshend s magnetic boy .  you heard of him  no doubt  from count d orsay .  if you get him to gore house  don t  i entreat you  have more than eight people  four is a better number  to see him .  he fails in a crowd  and is marvellous before a few .   i am told that down in devonshire there are young ladies innumerable  who read crabbed manuscripts with the palms of their hands  and newspapers with their ankles  and so forth  and who are  so to speak  literary all over .  i begin to understand what a blue stocking means  and have not the smallest doubt that lady       for instance  could write quite as entertaining a book with the sole of her foot as ever she did with her head .  i am a believer in earnest  and i am sure you would be if you saw this boy  under moderately favourable circumstances  as i hope you will  before he leaves england .   believe me  dear lady blessington  faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  l .  gaylord clark .    september   th       .   my dear sir   i condole with you from my heart on the loss     you have sustained  and i feel proud of your permitting me to sympathise with your affliction .  it is a great satisfaction to me to have been addressed  under similar circumstances  by many of your countrymen since the  curiosity shop  came to a close .  some simple and honest hearts in the remote wilds of america have written me letters on the loss of children  so numbering my little book  or rather heroine  with their household gods  and so pouring out their trials and sources of comfort in them  before me as a friend  that i have been inexpressibly moved  and am whenever i think of them  i do assure you .  you have already all the comfort  that i could lay before you  all  i hope  that the affectionate spirit of your brother  now in happiness  can shed into your soul .   on the  th of next january  if it please god  i am coming with my wife on a three or four months  visit to america .  the british and north american packet will bring me  i hope  to boston  and enable me  in the third week of the new year  to set my foot upon the soil i have trodden in my day dreams many times  and whose sons  and daughters  i yearn to know and to be among .   i hope you are surprised  and i hope not unpleasantly .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  mrs .  hogarth .        devonshire terrace  sunday  october   th       .   my dear mrs .  hogarth   for god s sake be comforted  and bear this well  for the love of your remaining children .   i had always intended to keep poor mary s grave for us and our dear children  and for you .  but if it will be any comfort to you to have poor george buried there  i will cheerfully arrange to place the ground at your entire disposal .  do not consider me in any way .  consult only your own heart .  mine seems to tell me that as they both died so young and so suddenly  they ought both to be buried together .   try  do try  to think that they have but preceded you to happiness  and will meet you with joy in heaven .  there is consolation in the knowledge that you have treasure there  and that while you live on earth  there are creatures among the angels  who owed their being to you .   always yours with true affection .    sidenote  mr .  washington irving .    my dear sir       there is no man in the world who could have given me the heartfelt pleasure you have  by your kind note of the   th of last month .  there is no living writer  and there are very few among the dead  whose approbation i should feel so proud to earn .  and with everything you have written upon my shelves  and in my thoughts  and in my heart of hearts  i may honestly and truly say so .  if you could know how earnestly i write this  you would be glad to read it  as i hope you will be  faintly guessing at the warmth of the hand i autobiographically hold out to you over the broad atlantic .   i wish i could find in your welcome letter some hint of an intention to visit england .  i can t .  i have held it at arm s length  and taken a bird s eye view of it  after reading it a great many times  but there is no greater encouragement in it this way than on a microscopic inspection .  i should love to go with you  as i have gone  god knows how often  into little britain  and eastcheap  and green arbour court  and westminster abbey .  i should like to travel with you  outside the last of the coaches down to bracebridge hall .  it would make my heart glad to compare notes with you about that shabby gentleman in the oilcloth hat and red nose  who sat in the nine cornered back parlour of the masons  arms  and about robert preston and the tallow chandler s widow  whose sitting room is second nature to me  and about all those delightful places and people that i used to walk about and dream of in the daytime  when a very small and not over particularly taken care of boy .  i have a good deal to say  too  about that dashing alonzo de ojeda  that you can t help being fonder of than you ought to be  and much to hear concerning moorish legend  and poor unhappy boabdil .  diedrich knickerbocker i have worn to death in my pocket  and yet i should show you his mutilated carcass with a joy past all expression .   i have been so accustomed to associate you with my pleasantest and happiest thoughts  and with my leisure hours  that i rush at once into full confidence with you  and fall  as it were naturally  and by the very laws of gravity  into your open arms .  questions come thronging to my pen as to the lips of people who meet after long hoping to do so .  i don t know what to say first or what to leave unsaid  and am constantly disposed to break off and tell you again how glad i am this moment has arrived .   my dear washington irving  i cannot thank you enough for your cordial and generous praise  or tell you what deep and lasting gratification it has given me .  i hope to have many letters from you  and to exchange a frequent correspondence .  i send this to say so .  after the first two or three i shall settle down into a connected style  and become gradually rational .   you know what the feeling is  after having written a letter  sealed it  and sent it off .  i shall picture your reading this  and answering it before it has lain one night in the post office .  ten to one that before the fastest packet could reach new york i shall be writing again .   do you suppose the post office clerks care

.    fuller s hotel  washington  monday  march   th       .   my dear felton       i was more delighted than i can possibly tell you  to receive  last saturday night  your welcome letter .  we and the oysters missed you terribly in new york .  you carried away with you more than half the delight and pleasure of my new world  and i heartily wish you could bring it back again .   there are very interesting men in this place  highly interesting  of course  but it s not a comfortable place  is it .  if spittle could wait at table we should be nobly attended  but as that property has not been imparted to it in the present state of mechanical science  we are rather lonely and orphan like  in respect of  being looked arter .   a blithe black was introduced on our arrival  as our peculiar and especial attendant .  he is the only gentleman in the town who has a peculiar delicacy in intruding upon my valuable time .  it usually takes seven rings and a threatening message from      to produce him  and when he comes he goes to fetch something  and  forgetting it by the way  comes back no more .   we have been in great distress  really in distress  at the non arrival of the caledonia .  you may conceive what our joy was  when  while we were dining out yesterday  h .  arrived with the joyful intelligence of her safety .  the very news of her having really arrived seemed to diminish the distance between ourselves and home  by one half at least .   and this morning  though we have not yet received our heap of despatches  for which we are looking eagerly forward to this night s mail   this morning there reached us unexpectedly  through the government bag  heaven knows how they came there .    two of our many and long looked for letters  wherein was a circumstantial account of the whole conduct and behaviour of our pets  with marvellous narrations of charley s precocity at a twelfth night juvenile party at macready s  and tremendous predictions of the governess  dimly suggesting his having got out of pot hooks and hangers  and darkly insinuating the possibility of his writing us a letter before long  and many other workings of the same prophetic spirit  in reference to him and his sisters  very gladdening to their mother s heart  and not at all depressing to their father s .  there was  also  the doctor s report  which was a clean bill  and the nurse s report  which was perfectly electrifying  showing as it did how master walter had been weaned  and had cut a double tooth  and done many other extraordinary things  quite worthy of his high descent .  in short  we were made very happy and grateful  and felt as if the prodigal father and mother had got home again .   what do you think of this incendiary card being left at my door last night .   general g .  sends compliments to mr .  dickens  and called with two literary ladies .  as the two l .  l .  s are ambitious of the honour of a personal introduction to mr .  d .   general g .  requests the honour of an appointment for to morrow .   i draw a veil over my sufferings .  they are sacred .  we shall be in buffalo  please heaven  on the   th of april .  if i don t find a letter from you in the care of the postmaster at that place  i ll never write to you from england .   but if i do find one  my right hand shall forget its cunning  before i forget to be your truthful and constant correspondent  not  dear felton  because i promised it  nor because i have a natural tendency to correspond  which is far from being the case   nor because i am truly grateful to you for  and have been made truly proud by  that affectionate and elegant tribute which      sent me  but because you are a man after my own heart  and i love you well .  and for the love i bear you  and the pleasure with which i shall always think of you  and the glow i shall feel when i see your handwriting in my own home  i hereby enter into a solemn league and covenant to write as many letters to you as you write to me  at least .  amen .   come to england .  come to england .  our oysters are small  i know  they are said by americans to be coppery  but our hearts are of the largest size .  we are thought to excel in shrimps  to be far from despicable in point of lobsters  and in periwinkles are considered to challenge the universe .  our oysters  small though they be  are not devoid of the refreshing influence which that species of fish is supposed to exercise in these latitudes .  try them and compare .   affectionately yours .    sidenote  mr .  washington irving .    washington  monday afternoon  march   st       .   my dear irving   we passed through  literally passed through  this place again to day .  i did not come to see you  for i really have not the heart to say  good bye  again  and felt more than i can tell you when we shook hands last wednesday .   you will not be at baltimore  i fear .  i thought  at the time  that you only said you might be there  to make our parting the gayer .   wherever you go  god bless you .  what pleasure i have had in seeing and talking with you  i will not attempt to say .  i shall never forget it as long as i live .  what would i give  if we could have but a quiet week together .  spain is a lazy place  and its climate an indolent one .  but if you have ever leisure under its sunny skies to think of a man who loves you  and holds communion with your spirit oftener  perhaps  than any other person alive  leisure from listlessness  i mean  and will write to me in london  you will give me an inexpressible amount of pleasure .   your affectionate friend .    sidenote  professor felton .    montreal  saturday    st may       .   my dear felton   i was delighted to receive your letter yesterday  and was well pleased with its contents .  i anticipated objection to carlyle s     letter .  i called particular attention to it for three reasons .  firstly  because he boldly said what all the others think  and therefore deserved to be manfully supported .  secondly  because it is my deliberate opinion that i have been assailed on this subject in a manner in which no man with any pretensions to public respect or with the remotest right to express an opinion on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed in any other country .   .   .   .   i really cannot sufficiently thank you  dear felton  for your warm and hearty interest in these proceedings .  but it would be idle to pursue that theme  so let it pass .   the wig and whiskers are in a state of the highest preservation .  the play comes off next wednesday night  the   th .  what would i give to see you in the front row of the centre box  your spectacles gleaming not unlike those of my dear friend pickwick  your face radiant with as broad a grin as a staid professor may indulge in  and your very coat  waistcoat  and shoulders expressive of what we should take together when the performance was over .  i would give something  not so much  but still a good round sum  if you could only stumble into that very dark and dusty theatre in the daytime  at any minute between twelve and three   and see me with my coat off  the stage manager and universal director  urging impracticable ladies and impossible gentlemen on to the very confines of insanity  shouting and driving about  in my own person  to an extent which would justify any philanthropic stranger in clapping me into a strait waistcoat without further inquiry  endeavouring to goad h .  into some dim and faint understanding of a prompter s duties  and struggling in such a vortex of noise  dirt  bustle  confusion  and inextricable entanglement of speech and action as you would grow giddy in contemplating .  we perform  a roland for an oliver    a good night s rest   and  deaf as a post .   this kind of voluntary hard labour used to be my great delight .  the furor has come strong upon me again  and i begin to be once more of opinion that nature intended me for the lessee of a national theatre  and that pen  ink  and paper have spoiled a manager .   oh  how i look forward across that rolling water to home and its small tenantry .  how i busy myself in thinking how my books look  and where the tables are  and in what positions the chairs stand relatively to the other furniture  and whether we shall get there in the night  or in the morning  or in the afternoon  and whether we shall be able to surprise them  or whether they will be too sharply looking out for us  and what our pets will say  and how they ll look  and who will be the first to come and shake hands  and so forth .  if i could but tell you how i have set my heart on rushing into forster s study  he is my great friend  and writes at the bottom of all his letters   my love to felton    and into maclise s painting room  and into macready s managerial ditto  without a moment s warning  and how i picture every little trait and circumstance of our arrival to myself  down to the very colour of the bow on the cook s cap  you would almost think i had changed places with my eldest son  and was still in pantaloons of the thinnest texture .  i left all these things  god only knows what a love i have for them  as coolly and calmly as any animated cucumber  but when i come upon them again i shall have lost all power of self restraint  and shall as certainly make a fool of myself  in the popular meaning of that expression  as ever grimaldi did in his way  or george the third in his .   and not the less so  dear felton  for having found some warm hearts  and left some instalments of earnest and sincere affection  behind me on this continent .  and whenever i turn my mental telescope hitherward  trust me that one of the first figures it will descry will wear spectacles so like yours that the maker couldn t tell the difference  and shall address a greek class in such an exact imitation of your voice  that the very students hearing it should cry   that s he .  three cheers .  hoo ray ay ay ay ay .    about those joints of yours  i think you are mistaken .  they can t be stiff .  at the worst they merely want the air of new york  which  being impregnated with the flavour of last year s oysters  has a surprising effect in rendering the human frame supple and flexible in all cases of rust .   a terrible idea occurred to me as i wrote those words .  the oyster cellars  what do they do when oysters are not in season .  is pickled salmon vended there .  do they sell crabs  shrimps  winkles  herrings .  the oyster openers  what do they do .  do they commit suicide in despair  or wrench open tight drawers and cupboards and hermetically sealed bottles for practice .  perhaps they are dentists out of the oyster season .  who knows .   affectionately yours .    sidenote  the same .       devonshire terrace  york gate  regent s park  london  sunday  july   st       .   my dear felton   of all the monstrous and incalculable amount of occupation that ever beset one unfortunate man  mine has been the most stupendous since i came home .  the dinners i have had to eat  the places i have had to go to  the letters i have had to answer  the sea of business and of pleasure in which i have been plunged  not even the genius of an      or the pen of a      could describe .   wherefore i indite a monstrously short and wildly uninteresting epistle to the american dando  but perhaps you don t know who dando was .  he was an oyster eater  my dear felton .  he used to go into oyster shops  without a farthing of money  and stand at the counter eating natives  until the man who opened them grew pale  cast down his knife  staggered backward  struck his white forehead with his open hand  and cried   you are dando .  .  .   he has been known to eat twenty dozen at one sitting  and would have eaten forty  if the truth had not flashed upon the shopkeeper .  for these offences he was constantly committed to the house of correction .  during his last imprisonment he was taken ill  got worse and worse  and at last began knocking violent double knocks at death s door .  the doctor stood beside his bed  with his fingers on his pulse .   he is going   says the doctor .   i see it in his eye .  there is only one thing that would keep life in him for another hour  and that is  oysters .   they were immediately brought .  dando swallowed eight  and feebly took a ninth .  he held it in his mouth and looked round the bed strangely .   not a bad one  is it .   says the doctor .  the patient shook his head  rubbed his trembling hand upon his stomach  bolted the oyster  and fell back  dead .  they buried him in the prison yard  and paved his grave with oyster shells .   we are all well and hearty  and have already begun to wonder what time next year you and mrs .  felton and dr .  howe will come across the briny sea together .  to morrow we go to the seaside for two months .  i am looking out for news of longfellow  and shall be delighted when i know that he is on his way to london and this house .   i am bent upon striking at the piratical newspapers with the sharpest edge i can put upon my small axe  and hope in the next session of parliament to stop their entrance into canada .  for the first time within the memory of man  the professors of english literature seem disposed to act together on this question .  it is a good thing to aggravate a scoundrel  if one can do nothing else  and i think we can make them smart a little in this way .   .   .   .   i wish you had been at greenwich the other day  where a party of friends gave me a private dinner  public ones i have refused .  c     was perfectly wild at the reunion  and  after singing all manner of marine songs  wound up the entertainment by coming home  six miles  in a little open phaeton of mine  on his head  to the mingled delight and indignation of the metropolitan police .  we were very jovial indeed  and i assure you that i drank your health with fearful vigour and energy .   on board that ship coming home i established a club  called the united vagabonds  to the large amusement of the rest of the passengers .  this holy brotherhood committed all kinds of absurdities  and dined always  with a variety of solemn forms  at one end of the table  below the mast  away from all the rest .  the captain being ill when we were three or four days out  i produced my medicine chest and recovered him .  we had a few more sick men after that  and i went round  the wards  every day in great state  accompanied by two vagabonds  habited as ben allen and bob sawyer  bearing enormous rolls of plaster and huge pairs of scissors .  we were really very merry all the way  breakfasted in one party at liverpool  shook hands  and parted most cordially .   .   .   .   affectionately your faithful friend .   p . s .   i have looked over my journal  and have decided to produce my american trip in two volumes .  i have written about half the first since i came home  and hope to be out in october .  this is  exclusive news   to be communicated to any friends to whom you may like to intrust it  my dear f     .    sidenote  the same .       devonshire terrace  york gate  regent s park  london  september  st       .   my dear felton   of course that letter in the papers was as foul a forgery as ever felon swung for .   .   .   .  i have not contradicted it publicly  nor shall i .  when i tilt at such wringings out of the dirtiest mortality  i shall be another man  indeed  almost the creature they would make me .   i gave your message to forster  who sends a despatch box full of kind remembrances in return .  he is in a great state of delight with the first volume of my american book  which i have just finished   and swears loudly by it .  it is true and honourable i know  and i shall hope to send it you  complete  by the first steamer in november .   your description of the porter and the carpet bags prepares me for a first rate facetious novel  brimful of the richest humour  on which i have no doubt you are engaged .  what is it called .  sometimes i imagine the title page thus   oysters  in  every style  or  openings  of  life  by  young dando .   as to the man putting the luggage on his head  as a sort of sign  i adopt it from this hour .   i date this from london  where i have come  as a good profligate  graceless bachelor  for a day or two  leaving my wife and babbies at the seaside .   .   .   .  heavens .  if you were but here at this minute .  a piece of salmon and a steak are cooking in the kitchen  it s a very wet day  and i have had a fire lighted  the wine sparkles on a side table  the room looks the more snug from being the only undismantled one in the house  plates are warming for forster and maclise  whose knock i am momentarily expecting  that groom i told you of  who never comes into the house  except when we are all out of town  is walking about in his shirt sleeves without the smallest consciousness of impropriety  a great mound of proofs are waiting to be read aloud  after dinner .  with what a shout i would clap you down into the easiest chair  my genial felton  if you could but appear  and order you a pair of slippers instantly .   since i have written this  the aforesaid groom  a very small man  as the fashion is   with fiery red hair  as the fashion is not   has looked very hard at me and fluttered about me at the same time  like a giant butterfly .  after a pause  he says  in a sam wellerish kind of way   i vent to the club this mornin   sir .  there vorn t no letters  sir .    very good  topping .    how s missis  sir .    pretty well  topping .    glad to hear it  sir .  my missis ain t wery well  sir .    no .    no  sir  she s a goin   sir  to have a hincrease wery soon  and it makes her rather nervous  sir  and ven a young voman gets at all down at sich a time  sir  she goes down wery deep  sir .   to this sentiment i replied affirmatively  and then he adds  as he stirs the fire  as if he were thinking out loud    wot a mystery it is .  wot a go is natur  .   with which scrap of philosophy  he gradually gets nearer to the door  and so fades out of the room .   this same man asked me one day  soon after i came home  what sir john wilson was .  this is a friend of mine  who took our house and servants  and everything as it stood  during our absence in america .  i told him an officer .   a wot  sir .    an officer .   and then  for fear he should think i meant a police officer  i added   an officer in the army .    i beg your pardon  sir   he said  touching his hat   but the club as i always drove him to wos the united servants .    the real name of this club is the united service  but i have no doubt he thought it was a high life below stairs kind of resort  and that this gentleman was a retired butler or superannuated footman .   there s the knock  and the great western sails  or steams rather  to morrow .  write soon again  dear felton  and ever believe me .   .   .   .   your affectionate friend .   p . s .   all good angels prosper dr .  howe .  he  at least  will not like me the less  i hope  for what i shall say of laura .    sidenote  the same .       devonshire terrace  york gate  regent s park  london    st december       .   my dear felton   many and many happy new years to you and yours .  as many happy children as may be quite convenient  no more .    and as many happy meetings between them and our children  and between you and us  as the kind fates in their utmost kindness shall favourably decree .   the american book  to begin with that  has been a most complete and thorough going success .  four large editions have now been sold and paid for  and it has won golden opinions from all sorts of men  except our friend in f      who is a miserable creature  a disappointed man in great poverty  to whom i have ever been most kind and considerate  i need scarcely say that   and another friend in b      no less a person than an illustrious gentleman named       who wrote a story called      .  they have done no harm  and have fallen short of their mark  which  of course  was to annoy me .  now i am perfectly free from any diseased curiosity in such respects  and whenever i hear of a notice of this kind  i never read it  whereby i always conceive  don t you .   that i get the victory .  with regard to your slave owners  they may cry  till they are as black in the face as their own slaves  that dickens lies .  dickens does not write for their satisfaction  and dickens will not explain for their comfort .  dickens has the name and date of every newspaper in which every one of those advertisements appeared  as they know perfectly well  but dickens does not choose to give them  and will not at any time between this and the day of judgment .   .   .   .   i have been hard at work on my new book  of which the first number has just appeared .  the paul joneses who pursue happiness and profit at other men s cost will no doubt enable you to read it  almost as soon as you receive this .  i hope you will like it .  and i particularly commend  my dear felton  one mr .  pecksniff and his daughters to your tender regards .  i have a kind of liking for them myself .   blessed star of morning  such a trip as we had into cornwall  just after longfellow went away .  the  we  means forster  maclise  stanfield  the renowned marine painter   and the inimitable boz .  we went down into devonshire by the railroad  and there we hired an open carriage from an innkeeper  patriotic in all pickwick matters  and went on with post horses .  sometimes we travelled all night  sometimes all day  sometimes both .  i kept the joint stock purse  ordered all the dinners  paid all the turnpikes  conducted facetious conversations with the post boys  and regulated the pace at which we travelled .  stanfield  an old sailor  consulted an enormous map on all disputed points of wayfaring  and referred  moreover  to a pocket compass and other scientific instruments .  the luggage was in forster s department  and maclise  having nothing particular to do  sang songs .  heavens .  if you could have seen the necks of bottles  distracting in their immense varieties of shape  peering out of the carriage pockets .  if you could have witnessed the deep devotion of the post boys  the wild attachment of the hostlers  the maniac glee of the waiters .  if you could have followed us into the earthy old churches we visited  and into the strange caverns on the gloomy sea shore  and down into the depths of mines  and up to the tops of giddy heights where the unspeakably green water was roaring  i don t know how many hundred feet below .  if you could have seen but one gleam of the bright fires by which we sat in the big rooms of ancient inns at night  until long after the small hours had come and gone  or smelt but one steam of the hot punch  not white  dear felton  like that amazing compound i sent you a taste of  but a rich  genial  glowing brown  which came in every evening in a huge broad china bowl .  i never laughed in my life as i did on this journey .  it would have done you good to hear me .  i was choking and gasping and bursting the buckle off the back of my stock  all the way .  and stanfield  who is very much of your figure and temperament  but fifteen years older  got into such apoplectic entanglements that we were often obliged to beat him on the back with portmanteaus before we could recover him .  seriously  i do believe there never was such a trip .  and they made such sketches  those two men  in the most romantic of our halting places  that you would have sworn we had the spirit of beauty with us  as well as the spirit of fun .  but stop till you come to england  i say no more .   the actuary of the national debt couldn t calculate the number of children who are coming here on twelfth night  in honour of charley s birthday  for which occasion i have provided a magic lantern and divers other tremendous engines of that nature .  but the best of it is that forster and i have purchased between us the entire stock in trade of a conjurer  the practice and display whereof is intrusted to me .  and o my dear eyes  felton  if you could see me conjuring the company s watches into impossible tea caddies  and causing pieces of money to fly  and burning pocket handkerchiefs without hurting  em  and practising in my own room  without anybody to admire  you would never forget it as long as you live .  in those tricks which require a confederate  i am assisted  by reason of his imperturbable good humour  by stanfield  who always does his part exactly the wrong way  to the unspeakable delight of all beholders .  we come out on a small scale  to night  at forster s  where we see the old year out and the new one in .  particulars shall be forwarded in my next .   i have quite made up my mind that f     really believes he does know you personally  and has all his life .  he talks to me about you with such gravity that i am afraid to grin  and feel it necessary to look quite serious .  sometimes he tells me things about you  doesn t ask me  you know  so that i am occasionally perplexed beyond all telling  and begin to think it was he  and not i  who went to america .  it s the queerest thing in the world .   the book i was to have given longfellow for you is not worth sending by itself  being only a barnaby .  but i will look up some manuscript for you  i think i have that of the american notes complete   and will try to make the parcel better worth its long conveyance .  with regard to maclise s pictures  you certainly are quite right in your impression of them  but he is  such a discursive devil   as he says about himself  and flies off at such odd tangents  that i feel it difficult to convey to you any general notion of his purpose .  i will try to do so when i write again .  i want very much to know about      and that charming girl .   .   .   .  give me full particulars .  will you remember me cordially to sumner  and say i thank him for his welcome letter .  the like to hillard  with many regards to himself and his wife  with whom i had one night a little conversation which i shall not readily forget .  the like to washington allston  and all friends who care for me and have outlived my book .   .   .   .  always  my dear felton   with true regard and affection  yours .    sidenote  mr .  tom hood .    my dear hood   i can t state in figures  not very well remembering how to get beyond a million  the number of candidates for the sanatorium matronship  but if you will ask your little boy to trace figures in the beds of your garden  beginning at the front wall  going down to the cricket ground  coming back to the wall again  and  carrying over  to the next door  and will then set a skilful accountant to add up the whole  the product  as the tutor s assistants say  will give you the amount required .  i have pledged myself  being assured of her capability  to support a near relation of miss e     s  otherwise  i need not say how glad i should have been to forward any wish of yours .   very faithfully yours .   footnotes        this  and all other letters addressed to professor felton  were printed in mr .  field s  yesterdays with authors   originally published in

dear sir   let me hasten to say  in the fullest and most explicit manner  that you have acted a most honourable  open  fair and manly part in the matter of my complaint      for which i beg you to accept my best thanks  and the assurance of my friendship and regard .  i would on no account publish the letter you have sent me for that purpose  as i conceive that by doing so  i should not reciprocate the spirit in which you have written to me privately .  but if you should  upon consideration  think it not inexpedient to set the review right in regard to this point of fact  by a note in the next number  i should be glad to see it there .   in reference to the article itself  it did  by repeating this statement  hurt my feelings excessively  and is  in this respect  i still conceive  most unworthy of its author .  i am at a loss to divine who its author is .  i know he read in some cut throat american paper  this and other monstrous statements  which i could at any time have converted into sickening praise by the payment of some fifty dollars .  i know that he is perfectly aware that his statement in the review in corroboration of these lies  would be disseminated through the whole of the united states  and that my contradiction will never be heard of .  and though i care very little for the opinion of any person who will set the statement of an american editor  almost invariably an atrocious scoundrel  against my character and conduct  such as they may be  still  my sense of justice does revolt from this most cavalier and careless exhibition of me to a whole people  as a traveller under false pretences  and a disappointed intriguer .  the better the acquaintance with america  the more defenceless and more inexcusable such conduct is .  for  i solemnly declare  and appeal to any man but the writer of this paper  who has travelled in that country  for confirmation of my statement  that the source from which he drew the  information  so recklessly put forth again in england  is infinitely more obscene  disgusting  and brutal than the very worst sunday newspaper that has ever been printed in great britain .  conceive the edinburgh review quoting the satirist  or the man about town  as an authority against a man with one grain of honour  or feather weight of reputation .   with regard to yourself  let me say again that i thank you with all sincerity and heartiness  and fully acquit you of anything but kind and generous intentions towards me .  in proof of which  i do assure you that i am even more desirous than before to write for the review  and to find some topic which would at once please me and you .   always faithfully yours .    sidenote  professor felton .       devonshire terrace  york gate  regent s park  london  march  nd       .   my dear felton   i don t know where to begin  but plunge headlong with a terrible splash into this letter  on the chance of turning up somewhere .   hurrah .  up like a cork again  with the north american review in my hand .  like you  my dear       and i can say no more in praise of it  though i go on to the end of the sheet .  you cannot think how much notice it has attracted here .  brougham called the other day  with the number  thinking i might not have seen it   and i being out at the time  he left a note  speaking of it  and of the writer  in terms that warmed my heart .  lord ashburton  one of whose people wrote a notice in the edinburgh which they have since publicly contradicted  also wrote to me about it in just the same strain .  and many others have done the like .   i am in great health and spirits and powdering away at chuzzlewit  with all manner of facetiousness rising up before me as i go on .  as to news  i have really none  saving that       who never took any exercise in his life  has been laid up with rheumatism for weeks past  but is now  i hope  getting better .  my little captain  as i call him  he who took me out  i mean  and with whom i had that adventure of the cork soles  has been in london too  and seeing all the lions under my escort .  good heavens .  i wish you could have seen certain other mahogany faced men  also captains  who used to call here for him in the morning  and bear him off to docks and rivers and all sorts of queer places  whence he always returned late at night  with rum and water tear drops in his eyes  and a complication of punchy smells in his mouth .  he was better than a comedy to us  having marvellous ways of tying his pocket handkerchief round his neck at dinner time in a kind of jolly embarrassment  and then forgetting what he had done with it  also of singing songs to wrong tunes  and calling land objects by sea names  and never knowing what o clock it was  but taking midnight for seven in the evening  with many other sailor oddities  all full of honesty  manliness  and good temper .  we took him to drury lane theatre to see  much ado about nothing .   but i never could find out what he meant by turning round  after he had watched the first two scenes with great attention  and inquiring  whether it was a polish piece .    .   .   .   on the  th of april i am going to preside at a public dinner for the benefit of the printers  and if you were a guest at that table  wouldn t i smite you on the shoulder  harder than ever i rapped the well beloved back of washington irving at the city hotel in new york .   you were asking me  i love to say asking  as if we could talk together  about maclise .  he is such a discursive fellow  and so eccentric in his might  that on a mental review of his pictures i can hardly tell you of them as leading to any one strong purpose .  but the annual exhibition of the royal academy comes off in may  and then i will endeavour to give you some notion of him .  he is a tremendous creature  and might do anything .  but  like all tremendous creatures  he takes his own way  and flies off at unexpected breaches in the conventional wall .   you know h     s book  i daresay .  ah .  i saw a scene of mingled comicality and seriousness at his funeral some weeks ago  which has choked me at dinner time ever since .  c     and i went as mourners  and as he lived  poor fellow  five miles out of town  i drove c     down .  it was such a day as i hope  for the credit of nature  is seldom seen in any parts but these  muddy  foggy  wet  dark  cold  and unutterably wretched in every possible respect .  now  c     has enormous whiskers  which straggle all down his throat in such weather  and stick out in front of him  like a partially unravelled bird s nest  so that he looks queer enough at the best  but when he is very wet  and in a state between jollity  he is always very jolly with me  and the deepest gravity  going to a funeral  you know   it is utterly impossible to resist him  especially as he makes the strangest remarks the mind of man can conceive  without any intention of being funny  but rather meaning to be philosophical .  i really cried with an irresistible sense of his comicality all the way  but when he was dressed out in a black cloak and a very long black hat band by an undertaker  who  as he whispered me with tears in his eyes  for he had known h     many years  was a  character  and he would like to sketch him    i thought i should have been obliged to go away .  however  we went into a little parlour where the funeral party was  and god knows it was miserable enough  for the widow and children were crying bitterly in one corner  and the other mourners  mere people of ceremony  who cared no more for the dead man than the hearse did  were talking quite coolly and carelessly together in another  and the contrast was as painful and distressing as anything i ever saw .  there was an independent clergyman present  with his bands on and a bible under his arm  who  as soon as we were seated  addressed      thus  in a loud emphatic voice   mr .  c      have you seen a paragraph respecting our departed friend  which has gone the round of the morning papers .    yes  sir   says c       i have   looking very hard at me the while  for he had told me with some pride coming down that it was his composition .   oh .   said the clergyman .   then you will agree with me  mr .  c      that it is not only an insult to me  who am the servant of the almighty  but an insult to the almighty  whose servant i am .    how is that  sir .   said c     .   it is stated  mr .  c      in that paragraph   says the minister   that when mr .  h     failed in business as a bookseller  he was persuaded by me to try the pulpit  which is false  incorrect  unchristian  in a manner blasphemous  and in all respects contemptible .  let us pray .   with which  my dear felton  and in the same breath  i give you my word  he knelt down  as we all did  and began a very miserable jumble of an extemporary prayer .  i was really penetrated with sorrow for the family  but when c      upon his knees  and sobbing for the loss of an old friend  whispered me   that if that wasn t a clergyman  and it wasn t a funeral  he d have punched his head   i felt as if nothing but convulsions could possibly relieve me .   .   .   .   faithfully always  my dear felton .    sidenote  mrs .  hogarth .    devonshire terrace   th may       .   my dear mrs .  hogarth   i was dressing to go to church yesterday morning  thinking  very sadly  of that time six years  when your kind note and its accompanying packet were brought to me .  the best portrait that was ever painted would be of little value to you and me  in comparison with that unfading picture we have within us  and of the worst  which      s really is  i can only say  that it has no interest in my eyes  beyond being something which she sat near in its progress  full of life and beauty .  in that light  i set some store by the copy you have sent me  and as a mark of your affection  i need not say i value it very much .  as any record of that dear face  it is utterly worthless .   i trace in many respects a strong resemblance between her mental features and georgina s  so strange a one  at times  that when she and kate and i are sitting together  i seem to think that what has happened is a melancholy dream from which i am just awakening .  the perfect like of what she was  will never be again  but so much of her spirit shines out in this sister  that the old time comes back again at some seasons  and i can hardly separate it from the present .   after she died  i dreamed of her every night for many months  i think for the better part of a year  sometimes as a spirit  sometimes as a living creature  never with any of the bitterness of my real sorrow  but always with a kind of quiet happiness  which became so pleasant to me that i never lay down at night without a hope of the vision coming back in one shape or other .  and so it did .  i went down into yorkshire  and finding it still present to me  in a strange scene and a strange bed  i could not help mentioning the circumstance in a note i wrote home to kate .  from that moment i have never dreamed of her once  though she is so much in my thoughts at all times  especially when i am successful  and have prospered in anything  that the recollection of her is an essential part of my being  and is as inseparable from my existence as the beating of my heart is .   always affectionately .    sidenote  professor felton .    broadstairs  kent  september  st       .   my dear felton   if i thought it in the nature of things that you and i could ever agree on paper  touching a certain chuzzlewitian question whereupon f     tells me you have remarks to make  i should immediately walk into the same  tooth and nail .  but as i don t  i won t .  contenting myself with this prediction  that one of these years and days  you will write or say to me   my dear dickens  you were right  though rough  and did a world of good  though you got most thoroughly hated for it .   to which i shall reply   my dear felton  i looked a long way off and not immediately under my nose .    .   .   .  at which sentiment you will laugh  and i shall laugh  and then  for i foresee this will all happen in my land  we shall call for another pot of porter and two or three dozen of oysters .   now  don t you in your own heart and soul quarrel with me for this long silence .  not half so much as i quarrel with myself  i know  but if you could read half the letters i write to you in imagination  you would swear by me for the best of correspondents .  the truth is  that when i have done my morning s work  down goes my pen  and from that minute i feel it a positive impossibility to take it up again  until imaginary butchers and bakers wave me to my desk .  i walk about brimful of letters  facetious descriptions  touching morsels  and pathetic friendships  but can t for the soul of me uncork myself .  the post office is my rock ahead .  my average number of letters that must be written every day is  at the least  a dozen .  and you could no more know what i was writing to you spiritually  from the perusal of the bodily thirteenth  than you could tell from my hat what was going on in my head  or could read my heart on the surface of my flannel waistcoat .   this is a little fishing place  intensely quiet  built on a cliff  whereon  in the centre of a tiny semicircular bay  our house stands  the sea rolling and dashing under the windows .  seven miles out are the goodwin sands  you ve heard of the goodwin sands .   whence floating lights perpetually wink after dark  as if they were carrying on intrigues with the servants .  also there is a big lighthouse called the north foreland on a hill behind the village  a severe parsonic light  which reproves the young and giddy floaters  and stares grimly out upon the sea .  under the cliff are rare good sands  where all the children assemble every morning and throw up impossible fortifications  which the sea throws down again at high water .  old gentlemen and ancient ladies flirt after their own manner in two reading rooms and on a great many scattered seats in the open air .  other old gentlemen look all day through telescopes and never see anything .  in a bay window in a one pair sits  from nine o clock to one  a gentleman with rather long hair and no neckcloth  who writes and grins as if he thought he were very funny indeed .  his name is boz .  at one he disappears  and presently emerges from a bathing machine  and may be seen  a kind of salmon coloured porpoise  splashing about in the ocean .  after that he may be seen in another bay window on the ground floor  eating a strong lunch  after that  walking a dozen miles or so  or lying on his back in the sand reading a book .  nobody bothers him unless they know he is disposed to be talked to  and i am told he is very comfortable indeed .  he s as brown as a berry  and they do say is a small fortune to the innkeeper who sells beer and cold punch .  but this is mere rumour .  sometimes he goes up to london  eighty miles  or so  away   and then i m told there is a sound in lincoln s inn fields at night  as of men laughing  together with a clinking of knives and forks and wine glasses .   i never shall have been so near you since we parted aboard the george washington as next tuesday .  forster  maclise  and i  and perhaps stanfield  are then going aboard the cunard steamer at liverpool  to bid macready good bye  and bring his wife away .  it will be a very hard parting .  you will see and know him of course .  we gave him a splendid dinner last saturday at richmond  whereat i presided with my accustomed grace .  he is one of the noblest fellows in the world  and i would give a great deal that you and i should sit beside each other to see him play virginius  lear  or werner  which i take to be  every way  the greatest piece of exquisite perfection that his lofty art is capable of attaining .  his macbeth  especially the last act  is a tremendous reality  but so indeed is almost everything he does .  you recollect  perhaps  that he was the guardian of our children while we were away .  i love him dearly .   .   .   .   you asked me  long ago  about maclise .  he is such a wayward fellow in his subjects  that it would be next to impossible to write such an article as you were thinking of about him .  i wish you could form an idea of his genius .  one of these days a book will come out   moore s irish melodies   entirely illustrated by him  on every page .  when it comes  i ll send it to you .  you will have some notion of him then .  he is in great favour with the queen  and paints secret pictures for her to put upon her husband s table on the morning of his birthday  and the like .  but if he has a care  he will leave his mark on more enduring things than palace walls .   and so l     is married .  i remember her well  and could draw her portrait  in words  to the life .  a very beautiful and gentle creature  and a proper love for a poet .  my cordial remembrances and congratulations .  do they live in the house where we breakfasted .   .   .   .   i very often dream i am in america again  but  strange to say  i never dream of you .  i am always endeavouring to get home in disguise  and have a dreary sense of the distance .     propos of dreams  is it not a strange thing if writers of fiction never dream of their own creations  recollecting  i suppose  even in their dreams  that they have no real existence .  i never dreamed of any of my own characters  and i feel it so impossible that i would wager scott never did of his  real as they are .  i had a good piece of absurdity in my head a night or two ago .  i dreamed that somebody was dead .  i don t know who  but it s not to the purpose .  it was a private gentleman  and a particular friend  and i was greatly overcome when the news was broken to me  very delicately  by a gentleman in a cocked hat  top boots  and a sheet .  nothing else .   good god .   i said   is he dead .    he is as dead  sir   rejoined the gentleman   as a door nail .  but we must all die  mr .  dickens  sooner or later  my dear sir .    ah .   i said .   yes  to be sure .  very true .  but what did he die of .   the gentleman burst into a flood of tears  and said  in a voice broken by emotion   he christened his youngest child  sir  with a toasting fork .   i never in my life was so affected as at his having fallen a victim to this complaint .  it carried a conviction to my mind that he never could have recovered .  i knew that it was the most interesting and fatal malady in the world  and i wrung the gentleman s hand in a convulsion of respectful admiration  for i felt that this explanation did equal honour to his head and heart .   what do you think of mrs .  gamp .  and how do you like the undertaker .  i have a fancy that they are in your way .  oh heaven .  such green woods as i was rambling among down in yorkshire  when i was getting that done last july .  for days and weeks we never saw the sky but through green boughs  and all day long i cantered over such soft moss and turf  that the horse s feet scarcely made a sound upon it .  we have some friends in that part of the country  close to castle howard  where lord morpeth s father dwells in state  in his park indeed   who are the jolliest of the jolly  keeping a big old country house  with an ale cellar something larger than a reasonable church  and everything  like goldsmith s bear dances   in a concatenation accordingly .   just the place for you  felton .  we performed some madnesses there in the way of forfeits  picnics  rustic games  inspections of ancient monasteries at midnight  when the moon was shining  that would have gone to your heart  and  as mr .  weller says   come out on the other side .    .   .   .   write soon  my dear felton  and if i write to you less often than i would  believe that my affectionate heart is with you always .  loves and regards to all friends  from yours ever and ever .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  macvey napier .    broadstairs  september   th       .   my dear sir   i hinted  in a letter of introduction i gave mr .  hood to you  that i had been thinking of a subject for the edinburgh .  would it meet the purposes of the review to come out strongly against any system of education based exclusively on the principles of the established church .  if it would  i should like to show why such a thing as the church catechism is wholly inapplicable to the state of ignorance that now prevails  and why no system but one  so general in great religious principles as to include all creeds  can meet the wants and understandings of the dangerous classes of society .  this is the only broad ground i could hold  consistently with what i feel and think on such a subject .  but i could give  in taking it  a description of certain voluntary places of instruction  called  the ragged schools   now existing in london  and of the schools in jails  and of the ignorance presented in such places  which would make a very striking paper  especially if they were put in strong comparison with the effort making  by subscription  to maintain exclusive church instruction .  i could show these people in a state so miserable and so neglected  that their very nature rebels against the simplest religion  and that to convey to them the faintest outlines of any system of distinction between right and wrong is in itself a giant s task  before which mysteries and squabbles for forms must give way .  would this be too much for the review .   faithfully yours .   footnotes        this  and all other letters addressed to mr .  macvey napier  were printed in  selection from the correspondence of the late macvey napier  esq .    editor of the edinburgh review  edited by his son macvey napier .        his complaint was that the reviewer of his  american notes   in the number for january        had represented him as having gone to america as a missionary in the cause of international copyright  an allegation which charles dickens repudiated  and which was rectified in the way he himself suggested .                   .    sidenote  professor felton .    devonshire terrace  london  january  nd       .   my very dear felton   you are a prophet  and had best retire from business straightway .  yesterday morning  new year s day  when i walked into my little workroom after breakfast  and was looking out of window at the snow in the garden  not seeing it particularly well in consequence of some staggering suggestions of last night  whereby i was beset  the postman came to the door with a knock  for which i denounced him from my heart .  seeing your hand upon the cover of a letter which he brought  i immediately blessed him  presented him with a glass of whisky  inquired after his family  they are all well   and opened the despatch with a moist and oystery twinkle in my eye .  and on the very day from which the new year dates  i read your new year congratulations as punctually as if you lived in the next house .  why don t you .   now  if instantly on the receipt of this you will send a free and independent citizen down to the cunard wharf at boston  you will find that captain hewett  of the britannia steamship  my ship   has a small parcel for professor felton of cambridge  and in that parcel you will find a christmas carol in prose  being a short story of christmas by charles dickens .  over which christmas carol charles dickens wept and laughed and wept again  and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner in the composition  and thinking whereof he walked about the black streets of london  fifteen and twenty miles many a night when all the sober folks had gone to bed .   .   .   .  its success is most prodigious .  and by every post all manner of strangers write all manner of letters to him about their homes and hearths  and how this same carol is read aloud there  and kept on a little shelf by itself .  indeed  it is the greatest success  as i am told  that this ruffian and rascal has ever achieved .   forster is out again  and if he don t go in again  after the manner in which we have been keeping christmas  he must be very strong indeed .  such dinings  such dancings  such conjurings  such blindman s buffings  such theatre goings  such kissings out of old years and kissings in of new ones  never took place in these parts before .  to keep the chuzzlewit going  and do this little book  the carol  in the odd times between two parts of it  was  as you may suppose  pretty tight work .  but when it was done i broke out like a madman .  and if you could have seen me at a children s party at macready s the other night  going down a country dance with mrs .  m .   you would have thought i was a country gentleman of independent property  residing on a tiptop farm  with the wind blowing straight in my face every day .   .   .   .   your friend  mr .  p      dined with us one day  i don t know whether i told you this before   and pleased us very much .  mr .  c     has dined here once  and spent an evening here .  i have not seen him lately  though he has called twice or thrice  for k     being unwell and i busy  we have not been visible at our accustomed seasons .  i wonder whether h     has fallen in your way .  poor h     .  he was a good fellow  and has the most grateful heart i ever met with .  our journeyings seem to be a dream now .  talking of dreams  strange thoughts of italy and france  and maybe germany  are springing up within me as the chuzzlewit clears off .  it s a secret i have hardly breathed to anyone  but i  think  of leaving england for a year  next midsummer  bag and baggage  little ones and all  then coming out with such a story  felton  all at once  no parts  sledgehammer blow .   i send you a manchester paper  as you desire .  the report is not exactly done  but very well done  notwithstanding .  it was a very splendid sight  i assure you  and an awful looking audience .  i am going to preside at a similar meeting at liverpool on the   th of next month  and on my way home i may be obliged to preside at another at birmingham .  i will send you papers  if the reports be at all like the real thing .   i wrote to prescott about his book  with which i was perfectly charmed .  i think his descriptions masterly  his style brilliant  his purpose manly and gallant always .  the introductory account of aztec civilisation impressed me exactly as it impressed you .  from beginning to end the whole history is enchanting and full of genius .  i only wonder that  having such an opportunity of illustrating the doctrine of visible judgments  he never remarks  when cortes and his men tumble the idols down the temple steps and call upon the people to take notice that their gods are powerless to help themselves  that possibly if some intelligent native had tumbled down the image of the virgin or patron saint after them nothing very remarkable might have ensued in consequence .   of course you like macready .  your name s felton .  i wish you could see him play lear .  it is stupendously terrible .  but i suppose he would be slow to act it with the boston company .   hearty remembrances to sumner  longfellow  prescott  and all whom you know i love to remember .  countless happy years to you and yours  my dear felton  and some instalment of them  however slight  in england  in the loving company of  the proscribed one .  oh  breathe not his name .    sidenote  sir edward lytton bulwer .    athen  um  thursday afternoon    th january       .   my dear sir edward   i received your kind cheque yesterday  in behalf of the elton family  and am much indebted to you on their behalf .   pray do not believe that the least intentional neglect has prevented me from calling on you  or that i am not sincerely desirous to avail myself of any opportunity of cultivating your friendship .  i venture to say this to you in an unaffected and earnest spirit  and i hope it will not be displeasing to you .   at the time when you called  and for many weeks afterwards  i was so closely occupied with my little carol  the idea of which had just occurred to me   that i never left home before the owls went out  and led quite a solitary life .  when i began to have a little time and to go abroad again  i knew that you were in affliction  and i then thought it better to wait  even before i left a card at your door  until the pressure of your distress had past .   i fancy a reproachful spirit in your note  possibly because i knew that i may appear to deserve it .  but do let me say to you that it would give me real pain to retain the idea that there was any coldness between us  and that it would give me heartfelt satisfaction to know the reverse .   i shall make a personal descent upon you before sunday  in the hope of telling you this myself .  but i cannot rest easy without writing it also .  and if this should lead to a better knowledge in each of us  of the other  believe me that i shall always look upon it as something i have long wished for .   always faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  thompson .        liverpool

dinner .   i wish you had come .  it was really a splendid sight .  the town hall was crammed to the roof by  i suppose  two thousand persons .  the ladies were in full dress and immense numbers  and when dick showed himself  the whole assembly stood up  rustling like the leaves of a wood .  dick  with the heart of a lion  dashed in bravely .  he introduced that about the genie in the casket with marvellous effect  and was applauded to the echo  which did applaud again .  he was horribly nervous when he arrived at birmingham      but when he stood upon the platform  i don t believe his pulse increased ten degrees .  a better and quicker audience never listened to man .   the ladies had hung the hall  do you know what an immense place it is .   with artificial flowers all round .  and on the front of the great gallery  immediately fronting this young gentleman  were the words in artificial flowers  you ll observe   welcome boz  in letters about six feet high .  behind his head  and about the great organ  were immense transparencies representing several fames crowning a corresponding number of dicks  at which victoria  taking out a poetic licence  was highly delighted .

execution .   i have not been neglectful of the poems themselves  i assure you  but have read them with very great pleasure .  they struck me at the first glance as being remarkably nervous

our own house for the whole term of our intended absence abroad  on condition that she had possession of it to day .  we fled  and were driven into this place  which has no convenience for the production of any other banquet than a cold collation of plate and linen  the only comforts we have not left behind us .   my consolation lies in knowing what sort of dinner you would have had if you had come here  and in looking forward to claiming the fulfilment of your kind promise when we are again at home .   always believe me  my dear sir  faithfully yours .    sidenote  countess of blessington .    milan  wednesday  november   th       .   my dear lady blessington   appearances are against me .  don t believe them .  i have written you  in intention  fifty letters  and i can claim no credit for anyone of them  though they were the best letters you ever read   for they all originated in my desire to live in your memory and regard .  since i heard from count d orsay  i have been beset in i don t know how many ways .  first of all  i went to marseilles and came back to genoa .  then i moved to the peschiere .  then some people  who had been present at the scientific congress here  made a sudden inroad on that establishment  and overran it .  then they went away  and i shut myself up for a month  close and tight  over my little christmas book   the chimes .   all my affections and passions got twined and knotted up in it  and i became as haggard as a murderer  long before i wrote  the end .   when i had done that  like  the man of thessaly   who having scratched his eyes out in a quickset hedge  plunged into a bramble bush to scratch them in again  i fled to venice  to recover the composure i had disturbed .  from thence i went to verona and to mantua .  and now i am here  just come up from underground  and earthy all over  from seeing that extraordinary tomb in which the dead saint lies in an alabaster case  with sparkling jewels all about him to mock his dusty eyes  not to mention the twenty franc pieces which devout votaries were ringing down upon a sort of sky light in the cathedral pavement above  as if it were the counter of his heavenly shop .  you know verona .  you know everything in italy  i know .  the roman amphitheatre there delighted me beyond expression .  i never saw anything so full of solemn ancient interest .  there are the four and forty rows of seats  as fresh and perfect as if their occupants had vacated them but yesterday  the entrances  passages  dens  rooms  corridors  the numbers over some of the arches .  an equestrian troop had been there some days before  and had scooped out a little ring at one end of the arena  and had their performances in that spot .  i should like to have seen it  of all things  for its very dreariness .  fancy a handful of people sprinkled over one corner of the great place  the whole population of verona wouldn t fill it now   and a spangled cavalier bowing to the echoes  and the grass grown walls .  i climbed to the topmost seat  and looked away at the beautiful view for some minutes  when i turned round  and looked down into the theatre again  it had exactly the appearance of an immense straw hat  to which the helmet in the castle of otranto was a baby  the rows of seats representing the different plaits of straw  and the arena the inside of the crown .  i had great expectations of venice  but they fell immeasurably short of the wonderful reality .  the short time i passed there went by me in a dream .  i hardly think it possible to exaggerate its beauties  its sources of interest  its uncommon novelty and freshness .  a thousand and one realisations of the thousand and one nights  could scarcely captivate and enchant me more than venice .   your old house at albaro  il paradiso  is spoken of as yours to this day .  what a gallant place it is .  i don t know the present inmate  but i hear that he bought and furnished it not long since  with great splendour  in the french style  and that he wishes to sell it .  i wish i were rich and could buy it .  there is a third rate wine shop below byron s house  and the place looks dull and miserable  and ruinous enough .  old      is a trifle uglier than when i first arrived .  he has periodical parties  at which there are a great many flowerpots and a few ices  no other refreshments .  he goes about  constantly charged with extemporaneous poetry  and is always ready  like tavern dinners  on the shortest notice and the most reasonable terms .  he keeps a gigantic harp in his bedroom  together with pen  ink  and paper  for fixing his ideas as they flow  a kind of profane king david  but truly good natured and very harmless .   pray say to count d orsay everything that is cordial and loving from me .  the travelling purse he gave me has been of immense service .  it has been constantly opened .  all italy seems to yearn to put its hand in it .  i think of hanging it  when i come back to england  on a nail as a trophy  and of gashing the brim like the blade of an old sword  and saying to my son and heir  as they do upon the stage   you see this notch  boy .  five hundred francs were laid low on that day  for post horses .  where this gap is  a waiter charged your father treble the correct amount  and got it .  this end  worn into teeth like the rasped edge of an old file  is sacred to the custom houses  boy  the passports  and the shabby soldiers at town gates  who put an open hand and a dirty coat cuff into the coach windows of all  forestieri .   take it  boy .  thy father has nothing else to give .    my desk is cooling itself in a mail coach  somewhere down at the back of the cathedral  and the pens and ink in this house are so detestable  that i have no hope of your ever getting to this portion of my letter .  but i have the less misery in this state of mind  from knowing that it has nothing in it to repay you for the trouble of perusal .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    covent garden  sunday  noon  december        .   my dear lady blessington   business for other people  and by no means of a pleasant kind  has held me prisoner during two whole days  and will so detain me to day  in the very agony of my departure for italy again  that i shall not even be able to reach gore house once more  on which i had set my heart .  i cannot bear the thought of going away without some sort of reference to the happy day you gave me on monday  and the pleasure and delight i had in your earnest greeting .  i shall never forget it  believe me .  it would be worth going to china  it would be worth going to america  to come home again for the pleasure of such a meeting with you and count d orsay  to whom my love  and something as near it to miss power and her sister as it is lawful to send .  it will be an unspeakable satisfaction to me  though i am not maliciously disposed  to know under your own hand at genoa that my little book made you cry .  i hope to prove a better correspondent on my return to those shores .  but better or worse  or any how  i am ever  my dear lady blessington  in no common degree  and not with an every day regard  yours .   very faithfully yours .   footnotes        on the occasion of a great meeting of the mechanics  institution at liverpool

tired sole to my foot  from having found such an immense number of different resting places for it since i went away .  i write you my last italian letter for this bout  designing to leave here  please god  on the ninth of next month  and to be in london again by the end of june .  i am looking forward with great delight to the pleasure of seeing you once more  and mean to come to gore house with such a swoop as shall astonish the poodle  if  after being accustomed to his own size and sense  he retain the power of being astonished at anything in the wide world .  you know where i have been  and every mile of ground i have travelled over  and every object i have seen .  it is next to impossible  surely  to exaggerate the interest of rome  though  i think  it is very possible to find the main source of interest in the wrong things .  naples disappointed me greatly .  the weather was bad during a great part of my stay there .  but if i had not had mud  i should have had dust  and though i had had sun  i must still have had the lazzaroni .  and they are so ragged  so dirty  so abject  so full of degradation  so sunken and steeped in the hopelessness of better things  that they would make heaven uncomfortable  if they could ever get there .  i didn t expect to see a handsome city  but i expected something better than that long dull line of squalid houses  which stretches from the chiaja to the quarter of the porta capuana  and while i was quite prepared for a miserable populace  i had some dim belief that there were bright rays among them  and dancing legs  and shining sun browned faces .  whereas the honest truth is  that connected with naples itself  i have not one solitary recollection .  the country round it charmed me  i need not say .  who can forget herculaneum and pompeii .   as to vesuvius  it burns away in my thoughts  beside the roaring waters of niagara  and not a splash of the water extinguishes a spark of the fire  but there they go on  tumbling and flaming night and day  each in its fullest glory .   i have seen so many wonders  and each of them has such a voice of its own  that i sit all day long listening to the roar they make as if it were in a sea shell  and have fallen into an idleness so complete  that i can t rouse myself sufficiently to go to pisa on the twenty fifth  when the triennial illumination of the cathedral and leaning tower  and bridges  and what not  takes place .  but i have already been there  and it cannot beat st .  peter s  i suppose .  so i don t think i shall pluck myself up by the roots  and go aboard a steamer for leghorn .  let me thank you heartily for the  keepsake  and the  book of beauty .   they reached me a week or two ago .  i have been very much struck by two papers in them  one  landor s  conversations   among the most charming  profound  and delicate productions i have ever read  the other  your lines on byron s room at venice .  i am as sure that you wrote them from your heart  as i am that they found their way immediately to mine .   it delights me to receive such accounts of maclise s fresco .  if he will only give his magnificent genius fair play  there is not enough cant and dulness even in the criticism of art from which sterne prayed kind heaven to defend him  as the worst of all the cants continually canted in this canting world  to keep the giant down an hour .   our poor friend  the naval governor      has lost his wife  i am sorry to hear  since you and i spoke of his pleasant face .  do not let your nieces forget me  if you can help it  and give my love to count d orsay  with many thanks to him for his charming letter .  i was greatly amused by his account of      .  there was a cold shade of aristocracy about it  and a dampness of cold water  which entertained me beyond measure .   always faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  macvey napier .       devonshire terrace  july   th       .   my dear sir   as my note is to bear reference to business  i will make it as short and plain as i can .  i think i could write a pretty good and a well timed article on the punishment of death  and sympathy with great criminals  instancing the gross and depraved curiosity that exists in reference to them  by some of the outrageous things that were written  done  and said in recent cases .  but as i am not sure that my views would be yours  and as their statement would be quite inseparable from such a paper  i will briefly set down their purport that you may decide for yourself .   society  having arrived at that state in which it spares bodily torture to the worst criminals  and having agreed  if criminals be put to death at all  to kill them in the speediest way  i consider the question with reference to society  and not at all with reference to the criminal  holding that  in a case of cruel and deliberate murder  he is already mercifully and sparingly treated .  but  as a question for the deliberate consideration of all reflective persons  i put this view of the case .  with such very repulsive and odious details before us  may it not be well to inquire whether the punishment of death be beneficial to society .  i believe it to have a horrible fascination for many of those persons who render themselves liable to it  impelling them onward to the acquisition of a frightful notoriety  and  setting aside the strong confirmation of this idea afforded in individual instances  i presume this to be the case in very badly regulated minds  when i observe the strange fascination which everything connected with this punishment  or the object of it  possesses for tens of thousands of decent  virtuous  well conducted people  who are quite unable to resist the published portraits  letters  anecdotes  smilings  snuff takings  of the bloodiest and most unnatural scoundrel with the gallows before him .  i observe that this strange interest does not prevail to anything like the same degree where death is not the penalty .  therefore i connect it with the dread and mystery surrounding death in any shape  but especially in this avenging form  and am disposed to come to the conclusion that it produces crime in the criminally disposed  and engenders a diseased sympathy  morbid and bad  but natural and often irresistible  among the well conducted and gentle .  regarding it as doing harm to both these classes  it may even then be right to inquire  whether it has any salutary influence on those small knots and specks of people  mere bubbles in the living ocean  who actually behold its infliction with their proper eyes .  on this head it is scarcely possible to entertain a doubt  for we know that robbery  and obscenity  and callous indifference are of no commoner occurrence anywhere than at the foot of the scaffold .  furthermore  we know that all exhibitions of agony and death have a tendency to brutalise and harden the feelings of men  and have always been the most rife among the fiercest people .  again  it is a great question whether ignorant and dissolute persons  ever the great body of spectators  as few others will attend   seeing that murder done  and not having seen the other  will not  almost of necessity  sympathise with the man who dies before them  especially as he is shown  a martyr to their fancy  tied and bound  alone among scores  with every kind of odds against him .   i should take all these threads up at the end by a vivid little sketch of the origin and progress of such a crime as hooker s  stating a somewhat parallel case  but an imaginary one  pursuing its hero to his death  and showing what enormous harm he does after the crime for which he suffers .  i should state none of these positions in a positive sledge hammer way  but tempt and lure the reader into the discussion of them in his own mind  and so we come to this at last  whether it be for the benefit of society to elevate even this crime to the awful dignity and notoriety of death  and whether it would not be much more to its advantage to substitute a mean and shameful punishment  degrading the deed and the committer of the deed  and leaving the general compassion to expend itself upon the only theme at present quite forgotten in the history  that is to say  the murdered person .   i do not give you this as an outline of the paper  which i think i could make attractive .  it is merely an exposition of the inferences to which its whole philosophy must tend .   always faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  thompson .    devonshire terrace    th october       .   my dear thompson   roche has not returned  and from what i hear of your movements  i fear i cannot answer for his being here in time for you .   i enclose you  lest i should forget it  the letter to the peschiere agent .  he is the marquis pallavicini s man of business  and speaks the most abominable genoese ever heard .  he is a rascal of course  but a more reliable villain  in his way  than the rest of his kind .   you recollect what i told you of the swiss banker s wife  the english lady .  if you would like christiana     to have a friend at genoa in the person of a most affectionate and excellent little woman  and if you would like to have a resource in the most elegant and comfortable family there  i need not say that i shall be delighted to give you a letter to those who would die to serve me .

is really not mine .  i have been involved for the last fortnight in one maze of distractions  which nothing could have enabled me to anticipate or prevent .  everything i have had to do has been interfered with and cast aside .  i have never in my life had so many insuperable obstacles crowded into the way of my pursuits .  it is as little my fault  believe me  as though i were ill and wrote to you from my bed .  and pray bear as gently as you can with the vexation i occasion you  when i tell you how very heavily it falls upon myself .   faithfully yours .   footnotes        lieut .

we got to paris  in due course  on the friday evening .  we had a pleasant and prosperous journey  having rather cold weather in switzerland and on the borders thereof  and a slight detention of three hours and a half at the frontier custom house  atop of a mountain  in a hard frost and a dense fog .  we came into this house last thursday .  it has a pretty drawing room  approached through four most extraordinary chambers .  it is the most ridiculous and preposterous house in the world  i should think .  it belongs to a marquis castellane  but was fitted  so paul pry poole said  who dined here yesterday  by      in a fit of temporary insanity  i have no doubt .  the dining room is mere midsummer madness  and is designed to represent a bosky grove .   at this present writing  snow is falling in the street  and the weather is very cold  but not so cold as it was yesterday .  i dined with lord normanby on sunday last .  everything seems to be queer and uncomfortable in the diplomatic way  and he is rather bothered and worried  to my thinking .  i found young sheridan  mrs .  norton s brother  the attach   .  i know him very well  and he is a good man for my sight seeing purposes .  there are to be no theatricals unless the times should so adjust themselves as to admit of their being french  to which the markis seems to incline  as a bit of conciliation and a popular move .   lumley  of italian opera notoriety  also dined here yesterday  and seems hugely afeard of the opposition opera at covent garden  who have already spirited away grisi and mario  which he affects to consider a great comfort and relief .  i gave him some uncompromising information on the subject of his pit  and told him that if he didn t conciliate the middle classes  he might depend on being damaged  very decidedly .  the danger of the covent garden enterprise seems to me to be that they are going in for ballet too  and i really don t think the house is large enough to repay the double expense .   forster writes me that mac has come out with tremendous vigour in the christmas book  and took off his coat at it with a burst of such alarming energy that he has done four subjects .  stanfield has done three .  keeleys are making that  change      i was so hot upon at lausanne  and seem ready to spend money with bold hearts  but the cast  as far as i know it  at present  would appear to be black despair and moody madness .  j .  w .  leigh murray  from the princess s  is to be the alfred  and forster says there is a mrs .  gordon at bolton s who must be got for grace .  i am horribly afraid      will do one of the lawyers  and there seems to be nobody but      for marion .  i shall run over and carry consternation into the establishment  as soon as i have done the number .  but i have not begun it yet  though i hope to do so to night  having been quite put out by chopping and changing about  and by a vile touch of biliousness  that makes my eyes feel as if they were yellow bullets .   dombey  has passed its thirty thousand already .  do you remember a mysterious man in a straw hat low crowned  and a petersham coat  who was a sort of manager or amateur man servant at miss kelly s .  mr .  baynton bolt  sir  came out  the other night  as macbeth  at the royal surrey theatre .   there s all my news for you .  let me know  in return  whether you have fought a duel yet with your milingtary landlord  and whether lausanne is still that giddy whirl of dissipation it was wont to be  also full particulars of your fairer and better half  and of the baby .  i will send a christmas book to clermont as soon as i get any copies .  and so no more at present from yours ever .   footnotes        mr .  w .  j .  fox  afterwards m . p .  for oldham  well

anxious to prefer a petition to you to preside at their next annual dinner at the london tavern  and having no personal knowledge of you  have requested me  as one of their trustees  through their secretary  mr .  cullenford  to give them some kind of presentation to you .   i will only say that i have felt great interest in their design  which embraces all sorts and conditions of actors from the first  and it has been maintained by themselves with extraordinary perseverance and determination .  it has been in existence some years  but it is only two years since they began to dine .  at their first festival i presided  at their second  macready .  they very naturally hold that if they could prevail on you to reign over them now they would secure a most powerful and excellent advocate  whose aid would serve and grace their cause immensely .  i sympathise with their feeling so cordially  and know so well that it would certainly be mine if i were in their case  as  indeed  it is  being their friend   that i comply with their request for an introduction .  and i will not ask you to excuse my troubling you  feeling sure that i may use this liberty with you .   believe me always  very faithfully yours .    sidenote  countess of blessington .        rue de courcelles  paris  january   th       .   my dear lady blessington   i feel very wicked in beginning this note  and deeply remorseful for not having begun and ended it long ago .  but you know how difficult it is to write letters in the midst of a writing life  and as you know too  i hope  how earnestly and affectionately i always think of you  wherever i am  i take heart  on a little consideration  and feel comparatively good again .   forster has been cramming into the space of a fortnight every description of impossible and inconsistent occupation in the way of sight seeing .  he has been now at versailles  now in the prisons  now at the opera  now at the hospitals  now at the conservatoire  and now at the morgue  with a dreadful insatiability .  i begin to doubt whether i had anything to do with a book called  dombey   or ever sat over number five  not finished a fortnight yet  day after day  until i half began  like the monk in poor wilkie s story  to think it the only reality in life  and to mistake all the realities for short lived shadows .   among the multitude of sights  we saw our pleasant little bud of a friend  rose ch  ri  play clarissa harlowe the other night .  i believe she does it in london just now  and perhaps you may have seen it .  a most charming  intelligent  modest  affecting piece of acting it is  with a death superior to anything i ever saw on the stage  except macready s lear .  the theatres are admirable just now .  we saw  gentil bernard  at the vari  t  s last night  acted in a manner that was absolutely perfect .  it was a little picture of watteau  animated and talking from beginning to end .  at the cirque there is a new show piece called the  french revolution   in which there is a representation of the national convention  and a series of battles  fought by some five hundred people  who look like five thousand  that are wonderful in their extraordinary vigour and truth .  gun cotton gives its name to the general annual jocose review at the palais royal  which is dull enough  saving for the introduction of alexandre dumas  sitting in his study beside a pile of quarto volumes about five feet high  which he says is the first tableau of the first act of the first piece to be played on the first night of his new theatre .  the revival of moli  re s  don juan   at the fran  ais  has drawn money .  it is excellently played  and it is curious to observe how different their don juan and valet are from our english ideas of the master and man .  they are playing  lucretia borgia  again at the porte st .  martin  but it is poorly performed and hangs fire drearily  though a very remarkable and striking play .  we were at victor hugo s house last sunday week  a most extraordinary place  looking like an old curiosity shop  or the property room of some gloomy  vast  old theatre .  i was much struck by hugo himself  who looks like a genius as he is  every inch of him  and is very interesting and satisfactory from head to foot .  his wife is a handsome woman  with flashing black eyes .  there is also a charming ditto daughter of fifteen or sixteen  with ditto eyes .  sitting among old armour and old tapestry  and old coffers  and grim old chairs and tables  and old canopies of state from old palaces  and old golden lions going to play at skittles with ponderous old golden balls  they made a most romantic show and looked like a chapter out of one of his own books .               sidenote  mr .  edward chapman .

she has printed  and got four woodcuts engraved ready for .  she wants to get it published  something in the form of the christmas books .  i know the story  and it is a very fine one .   will you do it for her .  there is no other risk than putting a few covers on a few copies .  half profits is what she expects and no loss .  she has made appeal to me  and if there is to be a hard hearted ogre in the business at all  i would rather it should be you than i  so i have told her i would make proposals to your mightiness .   answer this straightway  for i have no doubt the fair translator thinks

less than in his triumphs .  you have so often read the human heart well that i can readily forgive your reading mine ill  and greatly wronging me by the supposition that any sentiment towards you but honour and respect has ever found a place in it .   you write as few lines which  dying  you would wish to blot  as most men .  but if you ever know me better  as i hope you may  the fault shall not be mine if you do not   i know you will be glad to have received the assurance that some part of your letter has been written on the sand and that the wind has already blown over it .   faithfully

memory than the enclosed .  it is evidence  i think  of very uncommon power .  i have read it with the greatest interest and surprise  and i am truly obliged to you for giving me the opportunity .  if you should see no objection to telling the young lady herself this much  pray do so  as it is sincere praise .   your criticism of coombe s pamphlet is as justly felt as it is earnestly and strongly written .  i undergo more astonishment and disgust in connection with that question of education almost every day of my life than is awakened in me by any other member of the whole magazine of social monsters that are walking about in these times .   you were in my thoughts when your letter arrived this morning  for we have a half formed idea of reviving our old amateur theatrical company for a special purpose  and even of bringing it bodily to manchester and liverpool  on which your opinion would be very valuable .  if we should decide on monday  when we meet  to pursue our idea in this warm weather  i will explain it to you in detail  and ask counsel of you in regard of a performance at liverpool .  meantime it is mentioned to no one .   your interest in  dombey  gives me unaffected pleasure .  i hope you will find no reason to think worse of it as it proceeds .  there is a great deal to do  one or two things among the rest that society will not be the worse  i hope  for thinking about a little .   may i beg to be remembered to mrs .  hodgson .  you always remember me yourself  i hope  as one who has a hearty interest in all you do and in all you have so admirably done for the advancement of the best objects .   always believe me very faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    regent s park  london  june   th       .   my dear sir   i write to you in reference to a

resolved to play again at one of the large theatres here for the benefit of leigh hunt  and to make a great appeal to all classes of society in behalf of a writer who should have received long ago  but has not yet  some enduring return from his country for all he has undergone and all the good he has done .  it is believed that such a demonstration by literature on behalf of literature  and such a mark of sympathy by authors and artists  for one who has written so well  would be of more service  present and prospective  to hunt than almost any other means of help that could be devised .  and we know  from himself  that it would be most gratifying to his own feelings .   the arrangements are  as yet  in an imperfect state  for the date of their being carried out depends on our being able to get one of the large theatres before the close of the present london season .  in the event of our succeeding  we purpose acting in london  on wednesday the   th of july  and on monday the   th .  on the first occasion we shall play  every man in his humour   and a farce  on the second   the merry wives of windsor   and a farce .   but we do not intend to stop here .  believing that leigh hunt has done more to instruct the young men of england  and to lend a helping hand to those who educate themselves  than any writer in england  we are resolved to come down  in a body  to liverpool and manchester  and to act one night at each place .  and the object of my letter is  to ask you  as the representative of the great educational establishment of liverpool  whether we can count on your active assistance  whether you will form a committee to advance our object  and whether  if we send you our circulars and addresses  you will endeavour to secure us a full theatre  and to enlist the general sympathy and interest in behalf of the cause we have at heart .   i address  by this post  a letter  which is almost the counterpart of the present  to the honorary secretaries of the manchester athen  um .  if we find in both towns such a response as we confidently expect  i would propose  on behalf of my friends  that the liverpool and manchester institutions should decide for us  at which town we shall first appear  and which play we shall act in each place .   i forbear entering into any more details  however  until i am favoured with your reply .   always believe me  my dear sir  faithfully your friend .    sidenote  mr .  alexander ireland .    regent s park  london  june   th       .   dear sir       in the hope that i may consider myself personally introduced to you by dr .  hodgson  of liverpool  i take the liberty of addressing you in this form .   i hear from that friend of ours  that you are greatly interested in all that relates to mr .  leigh hunt  and that you will be happy to promote our design in reference to him .  allow me to assure you of the gratification with which i have received this intelligence  and of the importance we shall all attach to your valuable co operation .   i have received a letter from mr .  langley  of the athen  um  informing me that a committee is in course of formation  composed of directors of that institution  acting as private gentlemen  and others .  may i hope to find that you are one of this body  and that i may soon hear of its proceedings  and be in communication with it .   allow me to thank you beforehand for your interest in the cause  and to look forward to the pleasure of doing so in person  when i come to manchester .   dear sir  very faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    athen  um club  london  saturday  june   th       .   my dear sir   the news of mr .  hunt s pension is quite true .  we do not propose to act in london after this change in his affairs  but we do still distinctly propose to act in manchester and liverpool .  i have set forth the plain state of the case in a letter to mr .  robinson by this post  a counterpart of which i have addressed to liverpool   and to which  in the midst of a most laborious correspondence on the subject  i beg to refer you .   it will be a great satisfaction to us to believe that we shall still be successful in manchester .  there is great and urgent need why we should be so  i assure you .   if you can help to bring the matter speedily into a practical and plain shape  you will render hunt the greatest service .   i fear  in respect to your kind invitation  that neither jerrold nor i will feel at liberty to accept it .  there was a pathetic proposal among us that we should  keep together   and  as president of the society  i am bound  i fear  to stand by the brotherhood with particular constancy .  nor do i think that we shall have more than one very short evening in manchester .   i write in great haste .  the sooner i can know  at broadstairs  in kent  the manchester and liverpool nights  and what the managers say  the better  i hope  will be the entertainments .   my dear sir  very faithfully yours .   p . s .   i enclose a copy of our london circular  issued before the granting of the pension .    sidenote  the same .    broadstairs  kent  july   th       .   my dear sir   i am much indebted to you for the present of your notice of hunt s books .  i cannot praise it better or more appropriately than by saying it is in hunt s own spirit  and most charmingly expressed .  i had the most sincere and hearty pleasure in reading it .       your announcement of  the working man s life  had attracted my attention by reason of the title  which had a great interest for me .      i hardly know if there is something wanting to my fancy in a certain genuine simple air i had looked for in the first part .  but there is great promise in it  and i shall be earnest to know how it proceeds .   now  to leave these pleasant matters  and resume my managerial character  which i shall be heartily glad  between ourselves  to lay down again  though i have none but pleasant correspondents  and the most easily governable company of actors on earth .   i have written to mr .  robinson by this post that i wish these words  from our original london circular  to stand at top of the bills  after  for the benefit of mr .  leigh hunt     it is proposed to devote a portion of the proceeds of this benefit to the assistance of another celebrated writer  whose literary career is at an end  and who has no provision for the decline of his life .    i have also told him that there is no objection to its being known that this is mr .  poole  the author of  paul pry   and  little pedlington   and many comic pieces of great merit  and whose farce of  turning the tables  we mean to finish with in manchester .  beyond what he will get from these benefits  he has no resource in this wide world  i know .  there are reasons which make it desirable to get this fact abroad  and if you see no objection to paragraphing it at your office  sending the paragraph round  if you should please  to the other manchester papers   i should be much obliged to you .   you may like to know  as a means of engendering a more complete individual interest in our actors  who they are .  jerrold and myself you have heard of  mr .  george cruikshank and mr .  leech  the best caricaturists of any time perhaps  need no introduction .  mr .  frank stone  a manchester man  and mr .  egg are artists of high reputation .  mr .  forster is the critic of the examiner  the author of  the lives of the statesmen of the commonwealth   and very distinguished as a writer in the edinburgh review .  mr .  lewes is also a man of great attainments in polite literature  and the author of a novel published not long since  called  ranthorpe .   mr .  costello is a periodical writer  and a gentleman renowned as a tourist .  mr .  mark lemon is a dramatic author  and the editor of punch  a most excellent actor  as you will find .  my brothers play small parts  for love  and have no greater note than the treasury and the city confer on their disciples .  mr .  thompson is a private gentleman .  you may know all this  but i thought it possible you might like to hold the key to our full company .  pray use it as you will .

  th april        monday evening .   my dear bulwer lytton   i confess to small faith in any american profits having international copyright for their aim .  but i will carefully consider blackwood s letter  when i get it  and will call upon you and tell you what occurs to me in reference to it  before i communicate with that northern light .   i have been  going  to write to you for many a day past  to thank you for your kindness to the general theatrical fund people  and for your note to me  but i have waited until i should hear of your being stationary somewhere .  what you said of the  battle of life  gave me great pleasure .  i was thoroughly wretched at having to use the idea for so short a story .  i did not see its full capacity until it was too late to think of another subject  and i have always felt that i might have done a great deal better if i had taken it for the groundwork of a more extended book .  but for an insuperable aversion i have to trying back in such a case  i should certainly forge that bit of metal again  as you suggest  one of these days perhaps .   i have not been special constable myself to day  thinking there was rather an epidemic in that wise abroad .  i walked over and looked at the preparations  without any baggage of staff  warrant  or affidavit .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mrs .  cowden clarke .        devonshire terrace    th april       .   dear mrs .  cowden clarke   i did not understand  when i had the pleasure of conversing with you the other evening  that you had really considered the subject  and desired to play .  but i am very glad to understand it now  and i am sure there will be a universal sense among us of the grace and appropriateness of such a proceeding .  falstaff  who depends very much on mrs .  quickly  may have in his modesty  some timidity about acting with an amateur actress .  but i have no question  as you have studied the part  and long wished to play it  that you will put him completely at his ease on the first night of your rehearsal .  will you  towards that end  receive this as a solemn  call  to rehearsal of  the merry wives  at miss kelly s theatre  to morrow  saturday  week at seven in the evening .   and will you let me suggest another point for your consideration .  on the night when  the merry wives  will not be played  and when  every man in his humour  will be  kenny s farce of  love  law  and physic  will be acted .  in that farce there is a very good character  one mrs .  hilary  which i have seen mrs .  orger  i think  act to admiration   that would have been played by mrs .  c .  jones  if she had acted dame quickly  as we at first intended .  if you find yourself quite comfortable and at ease among us  in mrs .  quickly  would you like to take this other part too .  it is an excellent farce  and is safe  i hope  to be very well done .   we do not play to purchase the house      which may be positively considered as paid for   but towards endowing a perpetual curatorship of it  for some eminent literary veteran .  and i think you will recognise in this even a higher and more gracious object than the securing  even  of the debt incurred for the house itself .   believe me  very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  alexander ireland .    devonshire terrace  may   nd       .   my dear sir   you very likely know that my company of amateurs have lately been playing  with a great reputation  in london here .  the object is   the endowment of a perpetual curatorship of shakespeare s house  to be always held by some one distinguished in literature  and more especially in dramatic literature   and we have already a pledge from the shakespeare house committee that sheridan knowles shall be recommended to the government as the first curator .  this pledge  which is in the form of a minute  we intend to advertise in our country bills .   now  on monday  the  th of june  we are going to play at liverpool  where we are assured of a warm reception  and where an active committee for the issuing of tickets is already formed .  do you think the manchester people would be equally glad to see us again  and that the house could be filled  as before  at our old prices .  if yes  would you and our other friends go  at once  to work in the cause .  the only night on which we could play in manchester would be saturday  the  rd of june .  it is possible that the depression of the times may render a performance in manchester unwise .  in that case i would immediately abandon the idea .  but what i want to know  by return of post is  is it safe or unsafe .  if the former  here is the bill as it stood in london  with the addition  on the back  of a paragraph i would insert in manchester  of which immediate use can be made .  if the latter  my reason for wishing to settle the point immediately is that we may make another use of that saturday night .   assured of your generous feeling i make no apology for troubling you .  a sum of money  got together by these means  will insure to literature  i will take good care of that  a proper expression of itself in the bestowal of an essentially literary appointment  not only now but henceforth .  much is to be done  time presses  and the least added the better .   i have addressed a counterpart of this letter to mr .  francis robinson  to whom perhaps you will communicate the bill .   faithfully yours always .    sidenote  mrs .  cowden clarke .    devonshire terrace  monday evening  july   nd       .   my dear mrs .  clarke   i have no energy whatever  i

if they tumble down  not taken on for an indefinite time at a vast expense  and never   no never  never   wearing lighted candles round their heads .      i am deeply miserable .  a real house like this is insupportable  after that canvas farm wherein i was so happy .  what is a humdrum dinner at half past five  with nobody  but john  to see me eat it  compared with that soup  and the hundreds

i have always done before  and pray believe that i have had the sincerest pleasure and gratification in your co operation and society  valuable and interesting on all public accounts  and personally of no mean worth  nor held in slight regard .   you had a sister once  when we were young and happy  i think they called her emma .  if she remember a bright being who once flitted like a vision

with the sincerity and attention which such a composition demands .   this i have done .  i do not write to express to you the measure of my gratification and pleasure  for i should find that very difficult to be accomplished to my own satisfaction   but simply to say that i have read the poem  and dwelt upon it with the deepest interest  admiration  and delight  and that i feel proud of it as a very good instance of the genius of a great writer of my own time .  i should feel it as a kind of treason to what has been awakened in me by the book  if i were to try to set off my thanks to you  or if i were tempted into being diffuse in its praise .  i am too earnest on the subject to have any misgiving but that i shall convey something of my earnestness to you in the briefest and most

eton to day .  i found that i did stand in some sort committed to mr .  evans  though not so much so but that i could with perfect ease have declined to place charley in his house if i had desired to do so .  i must say  however  that after seeing mr .  cookesley  a most excellent man in his way  and seeing mr .  evans  and mr .  evans s house  i think i should  under any circumstances  have given the latter the preference as to the domestic part of charley s life .  i would certainly prefer to try it .  i therefore thought it best to propose to have mr .  cookesley for his tutor  and to place him as a boarder with mr .  evans .  both gentlemen seemed satisfied with this arrangement  and dr .  hawtrey expressed his approval of it also .   mr .  cookesley  wishing to know what charley could do  asked me if i would object to leaving him there for half an hour or so .  as charley appeared not at all afraid of this proposal  i left him then and there .  on my return  mr .  cookesley said  in high and unqualified terms  that he had been thoroughly well grounded and well taught  that he had examined him in virgil and herodotus  and that he not only knew what he was about perfectly well  but showed an intelligence in reference to those authors which did his tutor great credit .  he really appeared most interested and pleased  and filled me with a grateful feeling towards you  to whom charley owes so much .   he said there were certain verses in imitation of horace  i really forget what sort of verses  to which charley was unaccustomed  and which were a little matter enough in themselves  but were made a great point of at eton  and could be got up well in a month  from an old etonian .   for this purpose he would desire charley to be sent every day to a certain mr .  hardisty  in store street  bedford square  to whom he had already  in my absence  prepared a note .  between ourselves  i must not hesitate to tell you plainly that this appeared to me to be a conventional way of bestowing a little patronage .  but  of course  i had nothing for it but to say it should be done  upon which  mr .  cookesley added that he was then certain that charley  on coming after the christmas holidays  would be placed at once in  the remove   which seemed to surprise mr .  evans when i afterwards told him of it as a high station .   i will take him to this gentleman on monday  and arrange for his going there every day  but  if you will not object  i should still like him to remain with you  and to have the advantage of preparing these annoying verses under your eye until the holidays .  that mr .  cookesley may have his own way thoroughly  i will send charley to mr .  hardisty daily until the school at eton recommences .   let me impress upon you in the strongest manner  not only that i was inexpressibly delighted myself by the readiness with which charley went through this ordeal with a stranger  but that i also saw you would have been well pleased and much gratified if you could have seen mr .  cookesley afterwards .  he had evidently not expected such a result  and took it as not at all an ordinary one .   my dear sir  yours faithfully and obliged .    sidenote  mr .  alexander ireland .     private .   devonshire terrace  london    th december       .   my dear sir   you will not be offended by my saying that  in common with many other men  i think  our london correspondent  one of the greatest nuisances of this kind  inasmuch as our london correspondent  seldom knowing anything  feels bound to know everything  and becomes in consequence a very reckless gentleman in respect of the truthfulness of his intelligence .   in your paper  sent to me this morning  i see the correspondent mentions one       and records how i was wont to feast in the house of the said      .  as i never was in the man s house in my life  or within five miles of it that i know of  i beg you will do me the favour to contradict this .   you will be the less surprised by my begging you to set this right  when i tell you that  hearing of his book  and knowing his history  i wrote to new york denouncing him as  a forger and a thief   that he thereupon put the gentleman who published my letter into prison  and that having but one day before the sailing of the last steamer to collect the proofs printed in the accompanying sheet  which are but a small part of the villain s life   i got them together in short time  and sent them out to justify the character i gave him .  it is not agreeable to me to be supposed to have sat at this amiable person s feasts .   faithfully yours .   footnote        mr .  joseph charles king  the friend of many artists and literary men  conducted a private school  at which the sons of mr .  macready

convenience to hold the great dramatic festival in the last week of october .  the concluding number of  copperfield  will prevent me from leaving here until saturday  the   th of that month .  if i were at my own disposal  i hope i need not say i should be at yours .   forster will tell you with what men we must do the play  and what laurels we would propose to leave for the gathering of new aspirants  of whom i hope you have a reasonable stock in your part of the country .   do you know mary boyle  daughter of the old admiral .  because she is the very best actress i ever saw off the stage  and immeasurably better than a great many i have seen on it .  i have acted with her in a country house in northamptonshire  and am going to do so again next november .  if you know her  i think she would be more than pleased to play  and by giving her something good in a farce we could get her to do mrs .  kitely .  in that case my little sister in law would  go on  for the second lady  and you could do without actresses  besides giving the thing a particular grace and interest .   if we could get mary boyle  we would do  used up   which is a delightful piece  as the farce .  but maybe you know nothing about the said mary  and in that case i should like to know what you would think of doing .   you gratify me more than i can tell you by what you say about  copperfield   the more so as i hope myself that some heretofore deficient qualities are there .  you are not likely to misunderstand me when i say that i like it very much  and am deeply interested in it  and that i have kept and am keeping my mind very steadily upon it .   believe me always  very faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    devonshire terrace  sunday night  november  rd       .   my dear bulwer

gladly undertake the part if it should become necessary .  going after her to day  i found that she and lemon had gone out of town  but will be back to night .  i have written to her  earnestly urging her to the redemption of her offer .  i have no doubt of being able to see her well up in the characters  and i hope you approve of this remedy .  if she once screws her courage to the sticking place  i have no fear of her whatever .  this is what i would say to you .  if i don t see you here  i will write to you at forster s  reporting progress .  don t be discouraged  for i am full of confidence

  on the principle of postponing nothing connected with the great scheme  i have been to ollivier s  where i found our friend the choremusicon in a very shattered state  his mouth wide open  the greater part of his teeth out  his bowels disclosed to the public eye  and his whole system frightfully disordered .  in this condition he is speechless .  i cannot  therefore  report touching his eloquence  but i find he is a piano as well as a choremusicon  that he requires to pass through no intermediate stage between choremusicon and piano  and therefore that he can easily and certainly accompany songs .   now  will you have it .  i am inclined to believe that on the whole  it is the best thing .   i have not heard of anything else having happened to anybody .   if i should not find you gone to australia or elsewhere  and should not have occasion to advertise in the third column of the times  i shall hope not to add to your misfortunes  i dare not say to afford you consolation  by shaking hands with you to morrow night  and afterwards keeping every man connected with the theatrical department to his duty .   ever faithfully yours .                   .    sidenote  the same .    devonshire terrace  sunday night  january  th       .   my dear bulwer   i am so sorry to have missed you .  i had gone down to forster  comedy in hand .   i think it most admirable .      full of character  strong in interest  rich in capital situations  and certain to go nobly .  you know how highly i thought of  money   but i sincerely think these three acts finer .  i did not think of the slight suggestions you make  but i said  en passant  that perhaps the drunken scene might do better on the stage a little concentrated .  i don t believe it would require even that  with the leading up which you propose .  i cannot say too much of the comedy to express what i think and feel concerning it  and i look at it  too  remember  with the yellow eye of an actor .  i should have taken to it  need i say so .   con amore in any case  but i should have been jealous of your reputation  exactly as i appreciate your generosity .  if i had a misgiving of ten lines i should have scrupulously mentioned it .   stone will take the duke capitally  and i will answer for his being got into doing it very well .  looking down the perspective of a few winter evenings here  i am confident about him .  forster will be thoroughly sound and real .  lemon is so surprisingly sensible and trustworthy on the stage  that i don t think any actor could touch his part as he will  and i hope you will have opportunities of testing the accuracy of this prediction .  egg ought to do the author to absolute perfection .  as to jerrold  there he stands in the play .  i would propose leech  well made up  for easy .  he is a good name  and i see nothing else for him .   this brings me to my own part .  if we had anyone  or could get anyone  for wilmot  i could do  i think  something so near your meaning in sir gilbert  that i let him go with a pang .  assumption has charms for me  i hardly know for how many wild reasons  so delightful  that i feel a loss of  oh .  i can t say what exquisite foolery  when i lose a chance of being someone in voice  etc .   not at all like myself .  but  i speak quite freely  knowing you will not mistake me  i know from experience that we could find nobody to hold the play together in wilmot if i didn t do it .  i think i could touch the gallant  generous  careless pretence  with the real man at the bottom of it  so as to take the audience with him from the first scene .  i am quite sure i understand your meaning  and i am absolutely certain that as jerrold  forster  and stone came in  i could  as a mere little bit of mechanics  present them better by doing that part  and paying as much attention to their points as my own  than another amateur actor could .  therefore i throw up my cap for wilmot  and hereby devote myself to him  heart and head .   i ought to tell you that in a play we once rehearsed and never played  but rehearsed several times  and very carefully   i saw lemon do a piece of reality with a rugged pathos in it  which i felt  as i stood on the stage with him to be extraordinarily good .  in the serious part of sir gilbert he will surprise you .  and he has an intuitive discrimination in such things which will just keep the suspicious part from being too droll at the outset  which will just show a glimpse of something in the depths of it .   the moment i come back to town  within a fortnight  please god .   i will ascertain from forster where you are .  then i will propose to you that we call our company together  agree upon one general plan of action  and that you and i immediately begin to see and book our vice presidents  etc .  further  i think we ought to see about the queen .  i would suggest our playing first about three weeks before the opening of the exhibition  in order that it may be the town talk before the country people and foreigners come .  macready thinks with me that a very large sum of money may be got in london .   i propose  for cheapness and many other considerations  to make a theatre expressly for the purpose  which we can put up and take down  say in the hanover square rooms  and move into the country .  as watson wanted something of a theatre made for his forthcoming little go  i have made it a sort of model of what i mean  and shall be able to test its working powers before i see you .  many things that  for portability  were to be avoided in mr .  hewitt s theatre  i have replaced with less expensive and weighty contrivances .   now  my dear bulwer  i have come to the small hours  and am writing alone here  as if i were writing something to do what your comedy will .  at such a time the temptation is strong upon me to say a great deal more  but i will only say this  in mercy to you  that i do devoutly believe that this plan carried  will entirely change the status of the literary man in england  and make a revolution in his position  which no government  no power on earth but his own  could ever effect .  i have implicit confidence in the scheme  so splendidly begun  if we carry it out with a steadfast energy .  i have a strong conviction that we hold in our hands the peace and honour of men of letters for centuries to come  and that you are destined to be their best and most enduring benefactor .   oh .  what a procession of new years might walk out of all this  after we are very dusty .   ever yours faithfully .   p . s .   i have forgotten something .  i suggest this title   knowing the world  or  not so bad as we seem .     sidenote  the same .    devonshire terrace  tuesday night  march  th       .   my dear bulwer   i know you will be glad to hear what i have to tell you .   i wrote to the duke of devonshire this morning  enclosing him the rough proof of the scheme  and plainly telling him what we wanted  i . e .   to play for the first time at his house  to the queen and court .  within a couple of hours he wrote me as follows    dear sir    i have read with very great interest the prospectus of the new endowment which you have confided to my perusal .    your manner of doing so is a proof that i am honoured by your goodwill and approbation .    i m truly happy to offer you my earnest and sincere co operation .  my services  my house  and my subscription will be at your orders .  and i beg you to let me see you before long  not merely to converse upon this subject  but because i have long had the greatest wish to improve our acquaintance  which has  as yet  been only one of crowded rooms .    this is quite princely  i think  and will push us along as brilliantly as heart could desire .  don t you think so too .   yesterday lemon and i saw the secretary of the national provident institution  the best office for the purpose  i am inclined to think  and stated all our requirements .  we appointed to meet the chairman and directors next tuesday  so on the day of our reading and dining i hope we shall have that matter in good time .   the theatre is also under consultation  and directly after the reading we shall go briskly to work in all departments .   i hear nothing but praises of your macready speech  of its eloquence  delicacy  and perfect taste  all of which it is good to hear  though i know it all beforehand as well as most men can tell it me .   ever cordially .    sidenote  the same .    devonshire terrace  tuesday morning    th march       .   my dear bulwer   coming home at midnight last night after our first rehearsal  i find your letter .  i write to entreat you  if you make any change in the first three acts  to let it be only of the slightest kind .  because we are now fairly under way  everybody is already drilled into his place  and in two or three rehearsals those acts will be in a tolerably presentable state .   it is of vital importance that we should get the last two acts soon .  the queen and prince are coming  phipps wrote me yesterday the most earnest letter possible  the time is fearfully short  and we must have the comedy in such a state as that it will go like a machine .  whatever you do  for heaven s sake don t be persuaded to endanger that .   even at the risk of your falling into the pit with despair at beholding anything of the comedy in its present state  if you can by any possibility come down to covent garden theatre to night  do .  i hope you will see in lemon the germ of a very fine presentation of sir geoffrey .  i think topham  too  will do easy admirably .   we really did wonders last night in the way of arrangement .  i see the ground plan of the first three acts distinctly .  the dressing and furnishing and so forth  will be a perfect picture  and i will answer for the men in three weeks  time .   in great haste  my dear bulwer  ever faithfully yours .    sidenote  mrs .  cowden clarke .    great

when wild in inns the noble savage ran  and all the world was a stage  gas lighted in a double sense  by the young gas and the old one .  when emmeline montague  now compton  and the mother of two children  came to rehearse in our new comedy     the other night  i nearly fainted .  the gush of recollection was so overpowering that i couldn t bear it .   i use the portfolio     for managerial papers still .  that s something .   but all this does not thank you for your book .      i have not got it yet  being here with mrs .  dickens  who has been very unwell   but i shall be in town early in the week  and shall bring it down to read quietly on these hills  where the wind blows as freshly as if there were no popes and no cardinals whatsoever  nothing the matter anywhere .  i thank you a thousand times  beforehand  for the pleasure you are going to give me .  i am full of faith .  your sister emma  she is doing work of some sort on the p . s .  side of the boxes  in some dark theatre  i know  but where  i wonder .  w .      has not proposed to her yet  has he .  i understood he was going to offer his hand and heart  and lay his leg     at her feet .   ever faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  mitton .    devonshire terrace    th april       .   my dear mitton   i have been in trouble  or i should have written to you sooner .  my wife has been  and is  far from well .  my poor father s death caused me much distress .  i came to london last monday to preside at a public dinner  played with little dora  my youngest child  before i went  and was told when i left the chair that she had died in a moment .  i am quite happy again  but i have undergone a good deal .   i am not going back to malvern  but have let this house until september  and taken the  fort   at broadstairs .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  sir edward bulwer lytton .    devonshire terrace  monday    th april       .   my dear bulwer   i see you are so anxious  that i shall endeavour to send you this letter by a special messenger .  i think i can relieve your mind completely .   the duke has read the play .  he asked for it a week ago  and had it .  he has been at brighton since .  he called here before eleven on saturday morning  but i was out on the play business  so i went to him at devonshire house yesterday .  he almost knows the play by heart .  he is supremely delighted with it  and critically understands it .  in proof of the latter part of this sentence i may mention that he had made two or three memoranda of trivial doubtful points  every one of which had attracted our attention in rehearsal  as i found when he showed them to me .  he thoroughly understands and appreciates the comedy of the duke  threw himself back in his chair and laughed  as i say of walpole   till i thought he d have choked   about his first duchess  who was a percy .  he suggested that he shouldn t say   you know how to speak to the heart of a noble   because it was not likely that he would call himself a noble .  he thought we might close up the porter and softhead a little more  already done  and was so charmed and delighted to recall the comedy that he was more pleased than any boy you ever saw when i repeated two or three of the speeches in my part for him .  he is coming to the rehearsal to day  we rehearse now at devonshire house  three days a week  all day long   and  since he read the play  has conceived a most magnificent and noble improvement in the devonshire house plan  by which  i daresay  we shall get another thousand or fifteen hundred pounds .  there is not a grain of distrust or doubt in him .  i am perfectly certain that he would confide to me  and does confide to me  his whole mind on the subject .   more than this  the duke comes out the best man in the play .  i am happy to report to you that stone does the honourable manly side of that pride inexpressibly better than i should have supposed possible in him .  the scene where he makes that reparation to the slandered woman is certain to be an effect .  he is not a jest upon the order of dukes  but a great tribute to them .  i have sat looking at the play  as you may suppose  pretty often  and carefully weighing every syllable of it .  i see  in the duke  the most estimable character in the piece .  i am as sure that i represent the audience in this as i am that i hear the words when they are spoken before me .  the first time that scene with hardman was seriously done  it made an effect on the company that quite surprised and delighted me  and whenever and wherever it is done  but most of all at devonshire house  the result will be the same .   everyone is greatly improved .  i wrote an earnest note to forster a few days ago on the subject of his being too loud and violent .  he has since subdued himself with the most admirable pains  and improved the part a thousand per cent .  all the points are gradually being worked and smoothed out with the utmost neatness all through the play .  they are all most heartily anxious and earnest  and  upon the least hitch  will do the same thing twenty times over .  the scenery  furniture  etc .   are rapidly advancing towards completion  and will be beautiful .  the dresses are a perfect blaze of colour  and there is not a pocket flap or a scrap of lace that has not been made according to egg s drawings to the quarter of an inch .  every wig has been made from an old print or picture .  from the duke s snuff box to will s coffee house  you will find everything in perfect truth and keeping .  i have resolved that whenever we come to a weak place in the acting  it must  somehow or other  be made a strong one .  the places that i used to be most afraid of are among the best points now .   will you come to the dress rehearsal on the tuesday evening before the queen s night .  there will be no one present but the duke .   i write in the greatest haste  for the rehearsal time is close at hand  and i have the master carpenter and gasman to see before we begin .   miss coutts is one of the most sensible of women  and if i had not seen the duke yesterday  i would have shown her the play directly .  but there can t be any room for anxiety on the head that has troubled you so much .  you may clear it from your mind as completely as gunpowder plot .   in great haste  ever cordially .    sidenote  the

suffering myself from another kind of malady  a severe  spasmodic  house buying and repairing attack  which has left me extremely weak and all but exhausted .  the seat of the disorder has been the pocket .   i had the kindest of notes from the kindest of men this morning  and am going to see him on wednesday .  of course i mean the duke of devonshire .  can i take anything to chatsworth for you .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  frank stone .    extract from letter to mr .  stone .    th september       .   you never saw such a sight as the sands between this and margate presented yesterday .  this day fortnight a steamer laden with cattle going from rotterdam to the london market  was wrecked on the goodwin  on which occasion  by the bye  the coming in at night of our salvage luggers laden with dead cattle  which where hoisted up upon the pier where they lay in heaps  was a most picturesque and striking sight .  the sea since wednesday has been very rough  blowing in straight upon the land .  yesterday  the shore was strewn with hundreds of oxen  sheep  and pigs  and with bushels upon bushels of apples   in every state and stage of decay  burst open  rent asunder  lying with their stiff hoofs in the air  or with their great ribs yawning like the wrecks of ships  tumbled and beaten out of shape  and yet with a horrible sort of humanity about them .  hovering among these carcases was every kind of water side plunderer  pulling the horns out  getting the hides off  chopping the hoofs with poleaxes  etc .  etc .   attended by no end of donkey carts  and spectral horses with scraggy necks  galloping wildly up and down as if there were something maddening in the stench .  i never beheld such a demoniacal business .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  henry austin .    broadstairs  monday   th september       .   my dear henry   your letter  received this morning  has considerably allayed the anguish of my soul .  our letters crossed  of course  as letters under such circumstances always do .   i am perpetually wandering  in fancy  up and down the house     and tumbling over the workmen  when i feel that they are gone to dinner i become low  when i look forward to their total abstinence on sunday  i am wretched .  the gravy at dinner has a taste of glue in it .  i smell paint in the sea .  phantom lime attends me all the day long .  i dream that i am a carpenter and can t partition off the hall .  i frequently dance  with a distinguished company  in the drawing room  and fall into the kitchen for want of a pillar .   a great to do here .  a steamer lost on the goodwins yesterday  and our men bringing in no end of dead cattle and sheep .  i stood a supper for them last night  to the unbounded gratification of broadstairs .  they came in from the wreck very wet and tired  and very much disconcerted by the nature of their prize  which  i suppose  after all  will have to be recommitted to the sea  when the hides and tallow are secured .  one lean faced boatman murmured  when they were all ruminative over the bodies as they lay on the pier   couldn t sassages be made on it .   but retired in confusion shortly afterwards  overwhelmed by the execrations of the bystanders .   ever affectionately .   p . s .   sometimes i think      s bill will be too long to be added up until babbage s calculating machine shall be improved and finished .  sometimes that there is not paper enough ready made  to carry it over and bring it forward upon .   i dream  also  of the workmen every night .  they make

 and beg to thank you for it  and for your obliging note  cordially .  it is a very curious little volume  deeply interesting  and written  if i may be allowed to say so  with as much power of knowledge and plainness of purpose as modesty .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  sir edward bulwer lytton .    tavistock house  sunday night    th february       .   my dear bulwer   i left liverpool at four o clock this morning  and am so blinded by excitement  gas  and waving hats and handkerchiefs  that i can hardly see to write  but i cannot go to bed without telling you what a triumph we have had .  allowing for the necessarily heavy expenses of all kinds  i believe we can hardly fund less than a thousand pounds out of this trip alone .  and  more than that  the extraordinary interest taken in the idea of the guild by  this grand people of england  down in these vast hives  and the enthusiastic welcome they give it  assure me that we may do what we will if we will only be true and faithful to our design .  there is a social recognition of it which i cannot give you the least idea of .  i sincerely believe that we have the ball at our feet  and may throw it up to the very heaven of heavens .  and i don t speak for myself alone  but for all our people  and not least of all for forster  who has been absolutely stunned by the tremendous earnestness of these great places .   to tell you  especially after your affectionate letter  what i would have given to have had you there would be idle .  but i can most seriously say that all the sights of the earth turned pale in my eyes  before the sight of three thousand people with one heart among them  and no capacity in them  in spite of all their efforts  of sufficiently testifying to you how they believe you to be right  and feel that they cannot do enough to cheer you on .  they understood the play  far better acted by this time than ever you have seen it  as well as you do .  they allowed nothing to escape them .  they rose up  when it was over  with a perfect fury of delight  and the manchester people sent a requisition after us to liverpool to say that if we will go back there in may  when we act at birmingham  as of course we shall  they will joyfully undertake to fill the free trade hall again .  among the tories of liverpool the reception was equally enthusiastic .  we played  two nights running  to a hall crowded to the roof  more like the opera at genoa or milan than anything else i can compare it to .  we dined at the town hall magnificently  and it made no difference in the response .  i said what we were quietly determined to do  when the guild was given as the toast of the night   and really they were so noble and generous in their encouragement that i should have been more ashamed of myself than i hope i ever shall be  if i could have felt conscious of having ever for a moment faltered in the work .   i will answer for birmingham  for any great working town to which we chose to go .  we have won a position for the idea which years upon years of labour could not have given it .  i believe its worldly fortunes have been advanced in this last week fifty years at least .  i feebly express to you what forster  who couldn t be at liverpool  and has not those shouts ringing in his ears  has felt from the moment he set foot in manchester .  believe me we may carry a perfect fiery cross through the north of england  and over the border  in this cause  if need be  not only to the enrichment of the cause  but to the lasting enlistment of the people s sympathy .   i have been so happy in all this that i could have cried on the shortest notice any time since tuesday .  and i do believe that our whole body would have gone to the north pole with me if i had shown them good reason for it .   i hope i am not so tired but that you may be able to read this .  i have been at it almost incessantly  day and night for a week  and i am afraid my handwriting suffers .  but in all other respects i am only a giant refreshed .   we meet next saturday you recollect .  until then  and ever afterwards   believe me  heartily yours .    sidenote  mrs .  cowden clarke .    tavistock

sympathy and remembrance  must know it very well already .   i do assure you that i have hardly ever received anything with so much pleasure in all my life .  they are not faded yet  are on my table here  but never can fade out of my remembrance .   i should be less than a young gas  and more than an old manager  that commemorative portfolio is here too  if i could relieve my heart of half that

of many interesting subjects  but that i felt a delicacy in encroaching on your other occupations .  will you excuse my remarking that to make an article on this particular subject useful  it is essential to address the employed as well as the employers .  in the case of the sheffield grinders the difficulty was  for many years  not with the masters  but the men .  painters who use white lead are with the greatest difficulty persuaded to be particular in washing their hands  and i daresay that i need not remind you that one could not generally induce domestic servants to attend to the commonest sanitary principles in their work without absolutely forcing them to experience their comfort and convenience .   dear sir  very faithfully yours .   footnotes        the  medical aspects of

great bulk of offences in a great number of places are committed by professed thieves  that it will not do to have pet prisoning advocated without grave remonstrance and great care .  that class of prisoner is not to be reformed .  we must begin at the beginning and prevent  by stringent correction and supervision of wicked parents  that class of prisoner from being regularly supplied as if he were a human necessity .   do they teach trades in workhouses and try to fit their people  the worst part of them  for society .  come with me to tothill fields bridewell  and i will show you what a

nearly self supporting .  have you any idea of the difficulty that is found in disposing of prison work  or does he think that the treadmills didn t grind the air because the state or the magistracy objected to the competition of prison labour with free labour  but because the work could not be got .   i never can have any kind of prison discipline disquisition in  h .  w .   that does not start with the first great principle i have laid down  and that does not protest against prisons being considered per se .  whatever chance is given to a man in a prison must be given to a man in a refuge for distress .   the article in itself is very good  but it must have these points in it  otherwise i am not only compromising opinions i am known to hold  but the journal itself is blowing hot and cold  and playing fast and loose in a ridiculous way .    starting a paper in india  is very droll to us .  but it is full of references that the public don t understand  and don t in the least care for .  bourgeois  brevier  minion  and nonpareil  long primer  turn ups  dunning advertisements  and reprints  back forme  imposing stone  and locking up  are all quite out of their way  and a sort of

can obviate them  except in the case of the prison paper   but because if i make a point of doing so always you will feel and judge the more readily both for yourself and me too when i take an italian

montigny  by the t  te noire  at   to morrow morning .  next morning early we mean to try the simplon .   after breakfast to day we ascended to the mer de glace  wonderfully different at this time of the year from when we saw it  a great portion of the ascent being covered with snow  and the climbing very difficult .  regardless of my mule  i walked up and walked down again  to the great admiration of the guides  who pronounced me  an intrepid .   the little house at the top being closed for the winter  and edward having forgotten to carry any brandy  we had nothing to drink at the top  which was a considerable disappointment to the inimitable  who was streaming with perspiration from head to foot .  but we made a fire in the snow with some sticks  and after a not too comfortable rest came down again .  it took a long time  from    to   .   the appearance of chamounix at this time of year is very remarkable .  the travellers are over for the season  the inns are generally shut up  all the people who can afford it are moving off to geneva  the snow is low on the mountains  and the general desolation and grandeur extraordinarily fine .  i wanted to pass by the col de balme  but the snow lies too deep upon it .   you would have been quite delighted if you could have seen the warmth of our old lausanne friends  and the heartiness with which they crowded down on a fearfully bad morning to see us off .  we passed the night at the ecu de gen  ve  in the rooms once our old rooms  at that time  the day before yesterday  occupied by the queen of the french  ex

to wear it on the long mule journey to martigny to morrow .   we get on extremely well .  edward continues as before .  he had never been here  and i took him up to the mer de glace this morning  and had a mule for him .   i shall leave this open  as usual  to add a word or two on our arrival at martigny .  we have had an amusingly absurd incident this afternoon .  when we came here  i saw added to the hotel  our old hotel  and i am now writing in the room where we once dined at the table d h  te  some baths  cold and hot  down on the margin of the torrent below .  this induced us to order three hot baths .  thereupon the keys of the bath rooms were found with immense difficulty  women ran backwards and forwards across the bridge  men bore in great quantities of wood  a horrible furnace was lighted  and a smoke was raised which filled the whole valley .  this began at half past three  and we congratulated each other on the distinction we should probably acquire by being the cause of the conflagration of the whole village .  we sat by the fire until half past five  dinner time   and still no baths .  then edward came up to say that the water was as yet only  tippit   which we suppose to be tepid  but that by half past eight it would be in a noble state .  ever since the smoke has poured forth in enormous volume  and the furnace has blazed  and the women have gone and come over the bridge  and piles of wood have been carried in  but we observe a general avoidance of us by the establishment which still looks like failure .  we have had a capital dinner  the dessert whereof is now on the table .  when we arrived  at nearly seven last night  all the linen in the house  newly washed  was piled in the sitting room  all the curtains were taken down  and all the chairs piled bottom upwards .  they cleared away as much as they could directly  and had even got the curtains up at breakfast this morning .   i am looking forward to letters at genoa  though i doubt if we shall get there  supposing all things right at the simplon  before monday night or tuesday morning .  i found there last night what f     would call  mr .  smith s  story of mont blanc  and took it to bed to read .  it is extremely well and unaffectedly done .  you would be interested in it .   martigny  friday afternoon  october   st .   safely arrived here after a most delightful day  without a cloud .  i walked the whole way .  the scenery most beautifully presented .  we are in the hotel where our old st .  bernard party assembled .   i should like to see you all very much indeed .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  the same .    h  tel de la ville  milan    th october       .   my dearest catherine   the road from chamounix here takes so much more time than i supposed  for i travelled it day and night  and my companions don t at all understand the idea of never going to bed  that we only reached milan last night  though we had been travelling twelve and fifteen hours a day .  we crossed the simplon on sunday  when there was not  as there is not now  a particle of cloud in the whole sky  and when the pass was as nobly grand and beautiful as it possibly can be .  there was a good deal of snow upon the top  but not across the road  which had been cleared .  we crossed the austrian frontier yesterday  and  both there and at the gate of milan  received all possible consideration and politeness .   i have not seen bairr yet .  he has removed from the old hotel to a larger one at a few hours  distance .  the head waiter remembered me very well last night after i had talked to him a little while  and was greatly interested in hearing about all the family  and about poor roche .  the boy we used to have at lausanne is now seventeen and a half  very tall  he says .  the elder girl  fifteen  very like her mother  but taller and more beautiful .  he described poor mrs .  bairr s death  i am speaking of the head waiter before mentioned  in most vivacious italian .  it was all over in ten minutes  he said .  she put her hands to her head one day  down in the courtyard  and cried out that she heard little bells ringing violently in her ears .  they sent off for bairr  who was close by .  when she saw him  she stretched out her arms  said in english   adieu  my dear .   and fell dead .  he has not married again  and he never will .  she was a good woman  my friend went on   excellent woman  full of charity  loved the poor  but un poco furiosa  that was nothing .   the new hotel is just like the old one  admirably kept  excellently furnished  and a model of comfort .  i hope to be at genoa on thursday morning  and to find your letter there .  we have agreed to drop sicily  and to return home by way of marseilles .  our projected time for reaching london is the   th of december .   as this house is full  i daresay we shall meet some one we know at the table d h  te to day .  it is extraordinary that the only travellers we have encountered  since we left paris  have been one horribly vapid englishman and wife whom we dropped at basle  one boring englishman whom we found  and  thank god  left  at geneva  and two english maiden ladies  whom we found sitting on a rock  with parasols  the day before yesterday  in the most magnificent part of the gorge of gondo  the most awful portion of the simplon  there awaiting their travelling chariot  in which  with their money  their parasols  and a perfect shop of baskets  they were carefully locked up by an english servant in sky blue and silver buttons .  we have been in the most extraordinary vehicles  like swings  like boats  like noah s arks  like barges and enormous bedsteads .  after dark last night  a landlord  where we changed horses  discovered that the luggage would certainly be stolen from questo porco d uno carro  this pig of a cart  his complimentary description of our carriage  unless cords were attached to each of the trunks  which cords were to hang down so that we might hold them in our hands all the way  and feel any tug that might be made at our treasures .  you will imagine the absurdity of our jolting along some twenty miles in this way  exactly as if we were in three shower baths and were afraid to pull the string .   we are going to the scala to night  having got the old box belonging to the hotel  the old key of which is lying beside me on the table .  there seem to be no singers of note here now  and it appears for the time to have fallen off considerably .  i shall now bring this to a close  hoping that i may have more interesting jottings to send you about the old scenes and people  from genoa  where we shall stay two days .  you are now  i take it  at macready s .  i shall be greatly interested by your account of your visit there .  we often talk of you all .   edward s italian is  i fear  very weak .  when we began to get really into the language  he reminded me of poor roche in germany .  but he seems to have picked up a little this morning .  he has been unfortunate with the unlucky egg  leaving a pair of his shoes  his favourite shoes  behind in paris  and his flannel dressing gown yesterday morning at domo d ossola .  in all other respects he is just as he was .   egg and collins have gone out to kill the lions here  and i take advantage of their absence to write to you  georgie  and miss coutts .  wills will have told you  i daresay  that cerjat accompanied us on a miserably wet morning  in a heavy rain  down the lake .  by the bye  the wife of one of his cousins  born in france of german parents  living in the next house to haldimand s  is one of the most charming  natural  open faced  and delightful women i ever saw .  madame de      is set up as the great attraction of lausanne  but this capital creature shuts her up altogether .  we have called her  her  the real belle   ever since  the early closing movement .   i am impatient for letters from home  confused ideas are upon me that you are going to white s  but i have no notion when .   take care of yourself  and god bless you .   ever most affectionately .    sidenote  the same .    croce di malta  genoa  friday night  october   th       .   my dearest catherine   as we arrived here later than i had expected  in consequence of the journey from milan being most horribly slow  i received your welcome letter only this morning .  i write this before going to bed  that i may be sure of not being taken by any engagement off the post time to morrow .   we came in last night between seven and eight .  the railroad to turin is finished and opened to within twenty miles of genoa .  its effect upon the whole town  and especially upon that part of it lying down beyond the lighthouse and away by san pietro d arena  is quite wonderful .  i only knew the place by the lighthouse  so numerous were the new buildings  so wide the streets  so busy the people  and so thriving and busy the many signs of commerce .  to day i have seen       the       the       and the       the latter of whom live at nervi  fourteen or fifteen miles off  towards porto fino .  first  of the      .  they are just the same  except that mrs .       s face is larger and fuller  and her hair rather gray .  as i rang at their bell she came out walking  and stared at me .   what .  you don t know me .   said i  upon which she recognised me very warmly  and then said in her old quiet way   i expected to find a ruin .  we heard you had been so ill  and i find you younger and better looking than ever .  but it s so strange to see you without a bright waistcoat .  why haven t you got a bright waistcoat on .   i apologised for my black one  and was sent upstairs  when      presently appeared in a hideous and demoniacal nightdress  having turned out of bed to greet his distinguished countryman .  after a long talk  in the course of which i arranged to dine there on sunday early  before starting by the steamer for naples  and in which they told me every possible and impossible particular about their minutest affairs  and especially about      s marriage  i set off for       at      .  i had found letters from him here  and he had been here over and over again  and had driven out no end of times to the gate to leave messages for me  and really is  in his strange uncouth way  crying glad to see me .  i found him and his wife in a little comfortable country house  overlooking the sea  sitting in a small summer house on wheels  exactly like a bathing machine .  i found her rather pretty  extraordinarily cold and composed  a mere piece of furniture  talking broken english .  through eight months in the year they live in this country place .  she never reads  never works  never talks  never gives an order or directs anything  has only a taste for going to the theatre  where she never speaks either  and buying clothes .  they sit in the garden all day  dine at four  smoke their cigars  go in at eight  sit about till ten  and then go to bed .  the greater part of this i had from      himself in a particularly unintelligible confidence in the garden  the only portion of which that i could clearly understand were the words  and one thing and another   repeated one hundred thousand times .  he described himself as being perfectly happy  and seemed very fond of his wife .   but that   said      to me this morning  looking like the figure head of a ship  with a nutmeg grater for a face   that he ought to be  and must be  and is bound to be  he couldn t help it .    then i went on to the      s  and found them living in a beautiful situation in a ruinous albaro like palace .  coming upon them unawares  i found       with a pointed beard  smoking a great german pipe  in a pair of slippers  the two little girls very pale and faint from the climate  in a singularly untidy state  one  heaven knows why .   without stockings  and both with their little short hair cropped in a manner never before beheld  and a little bright bow stuck on the top of it .       said she had invented this headgear as a picturesque thing  adding that perhaps it was  and perhaps it was not .  she was greatly flushed and agitated  but looked very well  and seems to be greatly liked here .  we had disturbed her at her painting in oils  and i rather received an impression that  what with that  and what with music  the household affairs went a little to the wall .       was teaching the two little girls the multiplication table in a disorderly old billiard room with all manner of maps in it .   having obtained a gracious permission from the lady of the school  i am going to show my companions the sala of the peschiere this morning .  it is raining intensely hard in the regular genoa manner  so that i can hardly hope for genoa s making as fine an impression as i could desire .  our boat for naples is a large french mail boat  and we hope to get there on tuesday or wednesday .  if the day after you receive this you write to the poste restante  rome  it will be the safest course .  friday s letter write poste restante  florence .  you refer to a letter you suppose me to have received from forster  to whom my love .  no letter from him has come to hand .   i will resume my report of this place in my next .  in the meantime  i will not fail to drink dear katey s health to day .  edward has just come in with mention of an english boat on tuesday morning  superior to french boat to morrow  and faster .  i shall inquire at      and take the best .  when i next write i will give you our route in detail .   i am pleased to hear of mr .  robson s success in a serious part  as i hope he will now be a fine actor .  i hope you will enjoy yourself at macready s  though i fear it must be sometimes but a melancholy visit .   good bye  my dear  and believe me ever most affectionately .   sunday    th october .   we leave for naples to morrow morning by the peninsular and oriental company s steamer the valletta .  i send a sketch of our movements that i have at last been able to make .   mrs .       quite came out yesterday .  so did mrs .        in a different manner   by violently attacking mrs .       for painting ill in oils when she might be playing well on the piano .  it rained hard all yesterday  but is finer this morning .  we went over the peschiere in the wet afternoon .  the garden is sorely neglected now  and the rooms are all full of boarding school beds  and most of the fireplaces are closed up  but the old beauty and grandeur of the place were in it still .   this will find you  i suppose  at sherborne .  my heartiest love to dear macready  and to miss macready  and to all the house .  i hope my godson has not forgotten me .   i will think of charley  from whom i have heard here  and soon write to him definitely .  at present i think he had better join me at boulogne .  i shall not bring the little boys over  as  if we keep our time  it would be too long before christmas day .   with love to georgy  ever most affectionately yours .    sidenote  the same .    hotel des   trangers  naples  friday night  november  th       .   my dearest catherine   we arrived here at midday  two days after our intended time  under circumstances which i reserve for georgina s letter  by way of variety  in what forster used to call good health and sp  p  pirits .  we have a charming apartment opposite the sea  a little lower down than the victoria  in the direction of the san carlo theatre  and the windows are now wide open as on an english summer night .  the first persons we found on board at genoa  were emerson tennent  lady tennent  their son and daughter .  they are all here too  in an apartment over ours  and we have all been constantly together in a very friendly way  ever since our meeting .  we dine at the table d h  te  made a league together on board  and have been mutually agreeable .  they have no servant with them  and have profited by edward .  he goes on perfectly well  is always cheerful and ready  has been sleeping on board  upside down  i believe   in a corner  with his head in the wet and his heels against the side of the paddle box  but has been perpetually gay and fresh .   as soon as we got our luggage from the custom house  we packed complete changes in a bag  set off in a carriage for some warm baths  and had a most refreshing cleansing after our long journey .  there was an odd neapolitan attendant  a steady old man  who  bringing the linen into my bath  proposed to  soap me .   upon which i called out to the other two that i intended to have everything done to me that could be done  and gave him directions accordingly .  i was frothed all over with naples soap  rubbed all down  scrubbed with a brush  had my nails cut  and all manner of extraordinary operations performed .  he was as much disappointed  apparently  as surprised not to find me dirty  and kept on ejaculating under his breath   oh  heaven .  how clean this englishman is .   he also remarked that the englishman is as fair as a beautiful woman .  some relations of lord john russell s  going to malta  were aboardship  and we were very pleasant .  likewise there was a mr .  young aboard  an agreeable fellow  not very unlike forster in person  who introduced himself as the brother of the miss youngs whom we knew at boulogne .  he was musical and had much good fellowship in him  and we were very agreeable together also .  on the whole i became decidedly popular  and was embraced on all hands when i came over the side this morning .  we are going up vesuvius  of course  and to herculaneum and pompeii  and the usual places .  the tennents will be our companions in most of our excursions  but we shall leave them here behind us .  naples looks just the same as when we left it  except that the weather is much better and brighter .   on the day before we left genoa  we had another dinner with      at his country place .  he was the soul of hospitality  and really seems to love me .  you would have been quite touched if you could have seen the honest warmth of his affection .  on the occasion of this second banquet  egg made a brilliant mistake that perfectly convulsed us all .  i had introduced all the games with great success  and we were playing at the  what advice would you have given that person .   game .  the advice was  not to bully his fellow creatures .   upon which  egg triumphantly and with the greatest glee  screamed   mr .       .   utterly forgetting      s relationship  which i had elaborately impressed upon him .  the effect was perfectly irresistible and uncontrollable  and the little woman s way of humouring the joke was in the best taste and the best sense .  while i am upon genoa i may add  that when we left the croce the landlord  in hoping that i was satisfied  told me that as i was an old inhabitant  he had charged the prices  as to a genoese .   they certainly were very reasonable .   mr .  and mrs .  sartoris have lately been staying in this house  but are just gone .  it is kept by an english waiting maid who married an italian courier  and is extremely comfortable and clean .  i am getting impatient to hear from you with all home news  and shall be heartily glad to get to rome  and find my best welcome and interest at the post office there .   that ridiculous      and her mother were at the hotel at leghorn the day before yesterday  where the mother  poor old lady .   was so ill from the fright and anxiety consequent on her daughter s efforts at martyrdom  that it is even doubtful whether she will recover .  i learnt from a lady friend of       that all this nonsense originated at nice  where she was stirred up by free kirk parsons  itinerant  any one of whom i take her to be ready to make a semi celestial marriage with .  the dear being who told me all about her was a noble specimen  single  forty  in a clinging flounced black silk dress  which wouldn t drape  or bustle  or fall  or do anything of that sort  and with a leghorn hat on her head  at least  i am serious  six feet round .  the consequence of its immense size  was  that whereas it had an insinuating blue decoration in the form of a bow in front  it was so out of her knowledge behind  that it was all battered and bent in that direction  and  viewed from that quarter  she looked drunk .   my best love to mamey and katey  and sydney the king of the nursery  and harry and the dear little plornishghenter .  i kiss almost all the children i encounter in remembrance of their sweet faces  and talk to all the mothers who carry them .  i hope to hear nothing but good news from you  and to find nothing but good spirits in your expected letter when i come to rome .  i already begin to look homeward  being now at the remotest part of the journey  and to anticipate the pleasure of return .   ever most affectionately .   footnote        charles dickens  mr .  wilkie

of my letter in the beginning .  i have great doubts of the possibility of publishing your story in portions .   but i think it possesses very great merit .  my doubts arise partly from the nature of the interest which i fear requires presentation as a whole  and partly on your manner of relating the tale .  the people do not sufficiently work out their own purposes in dialogue and dramatic action .  you are too much their exponent  what you do for them  they ought to do for themselves .  with reference to publication in detached portions  or  indeed  with a reference to the force of the story in any form   that long stoppage and going back to possess the reader with the antecedents of the clergyman s biography  are rather crippling .  i may mention that i think the boy  the child of the second marriage  a little too  slangy .   i know the kind of boyish slang which belongs to such a character in these times  but  considering his part in the story  i regard it as the author s function to elevate such a characteristic  and soften it into something more expressive of the ardour and flush of youth  and its romance .  it seems to me  too  that the dialogues between the lady and the italian maid are conventional but not natural .  this observation i regard as particularly applying to the maid  and to the scene preceding the murder .  supposing the main objection surmountable  i would venture then to suggest to you the means of improvement in this respect .   the paper is so full of good touches of character  passion  and natural emotion  that i very much wish for a little time to reconsider it  and to try whether condensation here and there would enable us to get it say into four parts .  i am not sanguine of this  for i observed the difficulties as i read it the night before last  but i am very unwilling  i assure you  to decline what has so much merit .   i am going to paris on sunday morning for ten days or so .  i purpose being back again within a fortnight .  if you will let me think of this matter in the meanwhile  i shall at least have done all i can to satisfy my own appreciation of your work .   but if  in the meantime  you should desire to have it back with any prospect of publishing it through other means  a letter  the shortest in the world  from you to mr .  wills at the  household words  office will immediately produce it .  i repeat with perfect sincerity that i am much impressed by its merits  and that if i had read it as the production of an entire stranger  i think it would have made exactly this effect upon me .   my dear miss king  very faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    tavistock house    th february       .   my dear miss king   i have gone carefully over your story again  and quite agree with you that the episode of the clergyman could be told in a very few lines .  startling as i know it will appear to you  i am bound to say that i think the purpose of the whole tale would be immensely strengthened by great compression .  i doubt if it could not be told more forcibly in half the space .   it is certainly too long for  household words   and i fear my idea of it is too short for you .  i am  if possible  more unwilling than i was at first to decline it  but the more i have considered it  the longer it has seemed to grow .  nor can i ask you to try to present it free from that objection  because i already perceive the difficulty  and pain  of such an effort .   to the best of my knowledge  you are wrong about the lady at last  and to the best of my observation  you do not express what you explain yourself to mean in the case of the italian attendant .  i have met with such talk in the romances of maturin s time  certainly never in italian life .   these  however  are slight points easily to be compromised in an hour .  the great obstacle i must leave wholly to your own judgment  in looking over the tale again .   believe me always  very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  w .

assuring you in all truth and earnestness that i am profoundly touched by your generous reference to me .  i do not know how to tell you what a glow it spread over my heart .  out of its fulness i do entreat you to believe that i shall never forget your words of commendation .  if you could wholly know at once how you have moved me  and how you have animated me  you would be the happier i am very certain .   faithfully yours ever .    sidenote  mr .  forster .    tavistock house  friday    th march       .   my dear forster   i have hope of mr .  morley      whom one cannot see without knowing to be a straightforward  earnest man .  i also think higgins     will materially help them .      generally  i quite agree with you that they hardly know what to be at  but it is an immensely difficult subject to start  and they must have every allowance .  at any rate  it is not by leaving them alone and giving them no help  that they can be urged on to success .   travers  too  i think  a man of the anti corn law league order .    higgins told me  after the meeting on monday night  that on the previous evening he had been closeted with       whose letter in that day s paper he had put right for the times .  he had never spoken to      before  he said  and found him a rather muddle headed scotchman as to his powers of conveying his ideas .  he  higgins  had gone over his documents judicially  and with the greatest attention  and not only was      wrong in every particular  except one very unimportant circumstance   but  in reading documents to the house  had stopped short in sentences where no stop was  and by so doing had utterly perverted their meaning .   this is to come out  of course  when said      gets the matter on .  i thought the case so changed  before i knew this  by his letter and that of the other shipowners  that i told morley  when i went down to the theatre  that i felt myself called upon to relieve him from the condition i had imposed .   for the rest  i am quite calmly confident that i only do justice to the strength of my opinions  and use the power which circumstances have given me  conscientiously and moderately  with a right object  and towards the prevention of nameless miseries .  i should be now reproaching myself if i had not gone to the meeting  and  having been  i am very glad .   a good illustration of a government office .       very kindly wrote to me to suggest that  houses of parliament  illustration .  after i had dined on wednesday  and was going to jog slowly down to drury lane  it suddenly came into my head that perhaps his details were wrong .  i had just time to turn to the  annual register   and not one of them was correct .   this is  of course  in close confidence .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  mrs .  winter .    tuesday   rd april       .   my dear maria       a necessity is upon me now  as at most times  of wandering about in my old wild way  to think .  i could no more resist this on sunday or yesterday than a man can dispense with food  or a horse can help himself from being driven .  i hold my inventive capacity on the stern condition that it must master my whole life  often have complete possession of me  make its own demands upon me  and sometimes  for months together  put everything else away from me .  if i had not known long ago that my place could never be held  unless i were at any moment ready to devote myself to it entirely  i should have dropped out of it very soon .  all this i can hardly expect you to understand  or the restlessness and waywardness of an author s mind .  you have never seen it before you  or lived with it  or had occasion to think or care about it  and you cannot have the necessary consideration for it .   it is only half an hour     it is only an afternoon     it is only an evening   people say to me over and over again  but they don t know that it is impossible to command one s self sometimes to any stipulated and set disposal of five minutes   or that the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day .  these are the penalties paid for writing books .  whoever is devoted to an art must be content to deliver himself wholly up to it  and to find his recompense in it .  i am grieved if you suspect me of not wanting to see you  but i can t help it  i must go my way whether or no .   i thought you would understand that in sending the card for the box i sent an assurance that there was nothing amiss .  i am pleased to find that you were all so interested with the play .  my ladies say that the first part is too painful and wants relief .  i have been going to see it a dozen times  but have never seen it yet  and never may .  madame c  leste is injured thereby  you see how unreasonable people are .   and says in the green room   m .  dickens est artiste .  mais il n a jamais vu  janet pride .     it is like a breath of fresh spring air to know that that unfortunate baby of yours is out of her one close room  and has about half a pint of very doubtful air per day .  i could only have become her godfather on the condition that she had five hundred gallons of open air at any rate every day of her life  and you would soon see a rose or two in the face of my other little friend  ella  if you opened all your doors and windows throughout the whole of all fine weather  from morning to night .   i am going off  i don t know where or how far  to ponder about i don t know what .  sometimes i am half in the mood to set off for france  sometimes i think i will go and walk about on the seashore for three or four months  sometimes i look towards the pyrenees  sometimes switzerland .  i made a compact with a great spanish authority last week  and vowed i would go to spain .  two days afterwards layard and i agreed to go to constantinople when parliament rises .  to morrow i shall probably discuss with somebody else the idea of going to greenland or the north pole .  the end of all this  most likely  will be  that i shall shut myself up in some out of the way place i have not yet thought of  and go desperately to work there .   once upon a time i didn t do such things you say .  no .  but i have done them through a good many years now  and they have become myself and my life .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  the same .    tavistock house  wednesday  june   th       .   my dear mrs .  winter   i am truly grieved to hear of your affliction in the loss of your darling baby .  but if you be not  even already  so reconciled to the parting from that innocent child for a little while  as to bear it gently and with a softened sorrow  i know that that not unhappy state of mind must soon arise .  the death of infants is a release from so much chance and change  from so many casualties and distresses  and is a thing so beautiful in its serenity and peace  that it should not be a bitterness  even in a mother s heart .  the simplest and most affecting passage in all the noble history of our great master  is his consideration for little children  and in reference to yours  as many millions of bereaved mothers poor and rich will do in reference to theirs until the end of time  you may take the comfort of the generous words   and he took a child  and set it in the midst of them .    in a book  by one of the greatest english writers  called  a journey from this world to the next   a parent comes to the distant country beyond the grave  and finds the little girl he had lost so long ago  engaged in building a bower to receive him in  when his aged steps should bring him there at last .  he is filled with joy to see her  so young  so bright  so full of promise  and is enraptured to think that she never was old  wan  tearful  withered .  this is always one of the sources of consolation in the deaths of children .  with no effort of the fancy  with nothing to undo  you will always be able to think of the pretty creature you have lost  as a child in heaven .   a poor little baby of mine lies in highgate cemetery  and i laid her just as you think of laying yours  in the catacombs there  until i made a resting place for all of us in the free air .   it is better that i should not come to see you .  i feel quite sure of that  and will think of you instead .   god bless and comfort you .  mrs .  dickens and her sister send their kindest condolences to yourself and mr .  winter .  i add mine with all my heart .   affectionately your friend .    sidenote  mr .  wilkie collins .    tavistock house  sunday   th july       .   my dear collins   i don t know whether you may have heard from webster  or whether the impression i derived from mark s manner on friday may be altogether correct .  but it strongly occurred to me that webster was going to decline the play  and that he really has worried himself into a fear of playing aaron .   now  when i got this into my head  which was during the rehearsal  i considered two things   firstly  how we could best put about the success of the piece more widely and extensively even than it has yet reached  and secondly  how you could be best assisted against a bad production of it hereafter  or no production of it .  i thought i saw immediately  that the point would be to have this representation noticed in the newspapers .  so i waited until the rehearsal was over and we had profoundly astonished the family  and then asked colonel waugh what he thought of sending some cards for tuesday to the papers .  he highly approved  and i yesterday morning directed mitchell to send to all the morning papers  and to some of the weekly ones  a dozen in the whole .   i dined at lord john s yesterday  where meyerbeer was  and said to me after dinner   ah  mon ami illustre .  que c est noble de vous entendre parler d haute voix morale     la table d un ministre .   for i gave them a little bit of truth about sunday that was like bringing a sebastopol battery among the polite company   i say  after this long parenthesis  i dined at lord john s  and found great interest and talk about the play  and about what everybody who had been here had said of it .  and i was confirmed in my decision that the thing for you was the invitation to the papers .  hence i write to tell you what i have done .   i dine at home at half past five if you are disengaged  and i shall be at home all the evening .   ever faithfully .   note  by mr .  wilkie collins  .   this characteristically kind endeavour to induce managers of theatres to produce  the lighthouse   after the amateur performances of the play  was not attended with any immediate success .  the work remained in the author s desk until messrs .  robson and emden undertook the management of the olympic theatre .  they opened their first season with  the lighthouse   the part of aaron gurnock being performed by mr .  f .  robson .   w .  c .    sidenote  miss emily jolly .       albion villas  folkestone  kent  tuesday    th july       .   dear madam       your manuscript  entitled a  wife s story   has come under my own perusal within these last three or four days .  i recognise in it such great merit and unusual promise  and i think it displays so much power and knowledge of the human heart  that i feel a strong interest in you as its writer .   i have begged the gentleman  who is in my confidence as to the transaction of the business of  household words   to return the ms .  to you by the post  which  as i hope  will convey this note to you .  my object is this  i particularly entreat you to consider the catastrophe .  you write to be read  of course .  the close of the story is unnecessarily painful  will throw off numbers of persons who would otherwise read it  and who  as it stands  will be deterred by hearsay from so doing  and is so tremendous a piece of severity  that it will defeat your purpose .  all my knowledge and experience  such as they are  lead me straight to the recommendation that you will do well to spare the life of the husband  and of one of the children .  let her suppose the former dead  from seeing him brought in wounded and insensible  lose nothing of the progress of her mental suffering afterwards when that doctor is in attendance upon her  but bring her round at last to the blessed surprise that her husband is still living  and that a repentance which can be worked out  in the way of atonement for the misery she has occasioned to the man whom she so ill repaid for his love  and made so miserable  lies before her .  so will you soften the reader whom you now as it were harden  and so you will bring tears from many eyes  which can only have their spring in affectionately and gently touched hearts .  i am perfectly certain that with this change  all the previous part of your tale will tell for twenty times as much as it can in its present condition .  and it is because i believe you have a great fame before you if you do justice to the remarkable ability you possess  that i venture to offer you this advice in what i suppose to be the beginning of your career .   i observe some parts of the story which would be strengthened  even in their psychological interest  by condensation here and there .  if you will leave that to me  i will perform the task as conscientiously and carefully as if it were my own .  but the suggestion i offer for your acceptance  no one but yourself can act upon .   let me conclude this hasty note with the plain assurance that i have never been so much surprised and struck by any manuscript i have read  as i have been by yours .   your faithful servant .    sidenote  the same .       albion villas  folkestone  july   st       .   dear madam   i did not enter  in detail  on the spirit of the alteration i propose in your story  because i thought it right that you should think out that for yourself if you applied yourself to the change .  i can now assure you that you describe it exactly as i had conceived it  and if i had wanted anything to confirm me in my conviction of its being right  our both seeing it so precisely from the same point of view  would be ample assurance to me .   i would leave her new and altered life to be inferred .  it does not appear to me either necessary or practicable  within such limits  to do more than that .  do not be uneasy if you find the alteration demanding time .  i shall quite understand that  and my interest will keep .  when you finish the story  send it to mr .  wills .  besides being in daily communication with him  i am at the office once a week  and i will go over it in print  before the proof is sent to you .   very faithfully yours .        .        sidenote  captain morgan .    dear friend       i am always delighted to hear from you .  your genial earnestness does me good to think of .  and every day of my life i feel more and more that to be thoroughly in earnest is everything  and to be anything short of it is nothing .  you see what we have been doing to our valiant soldiers .      you see what miserable humbugs we are .  and because we have got involved in meshes of aristocratic red tape to our unspeakable confusion  loss  and sorrow  the gentlemen who have been so kind as to ruin us are going to give us a day of humiliation and fasting the day after to morrow .  i am sick and sour to think of such things at this age of the world .   .   .   .  i am in the first stage of a new book  which consists in going round and round the idea  as you see a bird in his cage go about and about his sugar before he touches it .   always most cordially yours .   footnotes        the editors have great pleasure in publishing another note to mr .  thackeray  which has been found and sent to them by his

gentlemen   i have received a letter signed by you  which i assume to be written mainly on behalf of what are called working men and their families  inviting me to attend a meeting in our parish vestry hall this evening on the subject of the stoppage of the sunday bands in the parks .   i thoroughly agree with you that those bands have afforded an innocent and healthful enjoyment on the sunday afternoon  to which the people have a right .  but i think it essential that the working people should  of themselves and by themselves  assert that right .  they have been informed  on the high authority of their first minister  lately rather in want of house of commons votes i am told  that they are almost indifferent to it .  the correction of that mistake  if official omniscience can be mistaken  lies with themselves .  in case it should be considered by the meeting  which i prefer for this reason not to attend  expedient to unite with other metropolitan parishes in forming a fund for the payment of such expenses as may be incurred in peaceably and numerously representing to the governing powers that the harmless recreation they have taken away is very much wanted  i beg you to put down my name as a subscriber of ten pounds .   and i am  your faithful servant .    sidenote  mr .  washington irving .    tavistock house  london  july  th       .   my dear irving   if you knew how often i write to you individually and personally in my books  you would be no more surprised in seeing this note than you were in seeing me do my duty by that flowery julep  in what i dreamily apprehend to have been a former state of existence  at baltimore .   will you let me present to you a cousin of mine  mr .  b      who is associated with a merchant s house in new york .  of course he wants to see you  and know you .  how can i wonder at that .  how can anybody .   i had a long talk with leslie at the last academy dinner  having previously been with him in paris   and he told me that you were flourishing .  i suppose you know that he wears a moustache  so do i for the matter of that  and a beard too  and that he looks like a portrait of don quixote .   holland house has four and twenty youthful pages in it now  twelve for my lord  and twelve for my lady  and no clergyman coils his leg up under his chair all dinner time  and begins to uncurve it when the hostess goes .  no wheeled chair runs smoothly in with that beaming face in it  and      s little cotton pocket handkerchief helped to make  i believe  this very sheet of paper .  a half sad  half ludicrous story of rogers is all i will sully it with .  you know  i daresay  that for a year or so before his death he wandered  and lost himself like one of the children in the wood  grown up there and grown down again .  he had mrs .  procter and mrs .  carlyle to breakfast with him one morning  only those two .  both excessively talkative  very quick and clever  and bent on entertaining him .  when mrs .  carlyle had flashed and shone before him for about three quarters of an hour on one subject  he turned his poor old eyes on mrs .  procter  and pointing to the brilliant discourser with his poor old finger  said  indignantly    who is she .   upon this  mrs .  procter  cutting in  delivered  it is her own story  a neat oration on the life and writings of carlyle  and enlightened him in her happiest and airiest manner  all of which he heard  staring in the dreariest silence  and then said  indignantly  as before    and who are you .    ever  my dear irving  most affectionately and truly yours .    sidenote  mr .  frank stone  a . r . a   ville des moulineaux  boulogne  wednesday   th july       .   my dear stone   i have got a capital part for you in the farce      not a difficult one to learn  as you never say anything but  yes  and  no .   you are called in the dramatis person   an able bodied british seaman  and you are never seen by mortal eye to do anything  except inopportunely producing a mop  but stand about the deck of the boat in everybody s way  with your hair immensely touzled  one brace on  your hands in your pockets  and the bottoms of your trousers tucked up .  yet you are inextricably connected with the plot  and are the man whom everybody is inquiring after .  i think it is a very whimsical idea and extremely droll .  it made me laugh heartily when i jotted it all down yesterday .   loves from all my house to all yours .   ever affectionately .   footnote        the farce alluded to  however  was never written .  it had been projected to be played at the amateur theatricals at tavistock house .                   .    sidenote  sir edward bulwer lytton .    tavistock house  wednesday    th january       .   my dear bulwer   i thought wills had told you as to the guild  for i begged him to  that he can do absolutely nothing until our charter is seven years old .  it is the stringent and express prohibition of the act of parliament  for which things you members  thank god  are responsible and not i .  when i observed this clause  which was just as we were going to grant a pension  if we could agree on a good subject   i caused our counsel s opinion to be taken on it  and there is not a doubt about it .  i immediately recommended that there should be no expenses  that the interest on the capital should be all invested as it accrued  that the chambers should be given up and the clerk discharged  and that the guild should have the use of the  household words  office rent free  and the services of wills on the same terms .  all of which was done .   a letter is now copying  to be sent round to all the members  explaining  with the new year  the whole state of the thing .  you will receive this .  it appears to me that it looks wholesome enough .  but if a strong idiot comes and binds your hands  or mine  or both  for seven years  what is to be done against him .   as to greater matters than this  however  as to all matters on this teeming earth  it appears to me that the house of commons and parliament altogether  is just the dreariest failure and nuisance that has bothered this much bothered world .   ever yours .    sidenote  miss emily jolly .    gravesend  kent    th april       .   dear madam   as i am away from london for a few days  your letter has been forwarded to me .   i can honestly encourage and assure you that i believe the depression and want of confidence under which you describe yourself as labouring to have no sufficient foundation .   first as to  mr .  arle .   i have constantly heard it spoken of with great approval  and i think it a book of considerable merit .  if i were to tell you that i see no evidence of inexperience in it  that would not be true .  i think a little more stir and action to be desired also  but i am surprised by your being despondent about it  for i assure you that i had supposed it  always remembering that it is your first novel  to have met with a very good reception .   i can bring to my memory  here  with no means of reference at hand  only two papers of yours that have been unsuccessful at  household words .   i think the first was called  the brook .   it appeared to me to break down upon a confusion that pervaded it  between a coroner s inquest and a trial .  i have a general recollection of the mingling of the two  as to facts and forms that should have been kept apart  in some inextricable manner that was beyond my powers of disentanglement .  the second was about a wife s writing a novel and keeping the secret from her husband until it was done .  i did not think the incident of sufficient force to justify the length of the narrative .  but there is nothing fatal in either of these mischances .   mr .  wills told me when i spoke to him of the latter paper that you had it in contemplation to offer a longer story to  household words .   if you should do so  i assure you i shall be happy to read it myself  and that i shall have a sincere desire to accept it  if possible .   i can give you no better counsel than to look into the life about you  and to strive for what is noblest and true .  as to further encouragement  i do not  i can most strongly add  believe that you have any reason to be downhearted .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .    tavistock house  saturday morning    th may       .   dear madam   i read your story  with all possible attention  last night .  i cannot tell you with what reluctance i write to you respecting it  for my opinion of it is not favourable  although i perceive your heart in it  and great strength .   pray understand that i claim no infallibility .  i merely express my own honest opinion  formed against my earnest desire .  i do not lay it down as law for others  though  of course  i believe that many others would come to the same conclusion .  it appears to me that the story is one that cannot possibly be told within the compass to which you have limited yourself .  the three principal people are  every one of them  in the wrong with the reader  and you cannot put any of them right  without making the story extend over a longer space of time  and without anatomising the souls of the actors more slowly and carefully .  nothing would justify the departure of alice  but her having some strong reason to believe that in taking that step  she saved her lover .  in your intentions as to that lover s transfer of his affections to eleanor  i descry a striking truth  but i think it confusedly wrought out  and all but certain to fail in expressing itself .  eleanor  i regard as forced and overstrained .  the natural result is  that she carries a train of anti climax after her .  i particularly notice this at the point when she thinks she is going to be drowned .   the whole idea of the story is sufficiently difficult to require the most exact truth and the greatest knowledge and skill in the colouring throughout .  in this respect i have no doubt of its being extremely defective .  the people do not talk as such people would  and the little subtle touches of description which  by making the country house and the general scene real  would give an air of reality to the people  much to be desired  are altogether wanting .  the more you set yourself to the illustration of your heroine s passionate nature  the more indispensable this attendant atmosphere of truth becomes .  it would  in a manner  oblige the reader to believe in her .  whereas  for ever exploding like a great firework without any background  she glares and wheels and hisses  and goes out  and has lighted nothing .   lastly  i fear she is too convulsive from beginning to end .  pray reconsider  from this point of view  her brow  and her eyes  and her drawing herself up to her full height  and her being a perfumed presence  and her floating into rooms  also her asking people how they dare  and the like  on small provocation .  when she hears her music being played  i think she is particularly objectionable .   i have a strong belief that if you keep this story by you three or four years  you will form an opinion of it not greatly differing from mine .  there is so much good in it  so much reflection  so much passion and earnestness  that  if my judgment be right  i feel sure you will come over to it .  on the other hand  i do not think that its publication  as it stands  would do you service  or be agreeable to you hereafter .   i have no means of knowing whether you are patient in the pursuit of this art  but i am inclined to think that you are not  and that you do not discipline yourself enough .  when one is impelled to write this or that  one has still to consider   how much of this will tell for what i mean .  how much of it is my own wild emotion and superfluous energy  how much remains that is truly belonging to this ideal character and these ideal circumstances .   it is in the laborious struggle to make this distinction  and in the determination to try for it  that the road to the correction of faults lies .   perhaps i may remark  in support of the sincerity with which i write this  that i am an impatient and impulsive person myself  but that it has been for many years the constant effort of my life to practise at my desk what i preach to you .    i should not have written so much  or so plainly  but for your last letter to me .  it seems to demand that i should be strictly true with you  and i am so in this letter  without any reservation either way .   very faithfully yours .

take notice  please  that i have a reminder of you always before me .  on my desk  here  stand two green leaves     which i every morning station in their ever green place at my elbow .  the leaves on

roccabella  a very remarkable book indeed .  apart  quite apart  from my interest in you  i am certain that if i had taken it up under any ordinarily favourable circumstances as a book of which i knew nothing whatever  i should not  could not  have relinquished it until i had read it through .  i had turned but a few pages  and come to the shadow on the bright sofa at the foot of the bed  when i knew myself to be in the hands of an artist .  that rare and delightful recognition i never lost for a moment until i closed the second volume at the end .  i am  a good audience  when i have reason to be  and my girls would testify to you  if there were need  that i cried over it heartily .  your story seems to me remarkably ingenious .  i had not the least idea of the purport of the sealed paper until you chose to enlighten me  and then i felt it to be quite natural  quite easy  thoroughly in keeping with the character and presentation of the liverpool man .  the position of the bell family in the story has a special air of nature and truth  is quite new to me  and is so dexterously and delicately done that i find the deaf daughter no less real and distinct than the clergyman s wife .  the turn of the story round that damnable princess i pursued with a pleasure with which i could pursue nothing but a true interest  and i declare to you that if i were put upon finding anything better than the scene of roccabella s death  i should stare round my bookshelves very much at a loss for a long time .  similarly  your characters have really surprised me .  from the lawyer to the princess  i swear to them as true  and in your fathoming of rosamond altogether  there is a profound wise knowledge that i admire and respect with a heartiness not easily overstated in words .   i am not quite with you as to the italians .  your knowledge of the italian character seems to me surprisingly subtle and penetrating  but i think we owe it to those most unhappy men and their political wretchedness to ask ourselves mercifully  whether their faults are not essentially the faults of a people long oppressed and priest ridden   whether their tendency to slink and conspire is not a tendency that spies in every dress  from the triple crown to a lousy head  have engendered in their ancestors through generations .  again  like you  i shudder at the distresses that come of these unavailing risings  my blood runs hotter  as yours does  at the thought of the leaders safe  and the instruments perishing by hundreds  yet what is to be done .  their wrongs are so great that they will rise from time to time somehow .  it would be to doubt the eternal providence of god to doubt that they will rise successfully at last .  unavailing struggles against a dominant tyranny precede all successful turning against it .  and is it not a little hard in us englishman  whose forefathers have risen so often and striven against so much  to look on  in our own security  through microscopes  and detect the motes in the brains of men driven mad .  think  if you and i were italians  and had grown from boyhood to our present time  menaced in every day through all these years by that infernal confessional  dungeons  and soldiers  could we be better than these men .  should we be so good .  i should not  i am afraid  if i know myself .  such things would make of me a moody  bloodthirsty  implacable man  who would do anything for revenge  and if i compromised the truth  put it at the worst  habitually  where should i ever have had it before me .  in the old jesuits  college at genoa  on the chiaja at naples  in the churches of rome  at the university of padua  on the piazzo san marco at venice  where .  and the government is in all these places  and in all italian places .  i have seen something of these men .  i have known mazzini and gallenga  manin was tutor to my daughters in paris  i have had long talks about scores of them with poor ary scheffer  who was their best friend .  i have gone back to italy after ten years  and found the best men i had known there exiled or in jail .  i believe they have the faults you ascribe to them  nationally  not individually   but i could not find it in my heart  remembering their miseries  to exhibit those faults without referring them back to their causes .  you will forgive my writing this  because i write it exactly as i write my cordial little tribute to the high merits of your book .  if it were not a living reality to me  i should care nothing about this point of disagreement  but you are far too earnest a man  and far too able a man  to be left unremonstrated with by an admiring reader .  you cannot write so well without influencing many people .  if you could tell me that your book had but twenty readers  i would reply  that so good a book will influence more people s opinions  through those twenty  than a worthless book would through twenty thousand  and i express this with the perfect confidence of one in whose mind the book has taken  for good and all  a separate and distinct place .   accept my thanks for the pleasure you have given me .  the poor acknowledgment of testifying to that pleasure wherever i go will be my pleasure in return .  and so  my dear chorley  good night  and god bless you .   ever faithfully yours .    sidenote  sir john bowring .    gad s hill  wednesday    st october       .   my dear sir john       first let me congratulate you on your marriage and wish you all happiness and prosperity .   secondly  i must tell you that i was greatly vexed with the chatham people for not giving me early notice of your lecture .  in that case i should  of course  have presided  as president of the institution  and i should have asked you to honour my falstaff house here .  but when they made your kind intention known to me  i had made some important business engagements at the  all the year round  office for that evening  which i could not possibly forego .  i charged them to tell you so  and was going to write to you when i found your kind letter .   thanks for your paper  which i have sent to the printer s with much pleasure .   we heard of your accident here  and of your  making nothing of it .   i said that you didn t make much of disasters  and that you took poison  from natives  as quite a matter of course in the way of business .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  a .  h .  layard .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  tuesday   th december       .   my dear layard   i know you will readily believe that i would come if i could  and that i am heartily sorry i cannot .   a new story of my writing  nine months long  is just begun in  all the year round .   a certain allotment of my time when i have that story demand upon me  has  all through my author life  been an essential condition of my health and success .  i have just returned here to work so many hours every day for so many days .  it is really impossible for me to break my bond .   there is not a man in england who is more earnestly your friend and admirer than i am .  the conviction that you know it  helps me out through this note .  you are a man of so much mark to me  that i even regret your going into the house of commons  for which assembly i have but a scant respect .  but i would not mention it to the southwark electors if i could come to morrow  though i should venture to tell them  and even that your friends would consider very impolitic  that i think them very much honoured by having such a candidate for their suffrages .   my daughter and sister in law want to know what you have done with your  pledge  to come down here again .  if they had votes for southwark they would threaten to oppose you  but would never do it .  i was solemnly sworn at breakfast to let you know that we should be delighted to see you .  bear witness that i kept my oath .   ever  my dear layard  faithfully yours .    sidenote  captain morgan .    dear friend   i am heartily obliged to you for your seasonable and welcome remembrance .  it came to the office  while i was there  in the pleasantest manner  brought by two seafaring men as if they had swum across with it .  i have already told      what i am very well assured of concerning you  but you are such a noble fellow that i must not pursue that subject .  but you will at least take my cordial and affectionate thanks .   .   .   .  we have a touch of most beautiful weather here now  and this country is most beautiful too .  i wish i could carry you off to a favourite spot of mine between this and maidstone  where i often smoke your cigars and think of you .  we often take our lunch on a hillside there in the summer  and then i lie down on the grass  a splendid example of laziness  and say   now for my morgan .    my daughter and her aunt declare that they know the true scent of the true article  which i don t in the least believe   and sometimes they exclaim   that s not a morgan   and the worst of it is they were once right by accident .   .   .   .  i hope you will have seen the christmas number of  all the year round .       here and there  in the description of the sea going hero  i have given a touch or two of remembrance of somebody you know  very heartily desiring that thousands of people may have some faint reflection of the pleasure i have for many years derived from the contemplation of a most amiable nature and most remarkable man .   with kindest regards  believe me  dear morgan  ever affectionately yours .

lytton   i am delighted to receive your letter  and to look forward with confidence to having such a successor in august .  i can honestly assure you that i never have been so pleased at heart in all my literary life  as i am in the proud thought of standing side by side with you before this great audience .   in regard of the story      i have perfect faith in such a master hand as yours  and i know that what such an artist feels to be terrible and original  is unquestionably so .  you whet my interest by what you write of it to the utmost extent .   believe me ever affectionately yours .    sidenote  the same .       hanover terrace  regent s park  sunday    th april       .   my dear bulwer lytton   my story will finish in the first week in august .  yours ought to begin in the last week of july  or the last week but one .  wilkie collins will be at work to follow you .  the publication has made a very great success with  great expectations   and could not present a finer time for you .   the question of length may be easily adjusted .   of the misgiving you entertain i cannot of course judge until you give me leave to rush to the perusal .  i swear that i never thought i had half so much self denial as i have shown in this case .  i think i shall come out at exeter hall as a choice vessel on the strength of it .  in the meanwhile i have quickened the printer and told him to get on fast .   you cannot think how happy you make me by what you write of  great expectations .   there is nothing like the pride of making such an effect on such a writer as you .   ever faithfully .    sidenote  the same .       hanover terrace  regent s park  wednesday   th may       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i am anxious to let you know that mr .  frederic lehmann  who is coming down to knebworth to see you  with his sister mrs .  benzon  is a particular friend of mine  for whom i have a very high and warm regard .  although he will sufficiently enlist your sympathy on his own behalf  i am sure that you will not be the less interested in him because i am .   ever faithfully yours .    sidenote  the same .       hanover terrace  sunday    th may       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i received your revised proofs only yesterday  and i sat down to read them last night .  and before i say anything further i may tell you that i could not lay them aside  but was obliged to go on with them in my bedroom until i got into a very ghostly state indeed .  this morning i have taken them again and have gone through them with the utmost attention .   of the beauty and power of the writing i say not a word  or of its originality and boldness  or of its quite extraordinary constructive skill .  i confine myself solely to your misgiving  and to the question whether there is any sufficient foundation for it .   on the last head i say  without the faintest hesitation  most decidedly there is not sufficient foundation for it .  i do not share it in the least .  i believe that the readers who have here given their minds  or perhaps had any to give  to those strange psychological mysteries in ourselves  of which we are all more or less conscious  will accept your wonders as curious weapons in the armoury of fiction  and will submit themselves to the art with which said weapons are used .  even to that class of intelligence the marvellous addresses itself from a very strong position  and that class of intelligence is not accustomed to find the marvellous in such very powerful hands as yours .  on more imaginative readers the tale will fall  or i am greatly mistaken  like a spell .  by readers who combine some imagination  some scepticism  and some knowledge and learning  i hope it will be regarded as full of strange fancy and curious study  startling reflections of their own thoughts and speculations at odd times  and wonder which a master has a right to evoke .  in the last point lies  to my thinking  the whole case .  if you were the magician s servant instead of the magician  these potent spirits would get the better of you  but you are the magician  and they don t  and you make them serve your purpose .   occasionally in the dialogue i see an expression here and there which might  always solely with a reference to your misgiving  be better away  and i think that the vision  to use the word for want of a better  in the museum  should be made a little less abstruse .  i should not say that  if the sale of the journal was below the sale of the times newspaper  but as it is probably several thousands higher  i do .  i would also suggest that after the title we put the two words  a romance .  it is an absurdly easy device for getting over your misgiving with the blockheads  but i think it would be an effective one .  i don t  on looking at it  like the title .  here are a few that have occurred to me .    the steel casket .     the lost manuscript .     derval court .     perpetual youth .     maggie .     dr .  fenwick .     life and death .    the four last i think the best .  there is an objection to  dr .  fenwick  because there has been  dr .  antonio   and there is a book of dumas  which repeats the objection .  i don t think  fenwick  startling enough .  it appears to me that a more startling title would take the  john  bull by the horns  and would be a serviceable concession to your misgiving  as suggesting a story off the stones of the gas lighted brentford road .   the title is the first thing to be settled  and cannot be settled too soon .   for the purposes of the weekly publication the divisions of the story will often have to be greatly changed  though afterwards  in the complete book  you can  of course  divide it into chapters  free from that reference .  for example  i would end the first chapter on the third slip at  and through the ghostly streets  under the ghostly moon  went back to my solitary room .   the rest of what is now your first chapter might be made chapter ii .   and would end the first weekly part .   i think i have become  by dint of necessity and practice  rather cunning in this regard  and perhaps you would not mind my looking closely to such points from week to week .  it so happens that if you had written the opening of this story expressly for the occasion its striking incidents could not possibly have followed one another better .  one other merely mechanical change i suggest now .  i would not have an initial letter for the town  but would state in the beginning that i gave the town a fictitious name .  i suppose a blank or a dash rather fends a good many people off  because it always has that effect upon me .   be sure that i am perfectly frank and open in all i have said in this note  and that i have not a grain of reservation in my mind .  i think the story a very fine one  one that no other man could write  and that there is no strength in your misgiving for the two reasons  firstly  that the work is professedly a work of fancy and fiction  in which the reader is not required against his will to take everything for fact  secondly  that it is written by the man who can write it .  the magician s servant does not know what to do with the ghost  and has  consequently  no business with him .  the magician does know what to do with him  and has all the business with him that he can transact .   i am quite at ease on the points that you have expressed yourself as not at ease upon .  quite .  i cannot too often say that if they were carried on weak shoulders they would break the bearer down .  but in your mastering of them lies the mastery over the reader .   this will reach you at knebworth  i hope  to morrow afternoon .  pray give your doubts to the winds of that high spot  and believe that if i had them i would swarm up the flag staff quite as nimbly as margrave and nail the fenwick colours to the top .   ever affectionately yours .    sidenote  the same .       hanover terrace  regent s park  monday  twentieth may       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i did not read from australia till the end  because i was obliged to be hard at work that day  and thought it best that the ms .  should come back to you rather than that i should detain it .  of course  i can read it  whenever it suits you .  as to isabel s dying and fenwick s growing old  i would say that  beyond question  whatever the meaning of the story tends to  is the proper end .   all the alterations you mention in your last  are excellent .   as to title   margrave  a tale of mystery   would be sufficiently striking .  i prefer  wonder  to  mystery   because i think it suggests something higher and more apart from ordinary complications of plot  or the like  which  mystery  might seem to mean .  will you kindly remark that the title presses  and that it will be a great relief to have it as soon as possible .  the last two months of my story are our best time for announcement and preparation .  of course  it is most desirable that your story should have the full benefit of them .   ever faithfully .    sidenote  lady olliffe .    lord warden hotel  dover  sunday  twenty sixth may       .   my dear lady olliffe   i have run away to this sea beach to get rid of my neuralgic face .   touching the kind invitations received from you this morning  i feel that the only course i can take  without being a humbug  is to decline them .  after the middle of june i shall be mostly at gad s hill  i know that i cannot do better than keep out of the way of hot rooms and late dinners  and what would you think of me  or call me  if i were to accept and not come .   no  no  no .  be still my soul .  be virtuous  eminent author .  do not accept  my dickens .  she is to come to gad s hill with her spouse .  await her there  my child .   thus the voice of wisdom .    my dear lady olliffe  ever affectionately yours .    sidenote  mrs .  milner gibson .    gad s hill  monday  eighth july       .   my dear mrs .  gibson   i want very affectionately and earnestly to congratulate you on your eldest daughter s approaching marriage .  up to the moment when mary told me of it  i had foolishly thought of her always as the pretty little girl with the frank loving face whom i saw last on the sands at broadstairs .  i rubbed my eyes and woke at the words  going to be married   and found i had been walking in my sleep some years .   i want to thank you also for thinking of me on the occasion  but i feel that i am better away from it .  i should really have a misgiving that i was a sort of shadow on a young marriage  and you will understand me when i say so  and no more .   but i shall be with you in the best part of myself  in the warmth of sympathy and friendship  and i send my love to the dear girl  and devoutly hope and believe that she will be happy .  the face that i remember with perfect accuracy  and could draw here  if i could draw at all  was made to be happy and to make a husband so .   i wonder whether you ever travel by railroad in these times .  i wish mary could tempt you to come by any road to this little place .   with kind regard to milner gibson  believe me ever  affectionately and faithfully yours .    sidenote  sir edward bulwer lytton .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  tuesday  seventeenth september       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i am delighted with your letter of yesterday  delighted with the addition to the length of the story  delighted with your account of it  and your interest in it  and even more than delighted by what you say of our working in company .   not one dissentient voice has reached me respecting it .  through the dullest time of the year we held our circulation most gallantly .  and it could not have taken a better hold .  i saw forster on friday  newly returned from thousands of provincial lunatics   and he really was more impressed than i can tell you by what he had seen of it .  just what you say you think it will turn out to be  he was saying  almost in the same words .   i am burning to get at the whole story   and you inflame me in the maddest manner by your references to what i don t know .  the exquisite art with which you have changed it  and have overcome the difficulties of the mode of publication  has fairly staggered me .  i know pretty well what the difficulties are  and there is no other man who could have done it  i ween .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  mr .  h .  g .  adams .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  sunday  sixth october       .   my dear mr .  adams   my readings are a sad subject to me just now  for i am going away on the   th to read fifty times  and i have lost mr .  arthur smith  a friend whom i can never replace  who always went with me  and transacted  as no other man ever can  all the business connected with them  and without whom  i fear  they will be dreary and weary to me .  but this is not to the purpose of your letter .   i desire to be useful to the institution of the place with which my childhood is inseparably associated  and i will serve it this next christmas if i can .  will you tell me when i could do you most good by reading for you .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  b .  w .  procter .    office of  all the year round   tuesday  twelfth november       .   my dear procter   i grieve to reply to your note  that i am obliged to read at newcastle on the   st .  poor arthur smith had pledged me to do so before i knew that my annual engagement with you was being encroached on .  i am heartily sorry for this  and shall miss my usual place at your table  quite as much  to say the least  as my place can possibly miss me .  you may be sure that i shall drink to my dear old friend in a bumper that day  with love and best wishes .  don t leave me out next year for having been carried away north this time .   ever yours affectionately .    sidenote  sir edward bulwer lytton .    queen s head hotel  newcastle on tyne  wednesday night  twentieth november       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i have read here  this evening  very attentively  nos .     and    .  i have not the least doubt of the introduced matter  whether considered for its policy  its beauty  or its wise bearing on the story  it is decidedly a great improvement .  it is at once very suggestive and very new to have these various points of view presented to the reader s mind .   that the audience is good enough for anything that is well presented to it  i am quite sure .   when you can avoid notes  however  and get their substance into the text  it is highly desirable in the case of so large an audience  simply because  as so large an audience necessarily reads the story in small portions  it is of the greater importance that they should retain as much of its argument as possible .  whereas the difficulty of getting numbers of people to read notes  which they invariably regard as interruptions of the text  not as strengtheners or elucidators of it  is wonderful .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  the same .     all the year round  office  eighteenth december       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i have not had a moment in which to write to you .  even now i write with the greatest press upon me  meaning to write in detail in a day or two .   but i have read  at all events  though not written .  and i say  most masterly and most admirable .  it is impossible to lay the sheets down without finishing them .  i showed them to georgina and mary  and they read and read and never stirred until they had read all .  there cannot be a doubt of the beauty  power  and artistic excellence of the whole .   i counsel you most strongly not to append the proposed dialogue between fenwick and faber  and not to enter upon any explanation beyond the title page and the motto  unless it be in some very brief preface .  decidedly i would not help the reader  if it were only for the reason that that anticipates his being in need of help  and his feeling objections and difficulties that require solution .  let the book explain itself .  it speaks for itself with a noble eloquence .   ever affectionately .   footnote         a strange story .                    .    sidenote  the same .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  friday  twenty fourth january       .   my dear bulwer lytton   i have considered your questions  and here follow my replies .     .  i think you undoubtedly have the right to forbid the turning of your play into an opera .     .  i do not think the production of such an opera in the slightest degree likely to injure the play or to render it a less valuable property than it is now .  if it could have any effect on so standard and popular a work as  the lady of lyons   the effect would  in my judgment  be beneficial .  but i believe the play to be high above any such influence .     .  assuming you do consent to the adaptation  in a desire to oblige oxenford  i would not recommend your asking any pecuniary compensation .  this for two reasons  firstly  because the compensation could only be small at the best  secondly  because your taking it would associate you  unreasonably  but not the less assuredly  with the opera .   the only objection i descry is purely one of feeling .  pauline trotting about in front of the float  invoking the orchestra with a limp pocket handkerchief  is a notion that makes goose flesh of my back .  also a yelping tenor going away to the wars in a scene a half an hour long is painful to contemplate .  damas  too  as a bass  with a grizzled bald head  blatently bellowing about  years long ago  when the sound of the drum first made his blood glow with a rum ti tum tum    rather sticks in my throat  but there really seems to me to be no other objection  if you can get over this .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  mr .  baylis .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  saturday  first february       .   my dear mr .  baylis   i have just come home .  finding your note  i write to you at once  or you might do me the wrong of supposing me unmindful of it and you .   i agree with you about smith himself  and i don t think it necessary to pursue the painful subject .  such things are at an end  i think  for the time being   fell to the ground with the poor man at cremorne .  if they should be resumed  then they must be attacked  but i hope the fashion  far too much encouraged in its blondin beginning by those who should know much better  is over .   it always appears to me that the common people have an excuse in their patronage of such exhibitions which people above them in condition have not .  their lives are full of physical difficulties  and they like to see such difficulties overcome .  they go to see them overcome .  if i am in danger of falling off a scaffold or a ladder any day  the man who claims that he can t fall from anything is a very wonderful and agreeable person to me .   faithfully yours always .    sidenote  mr .  henry f .  chorley .        hyde park gate  south kensington gore  w .   saturday   st march       .   my dear chorley   i was at your lecture     this afternoon  and i hope i may venture to tell you that i was extremely pleased and interested .  both the matter of the materials and the manner of their arrangement were quite admirable  and a modesty and complete absence of any kind of affectation pervaded the whole discourse  which was quite an example to the many whom it concerns .  if you could be a very little louder  and would never let a sentence go for the thousandth part of an instant until the last word is out  you would find the audience more responsive .   a spoken sentence will never run alone in all its life  and is never to be trusted to itself in its most insignificant member .  see it well out  with the voice  and the part of the audience is made surprisingly easier .  in that excellent description of the spanish mendicant and his guitar  as well as the very happy touches about the dance and the castanets  the people were really desirous to express very hearty appreciation  but by giving them rather too much to do in watching and listening for latter words  you stopped them .  i take the liberty of making the remark  as one who has fought with beasts  oratorically  in divers arenas .  for the rest nothing could be better .  knowledge  ingenuity  neatness  condensation  good sense  and good taste in delightful combination .   affectionately always .    sidenote  mrs .  austin .    paris  rue du faubourg st .  honor        friday  seventh november       .   my dear letitia   i should have written to you from here sooner  but for having been constantly occupied .   your improved account of yourself is very cheering and hopeful .  through determined occupation and action  lies the way .  be sure of it .   i came over to france before georgina and mary  and went to boulogne to meet them coming in by the steamer on the great sunday  the day of the storm .  i stood  holding on with both hands  on the pier at boulogne  five hours .  the sub marine telegraph had telegraphed their boat as having come out of folkestone  though the companion boat from boulogne didn t try it  and at nine o clock at night  she being due at six  there were no signs of her .  my principal dread was  that she would try to get into boulogne  which she could not possibly have done without carrying away everything on deck .  the tide at nine o clock being too low for any such desperate attempt  i thought it likely that they had run for the downs and would knock about there all night .  so i went to the inn to dry my pea jacket and get some dinner anxiously enough  when  at about ten  came a telegram from them at calais to say they had run in there .  to calais i went  post  next morning  expecting to find them half dead  of course  they had arrived half drowned   but i found them elaborately got up to come on to paris by the next train  and the most wonderful thing of all was  that they hardly seem to have been frightened .  of course  they had discovered at the end of the voyage  that a young bride and her husband  the only other passengers on deck  and with whom they had been talking all the time  were an officer from chatham whom they knew very well  when dry   just married and going to india .  so they all set up house keeping together at dessin s at calais  where i am well known   and looked as if they had been passing a mild summer there .   we have a pretty apartment here  but house rent is awful to mention .  mrs .  bouncer  muzzled by the parisian police  is also here  and is a wonderful spectacle to behold in the streets  restrained like a raging lion .   i learn from an embassy

yesterday afternoon .  georgina and marsh were both highly mortified that it had fallen dark  and the beauties of the carriage were obscured .  but of course i had it out in the yard the first thing this morning  and got in and out at both the doors  and let down and pulled up the windows  and checked an imaginary coachman  and leaned back in a state of placid contemplation .   it is the lightest

book .  secondly  because my married daughter and her husband are with us .  thirdly  because my two boys are at home for their holidays .   but if you would come out of that murky electioneering atmosphere and come to us  you don t know how delighted we should be .  you should have your own way as completely as though you were at home .  you should have a cheery room  and you should have a swiss ch  let all to yourself to write in .  smoking regarded as a personal favour to the family .  georgina is so insupportably vain on account of being a favourite of yours  that you might find her a drawback  but nothing else would turn out in that way  i hope .   won t you manage it .  do think of it .  if  for instance  you would come back with us on that guild saturday .  i have turned the house upside down and inside out since you were here  and have carved new rooms out of places then non existent .  pray do think of it  and do manage it .  i should be heartily pleased .   i hope you will find the purpose and the plot of my book very plain when you see it as a whole piece .  i am looking forward to sending you the proofs complete about the end of next month .  it is all sketched out and i am working hard on it  giving it all the pains possible to be bestowed on a labour of love .  your critical opinion two months in advance of the public will be invaluable to me .  for you know what store i set by it  and how i think over a hint from you .   i notice the latest piece of poisoning ingenuity in pritchard s case .  when he had made his medical student boarders sick  by poisoning the family food  he then quietly walked out  took an emetic  and made himself sick .  this with a view to ask them  in examination on a possible trial  whether he did not present symptoms at the time like the rest .   a question naturally asked for him and answered in the affirmative .  from which i get at the fact .   if your constituency don t bring you in they deserve to lose you  and may the gods continue to confound them .  i shudder at the thought of such public life as political life .  would there not seem to be something horribly rotten in the system of it  when one stands amazed how any man  not forced into it by position  as you are  can bear to live it .   but the private life here is my point  and again i urge upon you .  do think of it  and do come .   i want to tell you how i have been impressed by the  boatman .   it haunts me as only a beautiful and profound thing can .  the lines are always running in my head  as the river runs with me .   ever

supposed to be the best sailor in our service .  i said i had been remarking at home     propos of the london  that i knew of no shipwreck of a large strong ship  not carrying weight of guns  in the open sea  and that i could find none such in the shipwreck books .  they all agreed that the unfortunate captain martin must have been unacquainted with the truth as to what can and what can not be done with a steamship having rigging and canvas  and that no sailor would dream of turning a ship s stern to such a gale  unless his vessel could run faster than the sea .       said  and the other two confirmed  that the london was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale  and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm topsail  which is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent aloft  and can be set under the worst circumstances  the disaster could not have occurred .  if he had no such sail  he could have improvised it  even of hammocks and the like .  they said that under a board of enquiry into the wreck  any efficient witness must of necessity state this as the fact  and could not possibly avoid the conclusion that the seamanship was utterly bad  and as to the force of the wind  for which i suggested allowance  they all had been in west indian hurricanes and in typhoons  and had put the heads of their ships to the wind under the most adverse circumstances .   i thought you might be interested in this  as you have no doubt been interested in the case .  they had a great respect for the unfortunate captain s character  and for his behaviour when the case was hopeless  but they had not the faintest doubt that he lost the ship and those two hundred and odd lives .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  mr .  r .  m .  ross .

respect and even assert superiority .  in many other cases their patron is a remote and misty person  or institution  sanctioned by time and custom .  but the proposed position would be a very different one for a student to hold  and boys are too often inconsiderate  proud  and cruel .  i should like to know whether this point has received consideration from the projectors of the design .

have reported personally .   the other day i received a letter from mr .        of new york  who came over in the winning yacht  and described the voyage in the times   saying he would much like to see me .  i made an appointment in london  and observed that when he did see me he was obviously astonished .  while i was sensible that the magnificence of my appearance would fully account for his being overcome  i nevertheless angled for the cause of his surprise .  he then told me that there was a paragraph going round the papers to the effect that i was  in a critical state of health .   i asked him if he was sure it wasn t  cricketing  state of health .  to which he replied  quite .  i then asked him down here to dinner  and he was again staggered by finding me in sporting training  also much amused .   yesterday s and to day s post bring me this unaccountable paragraph from hosts of uneasy friends  with the enormous and wonderful addition that  eminent surgeons  are sending me to america for  cessation from literary labour  .  .  .  so i have written a quiet line to the times  certifying to my own state of health  and have also begged dixon to do the like in the athen  um .  i mention the matter to you  in order that you may contradict  from me  if the nonsense should reach america unaccompanied by the truth .  but i suppose that the new york herald will probably have got the letter from mr .       aforesaid .   .   .   .   charles reade and wilkie collins are here  and the joke of the time is to feel my pulse when i appear at table  and also to inveigle innocent messengers to come over to the summer house  where i write  the place is quite changed since you were here  and a tunnel under the highroad connects this shrubbery with the front garden   to ask  with their compliments  how i find myself now .   if i come to america this next november  even you can hardly imagine with what interest i shall try copperfield on an american audience  or  if they give me their heart  how freely and fully i shall give them mine .  we will ask dolby then whether he ever heard it before .   i cannot thank you enough for your invaluable help to dolby .  he writes that at every turn and moment the sense and knowledge and tact of mr .  osgood are inestimable to him .   ever  my dear fields  faithfully yours .    sidenote  lord lytton .     all the year round  office  tuesday    th september       .   my dear lytton   i am happy to tell you that the play was admirably done last night  and made a marked impression .  pauline is weak  but so carefully trained and fitted into the picture as to be never disagreeable  and sometimes  as in the last scene  very pathetic .  fechter has played nothing nearly so well as claude since he played in paris in the  dame aux cam  lias   or in london as ruy blas .  he played the fourth act as finely as macready  and the first much better .  the dress and bearing in the fifth act are quite new  and quite excellent .   of the scenic arrangements  the most noticeable are   the picturesque struggle of the cottage between the taste of an artist  and the domestic means of poverty  expressed to the eye with infinite tact    the view of lyons  act v .  scene     with a foreground of quay wall which the officers are leaning on  waiting for the general   and the last scene  a suite of rooms giving on a conservatory at the back  through which the moon is shining .  you are to understand that all these scenic appliances are subdued to the piece  instead of the piece being sacrificed to them  and that every group and situation has to be considered  not only with a reference to each by itself  but to the whole story .   beaus  ant s speaking the original contents of the letter was a decided point  and the immense house was quite breathless when the tempter and the tempted stood confronted as he made the proposal .   there was obviously a great interest in seeing a frenchman play the part .  the scene between claude and gaspar  the small part very well done  was very closely watched for the same reason  and was loudly applauded .  i cannot say too much of the brightness  intelligence  picturesqueness  and care of fechter s impersonation throughout .  there was a remarkable delicacy in his gradually drooping down on his way home with his bride  until he fell upon the table  a crushed heap of shame and remorse  while his mother told pauline the story .  his gradual recovery of himself as he formed better resolutions was equally well expressed  and his being at last upright again and rushing enthusiastically to join the army  brought the house down .   i wish you could have been there .  he never spoke english half so well as he spoke your english  and the audience heard it with the finest sympathy and respect .  i felt that i should have been very proud indeed to have been the writer of the play .   ever affectionately .    sidenote  mr .  james t .  fields .        october       .   my dear fields   i hope the telegraph clerks did not mutilate out of recognition or reasonable guess the words i added to dolby s last telegram to boston .   tribune london correspondent totally false .   not only is there not a word of truth in the pretended conversation  but it is so absurdly unlike me that i cannot suppose it to be even invented by anyone who ever heard me exchange a word with mortal creature .  for twenty years i am perfectly certain that i have never made any other allusion to the republication of my books in america than the good humoured remark   that if there had been international copyright between england and the states  i should have been a man of very large fortune  instead of a man of moderate savings  always supporting a very expensive public position .   nor have i ever been such a fool as to charge the absence of international copyright upon individuals .  nor have i ever been so ungenerous as to disguise or suppress the fact that i have received handsome sums for advance sheets .  when i was in the states  i said what i had to say on the question  and there an end .  i am absolutely certain that i have never since expressed myself  even with soreness  on the subject .  reverting to the preposterous fabrication of the london correspondent  the statement that i ever talked about  these fellows  who republished my books or pretended to know  what i don t know at this instant  who made how much out of them  or ever talked of their sending me  conscience money   is as grossly and completely false as the statement that i ever said anything to the effect that i could not be expected to have an interest in the american people .  and nothing can by any possibility be falser than that .  again and again in these pages   all the year round   i have expressed my interest in them .  you will see it in the  child s history of england .   you will see it in the last preface to  american notes .   every american who has ever spoken with me in london  paris  or where not  knows whether i have frankly said   you could have no better introduction to me than your country .   and for years and years when i have been asked about reading in america  my invariable reply has been   i have so many friends there  and constantly receive so many earnest letters from personally unknown readers there  that  but for domestic reasons  i would go to morrow .   i think i must  in the confidential intercourse between you and me  have written you to this effect more than once .   the statement of the london correspondent from beginning to end is false .  it is false in the letter and false in the spirit .  he may have been misinformed  and the statement may not have originated with him .  with whomsoever it originated  it never originated with me  and consequently is false .  more than enough about it .   as i hope to see you so soon  my dear fields  and as i am busily at work on the christmas number  i will not make this a longer letter than i can help .  i thank you most heartily for your proffered hospitality  and need not tell you that if i went to any friend s house in america  i would go to yours .  but the readings are very hard work  and i think i cannot do better than observe the rule on that side of the atlantic which i observe on this  of never  under such circumstances  going to a friend s house  but always staying at a hotel .  i am able to observe it here  by being consistent and never breaking it .  if i am equally consistent there  i can  i hope  offend no one .   dolby sends his love to you and all his friends  as i do   and is girding up his loins vigorously .   ever  my dear fields  heartily and affectionately yours .    sidenote  mr .  thornbury .    gad s hill  saturday   th october       .

better opening for itself .  fechter is a thorough artist  and what he may sometimes want in personal force is compensated by the admirable whole he can make of a play  and his perfect understanding

have nothing whatever to add to your notes and memoranda of the points to be touched again  except that i have a little uneasiness in that burst of anger and inflexibility consequent on having been deceived  coming out of hegio .  i see the kind of actor who must play hegio  and i see that the audience will not believe in his doing anything so serious .   i suppose it would be impossible to get this effect out of the mother  or through the mother s influence  instead of out of the godfather of hegiopolis .    now  as to the classical ground and manners of the play .  i suppose the objection to the greek dress to be already  as defoe would write it   gotten over  by your suggestion .  i suppose the dress not to be conventionally associated with stilts and boredom  but to be new to the public eye and very picturesque .  grant all that   the names remain .  now  not only used such names to be inseparable in the public mind from stately weariness  but of late days they have become inseparable in the same public mind from silly puns upon the names  and from burlesque .  you do not know  i hope  at least  for my friend s sake  what the strand theatre is .  a greek name and a break down nigger dance  have become inseparable there .  i do not mean to say that your genius may not be too powerful for such associations  but i do most positively mean to say that you would lose half the play in overcoming them .  at the best you would have to contend against them through the first three acts .  the old tendency to become frozen on classical ground would be in the best part of the audience  the new tendency to titter on such ground would be in the worst part .  and instead of starting fair with the audience  it is my conviction that you would start with them against you and would have to win them over .   furthermore  with reference to your note to me on this head  you take up a position with reference to poor dear talfourd s  ion  which i altogether dispute .  it never was a popular play  i say .  it derived a certain amount of out of door s popularity from the circumstances under which  and the man by whom  it was written .  but i say that it never was a popular play on the stage  and never made out a case of attraction there .   as to changing the ground to russia  let me ask you  did you ever see the  nouvelles russes  of nicolas gogol  translated into french by louis viardot .  there is a story among them called  tarass boulla   in which  as it seems to me  all the conditions you want for such transplantation are to be found .  so changed  you would have the popular sympathy with the slave or serf  or prisoner of war  from the first .  but i do not think it is to be got  save at great hazard  and with lamentable waste of force on the ground the play now occupies .   i shall keep this note until to morrow to correct my conviction if i can see the least reason for correcting it  but i feel very confident indeed that i cannot be shaken in it .              saturday .   i have thought it over again  and have gone over the play again with an imaginary stage and actors before me  and i am still of the same mind .  shall i keep the ms .  till you come to town .   believe me  ever affectionately yours .    sidenote  mr .  fechter .    parker house  boston   rd december       .   my dear fechter   i have been very uneasy about you  seeing in the paper that you were taken ill on the stage .  but a letter from georgy this morning reassures me by giving me a splendid account of your triumphant last night at the lyceum .   i hope to bring out our play     with wallack in new york  and to have it played in many other parts of the states .  i have sent to wilkie for models  etc .  if i waited for time to do more than write you my love  i should miss the mail to morrow .  take my love  then  my dear fellow  and believe me ever  your affectionate .   footnotes        the hon .  robert lytton  now the earl of lytton  in literature well known as  owen meredith .         mr .  henry w .  phillips  at this time secretary of the artists  general benevolent society .  he was eager to establish some educational system in

doors with charles dickens .         a ridiculous paragraph in the papers following close on the public announcement that charles dickens was coming to america in november  drew from him this letter to mr .  fields  dated early in october .        as to subjects for articles in  all the year round .         the play referred to is founded on the  captives  of plautus  and is entitled  the captives .   it has never been acted or published .         no thoroughfare .                    .    rd february       .       articles of agreement entered into at baltimore  in the united states of america  this third day of february in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight  between            british subject  alias the man of ross  and                 american citizen  alias the boston bantam .   whereas  some bounce having arisen between the above men in reference to feats of pedestrianism and agility  they have agreed to settle their differences and prove who is the better man  by means of a walking match for two hats a side and the glory of their respective countries  and whereas they agree that the said match shall come off  whatsoever the weather  on the mill dam road outside boston  on saturday  the twenty ninth day of this present month  and whereas they agree that the personal attendants on themselves during the whole walk  and also the umpires and starters and declarers of victory in the match shall be           of boston  known in sporting circles as massachusetts jemmy  and charles dickens of falstaff s gad s hill  whose surprising performances  without the least variation  on that truly national instrument  the american catarrh  have won for him the well merited title of the gad s hill gasper     .  the men are to be started  on the day appointed  by massachusetts jemmy and the gasper .     .  jemmy and the gasper are  on some previous day  to walk out at the rate of not less than four miles an hour by the gasper s watch  for one hour and a half .  at the expiration of that one hour and a half they are to carefully note the place at which they halt .  on the match s coming off they are to station themselves in the middle of the road  at that precise point  and the men  keeping clear of them and of each other  are to turn round them  right shoulder inward  and walk back to the starting point .  the man declared by them to pass the starting point first is to be the victor and the winner of the match .     .  no jostling or fouling allowed .     .  all cautions or orders issued to the men by the umpires  starters  and declarers of victory to be considered final and admitting of no appeal .   a sporting narrative of the match to be written by the gasper within one week after its coming off  and the same to be duly printed  at the expense of the subscribers to these articles  on a broadside .  the said broadside to be framed and glazed  and one copy of the same to be carefully preserved by each of the subscribers to these articles .     .  the men to show on the evening of the day of walking at six o clock precisely  at the parker house  boston  when and where a dinner will be given them by the gasper .  the gasper to occupy the chair  faced by massachusetts jemmy .  the latter promptly and formally to invite  as soon as may be after the date of these presents  the following guests to honour the said dinner with their presence  that is to say  here follow the names of a few of his friends  whom he wished to be invited  .   now  lastly .  in token of their accepting the trusts and offices by these articles conferred upon them  these articles are solemnly and formally signed by massachusetts jemmy and by the gad s hill gasper  as well as by the men themselves .   signed by the

books .  i have a particular love for books of travel  and shall wander into the  wilds of america  with great interest .  i have also received your charming sketch with great pleasure and admiration .  let me thank you for it heartily .  as a beautiful suggestion of nature associated with this country  it shall have a quiet place on the walls of my house as long as i live .   your reference to my dear friend washington irving renews the vivid impressions reawakened in my mind at baltimore the other day .  i saw his fine face for the last time in that city .  he came there from new york to pass a day or two with me before i went westward  and they were made among the most memorable of my life by his delightful fancy and genial humour .  some unknown admirer of his books and mine sent to the hotel a most enormous mint julep  wreathed with flowers .  we sat  one on either side of it  with great solemnity  it filled a respectable sized paper   but the solemnity was of very short duration .  it was quite an enchanted julep  and carried us among innumerable people and places that we both knew .  the julep held out far into the night  and my memory never saw him afterward otherwise than as bending over it  with his straw  with an attempted gravity  after some anecdote  involving some wonderfully droll and delicate observation of character   and then  as his eyes caught mine  melting into that captivating laugh of his which was the brightest and best i have ever heard .   dear sir  with many thanks  faithfully yours .    sidenote  mrs .  pease .    baltimore   th february       .   dear madam   mr .  dolby has not come between us  and i have received your letter .  my answer to it is  unfortunately  brief .  i am not coming to cleveland or near it .  every evening on which i can possibly read during the remainder of my stay in the states is arranged for  and the fates divide me from  the big woman with two smaller ones in tow .   so i send her my love  to be shared in by the two smaller ones  if she approve  but not otherwise   and seriously assure her that her pleasant letter has been most welcome .   dear madam  faithfully your friend .    sidenote  mr .  james t .  fields .    aboard the  russia   bound for liverpool  sunday    th april       .   my dear fields   in order that you may have the earliest intelligence of me  i begin this note to day in my small cabin  purposing  if it should prove practicable  to post it at queenstown for the return steamer .   we are already past the banks of newfoundland  although our course was seventy miles to the south  with the view of avoiding ice seen by judkins in the scotia on his passage out to new york .  the russia is a magnificent ship  and has dashed along bravely .  we had made more than thirteen hundred and odd miles at noon to day .  the wind  after being a little capricious  rather threatens at the present time to turn against us  but our run is already eighty miles ahead of the russia s last run in this direction  a very fast one .   .   .   .  to all whom it may concern  report the russia in the highest terms .  she rolls more easily than the other cunard screws  is kept in perfect order  and is most carefully looked after in all departments .  we have had nothing approaching to heavy weather  still one can speak to the trim of the ship .  her captain  a gentleman  bright  polite  good natured  and vigilant .   .   .   .   as to me  i am greatly better  i hope .  i have got on my right boot to day for the first time  the  true american  seems to be turning faithless at last  and i made a gad s hill breakfast this morning  as a further advance on having otherwise eaten and drunk all day ever since wednesday .   you will see anthony trollope  i daresay .  what was my amazement to see him with these eyes come aboard in the mail tender just before we started .  he had come out in the scotia just in time to dash off again in said tender to shake hands with me  knowing me to be aboard here .  it was most heartily done .  he is on a special mission of convention with the united states post office .   we have been picturing your movements  and have duly checked off your journey home  and have talked about you continually .  but i have thought about you both  even much  much more .  you will never know how i love you both  or what you have been to me in america  and will always be to me everywhere  or how fervently i thank you .   all the working of the ship seems to be done on my forehead .  it is scrubbed and holystoned  my head  not the deck  at three every morning .  it is scraped and swabbed all day .  eight pairs of heavy boots are now clattering on it  getting the ship under sail again .  legions of ropes  ends are flopped upon it as i write  and i must leave off with dolby s love .              thursday    th .   soon after i left off as above we had a gale of wind which blew all night .  for a few hours on the evening side of midnight there was no getting from this cabin of mine to the saloon  or vice vers    so heavily did the sea break over the decks .  the ship  however  made nothing of it  and we were all right again by monday afternoon .  except for a few hours yesterday  when we had a very light head wind   the weather has been constantly favourable  and we are now bowling away at a great rate  with a fresh breeze filling all our sails .  we expect to be at queenstown between midnight and three in the morning .   i hope  my dear fields  you may find this legible  but i rather doubt it  for there is motion enough on the ship to render writing to a landsman  however accustomed to pen and ink  rather a difficult achievement .  besides which  i slide away gracefully from the paper  whenever i want to be particularly expressive .   .   .   .         sitting opposite to me at breakfast  always has the following items  a large dish of porridge into which he casts slices of butter and a quantity of sugar .  two cups of tea .  a steak .  irish stew .  chutnee and marmalade .  another deputation of two has solicited a reading to night .  illustrious novelist has unconditionally and absolutely declined .  more love  and more to that  from your ever affectionate friend .    sidenote  the same .     all the year round  office  may   th       .   my dear fields   i have found it so extremely difficult to write about america  though never so briefly  without appearing to blow trumpets on the one hand  or to be inconsistent with my avowed determination not to write about it on the other  that i have taken the simple course enclosed .  the number will be published on the  th of june .  it appears to me to be the most modest and manly course  and to derive some graceful significance from its title .   thank my dear mrs .  fields for me for her delightful letter received on the   th .  i will write to her very soon  and tell her about the dogs .  i would write by this post  but that wills  absence  in sussex  and getting no better there as yet  so overwhelms me with business that i can scarcely get through it .   miss me .  ah  my dear fellow  but how do i miss you .  we talk about you both at gad s hill every day of our lives .  and i never see the place looking very pretty indeed  or hear the birds sing all day long and the nightingales all night  without restlessly wishing that you were both there .   with best love  and truest and most enduring regard  ever  my dear fields   your most affectionate .    .   .   .  i hope you will receive by saturday s cunard a case containing     .  a trifling supply of the pen knibs that suited your hand .     .  a do .  of unfailing medicine for cockroaches .     .  mrs .  gamp  for      .   the case is addressed to you at bleecker street  new york .  if it should be delayed for the knibs  or nibs  promised to morrow  and should be too late for the cunard packet  it will in that case come by the next following inman steamer .   everything here looks lovely  and i find it  you will be surprised to hear  really a pretty place .  i have seen  no thoroughfare  twice .  excellent things in it  but it drags to my thinking .  it is  however  a great success in the country  and is now getting up with great force in paris .  fechter is ill  and was ordered off to brighton yesterday .  wills is ill too  and banished into sussex for perfect rest .  otherwise  thank god  i find everything well and thriving .  you and my dear mrs .  fields are constantly in my mind .  procter greatly better .    sidenote  mr .  fechter .    office of  all the year round   friday    nd may       .   my dear fechter   i have an idea about the bedroom act  which i should certainly have suggested if i had been at our  repetitions  here .      i want it done to the sound of the waterfall .  i want the sound of the waterfall louder and softer as the wind rises and falls  to be spoken through  like the music .  i want the waterfall listened to when spoken of  and not looked out at .  the mystery and gloom of the scene would be greatly helped by this  and it would be new and picturesquely fanciful .   i am very anxious to hear from you how the piece seems to go      and how the artists  who are to act it  seem to understand their parts .  pray tell me  too  when you write  how you found madame fechter  and give all our loves to all .   ever heartily yours .    sidenote  mrs .  james t .  fields .    gad s hill  higham by rochester  kent    th may       .   my dear mrs .  fields   as you ask me about the dogs  i begin with them .  when i came down first  i came to gravesend  five miles off .  the two newfoundland dogs  coming to meet me with the usual carriage and the usual driver  and beholding me coming in my usual dress out at the usual door  it struck me that their recollection of my having been absent for any unusual time was at once cancelled .  they behaved  they are both young dogs  exactly in their usual manner  coming behind the basket phaeton as we trotted along  and lifting their heads to have their ears pulled  a special attention which they receive from no one else .  but when i drove into the stable yard  linda  the st .  bernard  was greatly excited  weeping profusely  and throwing herself on her back that she might caress my foot with her great fore paws .  mamie s little dog  too  mrs .  bouncer  barked in the greatest agitation on being called down and asked by mamie   who is this .   and tore round and round me  like the dog in the faust outlines .  you must know that all the farmers turned out on the road in their market chaises to say   welcome home  sir .   and that all the houses along the road were dressed with flags  and that our servants  to cut out the rest  had dressed this house so that every brick of it was hidden .  they had asked mamie s permission to  ring the alarm bell    .   when master drove up  but mamie  having some slight idea that that compliment might awaken master s sense of the ludicrous  had recommended bell abstinence .  but on sunday the village choir  which includes the bell ringers  made amends .  after some unusually brief pious reflections in the crowns of their hats at the end of the sermon  the ringers bolted out  and rang like mad until i got home .  there had been a conspiracy among the villagers to take the horse out  if i had come to our own station  and draw me here .  mamie and georgy had got wind of it and warned me .   divers birds sing here all day  and the nightingales all night .  the place is lovely  and in perfect order .  i have put five mirrors in the swiss ch  let  where i write  and they reflect and refract in all kinds of ways the leaves that are quivering at the windows  and the great fields of waving corn  and the sail dotted river .  my room is up among the branches of the trees  and the birds and the butterflies fly in and out  and the green branches shoot in  at the open windows  and the lights and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of the company .  the scent of the flowers  and indeed of everything that is growing for miles and miles  is most delicious .   dolby  who sends a world of messages  found his wife much better than he expected  and the children  wonderful to relate .   perfect .  the little girl winds up her prayers every night with a special commendation to heaven of me and the pony  as if i must mount him to get there .  i dine with dolby  i was going to write  him   but found it would look as if i were going to dine with the pony  at greenwich this very day  and if your ears do not burn from six to nine this evening  then the atlantic is a non conductor .  we are already settling  think of this .   the details of my farewell course of readings .  i am brown beyond belief  and cause the greatest disappointment in all quarters by looking so well .  it is really wonderful what those fine days at sea did for me .  my doctor was quite broken down in spirits when he saw me  for the first time since my return  last saturday .   good lord .   he said  recoiling   seven years younger .    it is time i should explain the otherwise inexplicable enclosure .  will you tell fields  with my love  i suppose he hasn t used all the pens yet .    that i think there is in tremont street a set of my books  sent out by chapman  not arrived when i departed .  such set of the immortal works of our illustrious  etc .   is designed for the gentleman to whom the enclosure is addressed .  if t .   f .  and co .   will kindly forward the set  carriage paid  with the enclosure to      s address  i will invoke new blessings on their heads  and will get dolby s little daughter to mention them nightly .    no thoroughfare  is very shortly coming out in paris  where it is now in active rehearsal .  it is still playing here  but without fechter  who has been very ill .  the doctor s dismissal of him to paris  however  and his getting better there  enables him to get up the play there .  he and wilkie missed so many pieces of stage effect here  that  unless i am quite satisfied with his report  i shall go over and try my stage managerial hand at the vaudeville theatre .  i particularly want the drugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene at the swiss inn to be done to the sound of a waterfall rising and falling with the wind .  although in the very opening of that scene they speak of the waterfall and listen to it  nobody thought of its mysterious music .  i could make it  with a good stage carpenter  in an hour .   my dear love to fields once again .  same to you and him from mamie and georgy .  i cannot tell you both how i miss you  or how overjoyed i should be to see you here .   ever  my dear mrs .  fields  your most affectionate friend .    sidenote  mr .  alexander ireland .    the athen  um  saturday    th may       .   dear mr .  ireland   many thanks for the book     you have kindly lent me .  my interest in its subject is scarcely less than your own  and the book has afforded me great pleasure .  i hope it will prove a very useful tribute to hazlett and hunt  in extending the general knowledge of their writings   as well as a deservedly hearty and loving one .   you gratify me much by your appreciation of my desire to promote the kindest feelings between england and america .  but the writer of the generous article in the manchester examiner is quite mistaken in supposing that i intend to write a book on the united states .  the fact is exactly the reverse  or i could not have spoken without some appearance of having a purpose to serve .   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  james t .  fields .    gad s hill place  tuesday   th july       .   my dear fields   i have delayed writing to you  and mrs .  fields  to whom my love  until i should have seen longfellow .  when he was in london the first time he came and went without reporting himself  and left me in a state of unspeakable discomfiture .  indeed  i should not have believed in his having been here at all  if mrs .  procter had not told me of his calling to see procter .  however  on his return he wrote to me from the langham hotel  and i went up to town to see him  and to make an appointment for his coming here .  he  the girls  and appleton  came down last saturday night and stayed until monday forenoon .  i showed them all the neighbouring country that could be shown in so short a time  and they finished off with a tour of inspection of the kitchens  pantry  wine cellar  pickles  sauces  servants  sitting room  general household stores  and even the cellar book  of this illustrious establishment .  forster and kent  the latter wrote certain verses to longfellow  which have been published in the times  and which i sent to d      came down for a day  and i hope we all had a really  good time .   i turned out a couple of postillions in the old red jacket of the old red royal dover road  for our ride  and it was like a holiday ride in england fifty years ago .  of course we went to look at the old houses in rochester  and the old cathedral  and the old castle  and the house for the six poor travellers who   not being rogues or procters  shall have lodging  entertainment  and four pence each .    nothing can surpass the respect paid to longfellow here  from the queen downward .  he is everywhere received and courted  and finds  as i told him he would  when we talked of it in boston  the working men at least as well acquainted with his books as the classes socially above them .   .   .   .   last thursday i attended  as sponsor  the christening of dolby s son and heir  a most jolly baby  who held on tight by the rector s left whisker while the service was performed .  what time  too  his little sister  connecting me with the pony  trotted up and down the centre aisle  noisily driving herself as that celebrated animal  so that it went very hard with the sponsorial dignity .   wills is not yet recovered from that concussion of the brain  and i have all his work to do .  this may account for my not being able to devise a christmas number  but i seem to have left my invention in america .  in case you should find it  please send it over .  i am going up to town to day to dine with longfellow .  and now  my dear fields  you know all about me and mine .   you are enjoying your holiday .  and are still thinking sometimes of our boston days  as i do .  and are maturing schemes for coming here next summer .  a satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly entreated .   i am delighted to find you both so well pleased with the blind book scheme .      i said nothing of it to you when we were together  though i had made up my mind  because i wanted to come upon you with that little burst from a distance .  it seemed something like meeting again when i remitted the money and thought of your talking of it .   the dryness of the weather is amazing .  all the ponds and surface wells about here are waterless  and the poor people suffer greatly .  the people of this village have only one spring to resort to  and it is a couple of miles from many cottages .  i do not let the great dogs swim in the canal  because the people have to drink of it .  but when they get into the medway it is hard to get them out again .  the other day bumble  the son  newfoundland dog  got into difficulties among some floating timber  and became frightened .  don  the father  was standing by me  shaking off the wet and looking on carelessly  when all of a sudden he perceived something amiss  and went in with a bound and brought bumble out by the ear .  the scientific way in which he towed him along was charming .   ever your loving .    sidenote  mr .  j .  e .  millais  r . a .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  sunday    th july       .   my dear millais       i received the enclosed letter yesterday  and i have  perhaps unjustly  some vague suspicions of it .  as i know how faithful and zealous you have been in all relating to poor leech  i make no apology for asking you whether you can throw any light upon its contents .   you will be glad to hear that charles collins is decidedly better to day  and is out of doors .   believe me always  faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  serle .    gad s hill  wednesday    th july       .   my dear serle       i do not believe there is the slightest chance of an international copyright law being passed in america for a long time to come .  some massachusetts men do believe in such a thing  but they fail  as i think  to take into account the prompt western opposition .   such an alteration as you suggest in the english law would give no copyright in america  you see .  the american publisher could buy no absolute right of priority .  any american newspaper could  and many would  in a popular case  pirate from him  as soon as they could get the matter set up .  he could buy no more than he buys now when he arranges for advance sheets from england  so that there may be simultaneous publication in the two countries .  and success in england is of so much importance towards the achievement of success in america  that i greatly doubt whether previous publications in america would often be worth more to an american publisher or manager than simultaneous publication .  concerning the literary man in parliament who would undertake to bring in a bill for such an amendment of our copyright law  with weight enough to keep his heart unbroken while he should be getting it through its various lingering miseries  all i can say is  i decidedly don t know him .   on that horrible staplehurst day  i had not the slightest idea that i knew anyone in the train out of my own compartment .  mrs .  cowden clarke     wrote me afterwards  telling me in the main what you tell me  and i was astonished .  it is remarkable that my watch  a special chronometer  has never gone quite correctly since  and to this day there sometimes comes over me  on a railway  in a hansom cab  or any sort of conveyance  for a few seconds  a vague sense of dread that i have no power to check .  it comes and passes  but i cannot prevent its coming .   believe me  always faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  rusden .      th august       .   my dear sir   i should have written to you much sooner  but that i have been home from the united states barely three months  and have since been a little uncertain as to the precise time and way of sending my youngest son out to join his brother alfred .   it is now settled that he shall come out in the ship sussex       tons  belonging to messrs .  money  wigram  and co .  she sails from gravesend  but he will join her at plymouth on the   th september  and will proceed straight to melbourne .  of this i apprise alfred by this mail .   .   .   .  i cannot sufficiently thank you for your kindness to alfred .  i am certain that a becoming sense of it and desire to deserve it  has done him great good .   your report of him is an unspeakable comfort to me  and i most heartily assure you of my gratitude and friendship .   in the midst of your colonial seethings and heavings  i suppose you have some leisure to consult equally the hopeful prophets and the dismal prophets who are all wiser than any of the rest of us as to things at home here .  my own strong impression is that whatsoever change the new reform bill may effect will be very gradual indeed and quite wholesome .   numbers of the middle class who seldom or never voted before will vote now  and the greater part of the new voters will in the main be wiser as to their electoral responsibilities and more seriously desirous to discharge them for the common good than the bumptious singers of  rule britannia    our dear old church of england   and all the rest of it .   if i can ever do anything for any accredited friend of yours coming to the old country  command me .  i shall be truly glad of any opportunity of testifying that i do not use a mere form of words in signing myself   cordially yours .    sidenote  mr .  russell sturgis .    kennedy s hotel  edinburgh  monday    th december       .       my dear mr .  russell sturgis   i am  reading  here  and shall be through this week .  consequently i am only this morning in receipt of your kind note of the   th  forwarded from my own house .   believe me i am as much obliged to you for your generous and ready response to my supposed letter as i should have been if i had really written it .  but i know nothing whatever of it or of  miss jeffries   except that i have a faint impression of having recently noticed that name among my begging letter correspondents  and of having associated it in my mind with a regular professional hand .  your caution has  i hope  disappointed this swindler .  but my testimony is at your service if you should need it  and i would take any opportunity of bringing one of those vagabonds to punishment  for they are  one and all  the most heartless and worthless vagabonds on the face of the earth .   believe me  faithfully yours .    sidenote  mrs .  james t .  fields .    glasgow  wednesday  december          .   my dear mrs .  fields    .   .   .  first  as you are curious about the oliver murder  i will tell you about that trial of the same at which you ought to have assisted .  there were about a hundred people present in all .  i have changed my stage .  besides that back screen which you know so well  there are two large screens of the same colour  set off  one on either side  like the  wings  at a theatre .  and besides these again  we have a quantity of curtains of the same colour  with which to close in any width of room from wall to wall .  consequently  the figure is now completely isolated  and the slightest action becomes much more important .  this was used for the first time on the occasion .  but behind the stage  the orchestra being very large and built for the accommodation of a numerous chorus  there was ready  on the level of the platform  a very long table  beautifully lighted  with a large staff of men ready to open oysters and set champagne corks flying .  directly i had done  the screens being whisked off by my people  there was disclosed one of the prettiest banquets you can imagine  and when all the people came up  and the gay dresses of the ladies were lighted by those powerful lights of mine  the scene was exquisitely pretty  the hall being newly decorated  and very elegantly  and the whole looking like a great bed of flowers and diamonds .   now  you must know that all this company were  before the wine went round  unmistakably pale  and had horror stricken faces .  next morning harness  fields knows  rev .  william  did an edition of shakespeare  old friend of the kembles and mrs .  siddons   writing to me about it  and saying it was  a most amazing and terrific thing   added   but i am bound to tell you that i had an almost irresistible impulse upon me to scream  and that  if anyone had cried out  i am certain i should have followed .   he had no idea that  on the night  p      the great ladies  doctor  had taken me aside and said   my dear dickens  you may rely upon it that if only one woman cries out when you murder the girl  there will be a contagion of hysteria all over this place .   it is impossible to soften it without spoiling it  and you may suppose that i am rather anxious to discover how it goes on the  th of january .  .  .  we are afraid to announce it elsewhere  without knowing  except that i have thought it pretty safe to put it up once in dublin .  i asked mrs .  k      the famous actress  who was at the experiment   what do you say .  do it or not .    why  of course  do it   she replied .   having got at such an effect as that  it must be done .  but   rolling her large black eyes very slowly  and speaking very distinctly   the public have been looking out for a sensation these last fifty years or so  and by heaven they have got it .   with which words  and a long breath and a long stare  she became speechless .  again  you may suppose that i am a little anxious .   not a day passes but dolby and i talk about you both  and recall where we were at the corresponding time of last year .  my old likening of boston to edinburgh has been constantly revived within these last ten days .  there is a certain remarkable similarity of tone between the two places .  the audiences are curiously alike  except that the edinburgh audience has a quicker sense of humour and is a little more genial .  no disparagement to boston in this  because i consider an edinburgh audience perfect .   i trust  my dear eugenius  that you have recognised yourself in a certain uncommercial  and also some small reference to a name rather dear to you .  as an instance of how strangely something comic springs up in the midst of the direst misery  look to a succeeding uncommercial  called  a small star in the east   published to day  by the bye .  i have described  with exactness  the poor places into which i went  and how the people behaved  and what they said .  i was wretched  looking on  and yet the boiler maker and the poor man with the legs filled me with a sense of drollery not to be kept down by any pressure .   the atmosphere of this place  compounded of mists from the highlands and smoke from the town factories  is crushing my eyebrows as i write  and it rains as it never does rain anywhere else  and always does rain here .  it is a dreadful place  though much improved and possessing a deal of public spirit .  improvement is beginning to knock the old town of edinburgh about  here and there  but the canongate and the most picturesque of the horrible courts and wynds are not to be easily spoiled  or made fit for the poor wretches who people them to live in .  edinburgh is so changed as to its notabilities  that i had the only three men left of the wilson and jeffrey time to dine with me there  last saturday .   i think you will find  fatal zero   by percy fitzgerald  a very curious analysis of a mind  as the story advances .  a new beginner in  a .  y .  r .    hon .  mrs .  clifford  kinglake s sister   who wrote a story in the series just finished  called  the abbot s pool   has just sent me another story .  i have a strong impression that  with care  she will step into mrs .  gaskell s vacant place .  wills is no better  and i have work enough even in that direction .   god bless the woman with the black mittens for making me laugh so this morning .  i take her to be a kind of public spirited mrs .  sparsit  and as such take her to my bosom .  god bless you both  my dear friends  in this christmas and new year time  and in all times  seasons  and places  and send you to gad s hill with the next flowers .   ever your most affectionate .    sidenote  mr .  russell sturgis .    kennedy s hotel  edinburgh  friday    th december       .   my dear mr .  russell sturgis   i return you the forged letter  and devoutly wish that i had to flog the writer in virtue of a legal sentence .  i most cordially reciprocate your kind expressions in reference to our future intercourse  and shall hope to remind you of them five or six months hence  when my present labours shall have gone the way of all other earthly things .  it was particularly interesting to me when i was last at boston to recognise poor dear felton s unaffected and genial ways in his eldest daughter  and to notice how  in tender remembrance of him  she is  as it were  cambridge s daughter .   believe me always  faithfully yours .   footnotes        it was at baltimore that charles dickens first conceived the idea of a walking match  which should take place on his return to boston  and he drew up a set of humorous  articles .         the play of  no thoroughfare   was produced at the adelphi theatre  under the management of mr .  webster .        mr .  fechter was  at this time  superintending the production of a french version of  no thoroughfare   in paris .  it was called  l ab  me .         the volume referred to is a  list of the writings of william hazlett and leigh hunt  chronologically arranged  with notes  descriptive  critical  and explanatory  etc .         a copy of  the old curiosity shop   in raised letters for the use of the blind  had been printed by charles dickens s order at the  perkins institution for the blind  in boston  and presented by him to that institution in this year .        john everett millais  r . a .   the editors make use of this note  as it is the only one which mr .

  th march       .   my dear mrs .  forster   a thousand thanks for your note  which has reached me here this afternoon .  at breakfast this morning dolby showed me the local paper with a paragraph in it recording poor dear tennent s     death .  you may imagine how shocked i was .  immediately before i left town this last time  i had an unusually affectionate letter from him  enclosing one from forster  and proposing the friendly dinner since appointed for the   th .  i replied to him in the same spirit  and felt touched at the time by the gentle earnestness of his tone .  it is remarkable that i talked of him a great deal yesterday to dolby  who knew nothing of him   and that i reverted to him again at night before going to bed  with no reason that i know of .  dolby was strangely impressed by this  when he showed me the newspaper .   god be with us all .   ever your affectionate .    sidenote  mr .  h .  a .  layard .    office of  all the year round   saturday    th march

possession that i shall always prize foremost among my worldly goods  firstly  for your sake  secondly  for its own .   not one of these glasses shall be set on table until mrs .  layard is there  to touch with her lips the first champagne that any of them shall ever hold .  this vow has been registered in solemn triumvirate at gad s hill .   the first week in june will about see me through my present work  i hope .  i came to town hurriedly to attend poor dear emerson tennent s funeral .  you will know how my mind went back  in the york up train at midnight  to mount vesuvius and our neapolitan supper .   i have given mr .  hills  of oxford street  the letter of introduction to you that you kindly permitted .  he has immense local influence  and could carry his neighbours in

received your kind note this morning  and i hasten to thank you for it  and to assure your dear mother of our most cordial sympathy with her in her great affliction  and in loving remembrance of the good man and excellent friend we have lost .  the tidings of his being very ill indeed had  of course  been reported to me .  for some days past i had taken up the newspaper with sad misgivings  and this morning  before i got your letter  they were realised .   i loved him truly .  his wonderful gentleness and kindness  years ago  when we had sickness in our household in paris  has never been out of my grateful remembrance .  and  socially  his image is inseparable from some of the most genial and delightful friendly hours of my life .  i am almost ashamed to set such recollections by the side of your mother s great bereavement and grief  but they spring out of the fulness of my heart .   may god be with her and with you all .   ever yours affectionately .    sidenote  mr .  james t .  fields .    adelphi hotel  liverpool  friday  april  th       .   my dear fields   the faithful russia will bring this out to you  as a sort of warrant to take you into loving custody and bring you back on her return trip .   i rather think that when the   th of june shall have shaken off these shackles       there will be borage on the lawn at gad s .  your heart s desire in that matter  and in the minor particulars of cobham park  rochester castle  and canterbury  shall be fulfilled  please god .  the red jackets shall turn out again upon the turnpike road  and picnics among the cherry orchards and hop gardens shall be heard of in kent .  then  too  shall the uncommercial resuscitate  being at present nightly murdered by mr .  w .  sikes  and uplift his voice again .   the chief officer of the russia  a capital fellow  was at the reading last night  and dolby specially charged him with the care of you and yours .  we shall be on the borders of wales  and probably about hereford  when you arrive .  dolby has insane projects of getting over here to meet you  so amiably hopeful and obviously impracticable  that i encourage him to the utmost .  the regular little captain of the russia  cook  is just now changed into the cuba  whence arise disputes of seniority  etc .  i wish he had been with you  for i liked him very much when i was his passenger .  i like to think of your being in my ship .        and      have been taking it by turns to be  on the point of death   and have been complimenting one another greatly on the fineness of the point attained .  my people got a very good impression of       and thought her a sincere and earnest little woman .   the russia hauls out into the stream to day  and i fear her people may be too busy to come to us to night .  but if any of them do  they shall have the warmest of welcomes for your sake .   by the bye  a very good party of seamen from the queen s ship donegal  lying in the mersey  have been told off to decorate st .  george s hall with the ship s bunting .  they were all hanging on aloft upside down  holding to the gigantically high roof by nothing  this morning  in the most wonderfully cheerful manner .    my son charley has come for the dinner  and chappell  my proprietor  as  isn t it wemmick .   says  is coming to day  and lord dufferin  mrs .  norton s nephew  is to come and make the speech .  i don t envy the feelings of my noble friend when he sees the hall .  seriously  it is less adapted to speaking than westminster abbey  and is as large .   .   .   .   i hope you will see fechter in a really clever piece by wilkie .       also you will see the academy exhibition  which will be a very good one  and also we will  please god  see everything and more  and everything else after that .  i begin to doubt and fear on the subject of your having a horror of me after seeing the murder .  i don t think a hand moved while i was doing it last night  or an eye looked away .  and there was a fixed expression of horror of me  all over the theatre  which could not have been surpassed if i had been going to be hanged to that red velvet table .  it is quite a new sensation to be execrated with that unanimity  and i hope it will remain so .    is it lawful  would that woman in the black gaiters  green veil  and spectacles  hold it so  to send my love to the pretty m     .    pack up  my dear fields  and be quick .   ever your most affectionate .    sidenote  mr .  rusden .    preston  thursday    nd april       .   my dear sir   i am finishing my farewell readings  to night is the seventy fourth out of one hundred  and have barely time to send you a line to thank you most heartily for yours of the   th january  and for your great kindness to alfred and edward .  the latter wrote by the same mail  on behalf of both  expressing the warmest gratitude to you  and reporting himself in the stoutest heart and hope .  i never can thank you sufficiently .   you will see that the new ministry has made a decided hit with its budget  and that in the matter of the irish church it has the country at its back .  you will also see that the  reform league  has dissolved itself  indisputably because it became aware that the people did not want it .   i think the general feeling in england is a desire to get the irish church out of the way of many social reforms  and to have it done with as already done for .  i do not in the least believe myself that agrarian ireland is to be pacified by any such means  or can have it got out of its mistaken head that the land is of right the peasantry s  and that every man who owns land has stolen it and is therefore to be shot .  but that is not the question .   the clock strikes post time as i write  and i fear to write more  lest  at this distance from london  i should imperil the next mail .   cordially yours .    sidenote  mr .  thomas chappell .    office of  all the year round   monday   rd may       .   my dear mr .  chappell   i am really touched by your letter .  i can most truthfully assure you that your part in the inconvenience of this mishap has given me much more concern than my own  and that if i did not hope to have our london farewells yet  i should be in a very gloomy condition on your account .   pray do not suppose that you are to blame for my having done a little too much  a wild fancy indeed .  the simple fact is  that the rapid railway travelling was stretched a hair s breadth too far  and that i ought to have foreseen it .  for  on the night before the last night of our reading in america  when dolby was cheering me with a review of the success  and the immediate prospect of the voyage home  i told him  to his astonishment   i am too far gone  and too worn out to realise anything but my own exhaustion .  believe me  if i had to read but twice more  instead of once  i couldn t do it .   we were then just beyond our recent number .  and it was the travelling that i had felt throughout .   the sharp precautionary remedy of stopping instantly  was almost as instantly successful the other day .  i told dr .  watson that he had never seen me knocked out of time  and that he had no idea of the rapidity with which i should come up again .   just as three days  repose on the atlantic steamer made me  in my altered appearance  the amazement of the captain  so this last week has set me up  thank god  in the most wonderful manner .  the sense of exhaustion seems a dream already .  of course i shall train myself carefully  nevertheless  all through the summer and autumn .   i beg to send my kind regards to mrs .  chappell  and i shall hope to see her and you at teddington in the long bright days .  it would disappoint me indeed if a lasting friendship did not come of our business relations .   in the spring i trust i shall be able to report to you that i am ready to take my farewells in london .  of this i am pretty certain  that i never will take them at all  unless with you on your own conditions .   with an affectionate regard for you and your brother  believe me always   very faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  rusden .     all the year round  office  tuesday    th may       .   my dear mr .  rusden   as i daresay some exaggerated accounts of my having been very ill have reached you  i begin with the true version of the case .   i daresay i should have been very ill if i had not suddenly stopped my farewell readings when there were yet five and twenty remaining to be given .  i was quite exhausted  and was warned by the doctors to stop  for the time  instantly .  acting on the advice  and going home into kent for rest  i immediately began to recover  and within a fortnight was in the brilliant condition in which i can now  thank god  report myself .   i cannot thank you enough for your care of plorn .  i was quite prepared for his not settling down without a lurch or two .  i still hope that he may take to colonial life .   .   .   .  in his letter to me about his leaving the station to which he got through your kindness  he expresses his gratitude to you quite as strongly as if he had made a wonderful success  and seems to have acquired no distaste for anything but the one individual of whom he wrote that betrayed letter .  but knowing the boy  i want to try him fully .   you know all our public news  such as it is  at least as well as i do .  many people here  of whom i am one  do not like the look of american matters .   what i most fear is that the perpetual bluster of a party in the states will at last set the patient british back up .  and if our people begin to bluster too  and there should come into existence an exasperating war party on both sides  there will be great danger of a daily widening breach .   the first shriek of the first engine that traverses the san francisco railroad from end to end will be a death warning to the disciples of jo smith .  the moment the mormon bubble gets touched by neighbours it will break .  similarly  the red man s course is very nearly run .  a scalped stoker is the outward and visible sign of his utter extermination .  not quakers enough to reach from here to jerusalem will save him by the term of a single year .   i don t know how it may be with you  but it is the fashion here to be absolutely certain that the emperor of the french is fastened by providence and the fates on a throne of adamant expressly constructed for him since the foundations of the universe were laid .   he knows better  and so do the police of paris  and both powers must be grimly entertained by the resolute british belief  knowing what they have known  and doing what they have done through the last ten years .  what victor hugo calls  the drop curtain  behind which is constructing the great last act of the french revolution   has been a little shaken at the bottom lately  however .  one seems to see the feet of a rather large chorus getting ready .   i enclose a letter for plorn to your care  not knowing how to address him .  forgive me for so doing  i write to alfred direct   and believe me  my dear mr .  rusden   yours faithfully and much obliged .    sidenote  miss emily jolly .    office of  all the year round   thursday    nd july       .   dear miss jolly   mr .  wills has retired from here  for rest and to recover his health   and my son  who occupies his place  brought me this morning a story      in ms .   with a request that i would read it .  i read it with extraordinary interest  and was greatly surprised by its uncommon merit .  on asking whence it came  i found that it came from you .   you need not to be told  after this  that i accept it with more than readiness .  if you will allow me i will go over it with great care  and very slightly touch it here and there .  i think it will require to be divided into three portions .  you shall have the proofs and i will publish it immediately .  i think so very highly of it that i will have special attention called to it in a separate advertisement .  i congratulate you most sincerely and heartily on having done a very special thing .  it will always stand apart in my mind from any other story i ever read .  i write with its impression newly and strongly upon me  and feel absolutely sure that i am not mistaken .   believe me  faithfully yours always .    sidenote  hon .  robert lytton .        wellington street  london  thursday   nd september       .   my dear robert lytton    john acland  is most willingly accepted  and shall come in to the next monthly part .  i shall make bold to condense him here and there  according to my best idea of story telling   and particularly where he makes the speech   and with the usual fault of being too long  here and there  i think you let the story out too much  prematurely  and this i hope to prevent artfully .  i think your title open to the same objection  and therefore propose to substitute   the disappearance of john acland .   this will leave the reader in doubt whether he really was murdered  until the end .   i am sorry you do not pursue the other prose series .  you can do a great deal more than you think for  with whatever you touch  and you know where to find a firmly attached and admiring friend always ready to take the field with you  and always proud to see your plume among the feathers in the staff .   your account of my dear boffin      is highly charming   i had been troubled with a misgiving that he was good .  may his shadow never be more correct .   i wish i could have you at the murder from  oliver twist .    i am always  my dear robert lytton  affectionately your friend .              pray give my kindest regards to fascination fledgeby  who  i have no doubt  has by this time half a dozen new names  feebly expressive of his great merits .    sidenote  the same .    office of  all the year round       wellington street  strand  london  friday   st october       .   my dear robert lytton   i am assured by a correspondent that  john acland  has been done before .  said correspondent has evidently read the story  and is almost confident in  chambers s journal .   this is very unfortunate  but of course cannot be helped .  there is always a possibility of such a malignant conjunction of stars when the story is a true one .   in the case of a good story  as this is  liable for years to be told at table  as this was  there is nothing wonderful in such a mischance .  let us shuffle the cards  as sancho says  and begin again .   you will of course understand that i do not tell you this by way of complaint .  indeed  i should not have mentioned it at all  but as an explanation to you of my reason for winding the story up  which i have done to day  as expeditiously as possible .  you might otherwise have thought me  on reading it as published  a little hard on mr .  doilly .  i have not had time to direct search to be made in  chambers s   but as to the main part of the story having been printed somewhere  i have not the faintest doubt .  and i believe my correspondent to be also right as to the where .  you could not help it any more than i could  and therefore will not be troubled by it any more than i am .   the more i get of your writing  the better i shall be pleased .   do believe me to be  as i am  your genuine admirer and affectionate friend .    sidenote  mr .  rusden .    gad s hill place  higham by rochester  kent  sunday    th october       .   my dear mr .  rusden   this very day a great meeting is announced to come off in london  as a demonstration in favour of a fenian  amnesty .   no doubt its numbers and importance are ridiculously over estimated  but i believe the gathering will turn out to be big enough to be a very serious obstruction in the london streets .  i have a great doubt whether such demonstrations ought to be allowed .  they are bad as a precedent  and they unquestionably interfere with the general liberty and freedom of the subject .   moreover  the time must come when this kind of threat and defiance will have to be forcibly stopped  and when the unreasonable toleration of it will lead to a sacrifice of life among the comparatively innocent lookers on that might have been avoided but for a false confidence on their part  engendered in the damnable system of laisser aller .  you see how right we were  you and i  in our last correspondence on this head  and how desperately unsatisfactory the condition of ireland is  especially when considered with a reference to america .  the government has  through mr .  gladstone  just now spoken out boldly in reference to the desired amnesty .   so much the better for them or they would unquestionably have gone by the board .   still there is an uneasy feeling abroad that mr .  gladstone himself would grant this amnesty if he dared  and that there is a great weakness in the rest of their irish policy .  and this feeling is very strong amongst the noisiest irish howlers .  meanwhile  the newspapers go on arguing irish matters as if the irish were a reasonable people  in which immense assumption i  for one  have not the smallest faith .   again  i have to thank you most heartily for your kindness to my two boys .  it is impossible to predict how plorn will settle down  or come out of the effort to do so .  but he has unquestionably an affectionate nature  and a certain romantic touch in him .  both of these qualities are  i hope  more impressible for good than for evil  and i trust in god for the rest .   the news of lord derby s death will reach you  i suppose  at about the same time as this letter .  a rash  impetuous  passionate man  but a great loss for his party  as a man of mind and mark .  i was staying last june with lord russell  six or seven years older  but  except for being rather deaf  in wonderful preservation  and brighter and more completely armed at all points than i have seen him these twenty years .   as this need not be posted till friday  i shall leave it open for a final word or two  and am until then  and then  and always afterwards  my dear mr .  rusden   your faithful and much obliged .   thursday    th .   we have no news in england except two slight changes in the government consequent on layard s becoming our minister at madrid .  he is not long married to a charming lady  and will be far better in spain than in the house of commons .  the ministry are now holding councils on the irish land tenure question  which is the next difficulty they have to deal with  as you know .  last sunday s meeting was a preposterous failure  still  it brought together in the streets of london all the ruffian part of the population of london  and that is a serious evil which any one of a thousand accidents might render mischievous .  there is no existing law  however  to stop these assemblages  so that they keep moving while in the streets .   the government was undoubtedly wrong when it considered it had the right to close hyde park  that is now universally conceded .   i write to alfred and plorn both by this mail .  they can never say enough of your kindness when they write to me .    sidenote  mr .  a .  h .  layard .    gad s hill place  monday   th november       .   my dear layard   on friday or saturday next i can come to you at any time after twelve that will suit your convenience .  i had no idea of letting you go away without my god speed  but i knew how busy you must be  and kept in the background  biding my time .   i am sure you know that there is no man living more attached to you than i am .  after considering the subject with the jealousy of a friend  i have a strong conviction that your change      is a good one  ill as you can be spared from the ranks of men who are in earnest here .   with kindest regards to mrs .  layard .   ever faithfully yours .   footnotes        sir james emerson tennent .         some venetian glass champagne tumblers

presented at the adelphi theatre .  the outline of the plot was suggested by mr .  fechter .         the story was called  an experience .           boffin  and  fascination fledgeby   were nicknames given to his children by mr .  robert lytton at this time .         mr .  layard s appointment as british minister at madrid .                   .    sidenote  mr .  james t .  fields .       hyde park place  london  w .   friday  january   th       .   my dear fields   we live here  opposite the marble arch  in a charming house until the  st of june  and then return to gad s .  the conservatory is completed  and is a brilliant success  but an expensive one .   i should be quite ashamed of not having written to you and my dear mrs .  fields before now  if i didn t know that you will both understand how occupied i am  and how naturally  when i put my papers away for the day  i get up and fly .  i have a large room here  with three fine windows  overlooking the park  unsurpassable for airiness and cheerfulness .   you saw the announcement of the death of poor dear harness .  the circumstances are curious .  he wrote to his old friend the dean of battle saying he would come to visit him on that day  the day of his death  .  the dean wrote back   come next day  instead  as we are obliged to go out to dinner  and you will be alone .   harness told his sister a little impatiently that he must go on the first named day  that he had made up his mind to go  and must .  he had been getting himself ready for dinner  and came to a part of the staircase whence two doors opened  one  upon another level passage  one  upon a flight of stone steps .  he opened the wrong door  fell down the steps  injured himself very severely  and died in a few hours .   you will know  i don t  what fechter s success is in america at the time of this present writing .  in his farewell performances at the princess s he acted very finely .  i thought the three first acts of his hamlet very much better than i had ever thought them before  and i always thought very highly of them .  we gave him a foaming stirrup cup at gad s hill .   forster  who has been ill with his bronchitis again  thinks no .    of the new book   edwin drood   a clincher   i mean that word  as his own expression  for clincher .  there is a curious interest steadily working up to no .     which requires a great deal of art and self denial .  i think also  apart from character and picturesqueness  that the young people are placed in a very novel situation .  so i hope  at nos .    and    the story will turn upon an interest suspended until the end .   i can t believe it  and don t  and won t  but they say harry s twenty first birthday is next sunday .  i have entered him at the temple just now  and if he don t get a fellowship at trinity hall when his time comes  i shall be disappointed  if in the present disappointed state of existence .   i hope you may have met with the little touch of radicalism i gave them at birmingham in the words of buckle .  with pride i observe that it makes the regular political traders  of all sorts  perfectly mad .  such was my intentions  as a grateful acknowledgment of having been misrepresented .   i think mrs .       s prose very admirable  but i don t believe it .  no  i do not .  my conviction is that those islanders get frightfully bored by the islands  and wish they had never set eyes upon them .   charley collins has done a charming cover for the monthly part of the new book .  at the very earnest representations of millais  and after having seen a great number of his drawings  i am going to engage with a new man  retaining of course  c .  c .  s cover aforesaid .       katie has made some more capital portraits  and is always improving .   my dear mrs .  fields  if  he   made proud by chairs and bloated by pictures  does not give you my dear love  let us conspire against him when you find him out  and exclude him from all future confidences .  until then   ever affectionately yours and his .    sidenote  lord lytton .       hyde park place  monday    th february       .   my dear lytton   i ought to have mentioned in my hurried note to you  that my knowledge of the consultation      in question only preceded yours by certain hours  and that longman asked me if i would make the design known to you  as he thought it might be a liberty to address you otherwise .  this i did therefore .   the class of writers to whom you refer at the close of your note  have no copyright  and do not come within my case at all .  i quite agree with you as to their propensities and deserts .   indeed  i suppose in the main that there is very little difference between our opinions .  i do not think the present government worse than another  and i think it better than another by the presence of mr .  gladstone  but it appears to me that our system fails .   ever yours .    sidenote  mr .  frederic chapman .       hyde park place  monday    th march       .   dear frederic chapman   mr .  fildes has been with me this morning  and without complaining of      or expressing himself otherwise than as being obliged to him for his care in no .     represents that there is a brother student of his  a wood engraver  perfectly acquainted with his style and well understanding his meaning  who would render him better .   i have replied to him that there can be no doubt that he has a claim beyond dispute to our employing whomsoever he knows will present him in his best aspect .  therefore  we must make the change  the rather because the fellow student in question has engraved mr .  fildes  most successful drawings hitherto .   faithfully yours .    sidenote  mr .  charles mackay .    office of  all the year round   thursday    st april       .   my dear mackay   i have placed  god s acre .   the prose paper   the false friend   has lingered  because it seems to me that the idea is to be found in an introduced story of mine called  the baron of grogzwig  in  pickwick .    be pleasant with the scottish people in handling johnson  because i love them .   ever faithfully .    sidenote  sir john bowring .    gad s hill  thursday   th may       .   my dear sir john   i send you many cordial thanks for your note  and the very curious drawing accompanying it .  i ought to tell you  perhaps  that the opium smoking i have described  i saw  exactly as i have described it  penny ink bottle and all  down in shadwell this last autumn .  a couple of the inspectors of lodging houses knew the woman and took me to her as i was making a round with them to see for myself the working of lord shaftesbury s bill .   believe me  always faithfully yours .               sidenote  mr .  j .  b .  buckstone .         sunday    th may       .   my dear buckstone   i send a duplicate of this note to the haymarket  in case it should miss you out of town .  for a few years i have been liable  at wholly uncertain and incalculable times  to a severe attack of neuralgia in the foot  about once in the course of a year .  it began in an injury to the finer muscles or nerves  occasioned by over walking in the deep snow .  when it comes on i cannot stand  and can bear no covering whatever on the sensitive place .  one of these seizures is upon me now .  until it leaves me i could no more walk into st .  james s hall than i could fly in the air .  i hope you will present my duty to the prince of wales  and assure his royal highness that nothing short of my being  most unfortunately  disabled for the moment would have prevented my attending  as trustee of the fund       at the dinner  and warmly expressing my poor sense of the great and inestimable service his royal highness renders to a most deserving institution by so kindly commending it to the public .   faithfully yours always .    sidenote  mr .  rusden .    athen  um  friday evening    th may       .   my dear mr .  rusden   i received your most interesting and clear sighted letter about plorn just before the departure of the last mail from here to you .  i did not answer then because another incoming mail was nearly due  and i expected  knowing plorn so well  that some communication from him such as he made to you would come to me .  i was not mistaken .  the same arguing of the squatter question  vegetables and all  appeared .  this gave me an opportunity of touching on those points by this mail  without in the least compromising you .  i cannot too completely express my concurrence with your excellent idea that his correspondence with you should be regarded as confidential .  just as i could not possibly suggest a word more neatly to the point  or more thoughtfully addressed  to such a young man than your reply to his letter  i hope you will excuse my saying that it is a perfect model of tact  good sense  and good feeling .  i had been struck by his persistently ignoring the possibility of his holding any other position in australasia than his present position  and had inferred from it a homeward tendency .  what is most curious to me is that he is very sensible  and yet does not seem to understand that he has qualified himself for no public examinations in the old country  and could not possibly hold his own against any competition for anything to which i could get him nominated .   but i must not trouble you about my boys as if they were yours .  it is enough that i can never thank you for your goodness to them in a generous consideration of me .   i believe the truth as to france to be that a citizen frenchman never forgives  and that napoleon will never live down the coup d   tat .  this makes it enormously difficult for any well advised english newspaper to support him  and pretend not to know on what a volcano his throne is set .  informed as to his designs on the one hand  and the perpetual uneasiness of his police on the other  to say nothing of a doubtful army   the times has a difficult game to play .  my own impression is that if it were played too boldly for him  the old deplorable national antagonism would revive in his going down .  that the wind will pass over his imperiality on the sands of france i have not the slightest doubt .  in no country on the earth  but least of all there  can you seize people in their houses on political warrants  and kill in the streets  on no warrant at all  without raising a gigantic nemesis  not very reasonable in detail  perhaps  but none the less terrible for that .   the commonest dog or man driven mad is a much more alarming creature than the same individuality in a sober and commonplace condition .   your friend           is setting the world right generally all round  including the flattened ends  the two poles   and  as a minister said to me the other day   has the one little fault of omniscience .    you will probably have read before now that i am going to be everything the queen can make me .       if my authority be worth anything believe on it that i am going to be nothing but what i am  and that that includes my being as long as i live   your faithful and heartily obliged .    sidenote  mr .  alfred tennyson dickens .    athen  um club  friday night    th may       .   my dear alfred        i have just time to tell you under my own hand that i invited mr .  bear to a dinner of such guests as he would naturally like to see  and that we took to him very much  and got on with him capitally .   i am doubtful whether plorn is taking to australia .  can you find out his real mind .  i notice that he always writes as if his present life were the be all and the end all of his emigration  and as if i had no idea of you two becoming proprietors  and aspiring to the first positions in the colony  without casting off the old connection .   from mr .  bear i had the best accounts of you .  i told him that they did not surprise me  for i had unbounded faith in you .  for which take my love and blessing .   they will have told you all the news here  and that i am hard at work .  this is not a letter so much as an assurance that i never think of you without hope and comfort .   ever  my dear alfred  your affectionate father .              this letter did not reach australia until after these two absent sons of charles dickens had
