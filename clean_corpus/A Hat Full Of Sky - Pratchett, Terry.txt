terry pratchett      a hat full of sky      introduction      from fairies and how to avoid them by miss  perspicacia tick   the nac mac feegle   also called pictsies  the wee free men  the little men  and    person or persons unknown  believed to be armed          the nac mac feegle are the most dangerous of the fairy races  particularly when drunk .  they love drinking  fighting  and stealing  and will in fact steal anything that is not nailed down .  if it is nailed down  they will steal the nails as well .   nevertheless  those who have managed to get to know them and survive say that they are also amazingly loyal  strong  dogged  brave  and  in their own way  quite moral .   for example  they won   t steal from people who don   t have anything .    the average feegle man  feegle women are rare   see later  is about six inches high  red haired  his skin turned blue with tattoos and the dye called woad  and  since you   re this close  he   s probably about to hit you .   he   ll wear a kilt made of any old material  because among the feegles the clan allegiance is shown by the tattoos .  he may wear a rabbit skull helmet  and a feegle often decorates his beard and hair with feathers  beads  and anything else that takes his fancy .  he will almost certainly carry a sword  although it is mainly for show  the feegles    preferred method of fighting being with the boot and the head .       history and religion  the origin of the nac mac feegle is lost in the famous mists of time .  they say that they were thrown out of fairyland by the queen of the fairies because they objected to her spiteful and tyrannical rule .  others say they were just thrown out for being drunk .   little is known about their religion  if any  save for one fact  they think they are dead .  they like our world  with its sunshine and mountains and blue skies and things to fight .  an amazing world like this couldn   t be open to just anybody  they say .  it must be some kind of a heaven or valhalla  where brave warriors go when they are dead .  so  they reason  they have already been alive somewhere else  and then died and were allowed to come here because they have been so good .   this is a quite incorrect and fanciful notion because  as we know  the truth is exactly the other way around .   there is not a great deal of mourning when a feegle dies  and it   s only because his brothers are sad that he   s not spent more time with them before going back to the land of the living  which they also call    the last world .          habits and habitat  by choice  the clans of the nac mac feegle live in the burial mounds of ancient kings  where they hollow out a cozy cavern amid the gold .  generally there will be one or two thorn or elder trees growing on it   the feegles particularly like old  hollow elder trees  which become chimneys for their fires .  and there will  of course  be a rabbit hole .  it will look just like a rabbit hole .  there will be rabbit droppings around it  and maybe even a few bits of rabbit fur if the feegles are feeling particularly creative .   down below  the world of the feegle is a bit like a beehive  but with a lot less honey and a lot more sting .   the reason for this is that females are very rare among the feegle .  and  perhaps because of this  feegle women give birth to lots of babies  very often and very quickly .  they   re about the size of peas when born but grow extremely fast if they   re fed well  feegles like to live near humans so that they can steal milk from cows and sheep for this purpose  .   the queen of the clan is called the kelda  who as she gets older becomes the mother of most of it .  her husband is known as the big man .  when a girl child is born   and it doesn   t often happen   she stays with her mother to learn the hiddlins  which are the secrets of keldaring .  when she is old enough to be married  she must leave the clan  taking a few of her brothers with her as bodyguards on her long journey .   often she   ll travel to a clan that has no kelda .  very  very rarely  if there is no clan without a kelda  she   ll meet with feegles from several clans and form a completely new clan  with a new name and a mound of its own .  she will also choose her husband .  and from then on  while her word is absolute law among her clan and must be obeyed  she   ll seldom go more than a little distance from the mound .  she is both its queen and its prisoner .   but once  for a few days  there was a kelda who was a human girl    .       a feegle glossary   adjusted for those of a delicate disposition      bigjobs  human beings .      blethers  rubbish  nonsense .      carlin  old woman .      cludgie  the privy .      crivens .   a general exclamation that can mean anything

make this at home .      waily  a general cry of despair .       chapter        leaving      it came crackling over the hills  like an invisible fog .  movement without a body tired it  and it drifted very slowly .  it wasn   t thinking now .  it had been months since it had last thought  because the brain that was doing the thinking for it had died .  they always died .  so now it was naked again  and frightened .   it could hide in one of the blobby white creatures that baa   d nervously as it crawled over the turf .  but they had useless brains  capable of thinking only about grass and making other things that went baa .  no .  they would not do .  it needed  needed something better  a strong mind  a mind with power  a mind that could keep it safe .   it searched    .       the new boots were all wrong .  they were stiff and shiny .  shiny boots .  that was disgraceful .  clean boots  that was different .  there was nothing wrong with putting a bit of a polish on boots to keep the wet out .  but boots had to work for a living .  they shouldn   t shine .   tiffany aching  standing on the rug in her bedroom  shook her head .  she   d have to scuff the things as soon as possible .   then there was the new straw hat  with a ribbon on it .  she had some doubts about that  too .   she tried to look at herself in the mirror  which wasn   t easy because the mirror was not much bigger than her hand  and cracked and blotchy .  she had to move it around to try and see as much of herself as possible and remember how the bits fitted together .   but today   well  she didn   t usually do this sort of thing in the house  but it was important to look smart today  and since no one was around     she put the mirror down on the rickety table by the bed  stood in the middle of the threadbare rug  shut her eyes  and said      see me .          and away on the hills something  a thing with no body and no mind but a terrible hunger and a bottomless fear  felt the power .   it would have sniffed the air if it had a nose .   it searched .   it found .   such a strange mind  like a lot of minds inside one another  getting smaller and smaller .  so strong .  so close .   it changed direction slightly and went a little faster .  as it moved  it made a noise like a swarm of flies .   the sheep  nervous for a moment about something they couldn   t see or smell  baa   d        and went back to chewing grass .       tiffany opened her eyes .  there she was  a few feet away from herself .  she could see the back of her own head .   carefully  she moved around the room  not looking down at the    her    that was moving  because she found that if she did that  then the trick was over .   it was quite difficult  moving like that  but at last she was in front of herself and looking herself up and down .   brown hair to match brown eyes   well  there was nothing she could do about that .  at least her hair was clean and she   d washed her face .   she had a new dress on  which improved things a bit .  it was so unusual to buy new clothes in the aching family that  of course  it was bought big so that she   d    grow into it .     but at least it was pale green  and it didn   t actually touch the floor .  with the shiny new boots and the straw hat she looked   like a farmer   s daughter  quite respectable  going off to her first job .  it   d have to do .   from here she could see the pointy hat on her head  but she had to look hard for it .  it was like a glint in the air  gone as soon as you saw it .  that   s why she   d been worried about the new straw hat  but it had simply gone through the pointy hat as if it wasn   t there .   this was because  in a way  it wasn   t .  it was invisible  except in the rain .  sun and wind went straight through  but rain and snow somehow saw it  and treated it as if it was real .   she   d been given it by the greatest witch in the world  a real witch with a black dress and a black hat and eyes that could go through you like turpentine goes through a sick sheep .  it had been a kind of reward .  tiffany had done magic  serious magic .  before she had done it she hadn   t known that she could  when she had been doing it she hadn   t known that she was  and after she had done it she hadn   t known how she had .  now she had to learn how .      see me not     she said .  the vision of her   or whatever it was  because she was not exactly sure about this trick   vanished .   it had been a shock  the first time she   d done this .  but she   d always found it easy to see herself  at least in her head .  all her memories were like little pictures of herself doing things or watching things  rather than the view from the two holes in the front of her head .  there was a part of her that was always watching her .   miss tick   another witch  but one who was easier to talk to than the witch who   d given tiffany the hat   had said that a witch had to know how to    stand apart     and that she   d find out more when her talent grew  so tiffany supposed the    see me    was part of this .   sometimes tiffany thought she ought to talk to miss tick about    see me .     it felt as if she was stepping out of her body but still had a sort of ghost body that could walk around .  it all worked as long as her ghost eyes didn   t look down and see that she was just a ghost body .  if that happened  some part of her panicked and she found herself back in her solid body immediately .  tiffany had  in the end  decided to keep this to herself .  you didn   t have to tell a teacher everything .  anyway  it was a good trick for when you didn   t have a mirror .   miss tick was a sort of witch finder .  that seemed to be how witchcraft worked .  some witches kept a magical lookout for girls who showed promise  and found them an older witch to help them along .  they didn   t teach you how to do it .  they taught you how to know what you were doing .   witches were a bit like cats .  they didn   t much like one another   s company  but they did like to know where all the other witches were  just in case they needed them .  and what you might need them for was to tell you  as a friend  that you were beginning to cackle .   witches didn   t fear much  miss tick had said  but what the powerful ones were afraid of  even if they didn   t talk about it  was what they called    going to the bad .     it was too easy to slip into careless little cruelties because you had power and other people hadn   t  too easy to think other people didn   t matter much  too easy to think that ideas like right and wrong didn   t apply to you .  at the end of that road was you drooling and cackling to yourself all alone in a gingerbread house  growing warts on your nose .   witches needed to know other witches were watching them .   and that  tiffany thought  was why the hat was there .  she could touch it anytime  provided she shut her eyes .  it was a kind of reminder    .      tiffany .     her mother shouted up the stairs .     miss tick   s here .          yesterday tiffany had said good bye to granny aching    .   the iron wheels of the old shepherding hut were half buried in the turf  high up on the hills .  the potbellied stove  which still stood lopsided in the grass  was red with rust .  the chalk hills were taking them  just like they   d taken the bones of granny aching .   the rest of the hut had been burned on the day she   d been buried .  no shepherd would have dared to use it  let alone spend the night there .  granny aching had been too big in people   s minds  too hard to replace .  night and day  in all seasons  she was the chalk country  its best shepherd  its wisest woman  and its memory .  it was as if the green downland had a soul that walked about in old boots and a sacking apron and smoked a foul old pipe and dosed sheep with turpentine .   the shepherds said that granny aching had cussed the sky blue .  they called the fluffy little white clouds of summer    granny aching   s little lambs .     and although they laughed when they said these things  part of them was not joking .   no shepherd would have dared presume to live in that hut  no shepherd at all .   so they had cut the turf and buried granny aching in the chalk  watered the turf afterward to leave no mark  then burned her hut .   sheep wool  jolly sailor tobacco  and turpentine      had been the smells of the shepherding hut  and the smell of granny aching .  such things have a hold on people that goes right to the heart .  tiffany only had to smell them now to be back there  in the warmth and silence and safety of the hut .  it was the place she had gone to when she was upset  and the place she had gone to when she was happy .  and granny aching would always smile and make tea and say nothing .  and nothing bad could happen in the shepherding hut .  it was a fort against the world .  even now  after granny had gone  tiffany still liked to go up there .   tiffany stood there  while the wind blew over the turf and sheep bells clonked in the distance .      i   ve got       she cleared her throat .     i   ve got to go away .  i   i   ve got to learn proper witching  and there   s no one here now to teach me  you see .  i   ve got to   to look after the hills like you did .  i can   do things but i don   t know things  and miss tick says what you don   t know can kill you .  i want to be as good as you were .  i will come back .  i will come back soon .  i promise i will come back  better than i went .      a blue butterfly  blown off course by a gust  settled on tiffany   s shoulder  opened and shut its wings once or twice  then fluttered away .   granny aching had never been at home with words .  she collected silence like other people collected string .  but she had a way of saying nothing that said it all .   tiffany stayed for a while  until her tears had dried  and then went off back down the hill  leaving the everlasting wind to curl around the wheels and whistle down the chimney of the potbellied stove .  life went on .       it wasn   t unusual for girls as young as tiffany to go    into service .     it meant working as a maid somewhere .  traditionally  you started by helping an old lady who lived by herself  she wouldn   t be able to pay much  but since this was your first job  you probably weren   t worth much either .   in fact tiffany practically ran home farm   s dairy by herself  if someone helped her lift the big milk churns  and her parents had been surprised she wanted to go into service at all .  but as tiffany said  it was something everyone did .  you got out into the world a little bit .  you met new people .  you never knew what it could lead to .   that  rather cunningly  got her mother on her side .  her mother   s rich aunt had gone off to be a scullery maid  and then a parlor maid  and had worked her way up until she was a housekeeper and married to a butler and lived in a fine house .  it wasn   t her fine house  and she only lived in a bit of it  but she was practically a lady .   tiffany didn   t intend to be a lady .  this was all a ruse  anyway .  and miss tick was in on it .   you weren   t allowed to charge money for the witching  so all witches did some other job as well .  miss tick was basically a witch disguised as a teacher .  she traveled around with the other wandering teachers who went in bands from place to place teaching anything to anybody in exchange for food or old clothes .   it was a good way to get around  because people in the chalk country didn   t trust witches .  they thought they danced around on moonlit nights without their drawers on .   tiffany had made inquiries about this  and had been slightly relieved to find out that you didn   t have to do this to be a witch .  you could if you wanted to  but only if you were certain where all the nettles  thistles  and hedgehogs were .    but if it came to it  people were a bit wary of the wandering teachers too .  they were said to pinch chickens and steal away children  which was true  in a way   and they went from village to village with their gaudy carts and wore long robes with leather pads on the sleeves and strange flat hats and talked among themselves in some heathen lingo no one could understand  like    alea jacta est    and    quid pro quo .     it was quite easy for miss tick to lurk among them .  her pointy hat was a stealth version  which looked just like a black straw hat with paper flowers on it until you pressed the secret spring .   over the last year or so tiffany   s mother had been quite surprised  and a little worried  at tiffany   s sudden thirst for education  which people in the village thought was a good thing in moderation but if taken unwisely could lead to restlessness .   then a month ago the message had come  be ready .   miss tick  in her flowery hat  had visited the farm and had explained to mr .  and mrs .  aching that an elderly lady up in the mountains had heard of tiffany   s excellent prowess with cheese and was willing to offer her the post of maid at four dollars a month  one day off a week  her own bed  and a week   s vacation at hogswatch .   tiffany knew her parents .  three dollars a month was a bit low  and five dollars would be suspiciously high  but prowess with cheese was worth the extra dollar .  and a bed all to yourself was a very nice perk .  before most of tiffany   s sisters had left home  sleeping two sisters to a bed had been normal .  it was a good offer .   her parents had been impressed and slightly scared of miss tick  but they had been brought up to believe that people who knew more than you and used long words were quite important  so they   d agreed .   tiffany accidentally heard them discussing it after she had gone to bed that night .  it   s quite easy to accidentally overhear people talking downstairs if you hold an upturned glass to the floorboards and accidentally put your ear to it .   she heard her father say that tiffany didn   t have to go away at all .   she heard her mother say that all girls wondered what was out there in the world  so it was best to get it out of her system .  besides  she was a very capable girl with a good head on her shoulders .  why  with hard work there was no reason why one day she couldn   t be a servant to someone quite important  like aunt hetty had been  and live in a house with an inside privy .   her father said she   d find that scrubbing floors was the same everywhere .   her mother said  well  in that case she   d get bored and come back home after the year was up and  by the way  what did prowess mean .   superior skill  said tiffany to herself .  they did have an old dictionary in the house  but her mother never opened it because the sight of all those words upset her .  tiffany had read it all the way through .   and that was it  and suddenly here she was  a month later  wrapping her old boots  which had been worn by all her sisters before her  in a piece of clean rag and putting them in the secondhand suitcase her mother had bought her  which looked as if it was made of bad cardboard or pressed grape pips mixed with ear wax  and had to be held together with string .   there were good byes .  she cried a bit  and her mother cried a lot  and her little brother  wentworth  cried as well just in case he would get a sweet for doing so .  tiffany   s father didn   t cry but gave her a silver dollar and rather gruffly told her to be sure to write home every week  which is a man   s way of crying .  she said goodbye to the cheeses in the dairy and the sheep in the paddock and even to ratbag the cat .   then everyone apart from the cheeses and the cat stood at the gate and waved to her and miss tick   well  except for the sheep  too   until they   d gone nearly all the way down the chalky white lane to the village .   and then there was silence except for the sound of their boots on the flinty surface and the endless song of the skylarks overhead .  it was late august and very hot  and the new boots pinched .      i should take them off  if i was you     said miss tick after a while .   tiffany sat down by the side of the lane and got her old boots out of the case .  she didn   t bother to ask how miss tick knew about the tight new boots .  witches paid attention .  the old boots  even though she had to wear several pairs of socks with them  were much more comfortable and really easy to walk in .  they   d been walking since long before tiffany was born  and knew how to do it .      and are we going to see any   little men today .     miss tick went on  once they were walking again .      i don   t know  miss tick     said tiffany .     i told them a month ago i was leaving .  they   re very busy at this time of year .  but there   s always one or two of them watching me .      miss tick looked around quickly .     i can   t see anything     she said .     or hear anything .         no  that   s how you can tell they   re there     said tiffany .     it   s always a bit quieter if they   re watching me .  but they won   t show themselves while you   re with me .  they   re a bit frightened of hags   that   s their word for witches     she added quickly .     it   s nothing personal .      miss tick sighed .     when i was a little girl  i   d have loved to see the pictsies     she said .     i used to put out little saucers of milk .  of course  later on i realized that wasn   t quite the thing to do .         no  you should have used strong licker     said tiffany .   she glanced at the hedge and thought she saw  just for the snap of a second  a flash of red hair .  and she smiled  a little nervously .       tiffany had been  if only for a few days  the nearest a human being can be to a queen of the fairies .  admittedly  she   d been called a kelda rather than a queen  and the nac mac feegle should only be called fairies to their faces if you were looking for a fight .  on the other hand the nac mac feegle were always looking for a fight  in a cheerful sort of way  and when they had no one to fight they fought one another  and if one was all by himself he   d kick his own nose just to keep in practice .   technically they had lived in fairyland but had been thrown out  probably for being drunk .  and now  because if you   d ever been their kelda they never forgot you        they were always there .   there was always one somewhere on the farm  or circling on a buzzard high over the chalk downs .  and they watched her  to help and protect her  whether she wanted them to or not .  tiffany had been as polite as possible about this .  she   d hidden her diary all the way at the back of a drawer and blocked up the cracks in the privy with wadded paper  and done her best with the gaps in her bedroom floorboards  too .  they were little men  after all .  she was sure they tried to remain unseen so as not to disturb her  but she   d got very good at spotting them .   they granted wishes   not the magical fairy tale three wishes  the ones that always go wrong in the end  but ordinary  everyday ones .  the nac mac feegle were immensely strong and fearless and incredibly fast  but they weren   t good at understanding that what people said often wasn   t what they meant .  one day  in the dairy  tiffany had said     i wish i had a sharper knife to cut this cheese     and her mother   s sharpest knife was quivering in the table beside her almost before she   d got the words out .      i wish this rain would clear up    was probably okay  because the feegles couldn   t do actual magic  but she had learned to be careful not to wish for anything that might be achievable by some small  determined  strong  fearless  and fast men who were also not above giving someone a good kicking if they felt like it .   wishes needed thought .  she was never likely to say out loud     i wish that i could marry a handsome prince     but knowing that if you did you   d probably open the door to find a stunned prince  a tied up priest  and a nac mac feegle grinning cheerfully and ready to act as best man definitely made you watch what you said .  but they could be helpful  in a haphazard way  and she   d taken to leaving out for them things that the family didn   t need but might be useful to little people  like tiny mustard spoons  pins  a soup bowl that would make a nice bath for a feegle  and  in case they didn   t get the message  some soap .  they didn   t steal the soap .   her last visit to the ancient burial mound high on the chalk down where the pictsies lived had been to attend the wedding of rob anybody  the big man of the clan  to jeannie of the long lake .  she was going to be the new kelda and spend most of the rest of her life in the mound  having babies like a queen bee .   feegles from other clans had all turned up for the celebration  because if there   s one thing a feegle likes more than a party  it   s a bigger party  and if there   s anything better than a bigger party  it   s a bigger party with someone else paying for the drink .  to be honest  tiffany had felt a bit out of place  being ten times as tall as the next tallest person there  but she   d been treated very well  and rob anybody had made a long speech about her  calling her    our fine big wee young hag    before falling face first into the pudding .  it had all been very hot  and very loud  but she   d joined in the cheer when jeannie had carried rob anybody over a tiny broomstick that had been laid on the floor .  traditionally  both the bride and the groom should jump over the broomstick  but equally traditionally  no self respecting feegle would be sober on his wedding day .   she   d been warned that it would be a good idea to leave then  because of the traditional fight between the bride   s clan and the groom   s clan  which could take until friday .   tiffany had bowed to jeannie  because that   s what hags did  and had a good look at her .  she was small and sweet and very pretty .  she also had a glint in her eye and a certain proud lift to her chin .  nac mac feegle girls were very rare  and they grew up knowing they were going to be keldas one day  and tiffany had a definite feeling that rob anybody was going to find married life trickier than he   d thought .   she was going to be sorry to leave them behind  but not terribly sorry .  they were nice in a way  but they could  after a while  get on your nerves .  anyway  she was eleven now  and had a feeling that after a certain age you shouldn   t slide down holes in the ground to talk to little men .   besides  the look that jeannie had given her  just for a moment  had been pure poison .  tiffany had read its meaning without having to try .  tiffany had been the kelda of the clan  even if it was only for a short time .  she had also been engaged to be married to rob anybody  even if that had only been a sort of political trick .  jeannie knew all that .  and the look had said  he is mine .  this place is mine .  i do not want you here .  keep out .       a pool of silence followed tiffany and miss tick down the lane  since the usual things that rustle in hedges tended to keep very quiet when the nac mac feegle were around .   they reached the little village green and sat down to wait for the carrier   s cart that went just a bit faster than walking pace and would take five hours to get to the village of twoshirts  where   tiffany   s parents thought   they   d get the big coach that ran all the way to the distant mountains and beyond .   tiffany could actually see the cart coming up the road when she heard the hoofbeats coming across the green .  she turned  and her heart seemed to leap and sink at the same time .   it was roland  the baron   s son  on a fine black horse .  he leaped down before the horse had stopped  and then stood there looking embarrassed .      ah  i see a very fine and interesting example of a   a   a big stone over there     said miss tick in a sticky sweet voice .     i   ll just go and have a look at it  shall i .      tiffany could have pinched her for that .      er  you   re going  then     said roland as miss tick hurried away .      yes     said tiffany .   roland looked as though he was going to explode with nervousness .      i got this for you     he said .     i had it made by a man  er  over in yelp .     he held out a package wrapped in soft paper .   tiffany took it and put it carefully in her pocket .      thank you     she said  and dropped a small curtsy .  strictly speaking  that   s what you had to do when you met a nobleman  but it just made roland blush and stutter .      o open it later on     said roland .     er  i hope you   ll like it .         thank you     said tiffany sweetly .      here   s the cart .  er   you don   t want to miss it .         thank you     said tiffany  and curtsied again  because of the effect it had .  it was a little bit cruel  but sometimes you had to be .   anyway  it would be very hard to miss the cart .  if you ran fast  you could easily overtake it .  it was so slow that    stop    never came as a surprise .   there were no seats .  the carrier went around the villages every other day  picking up packages and  sometimes  people .  you just found a place where you could get comfortable among the boxes of fruit and rolls of cloth .   tiffany sat on the back of the cart  her old boots dangling over the edge  swaying backward and forward as the cart lurched away on the rough road .   miss tick sat beside her  her black dress soon covered in chalk dust to the knees .   tiffany noticed that roland didn   t get back on his horse until the cart was nearly out of sight .   and she knew miss tick .  by now she would be just bursting to ask a question  because witches hate not knowing things .  and sure enough  when the village was left behind  miss tick said  after a lot of shifting and clearing her throat      aren   t you going to open it .         open what .     asked tiffany  not looking at her .      he gave you a present     said miss tick .      i thought you were examining an interesting stone  miss tick     said tiffany accusingly .      well  it was only fairly interesting     said miss tick  completely unembarrassed .     so   are you .         i   ll wait until later     said tiffany .  she didn   t want a discussion about roland at this point or  really  at all .   she didn   t actually dislike him .  she   d found him in the land of the queen of the fairies and had sort of rescued him  although he had been unconscious most of the time .  a sudden meeting with the nac mac feegle when they   re feeling edgy can do that to a person .  of course  without anyone actually lying  everyone at home had come to believe that he had rescued her .  a nine year old girl armed with a frying pan couldn   t possibly have rescued a thirteen year old boy who   d had a sword .   tiffany hadn   t minded that .  it stopped people from asking too many questions she didn   t want to answer or even know how to .  but he   d taken to   hanging around .  she kept accidentally running into him on walks more often than was really possible  and he always seemed to be at the same village events she went to .  he was always polite  but she couldn   t stand the way he kept looking like a spaniel that had been kicked .   admittedly   and it took some admitting   he was a lot less of a twit than he had been .  on the other hand  there had been such a lot of twit to begin with .   and then she thought  horse  and wondered why until she realized that her eyes had been watching the landscape while her brain stared at the past .      i   ve never seen that before     said miss tick .   tiffany welcomed it as an old friend .  the chalk rose out of the plains quite suddenly on this side of the hills .  there was a little valley cupped into the fall of the down  and there was a carving in the curve it made .  turf had been cut away in long flowing lines  so that the bare chalk made the shape of an animal .      it   s the white horse     said tiffany .      why do they call it that .     said miss tick .   tiffany looked at her .      because the chalk is white .     she said  trying not to suggest that miss tick was being a bit dense .      no  i meant why do they call it a horse .  it doesn   t look like a horse .  it   s just   flowing lines    .         that look as if they   re moving  tiffany thought .   it had been cut out of the turf way back in the old days  people said  by the folk who   d built the stone circles and buried their kin in big earth mounds .  and they   d cut out the horse at one end of this little green valley  ten times bigger than a real horse and  if you didn   t look at it with your mind right  the wrong shape  too .  yet they must have known horses  owned horses  seen them every day  and they weren   t stupid people just because they lived a long time ago .   tiffany had once asked her father about the look of the horse  when they   d come all the way over here for a sheep fair  and he told her what granny aching had told him when he was a little boy .  he passed on what she said word for word  and tiffany did the same now .         taint what a horse looks like     said tiffany .     it   s what a horse be .         oh     said miss tick .  but because she was a teacher as well as a witch  and probably couldn   t help herself  she added     the funny thing is  of course  that officially there is no such thing as a white horse .  they   re called gray .          yes  i know     said tiffany .     this one   s white     she added  flatly .   that quietened miss tick down for a while  but she seemed to have something on her mind .      i expect you   re upset about leaving the chalk  aren   t you .     she said as the cart rattled on .      no     said tiffany .      it   s okay to be     said miss tick .      thank you  but i   m not really     said tiffany .      if you want to have a bit of a cry  you don   t have to pretend you   ve got some grit in your eye or anything           i   m all right  actually     said tiffany .     honestly .         you see  if you bottle that sort of thing up  it can cause terrible damage later on .         i   m not bottling  miss tick .      in fact  tiffany was a bit surprised at not crying  but she wasn   t going to tell miss tick that .  she   d left a sort of space in her head to burst into tears in  but it wasn   t filling up .  perhaps it was because she   d wrapped up all those feelings and doubts and left them on the hill by the potbellied stove .      and if  of course  you were feeling a bit downcast at the moment  i   m sure you could open the present he       miss tick tried .      tell me about miss level     tiffany said quickly .  the name and address were all she knew about the lady she was going to stay with  but an address like    miss level  cottage in the woods near the dead oak tree in lost man   s lane  high overhang  if out leave letters in old boot by door    sounded promising .      miss level  yes     said miss tick  defeated .     er  yes .  she   s not really very old  but she says she   ll be happy to have a third pair of hands around the place .      you couldn   t slip words past tiffany  not even if you were miss tick .      so there   s someone else there already .     she said .      er   no .  not exactly     said miss tick .      then she   s got four arms .     said tiffany .  miss tick sounded like someone trying to avoid a subject .   miss tick sighed .  it was difficult to talk to someone who paid attention all the time .  it put you off .      it   s best if you wait until you meet her     she said .     anything i tell you will only give you the wrong idea .  i   m sure you   ll get along with her .  she   s very good with people  and in her spare time she   s a research witch .  she keeps bees   and goats  the milk of which  i believe  is very good indeed  owing to homogenized fats .         what does a research witch do .         oh  it   s a very ancient craft .  she tries to find new spells by learning how old ones were really done .  you know all that stuff about    ear of bat and toe of frog    .  they never work  but miss level thinks it   s because we don   t know exactly what kind of frog  or which toe           i   m sorry  but i   m not going to help anyone chop up innocent frogs and bats     said tiffany firmly .      oh  no  she never kills any .     said miss tick hurriedly .     she only uses creatures that have died naturally or been run over or committed suicide .  frogs can get quite depressed at times .      the cart rolled on down the white  dusty road  until it was lost from view .   nothing happened .  skylarks sang  so high up they were invisible .  grass seeds filled the air .  sheep baa   d  high up on the chalk .   and then something came along the road .  it moved like a little slow whirlwind  so it could be seen only by the dust it stirred up .  as it went past  it made a noise like a swarm of flies .   then it  too  disappeared down the hill    .   after a while a voice  low down in the long grass  said     ach  crivens .  and it   s on her trail  right enough .      a second voice said     surely the old hag will spot it .         whut .  the teachin    hag .  she   s nae a proper hag .         she   s got the pointy hat under all them flowers  big yan     said the second voice a bit reproachfully .     i seen it .  she presses a wee spring an    the point comes up .         oh  aye  hamish  an    i daresay she does the readin    and the writin    well enough  but she disna ken aboot stuff that   s no    in books .  an    i   m no    showin    meself while she   s aroond .  she   s the kind of a body that   d write things doon about a man .  c   mon  let   s go and find the kelda .          the nac mac feegle of the chalk hated writing for all kinds of reasons  but the biggest one was this  writing stays .  it fastens words down .  a man can speak his mind and some nasty wee scuggan will write it down and who knows what he   ll do with those words .  ye might as weel nail a man   s shadow tae the wall .   but now they had a new kelda  and a new kelda brings new ideas .  that   s how it   s supposed to work .  it stopped a clan getting too set in its ways .  kelda jeannie was from the long lake clan  up in the mountains   and they did write things down .   she didn   t see why her husband shouldn   t too .  and rob anybody was finding out that jeannie was definitely a kelda .   sweat was dripping off his forehead .  he   d once fought a wolf all by himself  and he   d cheerfully do it again with his eyes shut and one hand tied behind him rather than do what he was doing now .   he had mastered the first two rules of writing  as he understood them .         .  steal some paper    .  steal a pencil .       unfortunately there was more to it than that .   now he held the stump of pencil in front of him in both hands and leaned backward as two of his brothers pushed him toward the piece of paper pinned up on the chamber wall  it was an old bill for sheep bells  stolen from the farm  .  the rest of the clan watched  in fascinated horror  from the galleries around the walls .      mebbe i could kind o    ease my way inta it gently     he protested as his heels left little grooves in the packed earth floor of the mound .     mebbe i could just do one o    they commeras or full stoppies           you   re the big man  rob anybody  so it   s fittin    ye should be the first tae do the writin        said jeannie .     i canna hae a husband who canna even write his ain name .  i showed you the letters  did i not .         aye  wumman  the nasty  loopy  bendy things .     growled rob .     i dinna trust that q  that   s a letter than has it in for a man .  that   s a letter with a sting  that one .         you just hold the pencil on the paper and i   ll tell ye what marks to make     said jeannie  folding her arms .      aye  but    tis a bushel of trouble  writin        said rob .     a word writ doon can hang a man .         wheest  now  stop that .     tis easy .     snapped jeannie .     bigjob babies can do it  and you   re a full growed feegle .         an    writin    even goes on sayin    a man   s wurds after he   s deid .     said rob anybody  waving the pencil as if trying to ward off evil spirits .     ye canna tell me that   s right .         oh  so you   re afeared o    the letters  is that it .     said jeannie artfully .     ach  that   s fine .  all big men fear something .  take the pencil off    f him  wullie .  ye canna ask a man to face his fears .      there was silence in the mound as daft wullie nervously took the pencil stub from his brother .  every beady eye was turned to rob anybody .  his hands opened and shut .  he started to breathe heavily  still glaring at the blank paper .  he stuck out his chin .      ach  ye   re a harrrrd wumman  jeannie mac feegle .     he said at last .  he spat on his hands and snatched back the pencil stub from daft wullie .     gimme that tool o    perdition .  them letters won   t know whut   s hit them .         there   s my brave lad .     said jeannie  as rob squared up to the paper .     right  then .  the first letter is an r .  that   s the one that looks like a fat man walking  remember .      the assembled pictsies watched as rob anybody  grunting fiercely and with his tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth  dragged the pencil through the curves and lines of the letters .  he looked at the kelda expectantly after each one .      that   s it     she said at last .     a bonny effort .      rob anybody stood back and looked critically at the paper .      that   s it .     he asked .      aye     said jeannie .     ye   ve writ your ain name  rob anybody .      rob stared at the letters again .     i   m gonna go to pris   n noo .     he asked .   there was a polite cough from beside jeannie .  it belonged to the toad .  he had no other name  because toads don   t go in for names .  despite sinister forces that would have people think differently  no toad has ever been called tommy the toad  for example .  it   s just not something that happens .   this toad had once been a lawyer  a human lawyer  toads manage without them  who   d been turned into a toad by a fairy godmother who   d intended to turn him into a frog but had been a bit hazy on the difference .  now he lived in the feegle mound  where he ate worms and helped them out with the difficult thinking .      i   ve told you  mr .  anybody  that just having your name written down is no problem at all     he said .     there   s nothing illegal about the words rob anybody .  unless  of course      and the toad gave a little legal laugh      it   s meant as an instruction .      none of the feegles laughed .  they liked their humor to be a bit  well  funnier .   rob anybody stared at his very shaky writing .     that   s my name  aye .         it certainly is  mr .  anybody .         an   nothin   bad   s happenin   at a        rob noted .  he looked closer .     how can you tell it   s my name .         ah  that   ll be the readin    side o    things     said jeannie .      that   s where the lettery things make a sound in yer heid .     asked rob .      exactly so     said the toad .     but we thought you   d like to start with the more physical aspect of the procedure .         could i no    mebbe just learn the writin    and leave the readin    to someone else .     rob asked  without much hope .      no  my man   s got to do both     said jeannie  folding her arms .  when a female feegle does that  there   s no hope left .      ach  it   s a terrible thing for a man when his wumman gangs up on him wi    a toad     said rob  shaking his head .  but when he turned to look at the grubby paper  there was just a hint of pride in his face .      still  that   s my name  right .     he said  grinning .   jeannie nodded .      just there  all by itself and no    on a wanted poster or anything .  my name  drawn by me .         yes  rob     said the kelda .      my name  under my thumb .  no scunner can do anythin    aboot it .  i   ve got my name  nice and safe .      jeannie looked at the toad  who shrugged .  it was generally held by those who knew them that most of the brains in the nac mac feegle clans ended up in the women .      a man   s a man o    some standin    when he   s got his own name where no one can touch it     said rob anybody .     that   s serious magic  that is           the r is the wrong way roond and you left the a and a y out of anybody     said jeannie  because it is a wife   s job to stop her husband actually exploding with pride .      ach  wumman  i didna    ken which way the fat man wuz walkin        said rob  airily waving a hand .     ye canna trust the fat man .  that   s the kind of thing us nat   ral writin    folk knows about .  one day he might walk this way  next day he might walk that way .      he beamed at his name        and i reckon you got it wrong wi    them y   s     he went on .     i reckon it should be n e bo d .  that   s enn   eee   bor   dee  see .  that   s sense .      he stuck the pencil into his hair and gave her a defiant look .   jeannie sighed .  she   d grown up with seven hundred brothers and knew how they thought  which was often quite fast while being totally in the wrong direction .  and if they couldn   t bend their thinking around the world  they bent the world around their thinking .  usually  her mother had told her  it was best not to argue .   actually  only half a dozen feegles in the long lake clan could read and write very well .  they were considered odd  strange hobbies .  after all  what   when you got out of bed in the morning   were they good for .  you didn   t need to know them to wrestle a trout or mug a rabbit or get drunk .  the wind couldn   t be read and you couldn   t write on water .   but things written down lasted .  they were the voices of feegles who   d died long ago  who   d seen strange things  who   d made strange discoveries .  whether you approved of that depended on how creepy you thought it was .  the long lake clan approved .  jeannie wanted the best for her new clan  too .   it wasn   t easy  being a young kelda .  you came to a new clan  with only a few of your brothers as bodyguards  where you married a husband and ended up with hundreds of brothers in law .  it could be troubling if you let your mind dwell on it .  at least back on the island in the long lake she had her mother to talk to  but a kelda never went home again .   a kelda was all alone .   jeannie was homesick and lonely and frightened of the future  which is why she was about to get things wrong .      rob .      hamish and big yan came tumbling through the fake rabbit hole that was the entrance to the mound .   rob anybody glared at them .     we wuz engaged in a lit   try enterprise     he said .      yes  rob  but we watched the big wee young hag safe awa     like you said  but there   s a hiver after her .     hamish blurted out .      are ye sure .     said rob  dropping his pencil .     i never heard o    one of them in this world .         oh  aye     said big yan .     its buzzin    fair made my teeths ache .         so did you no    tell her  ye daftie .     said rob .      there   s that other hag wi    her  rob     said big yan .     the educatin    hag .         miss tick .     said the toad .      aye  the one wi    a face like a yard o    yogurt     said big yan .     an    you said we wuzna    to show ourselves  rob .         aye  weel  this is different       rob anybody began  but stopped .   he hadn   t been a husband for very long  but upon marriage men get a whole lot of extra senses bolted into their brain  and one is there to tell a man that he   s suddenly neck deep in real trouble .   jeannie was tapping her foot .  her arms were still folded .  she had the special smile women learn about when they marry too which seems to say    yes  you   re in big trouble but i   m going to let you dig yourself in even more deeply .         what   s this about the big wee hag .     she said  her voice as small and meek as a mouse trained at the rodent college of assassins .      oh  ah  ach  weel  aye       rob began  his face falling .     do ye not bring her to mind  dear .  she was at oor wedding  aye .  she was oor kelda for a day or two  ye ken .  the old one made her swear to that just afore she went back to the land o    the livin        he added  in case mentioning the wishes of the last kelda would deflect whatever storm was coming .     it   s as well tae keep an eye on her  ye ken  her being oor hag and all    .      rob anybody   s voice trailed away in the face of jeannie   s look .      a true kelda has tae marry the big man     said jeannie .     just like i married ye  rob anybody feegle  and am i no    a good wife tae ye .         oh  fine  fine     rob burbled .     but           and ye canna be married to two wives  because that would be bigamy  would it not .     said jeannie  her voice dangerously sweet .      ach  it wasna that big     said rob anybody  desperately looking around for a way of escape .     and it wuz only temp   ry  an    she   s but a lass  an    she wuz good at thinkin              i   m good at thinking  rob anybody  and i am the kelda o    this clan  am i no    .  there can only be one  is that not so .  and i am thinking that there will be no more chasin    after this big wee girl .  shame on ye  anyway .  she   ll no    want the like o    big yan a gawpin    at her all the time  i   m sure .      rob anybody hung his head .      aye   but     he said .      but what .         a hiver   s chasin    the puir wee lass .      there was a long pause before jeannie said     are ye sure .         aye  kelda     said big yan .     once you hear that buzzin     ye never forget it .      jeannie bit her lip .  then  looking a little pale  she said     ye said she   s got the makin   s o    a powerful hag  rob .         aye  but nae one in his   try has survived a hiver .  ye canna kill it  ye canna stop it  ye canna           but wuz ye no    tellin    me how the big wee girl even fought the quin and won .     said jeannie .     wanged her wi    a skillet  ye said .  that means she   s good  aye .  if she is a true hag  she   ll find a way hersel    .  we all ha    to dree our weird .  whatever   s out there  she   s got to face it .  if she canna  she   s no true hag .         aye  but a hiver   s worse than       rob began .      she   s off to learn hagglin    from other hags     said jeannie .     an    i must learn keldarin    all by myself .  ye must hope she learns as fast as me  rob anybody .          chapter        twoshirts and two noses      twoshirts was just a bend in the road with a name .  there was nothing there but an inn for the coaches  a blacksmith   s shop  and a small store with the word souvenirs written optimistically on a scrap of cardboard in the window .  and that was it .  around the place  separated by fields and scraps of woodland  were the houses of people for whom twoshirts was  presumably  the big city .  every world is full of places like twoshirts .  they are places for people to come from  not go to .   it sat and baked silently in the hot afternoon sunlight .  right in the middle of the road an elderly spaniel  mottled brown and white  dozed in the dust .   twoshirts was bigger than the village back home  and tiffany had never seen souvenirs before .  she went into the store and spent half a penny on a small wood carving of two shirts on a washing line  and two postcards entitled    view of twoshirts     which showed the souvenir shop and what was quite probably the same dog sleeping in the road .  the little old lady behind the counter called her    young lady    and said that twoshirts was very popular later in the year  when people came from up to a mile around for the cabbage macerating festival .   when tiffany came out  she found miss tick standing next to the sleeping dog  frowning back the way they   d come .      is there something the matter .     said tiffany .      what .     said miss tick  as if she   d forgotten that tiffany existed .     oh   no .  i just   i thought i   look  shall we go and have something to eat .      it took a while to find someone in the inn  but miss tick wandered into the kitchens and found a woman who promised them some scones and a cup of tea .  she was actually quite surprised she   d promised that  since she hadn   t intended to  it strictly speaking being her afternoon free until the coach came  but miss tick had a way of asking questions that got the answers she wanted .   miss tick also asked for a fresh egg  not cooked  in its shell .  witches were also good at asking questions that weren   t followed by the other person saying     why .      they sat and ate in the sun  on the bench outside the inn .  then tiffany took out her diary .   she had one in the dairy too  but that was for cheese and butter records .  this one was personal .  she   d bought it off a peddler  cheap  because it was last year   s .  but  as he said  it had the same number of days .   it also had a lock  a little brass thing on a leather flap .  it had its own tiny key .  it was the lock that had attracted tiffany .  at a certain age you see the point of locks .   she wrote down    twoshirts     and spent some time thinking before adding    a bend in the road .      miss tick kept staring at the road .      is there something wrong  miss tick .     tiffany asked again  looking up .      i   m   not sure .  is anyone watching us .      tiffany looked around .  twoshirts slept in the heat .  there was no one watching .      no  miss tick .      the teacher removed her hat and took from inside it a couple pieces of wood and a spool of black thread .  she rolled up her sleeves  looking around quickly in case twoshirts had sprouted a population  then broke off a length of the thread and picked up the egg .   egg  thread  and fingers blurred for a few seconds and then there was the egg  hanging from miss tick   s fingers in a neat little black net .   tiffany was impressed .   but miss tick hadn   t finished .  she began to draw things from her pockets  and a witch generally has a lot of pockets .  there were some beads  a couple of feathers  a glass lens  and one or two strips of colored paper .  these all got threaded into the tangle of wood and cotton .      what is that .     said tiffany .      it   s a shamble     said miss tick  concentrating .      is it magic .         not exactly .  it   s trickery .      miss tick lifted her left hand .  feathers and beads and egg and pocket junk spun in the web of threads .      hmm     she said .     now let me see what i can see    .      she pushed the fingers of her right hand into the spiderwork of threads and pulled .   egg and glass and beads and feathers danced through the tangle  and tiffany was sure that at one point one thread had passed straight through another .      oh     she said .     it   s like cat   s cradle .         you   ve played that  have you .     said miss tick vaguely  still concentrating .      i can do all the common shapes     said tiffany .     the jewels and the cradle and the house and the flock and the three old ladies  one with a squint  carrying the bucket of fish to market when they meet the donkey  although you need two people for that one  and i only ever did it once  and betsy tupper scratched her nose at the wrong moment and i had to get some scissors to cut her loose    .      miss tick   s fingers worked like a loom .      funny it should be a children   s toy now     she said .     aha       she stared into the complex web she had created .      can you see anything .     said tiffany .      if i may be allowed to concentrate  child .  thank you    .      out in the road the sleeping dog woke  yawned  and pulled itself to its feet .  it ambled over to the bench the two of them were sitting on  gave tiffany a reproachful look  and then curled up by her feet .  it smelled of old damp carpets .      there   s   something       said miss tick very quietly .   panic gripped tiffany .   sunlight reflected off the white dust of the road and the stone wall opposite .  bees hummed between the little yellow flowers that grew on top of the wall .  by tiffany   s feet the spaniel snorted and farted occasionally .   but it was all wrong .  she could feel the pressure bearing down on her  pushing at her  pushing at the landscape  squeezing it under the bright light of day .  miss tick and her cradle of threads were motionless beside her  frozen in the moment of bright horror .   only the threads moved  by themselves .  the egg danced  the glass glinted  the beads slid and jumped from string to string     the egg burst .   the coach rolled in .   it arrived dragging the world behind it  in a cloud of dust and noise and hooves .  it blotted out the sun .  doors opened .  harnesses jingled .  horses steamed .  the spaniel sat up and wagged its tail hopefully .   the pressure went   no  it fled .   beside tiffany  miss tick pulled out a handkerchief and started to wipe egg off her dress .  the rest of the shamble had disappeared into a pocket with remarkable speed .   she smiled at tiffany but kept the smile as she spoke  making herself look slightly mad .      don   t get up  don   t do anything  just be as quiet as a little mouse     she said .  tiffany felt in no state to do anything but sit still  she felt like you feel when you wake up after a nightmare .   the richer passengers got out of the coach  and the poorer ones climbed down from the roof .  grumbling and stamping their feet  trailing road dust behind them  they disappeared .      now     said miss tick  when the inn door had swung shut     we   re   we   re going to go for a  a stroll .  see that little woods up there .  that   s where we   re heading .  and when mr .  crabber  the carter  sees your father tomorrow  he   ll say he   he dropped you off here just before the coach arrived and   and  and everyone will be happy and no one will have lied .  that   s important .         miss tick .     said tiffany  picking up the suitcase .      yes .         what happened just now .         i don   t know     said the witch .     do you feel all right .         er   yes .  you   ve got some yolk on your hat .     and you   re very nervous  tiffany thought .  that was the most worrying part .     i   m sorry about your dress     she added .      it   s seen a lot worse     said miss tick .     let   s go .         miss tick .     said tiffany again as they trudged away .      er  yes .         you are very nervous     said tiffany .     if you told me why  that means there   s two of us  which is only half the nervousness each .      miss tick sighed .     it was probably nothing     she said .      miss tick  the egg exploded .         yes .  um .  a shamble  you see  can be used as a simple magic detector and amplifier .  it   s actually very crude  but it   s always useful to make one in times of distress and confusion .  i think i   probably didn   t make it right .  and sometimes you do get big discharges of random magic .         you made it because you were worried     said tiffany .      worried .  certainly not .  i am never worried .     snapped miss tick .     however  since you raise the subject  i was concerned .  something was making me uneasy .  something close  i think .  it was probably nothing .  in fact  i feel a lot better now we   re leaving .      but you don   t look it  tiffany thought .  and i was wrong .  two people means twice as much nervousness each .   but she was sure there was nothing magical about twoshirts .  it was just a bend in the road .       twenty minutes later the passengers came out to get into the coach .  the coachman did notice that the horses were sweating  and wondered why he could hear a swarm of flies when there were no flies to be seen .   the dog that had been lying in the road was found later cowering in one of the inn   s stables  whimpering .       the woods was about half an hour   s walk away  with miss tick and tiffany taking turns to carry the suitcase .  it was nothing special  as woods go  being mostly full grown beech  although once you know that beech drips unpleasant poisons on the ground beneath it to keep it clear  it   s not quite the timber you thought it was .   they sat on a log and waited for sunset .  miss tick told tiffany about shambles .      they   re not magical then .     said tiffany .      no .  they   re something to be magical through .         you mean like spectacles help you see but don   t see for you .         that   s right  well done .  is a telescope magical .  certainly not .  it   s just glass in a tube  but with one you could count the dragons on the moon .  and   well  have you ever used a bow .  no  probably not .  but a shamble can act like a bow  too .  a bow stores up muscle power as the archer draws it  and sends a heavy arrow much farther than the archer could actually throw it .  you can make one out of anything  so long as it   looks right .         and then you can tell if magic is happening .         yes  if that   s what you   re looking for .  when you   re good at it  you can use it to help you do magic yourself  to really focus on what you have to do .  you can use it for protection  like a curse net  or to send a spell  or   well  it   s like those expensive penknives  you know .  the ones with the tiny saw and the scissors and the toothpick .  except that i don   t think any witch has ever used a shamble as a toothpick  ha ha .  all young witches should learn how to make a shamble .  miss level will help you .      tiffany looked around the woods .  the shadows were growing longer  but they didn   t worry her .  bits of miss tick   s teachings floated through her head  always face what you fear .  have just enough money  never too much  and some string .  even if it   s not your fault  it   s your responsibility .  witches deal with things .  never stand between two mirrors .  never cackle .  do what you must do .  never lie  but you don   t always have to be honest .  never wish .  especially don   t wish upon a star  which is astronomically stupid .  open your eyes  and then open your eyes again .      miss level has got long gray hair  has she .     she said .      oh  yes .         and she   s quite a tall lady  just a bit fat  and she wears quite a lot of necklaces     tiffany went on .     and glasses on a chain .  and surprisingly high heeled boots .      miss tick wasn   t a fool .  she looked around the clearing .      where is she .     she said .      standing by the tree over there     said tiffany .   even so  miss tick had to squint .  what tiffany had noticed was that witches filled space .  in a way that was almost impossible to describe  they seemed to be more real than others around them .  they just showed more .  but if they didn   t want to be seen  they became amazingly hard to notice .  they didn   t hide  they didn   t magically fade away  although it might seem like that  but if you had to describe the room afterward  you   d swear there hadn   t been a witch in it .  they just seemed to let themselves get lost .      ah yes  well done     said miss tick .     i was wondering when you   d notice .      ha .  thought tiffany .   miss level got realer as she walked toward them .  she was all in black  but clattered slightly as she walked because of all the black jewelry she wore  and she did have glasses  too  which struck tiffany as odd for a witch .  miss level reminded tiffany of a happy hen .  and she had two arms  the normal number .      ah  miss tick     she said .     and you must be tiffany aching .      tiffany knew enough to bow  witches don   t curtsy  unless they want to embarrass roland  .      i   d just like to have a word with miss level  tiffany  if you don   t mind     said miss tick  meaningfully .     senior witch business .      ha .  thought tiffany again  because she liked the sound of it .      i   ll just go and have a look at a tree then  shall i .     she said with what she hoped was withering sarcasm .      i should use the bushes if i was you  dear     miss level called after her .     i don   t like stopping once we   re airborne .      there were some holly bushes that made a decent screen  but after being talked to as though she was ten years old  tiffany would rather have allowed her bladder to explode .   i beat the queen of the fairies .  she thought as she wandered into the woods .  all right  i   m not sure how  because it   s all like a dream now  but i did do it .   she was angry at being sent away like that .  a little respect wouldn   t hurt  would it .  that   s what the old witch mistress weatherwax had said  wasn   t it .     i show you respect  as you in turn will respect me .     mistress weatherwax  the witch who all the other witches secretly wanted to be like  had shown her respect  so you   d think the others could make a bit of effort in that department .   she said     see me .         and stepped out of herself and walked away toward miss tick and miss level  in her invisible ghost body .  she didn   t dare look down  in case she saw her feet weren   t there .  when she turned and looked back at her solid body  she saw it standing demurely by the holly bushes  clearly too far away to be listening to anyone   s conversation .   as tiffany stealthily drew nearer  she heard miss tick say         but quite frighteningly precocious .         oh dear .  i   ve never got on very well with clever people     said miss level .      oh  she   s a good child at heart     said miss tick  which annoyed tiffany rather more than    frighteningly precocious    had .      of course  you know my situation     said miss level  as the invisible tiffany inched closer .      yes  miss level  but your work does you great credit .  that   s why mistress weatherwax suggested you .         but i am afraid i   m getting a bit absentminded     miss level worried .     it was terrible flying down here  because like a big silly i left my long distance spectacles on my other nose    .      her other nose .  thought tiffany .   both witches froze  exactly at the same time .      i   m without an egg .     said miss tick .      i have a beetle in a matchbox against just such an emergency .     squeaked miss level .   their hands flew to their pockets and pulled out string and feathers and bits of colored cloth     they know i   m here .  thought tiffany  and whispered     see me not .      she blinked and rocked on her heels as she arrived back in the patient little figure by the holly bushes .  in the distance miss level was frantically making a shamble and miss tick was staring around the woods .      tiffany  come here at once .     she shouted .      yes  miss tick     said tiffany  trotting forward like a good girl .   they spotted me somehow  she thought .  well  they are witches  after all  even if in my opinion they   re not very good ones     then the pressure came .  it seemed to squash the woods flat and filled it with the horrible feeling that something is standing right behind you .  tiffany sank to her knees with her hands over her ears and a pain like the worst earache squeezing her head .      finished .     shouted miss level .  she held up a shamble .  it was quite different from miss tick   s  made up of string and crow feathers and glittery black beads and  in the middle  an ordinary matchbox .   tiffany yelled .  the pain was like red hot needles and her ears filled with the buzz of flies .   the matchbox exploded .   and then there was silence  and birdsong  and nothing to show that anything had happened apart from a few pieces of matchbox spiraling down  along with iridescent fragments of wing case .      oh dear     said miss level .     he was quite a good beetle  as beetles go    .         tiffany  are you all right .     said miss tick .  tiffany blinked .  the pain had gone as fast as it has arrived  leaving only a burning memory .  she scrambled to her feet .      i think so  miss tick .         then a word  if you please .     said miss tick .  she marched over to a tree and stood there looking stern .      yes  miss tick .     said tiffany .      did you   do anything .     said miss tick .     you haven   t been summoning things  have you .         no .  anyway  i don   t know how to .     said tiffany .      it   s not your little men then  is it .     said miss tick doubtfully .      they   re not mine  miss tick .  and they don   t do that sort of thing .  they just shout    crivens .     and then start kicking people on the ankle .  you definitely know it   s them .         well  whatever it was  it seems to have gone     said miss level .     and we should go too   otherwise we   ll be flying all night .     she reached behind another tree and picked up a bundle of firewood .  at least  it looked exactly like that  because it was supposed to .     my own invention     she said  modestly .     one never knows down here on the plains  does one .  and the handle shoots out by means of this button   oh  i   m so sorry  it sometimes does that .  did anyone see where it went .      the handle was located in a bush and screwed back in .   tiffany  a girl who listened to what people said  watched miss level closely .  she definitely had only one nose on her face  and it was sort of uncomfortable to imagine where anyone might have another one and what   d they use it for .   then miss level pulled some rope out of her pocket and passed it to someone who wasn   t there .   that   s what she did  tiffany was sure .  she didn   t drop it  she didn   t throw it  she just held it out and let go  as though she   d thought she was hanging it on an invisible hook .   it landed in a coil on the moss .  miss level looked down  then saw tiffany staring at her and laughed nervously .      silly me     she said .     i thought i was over there .  i   ll forget my own head next .         well   if it   s the one on top of your neck     said tiffany cautiously  still thinking about the other nose     you   ve still got it .      the old suitcase was roped to the bristle end of the broomstick  which now floated calmly a few feet above the ground .      there  that   ll make a nice comfy seat     said miss level  now the bag of nerves that most people turned into when they felt tiffany staring at them .     if you   d just hang on behind me .  er .  that   s what i normally do .         you normally hang on behind you .     said tiffany .     how can           tiffany  i   ve always encouraged your forthright way of asking questions     said miss tick loudly .     and now  please  i would love to congratulate you on your mastery of silence .  do climb on behind miss level .  i   m sure she   ll want to leave while you   ve still got some daylight .      the stick bobbed a little as miss level climbed onto it .  she patted it invitingly .      you   re not frightened of heights  are you  dear .     she asked as tiffany climbed on .      no     said tiffany .      i shall drop in when i come up for the witch trials     said miss tick as tiffany felt the stick rise gently under her .     take care .      it turned out that when miss level had asked tiffany if she was scared of heights  it had been the wrong question .  tiffany was not afraid of heights at all .  she could walk past tall trees without batting an eyelid .  looking up at huge towering mountains didn   t bother her a bit .   what she was afraid of  although she hadn   t realized it until this point  was depths .  she was afraid of dropping such a long way out of the sky that she   d have time to run out of breath screaming before hitting the rocks so hard that she   d turn to a sort of jelly and all her bones would break into dust .  she was  in fact  afraid of the ground .  miss level should have thought before asking the question .   tiffany clung to miss level   s belt and stared at the cloth of her dress .      have you ever flown before  tiffany .     asked the witch as they rose .      gnf .     squeaked tiffany .      if you like  i could take us round in a little circle     said miss level .     we should have a fine view of your country from up here .      the air was rushing past tiffany now .  it was a lot colder .  she kept her eyes fixed firmly on the cloth .      would you like that .     said miss level  raising her voice as the wind grew louder .     it won   t take a moment .      tiffany didn   t have time to say no and  in any case  was sure she   d be sick if she opened her mouth .  the stick lurched under her  and the world went sideways .   she didn   t want to look but remembered that a witch is always inquisitive to the point of nosiness .  to stay a witch  she had to look .   she risked a glance and saw the world under her .  the red gold light of sunset was flowing across the land  and down there were the long shadows of twoshirts and  farther away  the woods and villages all the way back to the long curved hill of the chalk        which glowed red  and the white carving of the chalk horse burned gold like some giant   s pendant .  tiffany stared at it  in the fading light of the afternoon  with the shadows racing away from the sliding sun  it looked alive .   at that moment she wanted to jump off  fly back  get there by closing her eyes and clicking her heels together  do anything     no .  she   d bundled those thoughts away  hadn   t she .  she had to learn  and there was no one on the hills to teach her .   but the chalk was her world .  she walked on it every day .  she could feel its ancient life under her feet .  the land was in her bones  just as granny aching had said .  it was in her name  too  in the old language of the nac mac feegle  her name sounded like    land under wave     and in the eye of her mind she   d walked in those deep prehistoric seas when the chalk had been formed  in a million year rain made of the shells of tiny creatures .  she trod a land made of life  and breathed it in  and listened to it  and thought its thoughts for it .  to see it now  small  alone  in a landscape that stretched to the end of the world  was too much .  she had to go back to it     for a moment the stick wobbled in the air .   no .  i know i must go .   it jerked back  and there was a sickening feeling in her stomach as the stick curved away toward the mountains .      a little bit of turbulence there  i think     said miss level over her shoulder .     by the way  did miss tick warn you about the thick wooly pants  dear .      tiffany  still shocked  mumbled something that managed to sound like    no .     miss tick had mentioned the pants  and how a sensible witch wore at least three pairs to stop ice forming  but she had forgotten about them .      oh dear     said miss level .     then we   d better hedgehop .      the stick dropped like a stone .   tiffany never forgot that ride  though she often tried to .  they flew just above the ground  which was the blur just below her feet .  every time they came to a fence or a hedge  miss level would jump it with a cry of    here we go .     or    ups a daisy .     which was probably meant to make tiffany feel better .  it didn   t .  she threw up twice .   miss level flew with her head bent so far down as to be almost level with the stick  thus getting the maximum aerodynamic advantage from the pointy hat .  it was quite a stubby one  only about nine inches high  rather like a clown hat without the bobbles  tiffany found out later that this was so that she didn   t have to take it off when entering low ceilinged cottages .   after a while   an eternity from tiffany   s point of view   they left the farmlands behind and started to fly through foothills .  before long they   d left trees behind  too  and the stick was flying above the fast white waters of a wide river studded with boulders .  spray splashed over their boots .   she heard miss level yell above the roar of the river and the rush of the wind     would you mind leaning back .  this bit   s a little tricky .      tiffany risked peeking over the witch   s shoulder and gasped .   there was not much water on the chalk  except for the little streams that people called bournes  which flowed down the valleys in late winter and dried up completely in the summer .  big rivers flowed around it  of course  but they were slow and tame .   the water ahead wasn   t slow and tame .  it was vertical .   the river ran up into the dark blue sky  soared up to the early stars .  the broom followed it .   tiffany leaned back and screamed  and went on screaming as the broomstick tilted in the air and climbed up the waterfall .  she   d known the word  certainly  but the word hadn   t been so big  so wet  and above all it hadn   t been so loud .   the mist of it drenched her .  the noise pounded in her ears .  she held on to miss level   s belt as they climbed though spray and thunder and felt that she   d slip at any minute        and then she was thrown forward  and the noise of the falls died away behind her as the stick  now once again going    along    rather than    up     sped across the surface of a river that  while still leaping and foaming  at least had the decency to do it on the ground .   there was a bridge high above  and walls of cold rock hemmed the river in on either side  but the walls got lower and the river got slower and the air got warmer again until the broomstick skimmed across calm fat water that probably didn   t know what was going to happen to it .  silver fish zigzagged away as they passed over the surface .   after a while miss level sent them curving up across new fields  smaller and greener than the ones at home .  there were trees again  and little woods in deep valleys .  but the last of the sunlight was draining away  and soon all there was below was darkness .   tiffany must have dozed off  clinging to miss level  because she felt herself jerk awake as the broomstick stopped in midair .  the ground was some way below  but someone had set out a ring of what turned out to be candle ends  burning in old jars .   delicately  turning slowly  the stick settled down until it stopped just above the grass .   at this point tiffany   s legs decided to untwist  and she fell off .      up we get .     said miss level cheerfully  picking her up .     you did very well .         sorry about screaming and being sick     tiffany mumbled  tripping over one of the jars and knocking the candle out .  she tried to make out anything in the dark  but her head was spinning .     did you light these candles  miss level .         yes .  let   s get inside  it   s getting chilly       miss level began .      oh  by magic     said tiffany  still dizzy .      well  it can be done by magic  yes     said miss level .     but i prefer matches  which are of course a lot less effort and quite magical in themselves  when you come to think about it .     she untied the suitcase from the stick and said     here we are  then .  i do hope you   ll like it here .      there was that cheerfulness again .  even when she felt sick and dizzy  and quite interested in knowing where the privy was as soon as possible  tiffany still had ears that worked and a mind that  however much she tried  wouldn   t stop thinking .  and it thought  that cheerfulness has got cracks around the edges .  something isn   t right here    .       chapter        a single minded lady      there was a cottage  but tiffany couldn   t see much in the gloom .  apple trees crowded in around it .  something hanging from a branch brushed against her as  walking unsteadily  she followed miss level .  it swung away with a tinkling sound .  there was the sound of rushing water  too  some way away .   miss level was opening a door .  it led into a small  brightly lit  and amazingly tidy kitchen .  a fire was burning briskly in the iron stove .      um   i   m supposed to be the apprentice     said tiffany  still groggy from the flight .     i   ll make something to drink if you show me where things are           no .     miss level burst out  raising her hands .  the shout seemed to have shocked her  because she was shaking when she lowered them .     no  i  i wouldn   t dream of it     she said in a more normal voice  trying to smile .     you   ve had a long day .  i   ll show you to your room and where things are  and i   ll bring you up some stew  and you can be an apprentice tomorrow .  no rush .      tiffany looked at the bubbling pot on the iron stove  and the loaf on the table .  it was freshly baked bread  she could smell that .   the trouble with tiffany was her third thoughts .   they thought  she lives by herself .  who lit the fire .  a bubbling pot needs stirring from time to time .  who stirred it .  and someone lit the candles .  who .      is there anyone else staying here  miss level .     she said .   miss level looked desperately at the pot and the loaf and back to tiffany .      no  there   s only me     she said  and somehow tiffany knew she was telling the truth .  or a truth  anyway .      in the morning .     said miss level  almost pleading .  she looked so forlorn that tiffany actually felt sorry for her .   she smiled .     of course  miss level     she said .   there was a brief tour by candlelight .  there was a privy not far from the cottage  it was a two holer  which tiffany thought was a bit odd   but of course maybe other people had lived here once .  there was also a room just for a bath  a terrible waste of space by the standards of home farm .  it had its own pump and a big boiler for heating the water .  this was definitely posh .   her bedroom was a   nice room .  nice was a very good word .  everything had frills .  anything that could have a cover on it was covered .  some attempt had been made to make the room   jolly  as if being a bedroom was a jolly wonderful thing to be .  tiffany   s room back on the farm had a rag rug on the floor  a water jug and basin on a stand  a big wooden box for clothes  an ancient dolls    house  and some old calico curtains  and that was pretty much it .  on the farm  bedrooms were for shutting your eyes in .   the room had a chest of drawers .  the contents of tiffany   s suitcase filled one drawer easily .   the bed made no sound when tiffany sat on it .  her bed at home had a mattress so old that it had a comfy hollow in it  and the springs all made different noises  if she couldn   t sleep  she could move various parts of her body and play    the bells of st .  ungulants    on the springs   cling twing glong  gling ping bloyinnng  dlink plang dyonnng  ding ploink .   this room smelled different too .  it smelled of spare rooms and other people   s soap .   at the bottom of her suitcase was a small box that mr .  block  the farm   s carpenter  had made for her .  he did not go in for delicate work  and it was quite heavy .  in it  she kept   keepsakes .  there was a piece of chalk with a fossil in it  which was quite rare  and her personal butter stamp  which showed a witch on a broomstick  in case she got a chance to make butter here  and a dobby stone  which was supposed to be lucky because it had a hole in it .   she   d been told that when she was seven  and had picked it up .  she couldn   t quite see how the hole made it lucky  but since it had spent a lot of time in her pocket  and then safe and sound in the box  it probably was more fortunate than most stones  which got kicked around and run over by carts and so on .    there was also a blue and yellow wrapper from an old packet of jolly sailor tobacco  and a buzzard feather  and an ancient flint arrowhead wrapped up carefully in a piece of sheep   s wool .  there were plenty of these on the chalk .  the nac mac feegle used them for spear points .   she lined these up neatly on the top of the chest of drawers  alongside her diary  but they didn   t make the place look more homey .  they just looked lonely .   tiffany picked up the old wrapper and the sheep wool and sniffed them .  they weren   t quite the smell of the shepherding hut  but they were close enough to it to bring tears to her eyes .   she had never spent a night away from the chalk before .  she knew the word homesickness and wondered whether this cold  thin feeling growing inside her was what it felt like     someone knocked at the door .      it   s me     said a muffled voice .   tiffany jumped off the bed and opened the door .  miss level came in with a tray that held a bowl of beef stew and some bread .  she put it down on the little table by the bed .      if you put it outside the door when you   re finished  i   ll take it down later     she said .      thank you very much     said tiffany .   miss level paused at the door .     it   s going to be so nice having someone to talk to  apart from myself     she said .     i do hope you won   t want to leave  tiffany .      tiffany gave her a happy little smile  then waited until the door had shut and she   d heard miss level   s footsteps go downstairs before tiptoeing to the window and checking there were no bars in it .   there had been something scary about miss level   s expression .  it was sort of hungry and hopeful and pleading and frightened  all at once .   tiffany also checked that she could bolt the bedroom door on the inside .   the beef stew tasted  indeed  just like beef stew and not  just to take an example completely and totally at random  stew made out of the last poor girl who   d worked here .   to be a witch  you have to have a very good imagination .  just now  tiffany was wishing that hers wasn   t quite so good .  but mistress weatherwax and miss tick wouldn   t have let her come here if it was dangerous  would they .  well  would they .   they might .  they just might .  witches didn   t believe in making things too easy .  they assumed you used your brains .  if you didn   t use your brains  you had no business being a witch .  the world doesn   t make things easy  they   d say .  learn how to learn fast .   but   they   d give her a chance  wouldn   t they .   of course they would .   probably .   she   d nearly finished the not made of people at all honestly stew when something tried to take the bowl out of her hand .  it was the gentlest of tugs  and when she automatically pulled it back  the tugging stopped immediately .   o kay  she thought .  another strange thing .  well  this is a witch   s cottage .   something pulled at the spoon but  again  stopped as soon as she tugged back .   tiffany put the empty bowl and spoon back on the tray .      all right     she said  hoping she sounded not scared at all .     i   ve finished .      the tray rose into the air and drifted gently toward the door  where it landed on the floor with a faint tinkle .   up on the door  the bolt slid back .   the door opened .   the tray rose up and sailed through the doorway .   the door shut .   the bolt slid across .   tiffany heard the rattle of the spoon as  somewhere on the dark landing  the tray moved on .   it seemed to tiffany that it was vitally important that she thought before doing anything .  and so she thought  it would be stupid to run around screaming because your tray had been taken away .  after all  whatever had done it had even had the decency to bolt the door after itself  which meant that it respected her privacy  even while it ignored it .   she cleaned her teeth at the washstand  got into her nightgown  and slid into the bed .  she blew out the candle .   after a moment she got up  relit the candle  and with some effort dragged the chest of drawers in front of the door .  she wasn   t quite certain why  but she felt better for doing it .   she lay back in the dark again .   tiffany was used to sleeping while  outside on the downland  sheep baaed and sheep bells occasionally went tonk .   up here  there were no sheep to baa and no bells to tonk  and every time one didn   t  she woke up thinking  what was that .   but she did get to sleep eventually  because she remembered waking up in the middle of the night to hear the chest of drawers very slowly slide back to its original position .       tiffany woke up  still alive and not chopped up  when the dawn was just turning gray .  unfamiliar birds were singing .   there were no sounds in the cottage  and she thought  i   m the apprentice  aren   t i .  i   m the one who should be cleaning up and getting the fire lit .  i know how this is supposed to go .   she sat up and looked around the room .   her old clothes had been neatly folded on top of the chest of drawers .  the fossil and the lucky stone and the other things had gone  and it was only after a frantic search that she found them back in the box in her suitcase .      now look     she said to the room in general .     i am a hag  you know .  if there are any nac mac feegle here  step out this minute .      nothing happened .  she hadn   t expected anything to happen .  the nac mac feegle weren   t particularly interested in tidying things up  anyway .   as an experiment she took the candlestick off the bedside table  put it on the chest of drawers  and stood back .  more nothing happened .   she turned to look out of the window and  as she did so  there was a faint blint noise .   when she spun around  the candlestick was back on the table .   well   today was going to be a day when she got answers .  tiffany enjoyed the slightly angry feeling .  it stopped her thinking about how much she wanted to go home .   she went to put her dress on and realized that there was something soft yet crackly in a pocket .   oh  how could she have forgotten .  but it had been a busy day  a very busy day  and maybe she   d wanted to forget  anyway .   she pulled out roland   s present and opened the white tissue paper carefully .   it was a necklace .   it was the horse .   tiffany stared at it .   not what a horse looks like  but what a horse be    .  it had been carved in the turf back before history began  by people who had managed to convey in a few flowing lines everything a horse was  strength  grace  beauty  and speed  straining to break free of the hill .   and now someone   someone clever and  therefore  probably also someone expensive   had made it out of silver .  it was flat  just like it was on the hillside  and just like the horse on the hillside  some parts of it were not joined to the rest of the body .  the craftsman  though  had joined these carefully together with tiny silver chain  so when tiffany held it up in astonishment  it was all there  moving while standing still in the morning light .   she had to put it on .  and   there was no mirror  not even a tiny hand one .  oh  well        see me     said tiffany .   and far away  down on the plains  something that had lost the trail awoke .  nothing happened for a moment  and then the mist on the fields parted as something invisible started to move  making a noise like a swarm of flies    .   tiffany shut her eyes  took a couple of small steps sideways and a few steps forward  turned around  and carefully opened her eyes again .  there she stood  in front of her  as still as a picture .  the horse looked very good on the new dress  silver against green .   she wondered how much it must have cost roland .  she wondered why .      see me not     she said .  slowly she took the necklace off  wrapped it up again in its tissue paper  and put it in the box with the other things from home .  then she found one of the postcards from twoshirts and a pencil  and with care and attention  she wrote roland a short thank you note .  after a flash of guilt she carefully used the other postcard to tell her parents that she was completely still alive .   then  thoughtfully  she went downstairs .   it had been dark last night  so she hadn   t noticed the posters stuck up all down the stairs .  they were from circuses  and were covered with clowns and animals and that old fashioned poster lettering where no two lines of type are the same .   they said things like     thrills galore .  hurry .  hurry .  hurry .       professor monty bladder   s three ring circus and cabinet of curiosities .  .       see the horse with his head where his tail should be .       see the amazing dislocating jack put a lion   s head in his actual mouth .  .  .       see the egress .  .  .  .  .       clowns .  clowns .  clowns .   the flying pastrami brothers will defy gravity  the greatest force in the universe  without a net .        see clarence the tap dancing mule .       wonder at topsy and tipsy   the astounding mind reading act       and so it went on  right down to tiny print .  they were strange  bright things to find in a little cottage in the woods .   she found her way into the kitchen .  it was cold and quiet  except for the ticking of a clock on the wall .  both the hands had fallen off the clock face and lay at the bottom of the glass cover  so while the clock was still measuring time  it wasn   t inclined to tell anyone about it .   as kitchens went  it was very tidy .  in the cupboard drawer under the sink  forks  spoons  and knives were all in neat sections  which was a bit worrying .  every kitchen drawer tiffany had ever seen might have been meant to be neat but over the years had been crammed with things that didn   t quite fit  like big ladles and bent bottle openers  which meant that they always stuck unless you knew the trick of opening them .   experimentally she took a spoon out of the spoon section  dropped it among the forks  and shut the drawer .  then she turned her back .   there was a sliding noise and a tinkle exactly like the tinkle a spoon makes when it   s put back among the other spoons  who have missed it and are anxious to hear its tales of life among the frighteningly pointy people .   this time she put a knife in with the forks  shut the drawer   and leaned on it .   nothing happened for a while  and then she heard the cutlery rattling .  the noise got louder .  the drawer began to shake .  the whole sink began to tremble        all right     said tiffany  jumping back .     have it your way .      the drawer burst open  the knife jumped from section to section like a fish  and the drawer slammed back .   silence .      who are you .     said tiffany .  no one replied .  but she didn   t like the feeling in the air .  someone was upset with her now .  it had been a silly trick  anyway .   she went out into the garden quickly .  the rushing noise she had heard last night was made by a waterfall not far from the cottage .  a little waterwheel pumped water into a big stone cistern  and there was a pipe that led into the house .   the garden was full of ornaments .  they were rather sad  cheap ones   bunny rabbits with crazy grins  pottery deer with big eyes  gnomes with pointy red hats and expressions that suggested they were on bad medication .   things hung from the apple trees or were tied to posts all around the place .  there were some dream catchers and curse nets  which she sometimes saw hanging up outside cottages at home .  other things looked like big shambles  spinning and tinkling gently .  some   well  one looked like a bird made out of old brushes  but most looked like piles of junk .  odd junk  though .  it seemed to tiffany that some of it moved slightly as she went past .   when she went back into the cottage  miss level was sitting at the kitchen table .   so was miss level .  there were  in fact  two of her .      sorry     said the miss level on the right .     i thought it was best to get it over with right now .      the two women were exactly alike .     oh  i see     said tiffany .     you   re twins .         no     said the miss level on the left     i   m not .  this might be a little difficult              for you to understand     said the other miss level .     let me see  now .  you know              how twins are sometimes said to be able to share thoughts and feelings .     said the first miss level .   tiffany nodded .      well     said the second miss level     i   m a bit more complicated than that  i suppose  because              i   m one person with two bodies     said the first miss level  and now they spoke like players in a tennis match  slamming the words back and forth .      i wanted to break this to you              gently  because some people get upset by the              idea and find it creepy or              just plain              weird .      the two bodies stopped .      sorry about that last sentence     said the miss level on the left .     i only do that when i   m really nervous .         er  do you mean that you both       tiffany began  but the miss level on the right said quickly     there is no both .  there   s just me  do you understand .  i know it   s hard .  but i have a right right hand and a right left hand and a left right hand and a left left hand .  it   s all me .  i can go shopping and stay home at the same time  tiffany .  if it helps  think of me as one              person with four arms and              four legs and              four eyes .      all four of those eyes now watched tiffany nervously .      and two noses     said tiffany .      that   s right .  you   ve got it .  my right body is slightly clumsier than my left body  but i have better eyesight in my right pair of eyes .  i   m human  just like you  except that there   s more of me .         but one of you   that is  one half of you   came all the way to twoshirts for me     said tiffany .      oh yes  i can split up like that     said miss level .     i   m quite good at it .  but if there   s a gap of more than twenty miles or so  i get rather clumsy .  and now a cup of tea would do us both good  i think .      before tiffany could move  both the miss levels stood up and crossed the kitchen .   tiffany watched one person make a cup of tea using four arms .   there are quite a few things that need to be done to make a cup of tea  and miss level did them all at once .  the bodies stood side by side  passing things from hand to hand to hand  moving kettle and cups and spoon in a sort of ballet .      when i was a child  they thought i was twins     she said over one of her shoulders .     and then   they thought i was evil     she said  over another shoulder .      are you .     said tiffany .   both of miss level turned around  looking shocked .      what kind of question is that to ask anyone .     she said .      um   the obvious one .     said tiffany .     i mean  if they said     yes i am .  mwahahaha .     that would save a lot of trouble  wouldn   t it .      four eyes narrowed .      mistress weatherwax was right     said miss level .     she said you were a witch to your boots .      inside  tiffany beamed with pride .      well  the thing about the obvious     said miss level     is that it so often isn   t    .  did mistress weatherwax really take off her hat to you .         yes .         one day perhaps you   ll know how much honor she did you     said miss level .     anyway   no  i   m not evil .  but i nearly became evil  i think .  mother died not long after i was born  my father was at sea and never came back           worse things happen at sea     said tiffany .  it was something granny aching had told her .      yes  right  and probably they did  or possibly he never wanted to come back in any case     said miss level dryly .     and i was put in a charity home  bad food  horrible teachers  blah  blah  and i fell into the worst company possible  which was my own .  it   s amazing the tricks you can get up to when you   ve got two bodies .  of course  everyone thought i was twins .  in the end i ran away to join the circus .  me .  can you imagine that .         topsy and tipsy  the astounding mind reading act .     said tiffany .   miss level stood stock still  her mouths open .      it was on the posters over the stairs     tiffany added .   now miss level relaxed .      oh  yes .  of course .  very   quick of you  tiffany .  yes .  you do notice things  don   t you    .         i know i wouldn   t pay money to see the egress     said tiffany .     it just means    the way out .             clever .     said miss level .     monty put that on a sign to keep people moving though the believe it or not tent .     this way to the egress .     of course  people thought it was a female eagle or something  so monty had a big man with a dictionary outside to show them they got exactly what they paid for .  have you ever been to a circus .      once  tiffany admitted .  it hadn   t been much fun .  things that try too hard to be funny often aren   t .  there had been a moth eaten lion with practically no teeth  a tightrope walker who was never more than a few feet above the ground  and a knife thrower who threw a lot of knives at an elderly woman in pink tights on a big spinning wooden disc and completely failed to hit her every time .  the only real amusement was afterward  when a cart ran over the clown .      my circus was a lot bigger     said miss level  when tiffany mentioned this .     although  as i recall  our knife thrower was also very bad at aiming .  we had elephants and camels and a lion so fierce it bit a man   s arm nearly off .      tiffany had to admit that this sounded a lot more entertaining .      and what did you do .     she said .      well  i just bandaged him up while i shooed the lion off him           yes  miss level  but i meant in the circus .  just reading your own mind .      miss level beamed at tiffany .     that  yes  and nearly everything else  too     she said .     with different wigs on i was the stupendous bohunkus sisters .  i juggled plates  you know  and wore costumes covered in sequins .  and i helped with the high wire act .  not walking the wire  of course  but generally smiling and glittering at the audience .  everyone assumed i was twins  and circus people don   t ask too many personal questions in any case .  and then what with one thing and another  this and that   i came up here and became a witch .      both of miss level watched tiffany carefully .      that was quite a long sentence  that last sentence     said tiffany .      yes  it was  wasn   t it     said miss level .     i can   t tell you everything .  do you still want to stay .  the last three girls didn   t .  some people find me slightly   odd .         um   i   ll stay     said tiffany slowly .     the thing that moves things about is a bit strange  though .      miss level looked surprised and then said     oh  do you mean oswald .         there   s an invisible man called oswald who can get into my bedroom .     said tiffany  horrified .      oh  no .  that   s just a name .  oswald isn   t a man  he   s an ondageist .  have you heard of poltergeists .         er   invisible spirits that throw things around .         good     said miss level .     well  an ondageist is the opposite .  they   re obsessive about tidiness .  he   s quite handy around the house  but he   s absolutely dreadful if he   s in the kitchen when i   m cooking .  he keeps putting things away .  i think it makes him happy .  sorry  i should have warned you  but he normally hides if anyone comes to the cottage .  he   s shy .         and he   s a man .  i mean  a male spirit .         how would you tell .  he   s got no body and he doesn   t speak .  i just called him oswald because i always picture him as a worried little man with a dustpan and brush .     the left miss level giggled when the right miss level said this .  the effect was odd and  if you thought that way  also creepy .      well  we are getting on well     said the right miss level nervously .     is there anything more you want to know  tiffany .         yes  please     said tiffany .     what do you want me to do .  what do you do .          and mostly  it turned out  what miss level did was chores .  endless chores .  you could look in vain for much broomstick tuition  spelling lessons  or pointy hat management .  they were  mostly  the kind of chores that are just   chores .   there was a small flock of goats  technically led by stinky sam  who had a shed of his own and was kept on a chain  but really led by black meg  the senior nanny  who patiently allowed tiffany to milk her and then  carefully and deliberately  put a hoof in the milk bucket .  that   s a goat   s idea of getting to know you .  a goat is a worrying thing if you   re used to sheep  because a goat is a sheep with brains .  but tiffany had met goats before  because a few people in the village kept them for their milk  which was very nourishing .  and she knew that with goats you had to use persicology .   if you got excited  and shouted  and hit them  hurting your hand  because it   s like slapping a sack full of coat hangers   then they had won and sniggered at you in goat language  which is almost all sniggering anyway .   by day two tiffany learned that the thing to do was reach out and grab black meg   s hind leg just as she lifted it up to kick the bucket  and lift it up farther .  that made her unbalanced and nervous and the other goats sniggered at her  and tiffany had won .   next there were the bees .  miss level kept a dozen hives  for the wax as much as the honey  in a little clearing that was loud with buzzing .  she made tiffany wear a veil and gloves before she opened a hive .  she wore some too .      of course     she observed     if you are careful and sober and well centered in your life  the bees won   t sting .  unfortunately  not all the bees have heard about this theory .  good morning  hive three  this is tiffany .  she will be staying with us for a while    .      tiffany half expected the whole hive to pipe up  in some horrible high pitched buzz     good morning  tiffany .     it didn   t .      why did you tell them that .     she asked .      oh  you have to talk to your bees     said miss level .     it   s very bad luck not to .  i generally have a little chat with them most evenings .  news and gossip  that sort of thing .  every beekeeper knows about    telling the bees .            and who do the bees tell .     asked tiffany .   both of miss level smiled at her .      other bees  i suppose     she said .      so   if you knew how to listen to the bees  you   d know everything that was going on  yes .     tiffany persisted .      you know  it   s funny you should say that     said miss level .     there have been a few rumors   but you   d have to learn to think like a swarm of bees .  one mind with thousands of little bodies .  much too hard to do  even for me .     she exchanged a thoughtful glance with herself .     maybe not impossible  though .      then there were the herbs .  the cottage had a big herb garden  although it contained very little that you   d stuff a turkey with  and at this time of year there was still a lot of work to be done collecting and drying  especially the ones with important roots .  tiffany quite enjoyed that .  miss level was big on herbs .   there is something called the doctrine of signatures .  it works like this  when the creator of the universe made helpful plants for the use of people  he  or in some versions  she  put little clues on them to give people hints .  a plant useful for toothache would look like teeth  one to cure earache would look like an ear  one good for nose problems would drip green goo  and so on .  many people believed this .   you had to use a certain amount of imagination to be good at it  but not much in the case of nose dropwort   and in tiffany   s world the creator had got a little more   creative .  some plants had writing on them  if you knew where to look .  it was often hard to find and usually difficult to read  because plants can   t spell .  most people didn   t even know about it and just used the traditional method of finding out whether plants were poisonous or useful by testing them on some elderly aunt they didn   t need  but miss level was pioneering new techniques that she hoped would mean life would be better for everyone  and  in the case of the aunts  often longer  too  .      this one is false gentian     she told tiffany when they were in the long  cool workroom behind the cottage .  she was holding up a weed triumphantly .     everyone thinks it   s another toothache cure  but just look at the cut root by stored moonlight  using my blue magnifying glass    .      tiffany tried it  and read     good f r colds may cors drowsniss do not oprate heave mashinry .         terrible spelling  but not bad for a daisy     said miss level .      you mean plants really tell you how to use them .     said tiffany .      well  not all of them  and you have to know where to look     said miss level .     look at this  for example  on the common walnut .  you have to use the green magnifying glass by the light of a taper made from red cotton  thus    .      tiffany squinted .  the letters were small and hard to read .         may contain nut    .     she ventured .     but it   s a nutshell .  of course it   ll contain a nut .  er   won   t it .         not necessarily     said miss level .     it may  for example  contain an exquisite miniature scene wrought from gold and many colored precious stones depicting a strange and interesting temple set in a far off land .  well  it might     she added  catching tiffany   s expression .     there   s no actual law against it .  as such .  the world is full of surprises .      that night tiffany had a lot more to put in her diary .  she kept it on top of her chest of drawers with a large stone on it .  oswald seemed to get the message about this  but he had started to polish the stone .       and pull back  and rise above the cottage  and fly the eye across the nighttime    .   miles away  pass invisibly across something that is itself invisible  but which buzzes like a swarm on flies as it drags itself over the ground    .   continue  the roads and towns and trees rushing behind you with zip zip noises  until you come to the big city  and near the center of the city the high old tower  and beneath the tower the ancient magical university  and in the university the library  and in the library the bookshelves  and   the journey has hardly begun .   bookshelves stream past .  the books are on chains .  some snap at you as you pass .   and here is the section of the more dangerous books  the ones that are kept chained in cages or in vats of iced water or simply clamped between lead plates .   but here is a book  faintly transparent and glowing with thaumic radiation  under a glass dome .  young wizards about to engage in research are encouraged to go and read it .   the title is hivers  a dissertation upon a device of amazing cunning by sensibility bustle  d . m .  phil .   b .  el l .   patricius professor of magic .  most of the handwritten book is about how to construct a large and powerful magical apparatus to capture a hiver without harm to the user  but on the very last pages dr .  bustle writes  or wrote       according to the ancient and famous volume res centum et una quas magus facere potet   hivers are a type of demon  indeed  professor poledread classifies them as such in i spy demons  and cuvee gives them a section under    wandering spirits    in liber immanis monstrorum .    however  ancient texts discovered in the cave of jars by the ill fated first expedition to the loko region give quite a different story  which bears out my own not inconsiderable research .   hivers were formed in the first seconds of creation .  they are not alive but they have  as it were  the shape of life .  they have no body  brain  or thoughts of their own  and a naked hiver is a sluggish thing indeed  tumbling gently though the endless night between the worlds .  according to poledread  most end up at the bottoms of deep seas  or in the bellies of volcanoes  or drifting through the hearts of stars .  poledread was a very inferior thinker compared to myself  but in this case he is right .   yet a hiver does have the ability to fear and to crave .  we cannot guess what frightens a hiver  but they seem to take refuge in bodies that have power of some sort   great strength  great intellect  great prowess with magic .  in this sense they are like the common hermit elephant of howondaland  elephas solitariu  which will always seek the strongest mud hut as its shell .   there is no doubt in my mind that hivers have advanced the cause of life .  why did fish crawl out of the sea .  why did humanity grasp such a dangerous thing as fire .  hivers  i believe  have been behind this  firing outstanding creatures of various species with the flame of necessary ambition  which drove them onward and upward .  what is it that a hiver seeks .  what is it that drives them forward .  what is it they want .  this i shall find out .   oh  lesser wizards warn us that a hiver distorts the mind of its host  curdling it and inevitably causing an early death through brain fever .  i say poppycock .  people have always been afraid of what they do not understand .   but i have understanding .   this morning  at two o   clock  i captured a hiver with my device .  and now it is locked inside my head .  i can sense its memories  the memories of every creature it has inhabited .  yet because of my superior intellect  i control the hiver .  it does not control me .  i do not feel that it has changed me in any way .  my mind is as extraordinarily powerful as it always has been .       at this point the writing is smudgy  apparently because bustle was beginning to drool .       oh  how they have held me back over the years  those worms and cravens that have through sheer luck been allowed to call themselves my superiors .  they laughed at me .  but they are not laughing now .  .  .  even those who called themselves my friends  oh yes  they did nothing but hinder me .  what about the warnings .  they said .  why did the jar you found the plans in have the words    do not open under any circumstances .     engraved in fifteen ancient languages on the lid .  they said .  cowards .  so called    chums    .  creatures inhabited by a hiver become paranoid and insane  they said .  hivers cannot be controlled  they squeaked .  .  do any of us believe this for one minute .  oh  what glories await .  now i have cleansed my life of such worthlessness .  and as for those even now having the disrespect yes disrespect to hammer on my door because of what i did to the so called archchancellor and the college council   how dare they judge me .  like all insects they have no concept of greatness .  .  .  .  .  i will show them .  .  .  but   i in soleps   blit .  .  .  .  .  hammeringggg dfgujf blort            and there the writing ends .  on a little card beside the book some wizard of former times has written  all that could be found of professor bustle was buried in a jar in the old rose garden .  we advise all research students to spend some time there  and reflect upon the manner of his death .       the moon was on the way to being full .  a gibbous moon  it   s called .  it   s one of the duller phases of the moon and seldom gets illustrated .  the full moon and the crescent moon get all the publicity .   rob anybody sat alone on the mound just outside the fake rabbit hole  staring at the distant mountains where the snow on the peaks gleamed in the moonlight .   a hand touched him lightly on the shoulder .         tis not like ye to let someone creep up on ye  rob anybody     said jeannie  sitting down beside him .   rob anybody sighed .      daft wullie was telling me ye havena been eatin    your meals     said jeannie carefully .   rob anybody sighed .      and big yan said when ye wuz out huntin    today  ye let a fox go past wi   out gieing it a good kickin    .      rob sighed again .   there was a faint pop followed by a glugging noise .  jeannie held out a tiny wooden cup .  in her other hand was a small leather bottle .   fumes from the cup wavered in the air .      this is the last o    the special sheep liniment your big wee hag gave us at our wedding     said jeannie .     i put it safely by for emergencies .         she   s no    my big wee hag  jeannie     said rob  without looking at the cup .     she   s oor big wee hag .  an    i   ll tell ye  jeannie  she has it in her tae be the hag o    hags .  there   s power in her she doesna dream of .  but the hiver smells it .         aye  well  a drink   s a drink  whomsoever ye call her     said jeannie soothingly .  she waved the cup under rob   s nose .   he sighed and looked away .   jeannie stood up quickly .     wullie .  big yan .  come quick .     she yelled .     he willna tak    a drink .  i think he   s deid .         ach  this is no    the time for strong licker     said rob anybody .     my heart is heavy  wumman .         quickly now .     jeannie shouted down the hole .     he   s deid and still talkin    .         she   s the hag o    these hills     said rob  ignoring her .     just like her granny .  she tells the hills what they are  every day .  she has them in her bones .  she holds    em in her heart .  wi   out her  i dinna like tae think o    the future .      the other feegles had come scurrying out of the hole and were looking uncertainly at jeannie .      is somethin    wrong .     said daft wullie .      aye .     snapped the kelda .     rob willna tak    a drink o    special sheep liniment .      wullie   s little face screwed up in instant grief .     ach  the big man   s deid .     he sobbed .     oh waily waily waily           will ye hush yer gob  ye big mudlin .     shouted rob anybody  standing up .     i am no    deid .  i   m trying to have a moment o    existential dreed here  right .  crivens  it   s a puir lookout if a man canna feel the chilly winds o    fate lashing aroound his nethers wi   out folks telling him he   s deid  eh .         ach  and i see ye   ve been talking to the toad again  rob     said big yan .     he   s the only one aroound here that used them lang words that tak    all day to walk the length of    .     he turned to jeannie .     it   s a bad case o    the thinkin    he   s caught  missus .  when a man starts messin    wi    the readin    and the writin     then he   ll come doon with a dose o    the thinkin    soon enough .  i   ll fetch some o    the lads and we   ll hold his heid under water until he stops doin    it      tis the only cure .  it can kill a man  the thinkin    .         i   ll wallop ye and ten like ye .     yelled rob anybody in big yan   s face  raising his fists .     i   m the big man in this clan and           and i am the kelda     said their kelda  and one of the hiddlins of keldaring is to use your voice like that  hard  cold  sharp  cutting the air like a dagger of ice .     and i tell you men to go back doon the hole and dinna show your faces back up here until i say .  not you  rob anybody feegle .  you stay here until i tell ye .         oh waily waily       daft wullie began  but big yan clapped a hand over his mouth and dragged him away quickly .   when they were alone  and scraps of cloud were beginning to mass around the moon  rob anybody hung his head .      i willna go  jeannie  if you say     he said .      ach  rob  rob     said jeannie  beginning to cry .     ye dinna understand .  i want no harm to come to the big wee girl  truly i don   t .  but i canna face thinkin    o    you out there fightin    this monster that canna be killed .  it   s you i   m worried aboot  can ye no    see .      rob put his arm around her .     aye  i see     he said .      i   m your wife  rob  askin    ye not to go .         aye  aye .  i   ll stay     said rob .   jeannie looked up to him .  tears shone in the moonlight .     ye mean it .         i never braked my word yet     said rob .     except to polis   men and other o    that kidney  ye ken  and they dinna count .         ye   ll stay .  ye   ll abide by my word .     said jeannie  sniffing .   rob sighed .     aye .  i will .      jeannie was quiet for a while and then said  in the sharp cold voice of a kelda     rob anybody feegle  i   m tellin    ye now to go and save the big wee hag .         whut .     said rob anybody  amazed .     jus    noo ye said i was tae stay           that was as your wife  rob .  now i   m telling you as your kelda .     jeannie stood up  chin out and looking determined .     if ye dinna heed the world o    yer kelda  rob anybody feegle  ye can be banished fra    the clan .  ye ken that .  so you   ll listen t    me guid .  tak    what men you need afore it   s too late  and go to the mountains  and see that the big wee girl comes tae nae harm .  and come back safe yoursel    .  that is an order .  nay     tis more   n an order .     tis a geas i   m laying on ye .  that cannae be brake .         but i       rob began  completely bewildered .      i   m the kelda  rob     said jeannie .     i canna run a clan with the big man pinin    .  and the hills of our children need their hag .  everyone knows the land needs someone tae tell it whut it is .      there was something about the way jeannie had said    children .     rob anybody was not the fastest of thinkers  but he always got there in the end .      aye  rob     said jeannie  seeing his expression .     soon i   ll be birthing seven sons .         oh     said rob anybody .  he didn   t ask how she knew the number .  keldas just knew .      that   s great .     he said .      and one daughter  rob .      rob blinked .      a daughter .  this soon .         aye     said jeannie .      that   s wonderful good luck for a clan .     said rob .      aye .  so you   ve got something to come back safe to me for  rob anybody .  an    i beg ye to use your heid for somethin    other than nuttin    folk .         i thank ye  kelda     said rob anybody .     i   ll do as ye bid .  i   ll tak    some lads and find the big wee hag  for the good o    the hills .  it canna be a good life for the puir wee big wee thing  all alone and far fra    home  among strangers .         aye     said jeannie  turning her face away .     i ken that  too .          chapter        the pln      at dawn rob anybody  watched with awe by his many brothers  wrote the word   pln     on a scrap of paper bag .  then he held it up .      plan  ye ken     he said to the assembled feegles .     now we have a plan  all we got tae do is work out what tae do .  yes  wullie .         whut was that about this geese jeannie hit ye with .     said daft wullie  lowering his hand .      not geese  geas     said rob anybody .  he sighed .     i told yez .  that means it   s serious .  it means i got tae bring back the big wee hag  an    no excuses  otherwise my soul gaes slam bang intae the big cludgie in the sky .  it   s like a magical order .     tis a heavy thing  tae be under a geas .         well  they   re big birds     said daft wullie .      wullie     said rob  patiently     ye ken i said i would tell ye when there wuz times you should   ve kept your big gob shut .         aye  rob .         weel  that wuz one o    them times .     he raised his voice .     now  lads  ye ken all aboot hivers .  they cannae be killed .  but    tis oor duty to save the big wee hag  so this is  like  a sooey side mission and ye   ll probably all end up back in the land o    the living doin    a borin    wee job .  so   i   m askin    for volunteers .      every feegle over the age of four automatically put his hand up .      oh  come on     said rob .     you canna all come .  look  i   ll tak      daft wullie  big yan  and   you  awf   ly wee billy bigchin .  an    i   m takin    no weans  so if yez under three inches high  ye   re not comin    .  except for ye  o   course  awf   ly wee billy .  as for the rest of youse  we   ll settle this the traditional feegle way .  i   ll tak    the last fifty men still standing .      he beckoned the chosen three to a place in the corner of the mound while the rest of the crowd squared up cheerfully .  a feegle liked to face enormous odds all by himself  because it meant you didn   t have to look where you were hitting .      she   s more   n a hundret miles awa        said rob as the big fight started .     we canna run it      tis too far .  any of youse scunners got any ideas .         hamish can get there on his buzzard     said big yan  stepping aside as a cluster of punching  kicking feegles rolled past .      aye  and he   ll come wi    us  but he canna tak    more   n one passenger     shouted rob over the din .      can we swim it .     said daft wullie  ducking as a stunned feegle hurtled over his head .   the others looked at him .     swim it .  how can we swim there fra    here  yer daftie .     said rob anybody .      it   s just worth consid   ring  that   s all     said wullie  looking hurt .     i wuz just tryin    to make a contribution  ye ken .  just wanted to show willin    .         the big wee hag left in a cart     said big yan .      aye  so what .     said rob .      weel  mebbe we could .         ach  no .     said rob .     showin    oursels tae hags is one thing  but not to other folks .  you remember what happened a few years back when daft wullie got spotted by that lady who wuz painting the pretty pichoors doon in the valley .  i dinna want to have them folklore society bigjobs pokin    aroound again .         i have an idea  mister rob .  it   s me  awf   ly wee billy bigchin mac feegle .  we could disguise oursels .      awf   ly wee billy bigchin mac feegle always announced himself in full .  he seemed to feel that if he didn   t tell people who he was  they   d forget about him and he   d disappear .  when you   re half the size of most grown pictsies  you   re really short  much shorter and you   d be a hole in the ground .   he was the new gonnagle .  a gonnagle is the clan   s bard and battle poet  but they don   t spend all their lives in the same clan .  in fact  they   re a sort of clan all by themselves .  gonnagles move around among the other clans  making sure the songs and stories get spread around all the feegles .  awf   ly wee billy had come with jeannie from the long lake clan  which often happens .  he was very young for a gonnagle  but as jeannie had said  there was no age limit to gonnagling .  if the talent was in you  you gonnagled .  and awf   ly wee billy knew all the songs and could play the mousepipes so sadly that outside it would start to rain .      aye  lad .     said rob anybody  kindly .     speak up  then .         can we get hold o    some human clothes .     said awf   ly wee billy .     because there   s an old story about the big feud between the three peaks clan and the windy river clan and the windy river boys escaped by making a tattiebogle walk  and the men o    three peaks thought it was a bigjob and kept oot o    its way .      the others looked puzzled  and awf   ly wee billy remembered that they were men of the chalk and had probably never seen a tattiebogle .      a scarecrow .     he said .     it   s like a bigjob made o    sticks  wi    clothes on  for to frighten away the birdies fra    the crops .  now  the song says the windy river   s kelda used magic to make it walk  but i reckon it was done by cunnin    and strength .      he sang about it .  they listened .   he explained how to make a human that would walk .  they looked at one another .  it was a mad  desperate plan  which was very dangerous and risky and would require tremendous strength and bravery to make it work .   put like that  they agreed to it instantly .       tiffany found that there was more than chores and the research  though .  there was what miss level called    filling what   s empty and emptying what   s full .      usually only one of miss level   s bodies went out at a time .  people thought miss level was twins  and she made sure they continued to do so  but she found it a little bit safer all around to keep the bodies apart .  tiffany could see why .  you only had to watch both of miss level when she was eating .  the bodies would pass plates to one another without saying a word  sometimes they   d eat off one another   s forks  and it was rather strange to see one person burp and the other one say    oops  pardon me .         filling what   s empty and emptying what   s full    meant wandering around the local villages and the isolated farms and  mostly  doing medicine .  there were always bandages to change or expectant mothers to talk to .  witches did a lot of midwifery  which is a kind of    emptying what   s full     but miss level wearing her pointy hat had only to turn up at a cottage for other people to suddenly come visiting  by sheer accident .  and there was an awful lot of gossip and tea drinking .  miss level moved in a twitching  living world of gossip  although tiffany noticed that she picked up a lot more than she passed on .   it seemed to be a world made up entirely of women  but occasionally  out in the lanes  a man would strike up a conversation about the weather and somehow  by some sort of code  an ointment or a potion would get handed over .   tiffany couldn   t quite work out how miss level got paid .  certainly the basket she carried filled up more than it emptied .  they   d walk past a cottage and a woman would come scurrying out with a fresh baked loaf or a jar of pickles  even though miss level hadn   t stopped there .  but they   d spend an hour somewhere else  stitching up the leg of a farmer who   d been careless with an axe  and get a cup of tea and a stale biscuit .  it didn   t seem fair .      oh  it evens out     said miss level  as they walked on through the woods .     you do what you can .  people give what they can  when they can .  old slapwick there  with the leg  he   s as mean as a cat  but there   ll be a big cut of beef on my doorstep before the week   s end  you can bet on it .  his wife will see to it .  and pretty soon people will be killing their pigs for the winter  and i   ll get more lard  ham  bacon  and sausages turning up than a family could eat in a year .         you will .  what do you do with all that food .         store it     said miss level .      but you           i store it in other people .  it   s amazing what you can store in other people .     miss level laughed at tiffany   s expression .     i mean  i take what i don   t need around to those who don   t have a pig  or who   re going through a bad patch  or who don   t have anyone to remember them .         but that means they   ll owe you a favor .         right .  and so it just keeps on going around .  it all works out .         i bet some people are too mean to pay           not pay     said miss level  severely .     a witch never expects payment and never asks for it and just hopes she never needs to .  but sadly  you are right .         and then what happens .         what do you mean .         you stop helping them  do you .         oh  no     said miss level  genuinely shocked .     you can   t not help people just because they   re stupid or forgetful or unpleasant .  everyone   s poor around here .  if i don   t help them  who will .         granny aching   that is  my grandmother said someone has to speak up for them as has no voices     tiffany volunteered after a moment .      was she a witch .         i   m not sure     said tiffany .     i think so  but she didn   t know she was .  she mostly lived by herself in an old shepherding hut up on the downs .         she wasn   t a cackler  was she .     said miss level  and when she saw tiffany   s expression she said hurriedly     sorry  sorry .  but it can happen  when you   re a witch who doesn   t know it .  you   re like a ship with no rudder .  but obviously she wasn   t like that  i can tell .         she lived on the hills and talked to them  and she knew more about sheep than anybody .     said tiffany hotly .      i   m sure she did  i   m sure she did           she never cackled .         good  good     said miss level soothingly .     was she clever at medicine .      tiffany hesitated .     um   only with sheep     she said  calming down .     but she was very good .  especially if it involved turpentine .  mostly if it involved turpentine  actually .  but always she   was   just   there .  even when she wasn   t actually there    .         yes     said miss level .      you know what i mean .     said tiffany .      oh  yes     said miss level .     your granny aching lived down on the uplands           no  up on the downland     tiffany corrected her .      sorry  up on the downland  with the sheep  but people would look up sometimes  look up at the hills  knowing she was there somewhere  and say to themselves     what would granny aching do .     or    what would granny aching say if she found out .     or    is this the sort of thing granny aching would be angry about .        said miss level .     yes .      tiffany narrowed her eyes .  it was true .  she remembered when granny aching had hit a peddler who   d overloaded his donkey and was beating it .  granny usually used only words  and not many of them .  the man had been so frightened by her sudden rage that he   d stood there and taken it .   it had frightened tiffany  too .  granny  who seldom said anything without thinking about it for ten minutes beforehand  had struck the wretched man twice across the face in a brief blur of movement .  and then news had got around  all along the chalk .  for a while  at least  people were a little more gentle with their animals .  for months after that moment with the peddler  carters and drovers and farmers all across the downs would hesitate before raising a whip or a stick  and think  suppose granny aching is watching .   but        how did you know that .     tiffany asked .      oh  i guessed .  she sounds like a witch to me  whatever she thought she was .  a good one  too .      tiffany inflated with inherited pride .      did she help people .     miss level added .   the pride deflated a bit .  the instant answer    yes    jumped onto her tongue  and yet   granny aching hardly ever came down off the hills  except for hogswatch and the early lambing .  you seldom saw her in the village unless the peddler who sold jolly sailor tobacco was late on his rounds  in which case she   d be down in a hurry and a flurry of greasy black skirts to cadge a pipeful off one of the old men .   but there wasn   t a person on the chalk  from the baron down  who didn   t owe something to granny .  and what they owed to her  she made them pay to others .  she always knew who was short of a favor or two .      she made them help one another     she said .     she made them help themselves .      in the silence that followed  tiffany heard the birds singing by the road .  you got a lot of birds here  but she missed the high scream of the buzzards .   miss level sighed .     not many of us are that good     she said .     if i was that good  we wouldn   t be going to visit old mr .  weavall again .      tiffany said    oh dear    inside .   most days included a visit to mr .  weavall .  tiffany dreaded them .   mr .  weavall   s skin was paper thin and yellowish .  he was always in the same old armchair  in a tiny room in a small cottage that smelled of old potatoes and was surrounded by a more or less overgrown garden .  he   d be sitting bolt upright  his hands on two walking sticks  wearing a suit that was shiny with age  staring at the door .      i make sure he has something hot every day  although he eats like a bird     miss level had said .     and old widow tussy down the lane does his laundry  such as it is .  he   s ninety one  you know .      mr .  weavall had very bright eyes and chatted away to and at them as they tidied up the room .  the first time tiffany had met him  he   d called her mary .  sometimes he still did so .  and he   d grabbed her wrist with surprising force as she walked past    .  it had been a real shock  that claw of a hand suddenly gripping her .  you could see blue veins under the skin .      i shan   t be a burden on anyone     he   d said urgently .     i got money put by for when i go .  my boy  toby  won   t have nothin    to worry about .  i can pay my way .  i want the proper funeral show  right .  with the black horses and the plumes and the mutes and a knife and fork tea for everyone afterward  i   ve written it all down  fair and square .  check in my box to make sure  will you .  that witch woman   s always hanging around here .      tiffany had given miss level a despairing look .  she   d nodded and pointed to an old wooden box tucked under mr .  weavall   s chair .   it had turned out to be full of coins  mostly copper  but there were quite a few silver ones .  it looked like a fortune  and for a moment tiffany   d wished she had as much money .      there   s a lot of coins in here  mr .  weavall     she   d said .   mr .  weavall relaxed .     ah  that   s right     he   d said .     then i won   t be a burden .      today mr .  weavall was asleep when they called on him  snoring with his mouth open and his yellow brown teeth showing .  but he awoke in an instant  stared at them  and then said     my boy toby   s coming to see i sat   day .         that   s nice  mr .  weavall     said miss level  plumping up his cushions .     we   ll get the place nice and tidy .         he   s done very well for hisself  you know     said mr .  weavall proudly .     got a job indoors with no heavy lifting .  he said he   ll see i all right in my old age  but i told him  i told him i   d pay my way when i go  the whole thing  the salt and earth and tuppence for the ferryman  too .      today miss level gave him a shave .  his hands shook too much for him to do it himself .   yesterday she   d cut his toenails  because he couldn   t reach them  it was not a safe spectator sport  especially when one smashed a windowpane .       it   s all in a box under my chair     he said as tiffany nervously wiped the last bits of foam off him .     just check for me  will you  mary .      oh  yes .  that was the ceremony  every day .   there was the box  and there was the money .  he asked every time .  there was always the same amount of money .      tuppence for the ferryman .     said tiffany  as they walked home .      mr .  weavall remembers all the old funeral traditions     said miss level .     some people believe that when you die  you cross the river of death and have to pay the ferryman .  people don   t seem to worry about that these days .  perhaps there   s a bridge now .         he   s always talking about   his funeral .         well  it   s important to him .  sometimes old people are like that .  they   d hate people to think that they were too poor to pay for their own funeral .  mr .  weavall   d die of shame if he couldn   t pay for his own funeral .         it   s very sad  him being all alone like that .  something should be done for him     said tiffany .      yes .  we   re doing it     said miss level .     and mrs .  tussy keeps a friendly eye on him .         yes  but it shouldn   t have to be us  should it .         who should it have to be .     said miss level .      well  what about this son he   s always talking about .     said tiffany .      young toby .  he   s been dead for fifteen years .  and mary was the old man   s daughter  she died quite young .  mr .  weavall is very shortsighted  but he sees better in the past .      tiffany didn   t know what to reply except     it shouldn   t be like this .         there isn   t a way things should be .  there   s just what happens  and what we do .         well  couldn   t you help him by magic .         i see to it that he   s in no pain  yes     said miss level .      but that   s just herbs .         it   s still magic .  knowing things is magical  if other people don   t know them .         yes  but you know what i mean     said tiffany  who felt she was losing this argument .      oh  you mean make him young again .     said miss level .     fill his house with gold .  that   s not what witches do .         we see to it that lonely old men get a cooked dinner and cut their toenails .     said tiffany  just a little sarcastically .      well  yes     said miss level .     we do what can be done .  mistress weatherwax said you   ve got to learn that witchcraft is mostly about doing quite ordinary things .         and you have to do what she says .     said tiffany .      i listen to her advice     said miss level coldly .      mistress weatherwax is the head witch  then  is she .         oh no .     said miss level  looking shocked .     witches are all equal .  we don   t have things like head witches .  that   s quite against the spirit of witchcraft .         oh  i see     said tiffany .      besides     miss level added     mistress weatherwax would never allow that sort of thing .          suddenly  things were going missing from the households around the chalk .  this wasn   t the occasional egg or chicken .  clothes were vanishing off washing lines .  a pair of boots mysteriously disappeared from under the bed of nosey hinds  the oldest man in the village      and they was damn good boots  they could walk home from the pub all by themselves if i but pointed they in the right direction     he complained to anyone who would listen .     and they marched off wi    my old hat  too .  and i   d got he just as i wanted he  all soft and floppy .      a pair of trousers and a long coat vanished from a hook belonging to abiding swindell  the ferret keeper  and the coat still had ferrets living in the inside pockets .  and who  who climbed through the bedroom window of clem doins and shaved off his beard  which had been so long that he could tuck it into his belt .  not a hair was left .  he had to go around with a scarf over his face  in case the sight of his poor pink chin frightened the ladies .   it was probably witches  people agreed  and made a few more curse nets to hang in their windows .   however     on the far side of the chalk  where the long green slopes came down to the flat fields of the plain  there were big thickets of bramble and hawthorn .  usually  these were alive with birdsong  but this particular one  the one just here  was alive with cussing .      ach  crivens .  will ye no    mind where ye   re puttin    yer foot  ye spavie .         i canna help it .  it   s nae easy  bein    a knee .         ye think ye got troubles .  ye wanna be doon here in the boots .  that old man swindell couldnae ha    washed his feet in years .  it   s fair reekin    doon here .         reekin     izzit .  well  you try bein    in this pocket .  them ferrets ne   er got oot to gae to the lavie  if you get my meanin    .         crivens .  will ye dafties no    shut up .         oh  aye .  hark at him .  just    cuz ye   re up in the heid  you think you know everythin    .  fra    doon here ye   re nothing but deid weight  pal .         aye  right .  i   m wi   the elbows on this one .  where   d you be if it wuzn   t for us carryin    ye aroound .  who   s ye think ye are .         i   m rob anybody feegle  as you ken well enough  an    i   ve had enough o    the lot o    yez .         okay  rob  but it   s real stuffy in here .         ach  an    i   m fed up wi    the stomach complainin     too .         gentlemen .     this was the voice of the toad  no one else would dream of calling the nac mac feegle gentlemen .     gentlemen  time is of the essence .  the cart will be here soon .  you must not miss it .         we need more time to practice  toad .  we   re walkin    like a feller wi    nae bones and a serious case o    the trots .     said a voice a little higher up than the rest .      at least you are walking .  that   s good enough .  i wish you luck  gentlemen .      there was a cry from farther along the thickets  where a lookout had been watching the road .      the cart   s comin    doon the hill .         okay  lads .     shouted rob anybody .     toad  you look after jeannie  y   hear .  she   ll need a thinkin    laddie to rely on while i   m no    here .  right  ye scunners .  it   s do or die .  ye ken what to do .  ye lads on the ropes  pull us up noo .     the bushes shook .     right .  pelvis  are ye ready .         aye  rob .         knees .  knees .  i said  knees .         aye  rob  but           feets .         aye  rob .      the bushes shook again .      right .  remember  right  left  right  left .  pelvis  knee  foot on the groound .  keep a spring in the step  feets .  are you ready .  all together  boys   walk .      it was a big surprise for mr .  crabber  the carter .  he   d been staring vaguely at nothing  thinking only of going home  when something stepped out of the bushes and into the road .  it looked human or  rather  it looked slightly more human than it looked like anything else .  but it seemed to be having trouble with its knees  and walked as though they   d been tied together .   however  the carter didn   t spend too much time thinking about that because  clutched in one gloved hand that was waving vaguely in the air  was something gold .   this immediately identified the stranger  as far as the carter was concerned .  he was not  as first sight might suggest  some old tramp to be left by the roadside  but an obvious gentleman down on his luck  and it was practically the carter   s duty to help him .  he slowed the horse to a standstill .   the stranger didn   t really have a face .  there was nothing much to see between the droopy hat brim and the turned up collar of the coat except a lot of beard .  but from somewhere within the beard a voice said         shudupshudup   will ye all shudup while i   m talkin       .       ahem .  good day ta    ye  carter fellow my ol    fellowy fellow .  if ye   ll gie us   me a lift as far as yer are goin     we   i   ll gie ye this fine shiny golden coin .      the figure lurched forward and thrust its hand in front of mr .  crabber   s face .   it was quite a large coin .  and it was certainly gold .  it had come from the treasure of the old dead king who was buried in the main part of the feegles    mound .  oddly enough  the feegles weren   t hugely interested in gold once they   d stolen it  because you couldn   t drink it and it was difficult to eat .  in the mound  they mostly used the old coins and plates to reflect candlelight and give the place a nice glow .  it was no hardship to give some away .   the carter stared at it .  it was more money than he had ever seen in his life .      if   sir   would like to   hop on the back of the cart  sir     he said  carefully taking it .      ach  right you are  then     said the bearded mystery man after a pause .     just a moment  this needs a wee bitty organizin      okay  youse hands  you just grab the side o    the cart  and you leftie leg  ye gotta kinda sidle along   ach  crivens .  ye gotta bend .  bend .  c   mon  get it right .     the hairy face turned to the carter .     sorry aboot this     it said .     i talk to my knees  but they dinna listen to me .         is that right .     said the carter weakly .     i have trouble with my knees in the wet weather .  goose grease works .         ah  weel  these knees is gonna get more   n a greasin    if i ha    to get doon there an    sort them oot .     snarled the hairy man .   the carter heard various bangs and grunts behind him as the man hauled himself onto the tail of the cart .      okay  let   s gae     said a voice .     we havena got all day .  and youse knees  you   re sacked .  crivens  i   m walkin    like i got a big touch of the stoppies .  you gae up to the stomach and send doon a couple of good knee men .      the carter bit the coin thoughtfully as he urged the horse into a walk .  it was such pure gold that he left toothmarks .  that meant his passenger was very  very rich .  that was becoming very important at this point .      can ye no    go a wee bitty faster  my good man  my good man .     said the voice behind him  after they had gone a little way .      ah  well  sir     said the carter     see them boxes and crates .  i   ve got a load of eggs  and those apples mustn   t be bruised  sir  and then there   s those jugs of        there were some bangs and crashes behind him  including the sploosh that a large crate of eggs makes when it hits a road .      ye can gae faster noo  eh .     said the voice .      hey  that was my       mr .  crabber began .      i   ve got another one o    they big wee gold coins for ye .     and a heavy and smelly arm landed on the carter   s shoulder .  dangling from the glove on the end of it was  indeed  another coin .  it was ten times what the load had been worth .      oh  well       said the carter  carefully taking the coin .     accidents do happen  eh  sir .         aye  especially if i dinna think i   m goin    fast enough     said the voice behind him .     we   i mean i   m a big hurry tae get tae yon mountains  ye ken .         but i   m not a stagecoach  sir     said the carter reproachfully as he urged his old horse into a trot .      stagecoach  eh .  what   s one o    them things .         that   s what you   ll need to catch to take you up into the mountains  sir .  you can catch one in twoshirts  sir .  i never go any farther than twoshirts  sir .  but you won   t be able to get the stage today  sir .         why not .         i   ve got to make stops at the other villages  sir  and it   s a long way  and on wednesdays it runs early  sir  and this cart can only go so fast  sir  and           if we   i dinna catch yon coach today i   ll gie    ye the hidin    o    yer life     growled the passenger .     but if i do catch yon coach today  i   ll gie ye five o    them gold coins .      mr .  crabber took a deep breath  and yelled      hi .  hyah .  giddyup  henry .          all in all  it seemed to tiffany  most of what witches did really was very similar to work .  dull work .  miss level didn   t even use her broomstick very much .   that was a bit depressing .  it was all a bit   well  goody goody .  obviously that was better than being baddy baddy  but a little more   excitement would be nice .  tiffany wouldn   t like anyone to think she   d expected to be issued with a magic wand on day one but  well  the way miss level talked about magic  the whole point of witchcraft lay in not using any .   mind you  tiffany thought she would be depressingly good at not using any .  it was doing the simplest magic that was hard .   miss level patiently showed her how to make a shamble  which could more or less be made of anything that seemed a good idea at the time provided it also contained something alive  like a beetle or a fresh egg .   tiffany couldn   t get the hang of it .  that was   annoying .  didn   t she have the virtual hat .  didn   t she have first sight and second thoughts .  miss tick and miss level could throw a shamble together in seconds  but tiffany just got a tangle  dripping with egg .  over and over again .      i know i   m doing it right  but it just twists up .     tiffany complained .     what can i do .         we could make an omelette .     said miss level cheerfully .      oh  please  miss level .     tiffany wailed .   miss level patted her on the back .     it   ll happen .  perhaps you   re trying too hard .  one day it   ll come .  the power does come  you know .  you just have to put yourself in its path .         couldn   t you make one that i could use for a while  to get the hang of it .         i   m afraid i can   t     said miss level .     a shamble is a very tricky thing .  you can   t even carry one around  except as an ornament .  you have to make it for yourself  there and then  right where and when you want to use it .         why .     said tiffany .      to catch the moment     said the other part of miss level  coming in .     the way you tie the knots  the way the string runs              the freshness of the egg  perhaps  and the moisture in the air       said the first miss level .         the tension of the twigs and the kinds of things that you just happen to have in your pocket at that moment              even the way the wind is blowing     the first miss level concluded .     all these things make a kind of   of picture of the here and now when you move them right .  and i can   t tell you how to move them  because i don   t know .         but you do move them     said tiffany  getting lost .     i saw you           i do it but i don   t know how i do     said miss level  picking up a couple of twigs and taking a length of thread .  miss level sat down at the table opposite miss level  and all four hands started to put a shamble together .      this reminds me of when i was in the circus     she said .     i was              walking out for a while with marco and falco  the flying pastrami brothers     the other part of miss level went on .     they would do              triple somersaults fifty feet up with no safety net .  what lads they were .  as alike as two              peas  and marco could catch falco blindfolded .  why  for a moment i wondered if they were just like me        she stopped  went a bit red on both faces  and coughed .     anyway     she went on     one day i asked them how they managed to stay on the high wire  and falco said     never ask the tightrope walker how he keeps his balance .  if he stops to think about it  he falls off .     although actually              he said it like this     nev ah aska tightaropa walkera       because the lads pretended they were from brindisi  you see  because that sounds foreign and impressive and they thought no one would want to watch acrobats called the flying sidney and frank cartwright .  good advice  though  wherever it came from .      the hands worked .  this was not a lone miss level  a bit flustered  but the full miss level  all twenty fingers working together .      of course     she said     it can be helpful to have the right sort of things in your pocket .  i always carry a few sequins              for the happy memories they bring back     said miss level from the other side of the table  blushing again .   she held up the shamble .  there were sequins  and a fresh egg in a little bag made of thread  and a chicken bone and many other things hanging or spinning in the threads .   each part of miss level put both its hands into the threads and pulled    .   the threads took up a pattern .  did the sequins jump from one thread to another .  it looked like it .  did the chicken bone pass through the egg .  so it seemed .   miss level peered into it .   she said     something   s coming    .          the stagecoach left twoshirts half full and was well out over the plains when one of the passengers sitting on the rooftop tapped the driver on the shoulder .      excuse me  did you know there   s something trying to catch up to us .     he said .      bless you  sir     said the driver  because he hoped for a good tip at the end of the run     there   s nothing that can catch up to us .      then he heard the screaming in the distance  getting louder .      er  i think he means to     said the passenger as the carter   s wagon caught up to them .      stop .  stop  for pity   s sake  stop .     yelled the carter as he sailed past .   but there was no stopping henry .  he   d spent years pulling the carrier   s cart around the villages  very slowly  and he   d always had this idea in his big horse head that he was cut out for faster things .  he   d plodded along  being overtaken by coaches and carts and three legged dogs  and now he was having the time of his life .   besides  the cart was a lot lighter than usual  and the road was slightly downhill here .  all he was really having to do was gallop fast enough to stay in front .  and finally he   d nearly overtaken the stagecoach .  him  henry .   he only stopped because the stagecoach driver stopped first .  besides  the blood was pumping through henry now  and there were a couple of mares in the team of horses pulling the coach who he felt he   d really like to get to know   find out when was their day off  what kind of hay they liked  that kind of thing .   the carter  white in the face  got down carefully and then lay on the ground and held on tight to the dirt .   his one passenger  who looked to the coach driver like some sort of scarecrow  climbed unsteadily down from the back and lurched toward the coach .      i   m sorry  we   re full up     the driver lied .  they weren   t full  but there was certainly no room for a thing that looked like that .      ach  and there wuz me willin    to pay wi    gold     said the creature .     gold such as this here     it added  waving a ragged glove in the air .   suddenly there was plenty of space for an eccentric millionaire .  within a few seconds he was seated inside  and to the annoyance of henry  the coach set off again .       outside miss level   s cottage a broomstick was heading through the trees .  a young witch   or at least  someone dressed as a witch  it never paid to jump to conclusions   was sitting on it sidesaddle .   she wasn   t flying it very well .  it jerked sometimes  and it was clear the girl was no good at making it turn corners  because sometimes she stopped  jumped off  and pointed the stick in a new direction by hand .  when she reached the garden gate  she got off again quickly and tethered the stick to it with string .      nicely done  petulia .     said miss level  clapping with all four hands .     you   re getting quite good .         um  thank you  miss level     said the girl  bowing .  she stayed bowed  and said     um  oh dear        half of miss level stepped forward .      oh  i can see the problem     she said  peering down .     your amulet with the little owls on it is tangled up with your necklace of silver bats  and they   ve both got caught around a button .  just hold still  will you .         um  i   ve come to see if your new girl would like come to the sabbat tonight     said the bent petulia  her voice a bit muffled .   tiffany couldn   t help noticing that petulia had jewelry everywhere  later she found that it was hard to be around petulia for any length of time without having to unhook a bangle from a necklace or  once  an earring from an ankle bracelet  nobody ever found out how that one happened  .  petulia couldn   t resist occult jewelry .  most of the stuff was to magically protect her from things  but she hadn   t found anything to protect her from looking a bit silly .   she was short and plump and permanently red faced and slightly worried .      sabbat .  oh  one of your meetings     said miss level .     that would be nice  wouldn   t it  tiffany .         yes .     said tiffany  not quite sure yet .      some of the girls meet up in the woods in the evenings     said miss level .     for some reason the craft is getting popular again .  that   s very welcome  of course .      she said it as if she wasn   t quite sure .  then she added     petulia here works for old mother blackcap  over in sidling without .  specializes in animals .  very good woman with pig diseases .  i mean  with pigs that   ve got diseases  i don   t mean she has pig diseases .  it   ll be nice for you to have friends here .  why don   t you go .  there  everything   s unhooked .      petulia stood up and gave tiffany a worried smile .      um  petulia gristle     she said  holding out a hand .      tiffany aching     said tiffany  shaking it gingerly in case the sound of all the bangles and bracelets jangling together deafened everyone .      um  you can ride with me on the broomstick  if you like     said petulia .      i   d rather not     said tiffany .  petulia looked relieved but said     um  do you want to get dressed .      tiffany looked down at her green dress .     i am .         um  don   t you have any gems or beads or amulets or anything .         no  sorry     said tiffany .      um  you must at least have a shamble  surely .         um  can   t get the hang of them     said tiffany .  she hadn   t meant the    um     but around petulia it was catching .      um   a black dress  perhaps .         i don   t really like black .  i prefer blue or green     said tiffany .     um           um .  oh well  you   re just starting     said petulia generously .     i   ve been crafty for three years .      tiffany looked desperately at the nearest half of miss level .      in the craft     said miss level helpfully .     witchcraft .         oh .     tiffany knew she was being very unfriendly  and petulia with her pink face was clearly a nice person  but she felt awkward in front of her and she couldn   t work out why .  it was stupid  she knew .  she could do with a friend .  miss level was nice enough  and she managed to get along with oswald  but it would be good to have someone around her own age to talk to .      well  i   d love to come     she said .     i know i   ve got a lot to learn .          the passengers inside the stagecoach had paid good money to be inside on the soft seats and out of the wind and the dust  and therefore it was odd that so many got out at the next stop and went and sat on the roof .   the few who didn   t want to ride up there or couldn   t manage the climb sat huddled together on the seat opposite  watching the new traveler like a group of rabbits watching a fox and trying not to breathe .   the problem wasn   t that he smelled of ferrets .  well  that was a problem  but compared to the big problem it wasn   t much of one .  he talked to himself .  that is  bits of him talked to other bits of him .  all the time .      ah  it   s fair boggin    doon here .  ah   m tellin ye .  ah   m sure it   s my turn to be up inna heid .         hah  at leas    youse people are all cushy in the stomach   it   s us in the legs that has tae do all the work .      at which the right hand said     legs .  youse dinna know the meanin    of the word    work    .  ye ought tae try being stuck in a glove .  ach  blow this for a game o    sojers .  ah   m gonna stretch ma legs .      in horrified silence the other passengers watched one of the man   s gloved hands drop off and walk around on the seat .      aye  weel  it   s nae picnic doon here inna troosers  neither .  a   m gonna let some fresh air in right noo .         daft wullie  don   t you dare do that        the passengers  squeezing even closer together  watched the trousers with terrible fascination .  there was some movement  some swearing under the breath in a place where nothing should be breathing  and then a couple of buttons popped and a very small red headed blue man stuck his head out  blinking in the light .   he froze when he saw the people .   he stared .   they stared .   then his face widened into a mad smile .      youse folks all right .     he said  desperately .     that   s greaaat .  dinna worry aboout me   i   m one o    they opper tickle aloosyon   s  ye ken .      he disappeared back into the trousers  and they heard him whisper     i   m thinkin    i fooled    em easily  no problemo .      a few minutes later the coach stopped to change horses .  when it set off again  it was minus the inside passengers .  they got off  and asked for their luggage to be taken off  too .  no thank you  they did not want to continue their ride .  they   d catch the coach tomorrow  thank you .  no  there was no problem in waiting here in this delightful little  er  town of dangerous corner .  thank you .  good bye .   the coach set off again  somewhat lighter and faster .  it didn   t stop that night .  it should have done so  and the rooftop passengers were still eating their dinner in the last inn when they heard it set off without them .  the reason probably had something to do with the big heap of coins now in the driver   s pocket .       chapter        the circle      tiffany walked through the woods while petulia flew unsteadily alongside in a series of straight lines .  tiffany learned that petulia was nice  had three brothers  wanted to be a midwife for humans as well as pigs when she grew up  and was afraid of pins .  she also learned that petulia hated to disagree about anything .   so parts of the conversation went like this   tiffany said     i live down on the chalk .      and petulia said     oh  where they keep all those sheep .  i don   t like sheep much   they   re so kind of   baggy .      tiffany said     actually  we   re very proud of our sheep .      and then you could stand back as petulia reversed her opinions like someone trying to turn a cart around in a very narrow space     oh  i didn   t really mean i hate them .  i expect some sheep are all right .  we   ve got to have sheep  obviously .  they   re better than goats  and woolier .  i mean i actually like sheep  really .  sheep are nice .      petulia spent a lot of time trying to find out what other people thought so that she could think the same way .  it would be impossible to have an argument with her .  tiffany had to stop herself from saying    the sky is green    just to see how long it would take for petulia to agree .  but she liked her .  you couldn   t not like her .  she was restful company .  besides  you couldn   t help liking someone who couldn   t make a broomstick turn corners .   it was a long walk through the woods .  tiffany had always wanted to see a forest so big that you couldn   t see daylight through the other side  but now that she   d lived in one for a couple of weeks  it got on her nerves .  it was quite open woodland here  at least around the villages  and not hard to walk through .  she   d had to learn what maples and birches were  and she   d never before seen the spruces and firs that grew higher up the slopes .  but she wasn   t happy in the company of trees .  she missed the horizons .  she missed the sky .  everything was too close .   petulia chattered nervously .  old mother blackcap was a pig borer  cow shouter  and all around veterinary witch .  petulia liked animals  especially pigs  because they had wobbly noses .  tiffany quite liked animals too  but no one except other animals liked animals as much as petulia .      so   what   s this meeting about .     she said  to change the subject .      um .  oh  it   s just to keep in touch     said petulia .     annagramma says it   s important to make contacts .         annagramma   s the leader  then  is she .     said tiffany .      um  no .  witches don   t have leaders  annagramma says .         hmm     said tiffany .   they arrived at last at a clearing in the woods  just as the sun was setting .  there were the remains of an old cottage there  now covered mostly in brambles .  you might miss it completely if you didn   t spot the rampant growth of lilac and the gooseberry bushes  now a forest of thorns .  someone had lived here once  and had had a garden .   someone else  now  had lit a fire .  badly .  and they had found that lying down flat to blow on a fire because you hadn   t started it with enough paper and dry twigs was not a good idea  because it would then cause your pointy hat  which you had forgotten to take off  to fall into the smoking mess and then  because it was dry  catch fire .   a young witch was now flailing desperately at her burning hat  watched by several interested spectators .   another one  sitting on a log  said     dimity hubbub  that is literally the most stupid thing anyone has ever done anywhere in the whole world  ever .     it was a sharp  not very nice voice  the sort most people used for being sarcastic with .      sorry  annagramma .     said miss hubbub  pulling off the hat and stamping on the point .      i mean  just look at you  will you .  you really are letting everyone down .         sorry  annagramma .         um     said petulia .   everyone turned to look at the new arrivals .      you   re late  petulia gristle .     snapped annagramma  and who   s this .         um  you did ask me to stop in at miss level   s to bring the new girl  annagramma     said petulia  as if she   d been caught doing something wrong .   annagramma stood up .  she was at least a head taller than tiffany and had a face that seemed to be built backward from her nose  which she held slightly in the air .  to be looked at by annagramma was to know that you   d already taken up too much of her valuable time .      is this her .         um  yes  annagramma .         let   s have a look at you  new girl .      tiffany stepped forward .  it was amazing .  she hadn   t really meant to .  but annagramma had the kind of voice that you obeyed .      what is your name .         tiffany aching .     said tiffany  and found herself saying her name as if she was asking permission to have it .      tiffany .  that   s a funny name     said the tall girl .     my name is annagramma hawkin .         um  annagramma works for       petulia began .         works with     said annagramma sharply  still looking tiffany up and down .      um  sorry  works with mrs .  earwig     said petulia .     but she           i intend to leave next year     said annagramma .     apparently  i   m doing extremely well .  so you   re the girl who   s joined miss level  are you .  she   s weird  you know .  the last three girls all left very quickly .  they said it was just too strange trying to keep track of which one of her was which .         which witch was which     said one of the girls cheerfully .      anyone can do that pun  lucy warbeck     said annagramma  without looking around .     it   s not funny  and it   s not clever .      she turned her attention back to tiffany  who felt that she was being examined as critically and thoroughly as granny aching would check a ewe she might be thinking of buying .  she wondered if annagramma would actually try to open her mouth and make sure she had all her teeth .      they say you can   t breed good witches on chalk     said annagramma .   all the other girls looked from annagramma to tiffany  who thought  hah  so witches don   t have leaders  do they .  but she was in no mood to make enemies .      perhaps they do     she said quietly .  this did not seem to be what annagramma wanted to hear .      you haven   t even dressed the part     said annagramma .      sorry     said tiffany .      um  annagramma says that if you want people to treat you like a witch  you should look like one     petulia said .      hmm     said annagramma  staring at tiffany as if she   d failed a simple test .  then she nodded her head .     well  we all had to start somewhere .     she stood back .     ladies  this is tiffany .  tiffany  you know petulia .  she crashes into trees .  dimity hubbub is the one with the smoke coming out of her hat  so that she looks like a chimney .  that   s gertruder tiring  that   s the hilariously funny lucy warbeck  that   s harrieta bilk  who can   t seem to do anything about the squint  and then that   s lulu darling  who can   t seem to do anything about the name .  you can sit in for this evening   tiffany  wasn   t it .  i   m sorry you   ve been taken on by miss level .  she   s rather sad .  complete amateur .  hasn   t really got a clue .  just bustles about and hopes .  oh  well  it   s too late now .  gertruder  summon the world   s four corners and open the circle  please .         er       said gertruder nervously .  it was amazing how many people around annagramma became nervous .      do i have to do everything around here .     said annagramma .     try to remember  please .  we must have been through this literally a million times .         i   ve never heard of the world   s four corners     said tiffany .      really .  there   s a surprise     said annagramma .     well  they   re the directions of power  tiffany  and i would advise you to do something about that name  too  please .         but the world   s round  like a plate     said tiffany .      um  you have to imagine them     petulia whispered .   tiffany wrinkled her forehead .      why .     she said .   annagramma rolled her eyes .     because that   s the way to do things properly .         oh .         you have done some kind of magic  haven   t you .     annagramma demanded .   tiffany was a bit confused .  she wasn   t used to people like annagramma .      yes     she said .  all the other girls were staring at her  and tiffany couldn   t help thinking about sheep .  when a dog attacks a sheep  the other sheep run away to a safe distance and then turn and watch .  they don   t gang up on the dog .  they   re just happy it   s not them .      what are you best at  then .     snapped annagramma .   tiffany  her mind still full of sheep  spoke without thinking .     soft nellies     she said .     it   s a sheep cheese .  it   s quite hard to make    .      she looked around at the circle of blank faces and felt embarrassment rise inside her like hot jelly .      um  annagramma meant what magic can you do best     said petulia kindly .      although soft nellies is good     said annagramma with a cruel little smile .  one or two of the girls gave that little snort that meant they were trying not to laugh out loud but didn   t mind showing that they were trying .   tiffany looked down at her boots again .      i don   t know     she mumbled     but i did throw the queen of the fairies out of my country .         really .     said annagramma .     the queen of the fairies  eh .  how did you do that .         i   m   not sure .  i just got angry with her .     and it was hard to remember exactly what had happened that night .  tiffany recalled the anger  the terrible anger  and the world   changing .  she   d seen it clearer than a hawk sees  heard it better than a dog hears  felt its age beneath her feet  felt the hills still living .  and she remembered thinking that no one could do this for long and still be human .      well  you   ve got the right boots for stamping your foot     said annagramma .  there were a few more half concealed giggles .     a queen of the fairies     she added .     i   m sure you did .  well  it helps to dream .         i don   t tell lies     mumbled tiffany  but no one was listening .   sullen and upset  she watched the girls open the corners and summon the circle  unless she   d got that the wrong way around .  this went on for some time .  it would have gone better if they   d all been sure what to do  but it was probably hard to know what to do when annagramma was around  since she kept correcting everyone .  she was standing with a big book open in her arms .         now you  gertruder  go widdershins  no  that   s the other way  i must have told you literally a thousand times  and lulu   where   s lulu .  well  you shouldn   t have been there .  get the shriven chalice  not that one  no  the one without handles   yes .  harrieta  hold the wand of the air a bit higher  i mean  it must be in the air  d   you understand .  and for goodness    sake  petulia  please try to look a little more stately  will you .  i appreciate that it doesn   t come naturally to you  but you might at least show you   re making an effort .  by the way  i   ve been meaning to tell you  no invocation ever written starts with    um     unless i   m very much mistaken .  harrieta  is that the cauldron of the sea .  does it even look like a cauldron of the sea .  i don   t think so  do you .  what was that noise .      the girls looked down .  then someone mumbled     dimity trod on the circlet of infinity  annagramma .         not the one with the genuine seed pearls on it .     said annagramma in a tight little voice .      um  yes     said petulia .     but i   m sure she   s very sorry .  um   shall i make a cup of tea .      the book slammed shut .      what is the point .     said annagramma to the world in general .     what .  is .  the .  point .  do you want to spend the rest of your lives as village witches  curing boils and warts for a cup of tea and a biscuit .  well .  do you .      there was a shuffling among the huddled witches  and a general murmur of    no  annagramma .         you did all read mrs .  earwig   s book  didn   t you .     she demanded .     well  did you .      petulia raised a hand nervously .     um       she began .      petulia  i   ve told you literally a million times not to start .  every .  single .  sentence .  with    um      haven   t i .         um       said petulia  trembling with nervousness .      just speak up  for goodness    sake .  don   t hesitate all the time .         um           petulia .         um           really  you might make an effort .  honestly  i don   t know what   s the matter with all of you .      i do  tiffany thought .  you   re like a dog worrying sheep all the time .  you don   t give them time to obey you  and you don   t let them know when they   ve done things right .  you just keep barking .   petulia had lapsed into tongue tied silence .   annagramma put the book down on the log .     well  we   ve completely lost the moment     she said .     we may as well have that cup of tea  petulia .  do hurry up .      petulia  relieved  grabbed the kettle .  people relaxed a little .   tiffany looked at the cover of the book .  it read       the higher magik  by letice earwig  witch        magic with a k .     she said aloud .     magikkkk .         that   s deliberate     said annagramma coldly .     mrs .  earwig says that if we are to make any progress at all we must distinguish the higher magik from the everyday sort .         the everyday sort of magic .     said tiffany .      exactly .  none of that mumbling in hedgerows for us .  proper sacred circles  spells written down .  a proper hierarchy  not everyone running around doing whatever they feel like .  real wands  not bits of grubby stick .  professionalism  with respect .  absolutely no warts .  that   s the only way forward .         well  i think       tiffany began .      i don   t really care what you think  because you don   t know enough yet     said annagramma sharply .  she turned to the group in general .     do we all at least have something for the trials this year .     she asked .  there were general murmurs and nods on the theme of    yes .         what about you  petulia .     said annagramma .      i   m going to do the pig trick  annagramma     said petulia meekly .      good .  you   re nearly good at that     said annagramma  and pointed around the circle  from one girl to another  nodding at their answers  until she came to tiffany .      soft nellies .     she said  to sniggering amusement .      what are witch trials .     said tiffany .     miss level mentioned them  but i don   t know what they are .      annagramma gave one of her noisy sighs .      you tell her  petulia     she said .     you brought her  after all .      hesitantly  with lots of    um   s and glances at annagramma  petulia explained about the witch trials .  um  it was a time when witches from all over the mountains could meet up and um see old friends and um pick up the latest news and gossip .  ordinary people could come along too  and there was a fair and um sideshows .   it was quite an um big event .  and in the afternoon all the witches that um wanted to could show off a spell or um something they   d been working on  which was very um popular .   to tiffany they sounded like sheepdog trials  without the dogs or the sheep .  they were in sheercliff this year  which was quite close .      and is there a prize .     she asked .      um  oh no     said petulia .     it   s all done in the spirit of fun and good fellow   um  good sistership .         hah .     said annagramma .     not even she will believe that .  it   s all a fix  anyway .  they   ll all applaud mistress weatherwax .  she always wins  whatever she does .  she just messes up people   s minds .  she just fools them into thinking she   s good .  she wouldn   t last five minutes against a wizard .  they do real magic .  and she dresses like a scarecrow  too .  it   s ignorant old women like her who keep witchcraft rooted in the past  as mrs .  earwig points out in chapter one .      one or two girls looked uncertain .  petulia even looked over her shoulder .      um  people do say she   s done amazing things  annagramma     she said .     and  um  they say she can spy on people miles away           yes  they say that     said annagramma .     that   s because they   re all frightened of her .  she   s such a bully .  that   s all she does  bully people and mess up their heads .  that   s old witchcraft  that is .  just one step away from cackling  in my opinion .  she   s half cracked now  they say .         she didn   t seem cracked to me .         who said that .     snapped annagramma .   everyone looked at tiffany  who wished she hadn   t spoken .  but now there was nothing for it but to go on .      she was just a bit old and stern     she said .     but she was quite   polite .  she didn   t cackle .         you   ve met her .         yes .         she spoke to you  did she .     snarled annagramma .     was that before or after you kicked out the fairy queen .         just after     said tiffany  who was not used to this sort of thing .     she turned up on a broomstick     she added .     i am telling the truth .         of course you are     said annagramma  smiling grimly .     and she congratulated you  i expect .         not really     said tiffany .     she seemed pleased  but it was hard to tell .      and then tiffany said something really  really stupid .  long afterward  and long after all sorts of things had happened  she   d go    la la la .     to blot out the memory whenever something reminded her of that evening .   she said     she did give me this hat .      and they said  all of them  with one voice     what hat .          petulia took her back to the cottage .  she did her best  and assured tiffany that she believed her  but tiffany knew she was just being nice .  miss level tried to talk to her as she ran upstairs  but she bolted her door  kicked off her boots  and lay down on the bed with the pillow over her head to drown out the laughter echoing inside .   downstairs there was some muffled conversation between petulia and miss level and then the sound of the door closing as petulia left .   after a while there was a scraping noise as tiffany   s boots were dragged across the floor and arranged neatly under the bed .  oswald was never off duty .   after another while the laughter died down  although she was sure it   d never go completely .   tiffany could feel the hat .  at least  she had been able to feel it .  the virtual hat  on her real head .  but no one could see it  and petulia had even waved a hand back and forth over tiffany   s head and encountered a complete absence of hat .   the worst part   and it was hard to find the worst part  so humiliatingly bad had it been   was hearing annagramma say     no  don   t laugh at her .  that   s too cruel .  she   s just foolish  that   s all .  i told you the old woman messes with people   s heads .      tiffany   s first thoughts were running around in circles .  her second thoughts were caught up in the storm .  only her third thoughts  which were very weak  came up with  even though your world is completely and utterly ruined and can never be made better  no matter what  and you   re completely inconsolable  it would be nice if you heard someone bringing some soup upstairs    .   the third thoughts got tiffany off the bed and over to the door  where they guided her hand to slide the bolt back .  then they let her fling herself on the bed again .   a few minutes later there was a creak of footsteps on the landing .  it   s nice to be right .   miss level knocked  then came in after a decent pause .  tiffany heard the tray go down on the table  then felt the bed move as a body sat down on it .      petulia is a capable girl  i   ve always thought     said miss level after a while .     she   ll make some village a very serviceable witch one day .      tiffany stayed silent .      she told me all about it     said miss level .     miss tick never mentioned the hat  but if i was you  i wouldn   t have told her about it anyway .  it sounds the sort of thing mistress weatherwax would do .  you know  sometimes it helps to talk about these things .      more silence from tiffany .      actually  that   s not true     miss level added .     but as a witch i am incredibly inquisitive and would love to know more .      that had no effect either .  miss level sighed and stood up .     i   ll leave the soup  but if you let it get too cold  oswald will try to take it away .      she went downstairs .   nothing stirred in the room for about five minutes .  then there was faintest of tinkles as the soup began to move .   tiffany   s hand shot out and gripped the tray firmly .  that   s the job of third thoughts  first and second thoughts might understand your current tragedy  but something has to remember that you haven   t eaten since lunchtime .   afterward  and after oswald had speedily taken the empty bowl away  tiffany lay in the dark  staring at nothing .   the novelty of this new country had taken all her attention in the past few days  but now that had drained away in the storm of laughter  and homesickness rushed to fill in the empty spaces .   she missed the sounds and the sheep and the silences of the chalk .  she missed seeing the blackness of the hills from her bedroom window  outlined against the stars .  she missed   part of herself    .   but they   d laughed at her .  they   d said    what hat .     and they   d laughed even more when she   d raised her hand to touch the invisible brim and hadn   t found it    .   she   d touched it every day for eighteen months  and now it had gone .  and she couldn   t make a shamble .  and she just had a green dress  while all the other girls wore black ones .  annagramma had a lot of jewelry  too  in black and silver .  all the other girls had shambles  too  beautiful ones .  who cared if they were just for show .   perhaps she wasn   t a witch at all .  oh  she   d defeated the queen  with the help of the little men and the memory of granny aching  but she hadn   t used magic .  she wasn   t sure  now  what she had used .  she   d felt something go down through the soles of her boots  down through the hills and through the years  and come back loud and roaring in a rage that shook the sky      how dare you invade my world  my land  my life     but what had the virtual hat done for her .  perhaps the old woman had tricked her  had just made her think there was a hat there .  perhaps she was a bit cracked  like annagramma had said  and had just got things wrong .  perhaps tiffany should go home and make soft nellies for the rest of her life .   tiffany turned around and crawled down the bed and opened her suitcase .  she pulled out the rough box  opened it in the dark  and closed a hand around the lucky stone .   she   d hoped that there   d be some kind of spark  some kind of friendliness in it .  there was none .  there was just the roughness of the outside of the stone  the smoothness on the face where it had split  and the sharpness between the two .  and the piece of sheep   s wool did nothing but make her fingers smell of sheep  and this made her long for home and feel even more upset .  the silver horse was cold .   only someone quite close would have heard the sob .  it was quite faint  but it was carried on the dark red wings of misery .  she wanted  longed for  the hiss of wind in the turf and the feel of centuries under her feet .  she wanted that sense  which had never left her before  of being where achings had lived for thousands of years .  she needed blue butterflies and the sounds of sheep and the big empty skies .   back home  when she   d felt upset  she   d gone up to the remains of the old shepherding hut and sat there for a while .  that had always worked .   it was a long way away now .  too far .  now she was full of a horrible  heavy  dead feeling  and there was nowhere to leave it .  and it wasn   t how things were supposed to go .   where was the magic .  oh  she understood that you had to learn about the basic  everyday craft  but when did the    witch    part turn up .  she   d been trying to learn  she really had  and she was turning into   well  a good worker  a handy girl with potions and a reliable person .  dependable  like miss level .   she   d expected   well  what .  well   to be doing serious witch stuff  you know  broomsticks  magic  guarding the world against evil forces in a noble yet modest way  and then also doing good for poor people because she was a really nice person .  and the people she   d seen in the picture had had rather less messy ailments and their children didn   t have such runny noses .  mr .  weavall   s flying toenails weren   t in it anywhere .  some of them boomeranged .   she got sick on broomsticks .  every time .  she couldn   t even make a shamble .  she was going to spend her days running around after people who  to be honest  could sometimes be doing a bit more for themselves .  no magic  no flying  no secrets   just toenails and bogeys .   she belonged to the chalk .  every day she   d told the hills what they were .  every day they   d told her who she was .  but now she couldn   t hear them .   outside  it began to rain  quite hard  and in the distance tiffany heard the mutter of thunder .   what would granny aching have done .  but even folded in the wings of despair she knew the answer to that .   granny aching never gave up .  she   d search all night for a lost lamb    .   she lay looking at nothing for a while  and then lit the candle by the bed and swiveled her legs onto the floor .  this couldn   t wait until morning .   tiffany had a little trick for seeing the hat .  if you moved your hand behind it quickly  there was a slight  brief blurriness to what you saw  as though the light coming through the invisible hat took a little more time .   it had to be there .   well  the candle should give enough light to be sure .  if the hat was there  everything would be fine  and it wouldn   t matter what other people thought .   she stood in the middle of the carpet  while lightning danced across the mountains outside  and closed her eyes .   down in the garden the apple tree branches flayed in the wind  the dream catchers and curse nets clashing and jangling    .      see me     she said .   the world went quiet  totally silent .  it hadn   t done that before .  but tiffany tiptoed around until she knew she was opposite herself  and opened her eyes again     and there she was  and so was the hat  as clear as it had ever been .   and the image of tiffany below  a young girl in a green dress  opened its eyes and smiled at her and said      we see you .  now we are you .      tiffany tried to shout     see me not .     but there was no mouth to shout    .   lightning struck somewhere nearby .  the window blew in .  the candle flame flew out in a streamer of fire and died .   and then there was only darkness  and the hiss of the rain .       chapter        the hiver      thunder rolled across the chalk .   jeannie carefully opened the package that her mother had given her on the day she   d left the long lake mound .  it was a traditional gift  one that every young kelda got when she went away  never to return .  keldas could never go home .  keldas were home .   the gift was this  memory .   inside the bag were a triangle of tanned sheepskin  three wooden stakes  a length of string twisted out of nettle fibers  a tiny leather bottle  and a hammer .   she knew what to do  because she   d see her mother do it many times .  the hammer was used to bang in the stakes around the smoldering fire .  the string was used to tie the three corners of the leather triangle to the stakes so that it sagged in the center  just enough to hold a small bucketful of water  which jeannie had drawn herself from the deep well .   she knelt down and waited until the water very slowly began to seep though the leather  then built up the fire .   she was aware of all the eyes of the feegles in the shadowy galleries around and above her .  none of them would come near her while she was boiling the cauldron .  they   d rather chop their own legs off .  this was pure hiddlins .   and this was what a cauldron really was  back in the days before humans had worked copper or poured iron .  it looked like magic .  it was supposed to .  but if you knew the trick  you could see how the cauldron would boil dry before the leather burned .   when the water in the skin was steaming  she damped down the fire and added to the water the contents of the little leather bottle  which contained some of the water from her mother   s cauldron .  that   s how it had always gone  from mother to daughter  since the very beginning .   jeannie waited until the cauldron had cooled some more  then took up a cup  filled it  and drank .  there was a sigh from the shadowy feegles .   she lay back and closed her eyes  waiting .  nothing happened except that the thunder rattled the land and the lightning turned the world black and white .   and then  so gently that it had already happened before she realized that it was starting to happen  the past caught up with her .  there  around her  were all the old keldas  starting with her mother  her grandmothers  their mothers   back until there was no one to remember   one big memory  carried for a while by many  worn and hazy in parts but old as a mountain .   but all the feegles knew about that .  only the kelda knew about the real hiddlin  which was this  the river of memory wasn   t a river  it was a sea .   keldas yet to be born would remember  one day .  on nights yet to come  they   d lie by their cauldron and become  for a few minutes  part of the eternal sea .  by listening to unborn keldas remembering their past  you remember your future    .   you needed skill to find those faint voices  and jeannie did not have all of it yet  but something was there .   as lightning turned the world to black and white again  she sat bolt upright .      it   s found her     she whispered .     oh  the puir wee thing .          rain had soaked into the rug when tiffany woke up .  damp daylight spilled into the room .   she got up and closed the window .  a few leaves had blown in .   o kay .   it hadn   t been a dream .  she was certain of that .  something   strange had happened .  the tips of her fingers were tingling .  she felt   different .  but not  now that she took stock  in a bad way .  no .  last night she   d felt awful  but now  now she felt   full of life .   actually  she felt happy .  she was going to take charge .  she was going to take control of her life .  get up and go had got up and come .   the green dress was rumpled  and really it needed a wash .  she had her old blue one in the chest of drawers  but somehow it didn   t seem right to wear it now .  she   d have to make do with the green until she could get another one .   she went to put on her boots  then stopped and stared at them .   they just wouldn   t do  not now .  she got the new shiny ones out of her case and wore them instead .   she found both of miss level was out in the wet garden in her nightie  sadly picking up bits of dream catcher and fallen apples .  even some of the garden ornaments had been smashed  although the madly grinning gnomes had unfortunately escaped destruction .   miss level brushed her hair out of one pair of her eyes and said     very  very strange .  all the curse nets seem to have exploded .  even the boredom stones are discharged .  did you notice anything .         no  miss level     said tiffany meekly .      and all the old shambles in the workroom are in pieces .  i mean  i know they are really only ornamental and have next to no power left  but something really strange must have happened .      both of her gave tiffany a look that miss level probably thought was very sly and cunning  but it made her look slightly ill .      the storm seemed a touch magical to me .  i suppose you girls weren   t doing anything   odd last night  were you  dear .     she said .      no  miss level .  i thought they were a bit silly .         because  you see  oswald seems to have gone     said miss level .     he   s very sensitive to atmospheres    .      it took tiffany a moment to understand what she was talking about .  then she said     but he   s always here .         yes  ever since i can remember .     said miss level .      have you tried putting a spoon in the knife section .         yes  of course .  not so much as a rattle .         dropped an apple core .  he always           that was the first thing i tried .         how about the salt and sugar trick .      miss level hesitated .     well  no       she brightened up .     he does love that one  so he   s bound to turn up  yes .      tiffany found the big bag of salt and another of sugar  and poured both of them into a bowl .  then she stirred up the fine white crystals with her hand .   she   d found this was the ideal away of keeping oswald occupied while they did the cooking .  sorting the salt and sugar grains back into the right bags could take him an entire happy afternoon .  but now the mixture just lay there  oswaldless .      oh  well   i   ll search the house     said miss level  as if that was a good way of finding an invisible person .     go and see to the goats  will you  dear .  and then we   ll have to try to remember how to do the dishes .      tiffany let the goats out of the shed .  usually black meg immediately went and stood on the milking platform and gave her an expectant look as if to say  i   ve thought up a new trick .   but not today .  when tiffany looked inside the shed  the goats were huddled in the dark at the far end .  they panicked  nostrils flaring  and scampered around as she went toward them  but she managed to grab black meg by her collar .  the goat twisted and fought her as she dragged her out toward the milking stand .  meg climbed up because it was either that or have her head pulled off  then stood there snorting and bleating .   tiffany stared at the goat .  her bones felt as though they were itching .  she wanted to   do things  climb the highest mountain  leap into the sky  run around the world .  and she thought  this is silly .  i start every day with a battle of wits with an animal .   well  let   s show this creature who is in charge .   she picked up the broom that was used for sweeping out the milking parlor .  black meg   s slot eyes widened in fear  and wham .  went the broom .   it hit the milking stand .  tiffany hadn   t intended to miss like that .  she   d wanted to give meg the wallop the creature richly deserved  but somehow  the stick had twisted in her hand .  she raised it again  but the look in her eye and the whack on the wood had achieved the right effect .  meg cowered .      no more games .     hissed tiffany  lowering the stick .   the goat stood as still as a log .  tiffany milked her out  took the pail back into the dairy  weighed it  chalked up the amount on the slate by the door  and tipped the milk into a big bowl .   the rest of the goats were nearly as bad  but a herd learns fast .   all together they gave three gallons  which was pretty pitiful for ten goats .  tiffany chalked this up without enthusiasm and stood staring at it  fiddling with the chalk .  what was the point of this .  yesterday she   d been full of plans for experimental cheeses  but now cheese was dull .   why was she here  doing silly chores  helping people too stupid to help themselves .  she could be doing   anything .   she looked down at the scrubbed wooden table .       help me     someone had written on the wood in chalk .  and the piece of chalk was still in her hand        petulia   s come to see you  dear     said miss level  behind her .   tiffany quickly shifted a milking bucket over the words and turned around guiltily .      what .     she said .     why .         just to see if you   re all right  i think     said miss level  watching tiffany carefully .   the dumpy girl stood very nervously on the doorstep  her pointy hat in her hands .      um  i just thought i ought to see how you  um  are       she muttered  looking tiffany squarely in the boots .     um  i don   t think anyone really wanted to be unkind    .         you   re not very clever and you   re too fat     said tiffany .  she stared at the round pink face for a moment and knew things .     and you still have a teddy bear help me and you believe in fairies .      she slammed the door  went back to the dairy  and stared at the bowls of milk and curds as if she was seeing them for the first time .   good with cheese .  that was one of the things everyone remembered about her  tiffany aching  brown hair  good with cheese .  but now the dairy looked all wrong and unfamiliar .   she gritted her teeth .  good with cheese .  was that really what she wanted to be .  of all the things people could be in the world  did she want to be known just as a dependable person to have around rotted milk .  did she really want to spend all day scrubbing slabs and washing pails and plates and   and   and that weird wire thing just there  that        cheese cutter        that cheese cutter .  did she want her whole life to     hold on        who   s there .     said tiffany .     did someone just say    cheese cutter    .      she peered around the room  as if someone could be hiding behind the bundles of dried herbs .  it couldn   t have been oswald .  he   d gone  and he never spoke in any case .   tiffany grabbed the pail  spat on her hand  and rubbed out the chalked help me .      tried to rub it out .  but her hand gripped the edge of the table and held it firmly  no matter how much she pulled .  she flailed with her left hand  managing to knock over a pail of milk  which washed across the letters   and her right hand let go suddenly .   the door was pushed open .  both of miss level was there .  when she pulled herself together like that  standing side by side  it was because she felt she had something important to say .      i have to say  tiffany  that i think              you were very nasty to petulia just              now .  she went off crying .      she stared at tiffany   s face .     are you all right  child .      tiffany shuddered .      er   yes .  fine .  feel a bit odd .  heard a voice in my head .  gone now .      miss level looked at her with her heads on one side  right and left in different directions .      if you   re sure  then .  i   ll get changed .  we   d better leave soon .  there   s a lot to do today .         a lot to do     said tiffany weakly .      well  yes .  there   s slapwick   s leg  and i   ve got to see to the grimly baby  and it   s been a week since i   ve visited surleigh bottom  and  let   s see  mr .  plover   s got gnats again  and i   d better just find a moment to have a word with mistress slopes   then there   s mr .  weavall   s lunch to cook .  i think i   ll have to do that here and run down with it for him  and of course mrs .  fanlight is near her time  and      she sighed      so is miss hobblow  again    .  it   s going to be a full day .  it   s really hard to fit it all in  really it is .      tiffany thought  you stupid woman  standing there looking worried because you just haven   t got time to give people everything they demand .  do you think you could ever give them enough help .  greedy  lazy  dumb people  always wanting all the time .  the grimly baby .  mrs .  grimly   s got eleven children .  who   d miss one .   mr .  weavall   s dead already .  he just won   t go .  you think they   re grateful  but all they   re doing is making sure you come around again .  that   s not gratitude  that   s just insurance .   the thought horrified part of her  but it had turned up and it flamed there in her head  just itching to escape from her mouth .      things need tidying up here     she muttered .      oh  i can do that while we   re gone     said miss level cheerfully .     come on  let   s have a smile .  there   s lots to do .      there was always lots to do  tiffany growled in her head as she trailed after miss level to the first village .  lots and lots .  and it never made any difference .  there was no end to the wanting .   they went from one grubby  smelly cottage to another  ministering to people too stupid to use soap  drinking tea from cracked cups  gossiping with old women with fewer teeth than toes .  it made her feel ill .   it was a bright day  but it seemed to darken as they walked on .  the feeling was like a thunderstorm inside her head .   then the daydreams began .  she was helping to splint the broken arm of some dull child when she glanced up and saw her reflection in the glass of the cottage window .   she was a tiger  with huge fangs .   she yelped and stood up .      oh  do be careful     said miss level  and then saw her face .     is there something wrong .     she asked .      i   i   something bit me .     lied tiffany .  that was a safe bet in these places .  the fleas bit the rats and the rats bit the children .   she managed to get out into the daylight  her head spinning .  miss level came out a few minutes later and found her leaning against the wall  shaking .      you look dreadful     she said .      ferns .     said tiffany .     everywhere .  big ferns .  and big things  like cows made out of lizards .     she turned a wide  mirthless smile onto miss level  who took a step back .     you can eat them .     she blinked .     what   s happening .     she whispered .      i don   t know  but i   m coming right down here this minute to fetch you     said miss level .     i   m on the broomstick right now .         they laughed at me when i said i could trap one .  well  who   s laughing now  tell me that  eh .      miss level   s expression of concern turned into something close to panic .      that didn   t sound like your voice .  that sounded like a man .  do you feel all right .         feel   crowded     murmured tiffany .      crowded .     said miss level .      strange   memories   help me        tiffany looked at her arm .  it had scales on it .  now it had hair on it .  now it was smooth and brown  and holding        a scorpion sandwich .     she said .      can you hear me .     asked miss level  her voice a long way away .     you   re delirious .  are you sure you girls haven   t been playing with potions or anything like that .      the broomstick dropped out of the sky and the other part of miss level nearly fell off .  without speaking  both of miss level got tiffany onto the stick and part of miss level got on behind her .   it didn   t take long to fly back to the cottage .  tiffany spent the flight with her mind full of hot cotton wool and wasn   t at all certain where she was  although her body did know and threw up again .   miss level helped her off the stick and sat her on the garden seat just outside the cottage door .      now just you wait there     said miss level  who dealt with emergencies by talking incessantly and using the word    just    too often because it   s a calming word     and i   ll just get you a drink and then we   ll just see what the matter is    .     there was a pause  and then the stream of words came out of the house again  dragging miss level after them .        and i   ll just check on   things .  just drink this  please .      tiffany drank the water and  out of the corner of her eye  saw miss level weaving string around an egg .  she was trying to make a shamble without tiffany noticing .   strange images were floating around tiffany   s mind .  there were scraps of voices  fragments of memories   and one little voice that was her own  small and defiant and getting fainter  you   re not me .  you just think you are .  someone help me .      now  then     said miss level     let   s just see what we can see        the shamble exploded  not just into pieces but into fire and smoke .      oh  tiffany     said miss level  frantically waving smoke away .     are you all right .      tiffany stood up slowly .  it seemed to miss level that she was slightly taller than she remembered .      yes  i think i am     said tiffany .     i think i   ve been all wrong  but now i   m all right .  and i   ve been wasting my time  miss level .         what       miss level began .   tiffany pointed a finger at her .      i know why you had to leave the circus  miss level     she said .     it had to do with the clown floppo  the trick ladder  and   some custard    .      miss level went pale .     how could you possibly know that .         just by looking at you .     said tiffany  pushing past her into the dairy .     watch this  miss level .      she pointed a finger .  a wooden spoon rose an inch from the table .  then it began to spin  faster and faster  until with a cracking sound it broke into splinters .  they whirled away across the room .      and i can do this .     tiffany shouted .  she grabbed a bowl of curds  tipped them out onto the table  and waved a hand at them .  they turned into a cheese .      now that   s what cheese making should be .     she said .     to think that i spent stupid years learning the hard way .  that   s how a real witch does it .  why do we crawl in the dirt  miss level .  why do we amble around with herbs and bandage smelly old men   s legs .  why do we get paid with eggs and stale cakes .  annagramma is as stupid as a hen  but even she can see it   s wrong .  why don   t we use magic .  why are you so afraid .      miss level tried to smile .      tiffany  dear  we all go through this     she said  and her voice was shaking .     though not as   explosively as you  i have to say .  and the answer is   well  it   s dangerous .         yes  but that   s what people always say to scare children     said tiffany .     we get told stories to frighten us  to keep us scared .  don   t go into the big bad woods help me because it   s full of scary things  that   s what we   re told .  but really  the big bad woods should be scared of us .  i   m going out .         i think that would be a good idea     said miss level weakly .     until you behave .         i don   t have to do things your way     snarled tiffany  slamming the door behind her .   miss level   s broomstick was leaning against the wall a little way away .  tiffany stopped and stared at it  her mind on fire .   she   d tried to keep away from it .  miss level had wheedled her into a trial flight with tiffany clinging on tightly with arms and legs while both of miss level ran alongside her  holding on to ropes and making encouraging noises .  they had stopped when tiffany threw up for the fourth time .   well  that was then .   she grabbed the stick  swung a leg over it   and found that her other foot stuck to the ground as though nailed there .  the broomstick swung around wildly as she tried to pull it up  and  when the boot was finally tugged off the ground  the stick turned over so that tiffany was upside down .  this is not the best position in which to make a grand exit .   she said  quietly     i am not going to learn you  you are going to learn me .  or the next lesson will involve an axe .      the broomstick turned upright  then gently rose .      right     said tiffany .  there was no fear this time .  there was just impatience .  the ground dropping away below her didn   t worry her at all .  if it didn   t have the sense to stay away from her  she   d hit it    .       as the stick drifted away  there was whispering in the long grass of the garden .      ach  we   re too late  rob .  that wuz the hiver  that wuz .         aye  but did ye see that foot .  it   s nae won yet   oour hag   s in there somewhere .  she   s fighting it .  it canna win until it   s taken the last scrap o    her .  wullie  will ye stop tryin    to grab them apples .         it   s sorry i am tae say this  rob  but no one can fight a hiver .     tis like fightin    yoursel .  the more you fight  the more it   ll tak    o    ye .  and when it has all o    ye           wash oot yer mouth wi    hedgehog pee  big yan .  that isna gonna happen           crivens .  here comes the big hag .      half of miss level stepped out into the ruined garden .   she stared up at the departing broomstick  shaking her head .   daft wullie was stuck out in the open  where he   d been trying to snag a fallen apple .  he turned to flee and would have got clean away if he hadn   t run straight into a pottery garden gnome .  he bounced off  stunned  and staggered wildly  trying to focus on the big  fat  chubby cheeked figure in front of him .  he was far too angry to hear the click of the garden gate and the soft tread of approaching footsteps .   when it comes to choosing between running and fighting  a feegle doesn   t think twice .  he doesn   t think at all .      what   re ye grinnin    at  pal .     he demanded .     oh aye  you reckon you   re the big man  eh  jus       cos yez got a fishin    rod .     he grabbed a pink pointy ear in each hand and aimed his head at what turned out be quite a hard pottery nose .  it smashed anyway  as things tend to in these circumstances  but it did slow the little man down and cause him to stagger in circles .   too late  he saw miss level bearing down on him from the doorway .  he turned to flee  right into the hands of also miss level .   her fingers closed around him .      i   m a witch  you know     she said .     and if you don   t stop struggling this minute  i will subject you to the most dreadful torture .  do you know what that is .      daft wullie shook his head in terror .  long years of juggling had given miss level a grip like steel .  down in the long grass the rest of the feegles listened so hard it hurt .   miss level brought him a little closer to her mouth .      i   ll let you go right now without giving you a taste of the twenty year old macabre single malt i have in my cupboard     she said .   rob anybody leaped up .      ach  crivens  mistress  what a thing to taunt a body wi    .  d   ye no    have a drop of mercy in you .     he shouted .     ye   re a cruel hag indeed tae       he stopped .  miss level was smiling .  rob anybody looked around  flung his sword on the ground and said     ach  crivens .          the nac mac feegle respected witches  even if they did call them hags .  and this one had brought out a big loaf and a whole bottle of whisky on the table for the taking .  you had to respect someone like that .      of course  i   d heard of you  and miss tick mentioned you     she said  watching them eat  which is not something to be done lightly .     but i always thought you were just a myth .         aye  weel  we   ll stay that way if ye dinna mind     said rob anybody  and belched .        tis bad enough wi    them arky olly gee men wantin    to dig up oour mounds wi   oot them folklore ladies wantin    to tak    pichoors o    us an    that .         and you watch over tiffany   s farm  mr .  anybody .         aye  we do that  an    we dinna ask for any reward     said rob anybody stoutly .      aye  we just tak    a few wee eiggs an    fruits an    old clothes and       daft wullie began .   rob gave him a look .      er   wuz that one o    those times when i shouldna open my big fat mouth .     said wullie .      aye .  it wuz     said rob .  he turned back to both of miss level .     mebbe we tak    the odd bitty thing lyin    aboot              in locked cupboards an    such       added daft wullie happily .         but it   s no    missed  an    we keeps an eye on the ships in payment     said rob  glaring at his brother .      you can see the sea from down there .     said miss level  entering that state of general bewilderment that most people fell into when talking to the feegles .      rob anybody means the sheep     said awf   ly wee billy .  gonnagles know a bit more about language .      aye  i said so  ships     said rob anybody .     anywa      aye  we watch her farm .  she   s the hag o    oor hills  like her granny .     he added proudly     it   s through her the hills knows they are alive .         and a hiver is    .      rob hesitated .     dunno the proper haggin    way o    talking aboot it     he said .     awf   ly wee billy  you know them lang words .      billy swallowed .     there   s old poems  mistress .  it   s like a  a mind wi   oot a body  except it disna think .  some say it   s nothing but a fear  and never dies .  and what it does       his tiny face wrinkled .     it   s like them things you get on sheep     he decided .   the feegles who weren   t eating and drinking came to his aid .      horns .         wools .         tails .         legs .         chairs .     this was daft wullie .      sheep ticks     said billy thoughtfully .      a parasite  you mean .     said miss level .      aye  that could be the word     said billy .     it creeps in  ye ken .  it looks for folks wi    power and strength .  kings  ye ken  magicians  leaders .  they say that way back in time  afore there wuz people  it lived in beasts .  the strongest beasts  ye ken  the ones wi    big  big teeths .  an    when it finds ye  it waits for a chance tae creep intae your head and it becomes ye .      the feegles fell silent  watching miss level .      becomes you .     she said .      aye .  wi    your memories an    all .  only   it changes ye .  it gives ye a lot o    power  but it takes ye over  makes ye its own .  an    the last wee bit of ye that still is ye   well  that   ll fight and fight  mebbe  but it will dwindle and dwindle until it   s a    gone an    ye   re just a memory    .      the feegles watched both of miss level .  you never knew what a hag would do at a time like this .      wizards used to summon demons     she said .     they may still do so  although i think that   s considered so fifteen centuries ago these days .  but that takes a lot of magic .  and you could talk to demons  i believe .  and there were rules .         never heard o    a hiver talkin        said billy .     or obeyin    rules .         but why would it want tiffany .     said miss level .     she   s not powerful .         she has the power o    the land in her     said rob anybody stoutly .        tis a power that comes at need  not for doin    wee conjurin    tricks .  we seen it  mistress .         but tiffany doesn   t do any magic     said miss level helplessly .     she   s very bright  but she can   t even make a shamble .  you must be wrong about that .         any o    youse lads seen the hag do any hagglin    lately .     rob anybody demanded .  there were a lot of shaken heads  and a shower of beads  beetles  feathers  and miscellaneous head items .      do you spy   i mean  do you watch over her all the time .     said miss level  slightly horrified .      oh  aye     said rob  airily .     no    in the privy  o    course .  an    it   s getting harder in her bedroom    cuz she   s blocked up a lot o    the cracks  for some reason .         i can   t imagine why     said miss level carefully .      no    us  neither     said rob .     we reckon it was    cuz o    the drafts .         yes  i expect that   s why it was     said miss level .      so mostly we get in through a mousehole and hides out in her old dolly house until she guz tae sleep     said rob .     dinna look at me like that  mistress   all the lads is perrrfect gentlemen an    keeps their eyes tight shut when she   s gettin    intae her nightie .  then there   s one guarding her window and another at the door .         guarding her from what .         everything .      for a moment miss level had a picture in her mind of a silent  moonlit bedroom with a sleeping child .  she saw  by the window  lit by the moon  one small figure on guard  and another in the shadows by the door .  what were they guarding her from .  everything     but now something  this thing  has taken her over and she   s locked inside somewhere .  but she never used to do magic .  i could understand it if it was one of the other girls messing around  but   tiffany .   one of the feegles was slowly raising a hand .      yes .     she said .      it   s me  mistress  big yan .  i dinna know if it wuz proper hagglin     mistress     he said nervously     but me an    nearly big angus saw her doin    something odd a few times  eh  nearly big angus .     the feegle next to him nodded and the speaker went on .     it was when she got her new dress and her new hat           and verra bonny she looked  too     said nearly big angus .      aye  she did that .  but she   d put    em on  and then standing in the middle o    the floor she said   whut wuz it she said  nearly big angus .            see me        nearly big angus volunteered .   miss level looked blank .  the speaker  now looking a bit sorry that he   d raised this  went on     then after a wee while we   d hear her voice say     see me not     and then she   d adjust the hat  ye know  mebbe to a more fetchin    angle .         oh  you mean she was looking at herself in what we call a mirror     said miss level .     that   s a kind of           we ken well what them things are  mistress     said nearly big angus .     she   s got a tiny one  all cracked and dirty .  but it   s nae good for a body as wants tae see herself properly .         verra good for the stealin     mirrors     said rob anybody .     we got oour jeannie a silver one wi    garnets in the frame .         and she   d say    see me    .     said miss level .      aye  an    then    see me not        said big yan .     an    betweentimes she   d stand verra still  like a stachoo .         sounds like she was trying to invent some kind of invisibility spell     miss level mused .     they don   t work like that  of course .         we reckoned she was just tryin    to throw her voice     said nearly big angus .     so it sounds like it   s comin    fra    somewhere else  ye ken .  wee iain can do that a treat when we   re huntin    .         throw her voice .     said miss level  her brow wrinkling .     why did you think that .            cuz when she said     see me not     it sounded like it wuz no    comin fra    her  and her lips didnae move .      miss level stared at the feegles .  when she spoke next  her voice was a little strange .      tell me     she said     when she was just standing there  was she moving at all .         just breathin    verra slow  mistress     said big yan .      were her eyes shut .         aye .      miss level started to breathe very fast .      she walked out of her own body .  there   s not one              witch in a hundred who can do that .     she said .     that   s borrowing  that is .  it   s better than any circus trick .  it   s putting              your mind somewhere else .  you have to              learn how to protect yourself before you ever try it .  and she just invented it because she didn   t have a mirror .  the little fool  why didn   t she              say .  she walked out of her own body and left it there for anything to take over .  i wonder what              she thought she was              doing .      after a while rob anybody gave a polite cough .      we   re better at questions about fightin     drinkin     and stealin        he mumbled .     we dinna have the knowin    o    the hagglin    .          chapter        the matter of brian      something that called itself tiffany flew across the treetops .   it thought it was tiffany .  it could remember everything   nearly everything   about being tiffany .  it looked like tiffany .  it even thought like tiffany  more or less .  it had everything it needed to be tiffany        except tiffany .  except the tiny part of her that was    her .   it peered from her own eyes  tried to hear with her own ears  think with her own brain .   a hiver took over its victim not by force  exactly  but simply by moving into any space  like the hermit elephant .   it just took you over because that was what it did  until it was in all the places and there was no room left        except        it was having trouble .  it had flowed through her like a dark tide but there was a place  tight and sealed  that was still closed .  if it had had the brains of a tree  it would have been puzzled .   if it had had the brains of a human  it would have been frightened    .       tiffany brought the broomstick in low over the trees and landed it neatly in mrs .  earwig   s garden .  there really was nothing to it  she decided .  you just had to want it to fly .   then she was sick again  or at least tried to be  but since she   d thrown up twice in the air  there wasn   t much left to be sick with .  it was ridiculous .  she wasn   t frightened of flying anymore  but her stupid stomach was .   she wiped her mouth carefully and looked around .   she   d landed on a lawn .  she   d heard of them  but had never seen a real one before .  there was grass all around miss level   s cottage  but that was just  well  the grass of the clearing .  every other garden she   d seen was used for growing vegetables  with perhaps just a little space for flowers if the wife had gotten tough about it .  a lawn meant you were posh enough to afford to give up valuable potato space .   this lawn had stripes .   tiffany turned to the stick and said     stay .     and then marched across the lawn to the house .  it was a lot grander than miss level   s cottage  but from what tiffany had heard  mrs .  earwig was a more senior witch .  she   d also married a wizard  although he didn   t do any wizarding these days .  it was a funny thing  miss level said  but you didn   t often meet a poor wizard .   she knocked at the door and waited .   there was a curse net hanging in the porch .  you   d have thought that a witch wouldn   t need such a thing  but tiffany supposed they used them as decoration .  there was also a broomstick leaning against the wall  and a five pointed silver star on the door .  mrs .  earwig advertised .   tiffany knocked on the door again  much harder .   it was instantly opened by a tall  thin woman  all in black .  but it was a very decorative  rich  deep black  all lacy and ruffled  and set off with more silver jewelry than tiffany imagined could exist .  she didn   t just have rings on her fingers .  some fingers had sort of silver finger gloves  designed to look like claws .  she gleamed like the night sky .   and she was wearing her pointy hat  which miss level never did at home .  it was taller than any hat that tiffany had ever seen .  it had stars on it  and silver hatpins glittered .   all of this should have added up to something pretty impressive .  it didn   t .  partly it was because there was just too much of everything  but mostly it was because of mrs .  earwig .  she had a long  sharp face and looked very much as though she was about to complain about the cat from next door widdling on her lawn .  and she looked like that all the time .  before she spoke  she very pointedly looked at the door to see if the heavy knocking had made a mark .      well .     she said  haughtily  or what she probably thought was haughtily .  it sounded a bit strangled .      bless all in this house     said tiffany .      what .  oh  yes .  favorable runes shine on this our meeting     said mrs .  earwig hurriedly .     well .         i   ve come to see annagramma     said tiffany .  there really was too much silver .      oh  are you one of her girls .     said mrs .  earwig .      not   exactly     said tiffany .     i work with miss level .         oh  her     said mrs .  earwig  looking her up and down .     green is a very dangerous color .  what is your name  child .         tiffany .         hmm     said mrs .  earwig  not approving at all .     well  you had better come in .     she glanced up and made a tch .  sound .     oh  will you look at that .  i bought that at the craft fair over in slice  too .  it was very expensive .      the curse net was hanging in tatters .      you didn   t do that  did you .     mrs .  earwig demanded .      it   s too high  mrs .  earwig     said tiffany .      it   s pronounced ah wij     said mrs .  earwig coldly .      sorry  mrs .  earwig .         come .      it was a strange house .  you couldn   t doubt that a witch lived in it  and not just because every doorframe had a tall pointy bit cut out of the top of it to allow mrs .  earwig   s hat to pass through .  miss level had nothing on her walls except circus posters  but mrs .  earwig had proper big paintings everywhere and they were all   witchy .  there were lots of crescent moons and young women with quite frankly not enough clothes on  and big men with horns and  ooh  not just horns .  there were suns and moons on the tiles of the floor  and the ceiling of the room tiffany was led into was high  blue  and painted with stars .  mrs .  earwig  pronounced ah wij  pointed to a chair with gryphon feet and crescent shaped cushions .      sit there     she said .     i will tell annagramma you are here .  do not kick the chair legs  please .      she went out via another door .   tiffany looked around        the hiver looked around        and thought  i   ve got to be the strongest .  when i am strongest  i shall be safe .  that one is weak .  she thinks you can buy magic .      oh  it really is you     said a sharp voice behind her .     the cheese girl .      tiffany stood up .      the hiver had been many things  including a number of wizards  because wizards sought power all the time and sometimes found  in their treacherous circles  not some demon that was so stupid that it could be tricked with threats and riddles  but the hiver  which was so stupid that it could not be tricked at all .  and the hiver remembered     annagramma was drinking a glass of milk .  once you   d seen mrs .  earwig  you understood something about annagramma .  there was an air about her that she was taking notes on the world in order to draw up a list of suggestions for improvements .      hello     said tiffany .      i suppose you came along to beg to be allowed to join after all  have you .  i suppose you might be fun .         no  not really .  but i might let you join me     said tiffany .     are you enjoying that milk .      the glass of milk turned into a bunch of thistles and grass .  annagramma dropped it hurriedly .  when it hit the floor  it became a glass of milk again  and shattered and splashed .   tiffany pointed at the ceiling .  the painted stars flared  filling the room with light .  but annagramma stared at the spilled milk .     you know they say the power comes .     said tiffany .     well  it   s come to me .  do you want to be my friend .  or do you want to be   in my way .  i should clean up that milk  if i was you .      she concentrated .  she didn   t know where this was coming from  but it seemed to know exactly what to do .   annagramma rose a few inches off the floor .  she struggled and tried to run  but that only made her spin .  to tiffany   s dreadful delight  the girl started to cry .      you said we ought to use our power     said tiffany  walking around her as annagramma tried to break free .     you said if we had the gift  people ought to know about it .  you   re a girl with her head screwed on right .     tiffany bent down a bit to look her in the eye .     wouldn   t it be awful if it got screwed on wrong .      she waved a hand and her prisoner dropped to the ground .  but while annagramma was unpleasant  she wasn   t a coward  and she rose up with her mouth open to yell and a hand upraised        careful     said tiffany .     i can do it again .      annagramma wasn   t stupid  either .  she lowered her hand and shrugged .      well  you have been lucky     she said grudgingly .      but i still need your help     said tiffany .      why would you need my help .     asked annagramma sulkily .      we need allies  the hiver thought with tiffany   s mind .  they can help protect us .  if necessary  we can sacrifice them .  other creatures will always want to be friends with the powerful  and this one loves power        to start with     said tiffany     where can i get a dress like yours .      annagramma   s eyes lit up .     oh  you want zakzak stronginthearm  over in sallett without     she said .     he sells everything for the modern witch .         then i want everything     said tiffany .      he   ll want paying     annagramma went on .     he   s a dwarf .  they know real gold from illusion gold .  everyone tries it out on him  of course .  he just laughs .  if you try it twice  he   ll make a complaint to your mistress .         miss tick said a witch should have just enough money     said tiffany .      that   s right     said annagramma .     just enough to buy everything she wants .  mrs .  earwig says that just because we   re witches  we don   t have to live like peasants .  but miss level is old fashioned  isn   t she .  probably hasn   t got any money in the house .      and tiffany said     oh  i know where i can get some money .  i   ll meet you please help me .  here this afternoon  and you can show me where his place is .         what was that .     said annagramma sharply .      i just said i   d stop me .  meet you here this       tiffany began .      there it was again .  there was a sort of   odd echo in your voice     said annagramma .     like two people trying to talk at once .         oh  that     said the hiver .     that   s nothing .  it   ll stop soon .          it was an interesting mind  and the hiver enjoyed using it   but always there was that one place  that little place that was closed  it was annoying  like an itch that wouldn   t go away    .   it did not think .  the mind of the hiver was just what remained of all the other minds it had once lived in .  they were like echoes after the music is taken away .  but even echoes  bouncing off one another  can produce new harmonies .   they clanged now .  they rang out things like  fit in .  not strong enough yet to make enemies .  have friends    .   zakzak   s low ceilinged  dark shop had plenty to spend your money on .  zakzak was indeed a dwarf  and they   re not traditionally interested in using magic  but he certainly knew how to display merchandise  which is what they are very good at .   there were wands  mostly of metal  some of rare woods .  some had shiny crystals stuck on them  which of course made them more expensive .  there were bottles of colored glass in the potions section  and oddly enough  the smaller the bottle  the more expensive it was .      that   s because there   s often very rare ingredients  like the tears of some rare snake or something     said annagramma .      i didn   t know snakes cried     said tiffany .      don   t they .  oh  well  i expect that   s why it   s expensive .      there was plenty of other stuff .  shambles hung from the ceiling  much prettier and more interesting than the working ones that tiffany had seen .  since they were made up complete  then surely they were dead  just like the ones miss level kept for ornamentation .  but they looked good   and looking was important .   there were even stones for looking into .      crystal balls     said annagramma as tiffany picked one up .     careful .  they   re very expensive .     she pointed to a sign  which had been placed thoughtfully among the glittering globes .  it said       lovely to look at  nice to hold  if you drop it  you get torn apart by wild horses     tiffany held the biggest one in her hand and saw how mr .  stronginthearm moved slightly away from his counter  ready to rush forward with a bill if she dropped it .      miss tick uses a saucer of water with a bit of ink poured into it     she said .     and she usually borrows the water and cadges the ink  at that .         oh  a fundamentalist     said annagramma .     letice   that   s mrs .  earwig   says they let us down terribly .  do we really want people to think witches are just a bunch of mad old women who look like crows .  that   s so gingerbread cottagey .  we really ought to be professional about these things .         hmm     said tiffany  throwing the crystal ball up into the air and catching it again with one hand .     people should be made to fear witches .         well  er  certainly they should respect us     said annagramma .     um   i should be careful with that  if i was you    .         why .     said tiffany  tossing the ball over her shoulder .      that was finest quartz .     shouted zakzak  rushing around his counter .      oh  tiffany     said annagramma  shocked and trying not to giggle .   zakzak rushed past them to where the shattered ball lay in hundreds of very expensive fragmen        did not lie in very expensive fragments .   both he and annagramma turned to tiffany .   she was spinning the crystal globe on the tip of her finger .      quickness of the hand deceives the eye     she said .      but i heard it smash .     said zakzak .      deceives the ear  too     said tiffany  putting the ball back on its stand .     i don   t want this  but      and she pointed a finger      i   ll take that necklace and that one and the one with the cats and that ring and a set of those and two  no  three of those and   what are these .         um  that   s a book of night     said annagramma nervously .     it   s a sort of magical diary .  you write down what you   ve been working on    .      tiffany picked up the leather bound book .  it had an eye set in heavier leather on the cover .  the eye rolled to look at her .  this was a real witch   s diary  and much more impressive than some shamefully cheap old book bought off a peddler .      whose eye was it .     said tiffany .     anyone interesting .         er  i get the books from the wizards at unseen university     said zakzak  still shaken .     they   re not real eyes  but they   re clever enough to swivel around until they see another eye .         it just blinked     said tiffany .      very clever people  wizards     said the dwarf  who knew a sale when he saw one .     shall i wrap it up for you .         yes     said tiffany .     wrap everything up .  and now can anyone hear me .  show me the clothes department           where there were hats .  there are fashions in witchery  just like everything else .  some years the slightly concertina   d look is in  and you   ll even see the point twisting around so much it   s nearly pointing at the ground .  there are varieties even in the most traditional hat  upright cone  black   such as the countrywoman  inside pockets  waterproof   the cloudbuster  low drag coefficient for broomstick use   and  quite importantly  the safety  guaranteed to survive    percent of falling farmhouses  .   tiffany chose the tallest upright cone .  it was more than two feet high and had big stars sewn on it .      ah  the sky scraper .  very much your look     said zakzak  bustling around and opening drawers .     it   s for the witch on the way up  who knows what she wants and doesn   t care how many frogs it takes  aha .  incidentally  many ladies like a cloak with that .  now  we have the midnight  pure wool  fine knit  very warm  but      he gave tiffany a knowing look      we currently have very limited supplies of the zephyr billow  just in  very rare  black as coal and thin as a shadow .  completely useless for keeping you warm or dry  but it looks fabulous in even the slightest breeze .  observe .      he held up the cloak and blew gently .  it billowed out almost horizontally  flapping and twisting like a sheet in a gale .      oh  yes     breathed annagramma .      i   ll take it     said tiffany .     i shall wear it to the witch trials on saturday .         well  if you win  be sure to tell everyone you bought it here     said zakzak .      when i win  i shall tell them i got it at a considerable discount     said tiffany .      oh  i don   t do discounts     said zakzak  as loftily as a dwarf can manage .   tiffany stared at him  then picked up one of the most expensive wands from the display .  it glittered .      that   s a number six     whispered annagramma .     mrs .  earwig has one of those .         i see it   s got runes on it     said tiffany  and something about the way she said it made zakzak go pale .      well  of course     said annagramma .     you   ve got to have runes .         these are in oggham     said tiffany  smiling nastily at zakzak .     it   s a very ancient language of the dwarfs .  shall i tell you what they say .  they say    oh what a wally is waving this .            don   t you take that nasty lying tone with me  young lady .     said the dwarf .     who   s your mistress .  i know your type .  learn one spell and you think you   re mistress weatherwax .  i   m not standing for this kind of behavior .  brian .      there was a rustling from the bead curtains that led to the back of the shop  and a wizard appeared .   you could tell he was a wizard .  wizards never want you to have to guess .  he had long flowing robes with stars and magical symbols on them  there were even some sequins .  his beard would have been long and flowing if indeed he   d been the kind of young man who could really grow a beard .  instead  it was ragged and wispy and not very clean .  and the general effect was also spoiled by the fact that he was smoking a cigarette  and had a mug of tea in his hand and a face that looked a bit like something that lives under damp logs .   the mug was chipped  and on it were the jolly words you don   t have to be magic to work here but it helps .      yeah .     he asked  adding reproachfully     i was on my tea break  you know .         this young   lady is being awkward     said zakzak .     throwing magic about .  talking back and being smart at me .  the usual stuff .      brian looked at tiffany .  she smiled .      brian   s been to unseen university     said zakzak with a    so there    smirk .     got a degree .  what he doesn   t know about magic could fill a book .  these ladies need showing the way out  brian .         now then  ladies     said brian nervously  putting down his mug .     do what mr .  stronginthearm says and push off  right .  we don   t want trouble  do we .  go on  there   s good kids .         why do you need a wizard to protect you  with all these magical amulets around the place  mr .  stronginthearm .     said tiffany sweetly .   zakzak turned to brian .     what   re you standing there for .     he demanded .     she   s doing it again .  i pay you  don   t i .  put a    fluence on    em or something .         well  er   that one could be a bit of an awkward customer       brian said  nodding toward tiffany .      if you studied wizardry  brian  then you know about conservation of mass  don   t you .     she said .     i mean  you know what really happens when you try to turn someone into a frog .         well  er       the wizard began .      ha .  that   s just a figure of speech .     snapped zakzak .     i   d like to see you turn someone into a frog .         wish granted     said tiffany  and waved the wand .   brian started to say     look  when i said i   d been to unseen university  i meant        but he ended up saying     erk .          take the eye away from tiffany  up through the shop  high  high above the village until the landscape spreads out in a patchwork of fields  woods  and mountains .   the magic spreads out like the ripples made when a stone is dropped in water .  within a few miles of the place it makes shambles spin and breaks the threads of curse nets .  as the ripples widen  the magic gets fainter  although it never dies and still can be felt by things far more sensitive than any shamble    .   let the eye move and fall now on this woods  this clearing  this cottage    .   there is nothing on the walls but whitewash  nothing on the floor but cold stone .  the huge fireplace doesn   t even have a cooking stove .  a black teakettle hangs on a black hook over what can hardly be called a fire at all  it   s just a few little sticks huddling together .   this is the house of a life peeled to the core .   upstairs  an old woman  all in faded black  is lying on a narrow bed .  but you wouldn   t think she was dead  because there is a big card on a string around her neck that reads      i ate   nt dead        and you have to believe it when it   s written down like that .   her eyes are shut  her hands are crossed on her chest  her mouth is open .   and bees crawl into her mouth  and over her ears  and all over her pillow .  they fill the room  flying in and out of the open window  where someone has put a row of saucers filled with sugary water on the sill .   none of the saucers match  of course .  a witch never has matching crockery .  but the bees work on  coming and going   busy as bees .   when the ripple of magic passes through  the buzz rises to a roar .  bees pour in through the window urgently  as though driven by a gale .  they land on the still old woman until her head and shoulders are a boiling mass of tiny brown bodies .   and then  as one insect  they rise in a storm and pour away into the outside air  which is full of whirling seeds from the sycamore trees outside .   mistress weatherwax sat bolt upright and said     bzzzt .     then she stuck a finger into her mouth  rootled around a bit  and pulled out a struggling bee .  she blew on it and shooed it out of the window .   for a moment her eyes seemed to have many facets  just like a bee   s .      so     she said .     she   s learned how to borrow  has she .  or she   s been borrowed .          annagramma fainted .  zakzak stared  too afraid to faint .      you see     said tiffany  while something in the air went gloop  gloop above them     a frog weighs only a few ounces  but brian weighs  oh  about a hundred and twenty pounds  yes .  so to turn someone big into a frog  you   ve got to find something to do with all the bits you can   t fit into a frog  right .      she bent down and lifted up the pointy wizard   s hat on the floor .      happy  brian .     she asked .  a small frog  squatting in a heap of clothes  looked up and said     erk .      zakzak didn   t look at the frog .  he was looking at the thing that went gloop  gloop .  it was like a large pink balloon full of water  quite pretty really  wobbling gently against the ceiling .      you   ve killed him .     he mumbled .      what .  oh  no .  that   s just the stuff he doesn   t need right now .  it   s sort of   spare brian .         erk     said brian .  gloop went the rest of him .      about this discount       zakzak began hurriedly .     ten percent would be        tiffany waved the wand .  behind her  the whole display of crystals rose in the air and began to orbit one another in a glittering and  above all  fragile way .      that wand shouldn   t do that .     he said .      of course it can   t .  it   s rubbish .  but i can     said tiffany .     ninety percent discount  did i hear you say .  think quickly  i   m getting tired .  and the spare brian is getting   heavy .         you can keep it all .     zakzak screamed .     for free .  just don   t let him splash .  please .         no  no  i   d like you to stay in business     said tiffany .     a ninety percent discount would be fine .  i   d like you to think of me as   a friend    .         yes .  yes .  i am your friend .  i   m a very friendly person .  now please put him baaack .  please .     zakzak dropped to his knees  which wasn   t very far .     please .  he   s not really a wizard .  he just did evening classes there in fretwork .  they hire out classrooms  that sort of thing .  he thinks i don   t know .  but he read a few of the magic books on the quiet and he pinched the robes and he can talk wizard lingo so   s you   d hardly know the difference .  please .  i   d never get a real wizard for the money i pay him .  don   t hurt him  please .      tiffany waved a hand .  there was a moment even more unpleasant than the one that had ended up with the spare brian bumping against the ceiling  and then the whole brian stood there  blinking .      thank you .  thank you .  thank you .     gasped zakzak .   brian blinked .     what just happened .     he asked .   zakzak  beside himself with horror and relief  patted him frantically .      you   re all there .     he said .     you   re not a balloon .         here  get off .     said brian  pushing him away .   there was a groan from annagramma .  she opened her eyes  saw tiffany  and tried to scramble to her feet and back away  which meant that she went backward like a spider .      please don   t do that to me .  please don   t .     she shouted .   tiffany ran after her and pulled her to her feet .      i wouldn   t do anything to you  annagramma     she said happily .     you   re my friend .  we   re all friends .  isn   t that nice please please stop me            you had to remember that pictsies weren   t brownies .  in theory brownies would do the housework for you if you left them a saucer of milk .   the nac mac feegle   wouldn   t .   oh  they   d try  if they liked you and you didn   t insult them with milk in the saucer .  they were helpful .  they just weren   t good at it .  for example  you shouldn   t try to remove a stubborn stain from a plate by repeatedly hitting it with your head .   and you didn   t want to see a sink full of them and your best china .  or a precious pot rolling backward and forward across the floor while the feegles inside simultaneously fought the ground in dirt and each other .   but miss level  once she   d got the better china out of the way  found she rather liked the feegles .  there was something unsquashable about them .  and they were entirely unamazed by a woman with two bodies too .      ach  that   s nothin        rob anybody had said .     when we wuz raidin    for the quin  we once found a world where there wuz people wi    five bodies each .  all sizes  ye ken  for doin    a    kinds of jobs .         really .     said both of miss level .      aye  and the biggest body had a huge left hand  just for openin    pickle jars .         those lids can get very tight  it   s true     miss level had agreed .      oh  we saw some muckle eldritch places when we wuz raiding for the quin     said rob anybody .     but we gave that up  for she wuz a schemin     greedy  ill fared carlin  that she was .         aye  and it wuz no    because she threw us oout o    fairyland for being completely pished at two in the afternoon  whatever any scunner might mphf mphf       said daft wullie .      pished .     said miss level .      aye   oh  aye  it means   tired .  aye .  tired .  that   s whut it means     said rob anybody  holding his hands firmly over his brother   s mouth .     an    ye dinna ken how to talk in front o    a lady  yah shammerin    wee scunner .         er   thank you for doing the dishes     said miss level .     you really didn   t need to           ach  it wasna any trouble     said rob anybody cheerfully  letting daft wullie go .     an    i   m sure all them plates an    stuff will mend fine wi    a bit o    glue .      miss level looked up at the clock with no hands .      it   s getting late     she said .     what exactly is it you propose to do  mr .  anybody .         whut .         do you have a plan .         oh  aye .      rob anybody rummaged around in his spog  which is a leather bag most feegles have hanging from their belt .  the contents are usually a mystery but sometimes include interesting teeth .   he flourished a much folded piece of paper .   miss level carefully unfolded it .         pln    .     she said .      aye     said rob proudly .     we came prepared .  look  it   s written doon .  pee el ner .  plan .         er   how can i put this       miss level mused .     ah  yes .  you came rushing all this way to save tiffany from a creature that can   t be seen  touched  smelled  or killed .  what did you intend to do when you found it .      rob anybody scratched his head  to a general shower of objects .      i think mebbe you   ve put yer finger on the one weak spot  mistress     he admitted .      do you mean you charge in regardless .         oh  aye .  that   s the plan  sure enough     said rob anybody  brightening up .      and then what happens .         weel  gen   raly people are tryin    tae wallop us by then  so we just make it up as we gae along .         yes  robert  but the creature is inside her head .      rob anybody gave billy a questioning look .      robert is a heich heidit way o    sayin    rob     said the gonnagle  and to save time he said to miss level     that means kinda posh .         ach  we can get inside her heid  if we have to     said rob .     i   d hoped tae get here afore the thing got to her  but we can chase it .      miss level   s face was a picture .  two pictures .      inside her head .     she said .      oh  aye     said rob  as if that sort of thing happened every day .     no problemo .  we can get in or oout o    anywhere .  except maybe pubs  which for some reason we ha    trouble leavin    .  a heid .  easy .         sorry  we   re talking about a real head here  are we .     said miss level  horrified .     what do you do  go in through the ears .      once again  rob stared at billy  who looked puzzled .      no  mistress .  they   d be too small     he said patiently .     but we can move between worlds  ye ken .  we   re fairy folk .      miss level nodded both heads .  it was true  but it was hard to look at the assembled ranks of the nac mac feegle and remember that they were  technically  fairies .  it was like watching penguins swimming underwater and having to remember that they were birds .      and .     she said .      we can get intae dreams  ye see    .  and what   s a mind but another world o    dreamin    .         no  i must forbid that .     said miss level .     i can   t have you running around inside a young girl   s head .  i mean  look at you .  you   re fully grow   well  you   re men .  it   d be like  like   well  it   d be like you looking at her diary .      rob anybody looked puzzled .      oh  aye .     he said .     we looked at her diary loads o    times .  nae harm done .         you looked at her diary .     said miss level  horrified .     why .      really  she thought later  she should have expected the answer .         cuz it wuz locked     said daft wullie .     if she didna want anyone tae look at it  why   d she keep it at the back o    her sock drawer .  anyway  all there wuz wuz a load o    words we couldna unnerstan    an    wee drawings o    hearts and flowers an    that .         hearts .  tiffany .     said miss level .     really .     she shook herself .     but you shouldn   t have done that .  and going into someone   s mind is even worse .         the hiver is in there  mistress     said awf   ly wee billy meekly .      but you said you can   t do anything about it .         she might .  if we can track her doon     said the gonnagle .     if we can find the wee bitty bit o    her that   s still her .  she   s a bonny fighter when she   s roused .  ye see  mistress  a mind   s like a world itself .  she   ll be hidin    in it somewhere  lookin    oout though her own eyes  listenin    wi    her own ears  tryin    to make people hear  tryin    no    to let yon beast find her   and it   ll be hunting her all the time  trying tae break her doon    .      miss level began to look hunted herself .  fifty small faces  full of worry and hope and broken noses  looked up at her .  and she knew she didn   t have a better plan .  or even a pln .      all right     she said .     but at least you ought to have a bath .  i know that   s silly  but it will make me feel better about the whole thing .      there was a general groan .      a bath .  but we a    had one no    a year ago     said rob anybody .     up at the big dew pond for the ships .         ach  crivens .     said big yan .     ye canna ask a man tae take a bath again this soon  mistress .  there   ll be nothin    left o    us .         with hot water and soap .     said miss level .     i mean it .  i   ll run the water and i   i   ll put some rope over the edge so you can climb in and out  but you will get clean .  i   m a wi   a hag  and you   d better do what i say .         oh  all reet .     said rob .     we   ll do it for the big wee hag .  but ye   re no    tae peek  okay .         peek .     said miss level .  she pointed a trembling finger .     get into that bathroom now .          miss level did  however  listen at the door .  it   s the sort of thing a witch does .   there was nothing to hear at first but the gentle splash of water  and then      this is no    as bad as i thought .         aye  very pleasin    .         hey  there   s a big yellow duck here .  who   re ye pointin    that beak at  yer scunner        there was a wet quack and some bubbling noises as the rubber duck sank .      rob  we oughta get one o    these put in back in the mound .  verra warmin    in the wintertime .         aye  it   s no    that good for the ship  havin    tae drink oout o    that pond after we   ve been bathin    .  it   s terrible  hearin    a ship try tae spit .         ach  it   ll make us softies .  it   s nae a guid wash if ye dinna ha    the ice formin    on yer heid .         who   re you callin    a softie .      there followed a lot more splashing  and water started to seep under the door .   miss level knocked .      come on out now  and dry yourselves off .     she commanded .     she could be back at any minute .      in fact  it wasn   t for another two hours  by which time miss level had got so nervous that her necklaces jingled all the time .   she   d come to witching later than most  being naturally qualified by reason of the two bodies  but she   d never been very happy about magic .  in truth  most witches could get through their whole lives without having to do serious  undeniable magic  making shambles and curse nets and dream catchers didn   t really count  being rather more like arts and crafts  and most of the rest of it was practical medicine  common sense  and the ability to look stern in a pointy hat  .  but being a witch and wearing the big black hat was like being a policeman .  people saw the uniform  not you .  when the mad axeman was running down the street  you weren   t allowed to back away  muttering     could you find someone else .  actually  i mostly just do  you know  stray dogs and road safety    .     you were there  you had the hat  you did the job .  that was a basic rule of witchery  it   s up to you .   she was two bags of nerves when tiffany arrived back  and stood side by side holding hands with herself to give herself confidence .      where have you been  dear .         out     said tiffany .      and what have you been doing .         nothing .         i see you   ve been shopping .         yes .         who with .         nobody .         ah  yes     miss level trilled  completely adrift .     i remember when i used to go out and do nothing .  sometimes you can be your own worst company .  believe me  i know        but tiffany had already swept upstairs .   without anyone actually seeming to move  feegles started to appear everywhere in the room .      well  that could ha    gone better     said rob anybody .      she looked so different .     miss level burst out .     she moved differently .  i just didn   t know what to do .  and those clothes .         aye .  sparklin    like a young raven     said rob .      did you see all those bags .  where could she have got the money .  i certainly don   t have that kind of        she stopped  and both of miss level spoke .      oh  no              surely not .  she wouldn   t              have  would she .         i dinna ken whut ye   re talkin    aboot     said awf   ly wee billy     but whut she would dae isna the point .  that   s the hiver doin    the thinkin    .      miss level clasped all four hands together in distress .     oh dear   i must go down to the village and check .      one of her ran toward the door .      well  at least she   s brought the broomstick back     muttered the miss level who stayed .  she started to wear the slightly unfocused expression she got when both her bodies weren   t in the same place .   they could hear noises from upstairs .      i vote we just tap her gently on the heid     said big yan .     it canna give us any trouble if it   s gone sleepies  aye .      miss level clenched and unclenched her fists nervously .     no     she said .     i   ll go up there and have a serious talk with her .         i told yez  mistress  it   s not her     said awf   ly wee billy wearily .      well at least i   ll wait until i   ve visited mr .  weavall     said miss level  standing in her kitchen .     i   m nearly there   ah   he   s asleep .  i   ll just eease the box out quietly    .  if she   s taken his money  i   m going to be so angry            it was a good hat  tiffany thought .  it was at least as tall as mrs .  earwig   s hat  and it shone darkly .  the stars gleamed .   the other packages covered the floor and the bed .  she pulled out another one of the black dresses  the one covered in lace  and the cloak  which spread out in the air .  she really liked the cloak .  in anything but a complete dead calm  it floated and billowed as if whipped by a gale .  if you were going to be a witch  you had to start by looking like one .   she twirled in it once or twice and then said something without thinking  so that the hiver part of her was caught unawares .      see me .      the hiver was suddenly thrust outside her body .  tiffany was free .  she hadn   t expected it    .   she felt herself to the tips of her fingers .  she dived toward the bed  grabbed one of zakzak   s best wands  and waved it desperately in front of her like a weapon .      you stay out .     she said .     stay away .  it   s my body  not yours .  you   ve made it do dreadful things .  you stole mr .  weavall   s money .  look at these stupid clothes .  and don   t you know about eating and drinking .  you stay away .  you   re not coming back .  don   t you dare .  i   ve got power  you know .      so have we  said her own voice in her own head .  yours .   they fought .  a watcher would have seen only a girl in a black dress  spinning around the room and flailing her arms as if she   d been stung  but tiffany fought for every toe  every finger .  she bounced off a wall  banged against the chest of drawers  slammed into another wall        and the door was flung open .   one of miss level was there  no longer nervous but trembling with rage .  she pointed a shaking finger .      listen to me  whoever you are .  did you steal mr .        she began .   the hiver turned .   the hiver struck .   the hiver   killed .       chapter        the secret land      it   s bad enough being dead .  waking up and seeing a nac mac feegle standing on your chest and peering intently at you from an inch away only makes things worse .   miss level groaned .  it felt as though she was lying on the floor .      ach  this one   s alive  right enough     said the feegle .     told yez .  that   s a weasel skull ye owe me .      miss level blinked one set of eyes and then froze in horror .      what happened to me .     she whispered .   the feegle in front of her was replaced by the face of rob anybody .  it was not an improvement .      how many fingers am i holdin    up .     he said .      five     whispered miss level .      am i .  ah  well  ye could be right  ye   d have the knowin    o    the countin        said rob  lowering his hand .     ye   ve had a wee bittie accident  ye ken .  you   re a wee bittie dead .      miss level   s head slumped back .  through the mist of something that wasn   t exactly pain  she heard rob anybody say to someone she couldn   t see      hey  i wuz breakin    it tae her gently .  i did say    wee bittie    twice  right .         it   s as though part of me is   a long way off     murmured miss level .      aye  you   re aboout right there     said rob  champion of the bedside manner .   some memories bobbed to the surface of the thick soup in miss level   s mind .      tiffany killed me  didn   t she .     she said .     i remember seeing that black figure turn around  and her expression was horrible           that wuz the hiver     said rob anybody .     that was no    tiffany .  she was fightin    it .  she still is  inside .  but it didna remember you ha    two bodies .  we got tae help her  mistress .      miss level pushed herself upright .  it wasn   t pain she felt  but it was the   ghost of pain .      what happened to me .     she said  weakly .      there was like  an explosion  an    smoke an    that     said rob .     not messy  really .         oh  well  that   s a small mercy  anyway     said miss level  sagging back .      aye  there was just this  like  big purple cloud o     like  dust     said daft wullie .      where   s my   i can   t feel   where   s my other body .         aye  that was what got blown up in that big cloud  right enough     said rob .     good job ye hae a spare  eh .         she   s all mithered in her heid     whispered awf   ly wee billy .     take it gently  eh .         how do you manage  seeing only one side of things .     said miss level dreamily to the world in general .     how will i get everything done with only one pair of hands and feet .  being in just one place all the time   how do people manage .  it   s impossible    .      she shut her eyes .      mistress level  we need ye .     shouted rob anybody into her ear .      need  need  need     murmured miss level .     everyone needs a witch .  no one cares if a witch needs .  giving and giving always   a fairy godmother never gets a wish  let me tell you           mistress level .     rob screamed .     ye cannae pass oout on us noo .         i   m weary     whispered miss level .     i   m very  very pished .         mistress level .     rob anybody yelled .     the big wee hag is lying on the floor like a dead person  but she   s cold as ice and sweatin    like a horse .  she   s fightin    the beast inside her  mistress .  and she   s losin    .     rob peered into miss level   s face and shook his head .     auchtahelweit .  she   s swooned .  c   mon  lads  let   s move her .      like many small creatures  feegles are immensely strong for their size .  it still took ten of them to carry miss level up the narrow stairs without banging her head more than necessary  although they did use her feet to push open the door to tiffany   s room .   tiffany lay on the floor .  sometimes a muscle twitched .   miss level was propped up like a doll .      how   re we gonna bring the big hag roound .     said big yan .      i heard where ye has to put someone   s heid between their legs     said rob doubtfully .   daft wullie sighed and drew his sword .     sounds a wee bit drastic tae me     he said     but if someone will help me hold her steady        miss level opened her eyes  which was just as well .  she focused unsteadily on the feegles and smiled a strange  happy little smile .      ooo  fairies .     she mumbled .      ach  noo she   s ramblin        said rob anybody .      she means fairies like bigjobs think they are     said awf   ly wee billy .     tiny wee tinkly creatures that live in flowers an    fly aroound cuddlin    butterflies an    that .         what .  have they no    seen real fairies .  they   re worse   n wasps .     said big yan .      we havna got time for this .     snapped rob anybody .  he jumped onto miss level   s knee .      aye  ma   am  we   s fairies from the land o          he stopped and looked imploringly at billy .      tinkle .     billy suggested .      aye  the land o   tinkle  ye ken  and we found this puir wee              princess     said billy .      aye  princess  who   s been attacked by a bunch o    scunners              wicked goblins     said billy .         yeah  wicked goblins  right  an    she   s in a bad way  so we wuz wonderin    if ye could kinda tell us how tae look after her              until the handsome prince turns up on a big white horse wi    curtains roound it an    wakes her with a magical kiss     said billy .   rob gave him a desperate look and turned back to the bemused miss level .      aye  what ma friend fairy billy just said     he managed .   miss level tried to focus .      you   re very ugly for fairies     she said .      aye  well  the ones you gen   rally see are for the pretty flowers  ye ken     said rob anybody  inventing desperately .     we   re more for the stingin    nettles and bindweed an    old man   s troosers an    thistles  okay .  it wouldna be fair for only the bonny flowers tae have fairies noo  would it .  it   d prob   ly be against the law  eh .  noo  can ye please help us wi    this princess here before them scunners              wicked goblins       said billy .      aye  before they come back     said rob .   panting  he watched miss level   s face .  there seemed to be a certain amount of thinking going on .      is her pulse rapid .     murmured miss level .     you say her skin is cold but she   s sweating .  is she breathing rapidly .  it sounds like shock .  keep her warm .  raise her legs .  watch her carefully .  try to remove   the cause    .     her head slumped .   rob turned to awf   ly wee billy .      a horse wi    curtains roound it .     he said .     where did ye get all that blethers .         there   s a big hoouse near the long lake  an    they read stories tae their wee bairn an    i got along an    listened fra    a mousehole     said awf   ly wee billy .     one day i snuck in and looked at the pichoors  and there was bigjobs called k   nits wi    shields and armor and horses wi    curtains           weel  it worked  blethers though it be     said rob anybody .  he looked at tiffany .  she was lying down  so he was about as high as her chin .  it was like walking around a small hill .     crivens  it does me nae guid at all ta see the puir wee thing like this     he said  shaking his head .     c   mon  lads  get that cover off the bed and put that cushion under her feet .         er  rob .     said daft wullie .      aye .     rob was staring up at the unconscious tiffany .      how are we goin    tae get inta her heid .  there   s got tae be somethin    tae guide us in .         aye  wullie  an    i ken whut it   s gonna be     cuz i   ve been usin    mah heid for thinkin    .     said rob .     ye   ve seen the big wee hag often enough  right .  well  see this necklet .      he reached up .  the silver horse had slipped around tiffany   s neck as she lay on the floor .  it hung there  amid the amulets and dark glitter .      aye .     said wullie .      it was a present from that son o    the baron     said rob .     an    she   s kept it .  she   s tried tae turn hersel    intae some kind of creature o    the night  but somethin    made her keep this .  it   ll be in her heid  too .     tis important tae her .  all we need tae do is frannit a wheelstone on it and it   ll tak    us right where she is .       daft wullie scratched his head .      but i thought she thought he was just a big pile of jobbies .     he said .     i seen her oout walkin     an    when he comes ridin    past  she sticks her nose in th    air and looks the other wa    .  in fact  sometimes i seen her wait aroound a full five and twenty minutes for him tae come past  just so   s she can do that .         ah  weel  no man kens the workin   s o    the female mind     said rob anybody loftily .     we   ll follow the horse .          from fairies and how to avoid them by miss perspicacia tick   no one knows exactly how the nac mac feegle step from one world to another .  those who have seen feegles actually travel this way say that they apparently throw back their shoulders and thrust out one leg straight ahead of them .  then they wiggle their foot and are gone .  this is known as    the crawstep     and the only comment on the subject by a feegle is    it   s all in the ankle movement  ye ken .     they appear to be able to travel magically between worlds of all kinds but not within a world .  for this purpose  they assure people  they have    feets .          the sky was black  even though the sun was high .  it hung at just past noon  lighting the landscape as brilliantly as a hot summer day  but the sky was midnight black  shorn of stars .   this was the landscape of tiffany aching   s mind .   the feegles looked around them .  there seemed to be downland underfoot  rolling and green .      she tells the land what it is .  the land tells her who she is     whispered awf   ly wee billy .     she really does hold the soul o    the land in her heid .            aye  so    tis     muttered rob anybody .     but there   s nae creatures  ye ken .  nae ships .  nae burdies .         mebbe   mebbe somethin   s scared them awa    .     said daft wullie .   there was  indeed  no life .  stillness and silence ruled here .  in fact tiffany  who cared a lot about getting words right  would have said it was a hush  which is not the same as silence .  a hush is what you get in cathedrals at midnight .      okay  lads     rob anybody whispered .     we dinna ken what we   re goin    tae find  so ye tread as light as e   er foot can fall  unnerstan    .  let   s find the big wee hag .      they nodded  and stepped forward like ghosts .   the land rose slightly ahead of them  to some kind of earthworks .  they advanced on it carefully  wary of ambush  but nothing stopped them as they climbed two long mounds in the turf that made a sort of cross .      manmade     said big yan  when they reached the top .     just like in the old days  rob .     the silence sucked his speech away .      this is deep inside o    the big wee hag   s head     said rob anybody  looking around warily .     we dinna know whut made    em .         i dinna like this  rob     said a feegle .     it   s too quiet .         aye  slightly sane georgie  it is that           you are my sunshine  my only su           daft wullie .     snapped rob  without taking his eyes off the strange landscape .   the singing stopped .     aye  rob .     said daft wullie from behind him .      ye ken i said i   d tell ye when ye wuz guilty o    stupid and inna pro pree ate behavior .         aye  rob     said daft wullie .     that wuz another one o    those times  wuz it .         aye .      they moved on again  staring around them .  and still there was the hush .  it was the pause before an orchestra plays  the quietness before thunder .  it was as if all the small sounds of the hills had shut down to make room for one big sound to happen .   and then they found the horse .   they   d seen it  back on the chalk .  but here it was not carved into the hillside but spread out before them .  they stared at it .      awf   ly wee billy .     said rob  beckoning the young gonnagle toward him .     you   re a gonnagle  ye ken aboout poetry and dreams .  what   s this .  why   s it up here .  it shouldna be on the top o    the hills .         serious hiddlins  mr .  rob     said billy .     this is serious hiddlins .  i canna work it out yet .         she knows the chalk .  why   d she get this wrong .         i   m thinkin    aboout it  mr .  rob .         you wouldna care tae think a bit faster  would ye .         rob .     said big yan  hurrying up .  he   d been scouting ahead .      aye .     said rob gloomily .      ye   d better come and see this .      on top of a round hill was a four wheeled shepherding hut  with a curved roof and a chimney for the potbellied stove .  inside  the walls were covered with the yellow and blue wrappers from hundreds of packets of jolly sailor tobacco .  there were old sacks hanging up there  and the back of the door was covered with chalk marks where granny aching had counted sheep and days .  and there was a narrow iron bedstead  made comfortable with old fleeces and feed sacks .      d   ye have the unnerstandin    of this  awf   ly wee billie .     said rob .     can ye tell us where the big wee hag is .      the young gonnagle looked worried .     er  mister rob  ye ken i   ve only just been made a gonnagle .  i mean  i know the songs an    a     but i   m no    verra experienced at this    .         aye .     said rob anybody .     an    just how many gonnagles afore ye ha    walked through the dreams o    a hag .         er   none i   ve ever heard of  mister rob     billy confessed .      aye .  so you already know more aboout it than any o    them big men     said rob .  he gave the boy a smile .     do yer best  laddie .  i dinna expect any more of you than that .      billy looked out of the shed door and took a deep breath     then i   ll tell ye i think she   s hidin    somewhere close  like a hunted creature  mr .  rob .  this is a wee bit o    her memory  the place o    her granny  the place where she   s always felt safe .  i   ll tell ye i think that we   re in the soul and center o    her .  the bit o    her that is her .  and i   m frightened for her .  frightened to mah boots .         why .         because i   ve been watchin    the shadows  mr .  rob     said billy .     the sun is movin    .  it   s slippin    doon the sky .         aye  weel  that   s whut the sun does       rob began .   billy shook his head .     nay  mr .  rob .  ye dinna understand .  i   m tellin    ye that   s no    the sun o    the big wide world .  that   s the sun o    the soul o    her .      the feegles looked at the sun  and at the shadows  then back at billy .  he   d stuck his chin out bravely  but he was trembling .      she   ll die when night comes .     rob said .      there   s worser things than death  mr .  rob .  the hiver will have her  head tae toe           that is nae gonna happen .     shouted rob anybody  so suddenly that billy backed away .     she   s a strong big wee lass .  she fought the quin wi    no more than a fryin    pan .      awf   ly wee billy swallowed .  there were a lot of things he   d rather do than face rob anybody now .  but he pressed on .      sorry  mr .  rob  but i   m telling ye she had iron then  an    she wuz on her ain turf .  she   s a lang  lang way fra    hame here .  an    it   ll squeeze this place when it finds it  leave no more room for it  and the night will come  an                 scuse me  rob .  i ha    an idea .      it was daft wullie  twisting his hands nervously .  everyone turned to look at him .      ye ha    an idea .     said rob .      aye  an    if i tell youse  i dinna want you ta    say it   s inna pro pree ate  okay  rob .      rob anybody sighed .     okay  wullie ye ha    my word on it .         weel     said wullie  his fingers knotting and unknotting     what is this place if it   s not truly her ain place .  what is it if not her ain turf .  if she canna fight the creature here  she canna fight it anywhere .         but it willna come here     said billy .     it doesna need to .  as she grows weaker  this place will fade away .         oh  crivens     mumbled daft wullie .     weel  it was a good idea  right .  even if it doesna work .      rob anybody wasn   t paying any attention .  he stared around the shepherding hut .  my man   s got to use his heid for something other than nuttin    folk  jeannie had said .      daft wullie is right     he said quietly .     this is her safe place .  she holds the land  she has it in her eye .  the creature can ne   er touch her here .  here she has power .  but    twill be a jailhoouse for her here unless she fights the monster .  she   d be locked in here and watch her life gae doon the cludgie .  she   ll look oot at the world like a pris   ner at a tiny window  and see hersel    hated and feared .  so we   ll fetch the beast in here against its will  and here it will die .      the feegles cheered .  they weren   t sure what was going on  but they liked the sound of it .      how .     said awf   ly wee billy .      ye had to gae and ask that  eh .     said rob anybody bitterly .     an    i wuz doin    sae weel wi    the thinkin           he turned .  there was a scratching noise on the door above him .   up there  across the rows and rows of half rubbed out markings  freshly chalked letters were appearing one by one  as if an invisible hand was writing them .      worrds     said rob anybody .     she   s tryin    tae tell us somethin    .         yes  they say       billy began .      i ken weel what they say .     snapped rob anybody .     i ha    the knowin    of the readin    .  they say        he looked up again .     okay  they say   that   s the snake  an    that   s the kinda like a gate letter  an    the comb on its side  two o    that  an    the fat man standin    still  an    the snake again  and then there   s whut we calls a    space     and then there   s the letter like a saw   s teeth  and two o    the letters that   s roound like the sun  and the letter that   s a man sittin    doon .  and onna next line we ha      the man wi    his arms oot  and the letter that   s you  an    ha  the fat man again but noo he   s walkin  an    next he   s standin    still again  an    next is the comb  an    the up an    doon ziggy zaggy letter  and the man   s got his arms oot  and then there   s me  and that ziggy zaggy and we end the line with the comb again    .  an    on the next line we starts wi   the bendy hook  that   s the letter roound as the sun  them   s twa   men sittin   doon  there   s the letter reaching oout tae the sky  then there   s a space    cuz there   s nae letter  then there   s the snaky again  an    the letter like a hoouse frame  and then there   s the letter that   s me  aye  an    another fella sitting doon  an    another big roound letter  and  ha  oour ol    friend  the fat man walkin    .  the end .      he stood back  hands on hips  and demanded      there .  is that readin    i just did  or wuz it no    .     there was a cheer from the feegles  and some applause .   awf   ly wee billy looked up at the chalked words      sheeps wool  turpentine  jolly sailor     and then he looked at rob anybody   s expression .      aye  aye     he said .     ye   re doin great  mr .  rob .  sheep   s wool  turpentine  and jolly sailor tobacco .         ach  weel  anyone can read it all in one go     said rob anybody dismissively .     but youse gotta be guid to break it doon intae all the tricksie letters .  and veera guid to have the knowin    o    the meanin    o    the whole .         what is that .     asked awf   ly wee billy .      the meaning  gonnagle  is that you are gonna go stealin    .     there was a cheer from the rest of the feegles .  they hadn   t been keeping up very well  but they recognized that word all right .      an    it   s gonna be a stealin    tae remember .     rob yelled  to another cheer .     daft wullie .         aye .         ye   ll be in charge .  ye ha    not got the brains o    a beetle  brother o    mine  but when it comes tae the thievin     ye hae no equal in this wurld .  ye   ve got tae fetch turpentine and fresh sheep wool and some o    the jolly sailor baccy .  ye got tae get them to the big hag wi    twa    bodies .  tell her she must mak    the hiver smell them  right .  it   ll bring it here .  and ye   d best be quick  because that sun is movin    down the sky .  ye   ll be stealin    fra   time itself   aye .  ye have a question .      daft wullie had raised a finger .      point o    order  rob     he said     but it was a wee bittie hurtful there for you to say i dinna hae the brains of a beetle        rob hesitated  but only for a moment .     aye  daft wullie  ye are right in whut ye say .  it was unricht o    me to say that .  it was the heat o    the moment  an    i am full sorry for it .  as i stand here before ye now  i will say  daft wullie  ye do hae the brains o    a beetle  an    i   ll fight any scunner who says different .      daft wullie   s face broke into a huge smile  then crinkled into a frown .      but ye are the leader  rob     he said .      no    on this raid  wullie .  a   m staying here .  i have every confidence that ye   ll be a fiiinne leader on this raid an    not totally mess it up like ye did the last seventeen times .      there was a general groan from the crowd .      look at the sun  will ye .     said rob  pointing .     it   s moved since we   ve been talkin    .  someone   s got tae stay wi    her .  i will no    ha    it said we left her tae die alone .  now  get movin     ye scunners  or feel the flat o    my blade .      he raised his sword and growled .  they fled .   rob anybody laid his sword down with care  then sat on the step of the shepherding hut to watch the sun .   after a while he was aware of something else    .       hamish the aviator gave miss level   s broomstick a doubtful look .  it hung a few feet above the ground  and it worried him .   he hitched up the bundle on his back that contained his parachute  although it was technically the    paradrawers     since it was made of string and an old pair of tiffany   s best sunday drawers  well washed .  they still had flowers on them  but there was nothing like them for getting a feegle safely to the ground .  he had a feeling it  or they  were going to be needed .      it   s no    got feathers     he complained .      look  we dinna ha    time to argue .     said daft wullie .     we   re in a hurry  ye ken  an    you   re the only one who knows how tae fly .         a broomstick isna flyin        said hamish .     it   s magic .  it hasna any wings .  i dinna ken that stuff .      but big yan had already thrown a piece of string over the bristle end of the stick and was climbing up .  other feegles followed .      besides  how do they steer these things .     hamish went on .      weel  how do ye do it with wi    the birdies .     daft wullie demanded .      oh  that   s easy .  ye just shift your weight  but           ach  ye   ll learn as we go     said wullie .     flying canna be that difficult .  even ducks can do it  and they have nae brains at a    .      and there was really no point in arguing  which is why  a few minutes later  hamish inched his way along the stick   s handle .  the rest of the feegles clung to the bristles at the other end  chattering .   firmly tied to the bristles was a bundle of what looked like sticks and rags  with a battered hat and the stolen beard on top of it .   at least this extra weight meant that the stick end was pointing up  toward a gap in the fruit trees .  hamish sighed  took a deep breath  pulled his goggles over his eyes  and put a hand on a shiny area of stick just in front of him .   gently  the stick began to move through the air .  there was a cheer from the feegles .      see .  told yez ye   d be okay     daft wullie called out .     but can ye no    make it go a wee bit faster .      carefully  hamish touched the shiny area again .   the stick shuddered  hung motionless for a moment  and then shot upward trailing a noise very like   arrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh    .       in the silent world of tiffany   s head  rob anybody picked up his sword again and crept across the darkening turf .   there was something there  small but moving .   it was a tiny thornbush  growing so fast that its twigs visibly moved .  its shadow danced on the grass .   rob anybody stared at it .  it had to mean something .  he watched it carefully .  little bush  growing     and then he remembered what the old kelda had told them when he   d been a wee boy .   once  the land had been all forest  heavy and dark .  then men came and cut down trees .  they let the sun in .  the grass grew up in the clearings .  the bigjobs brought in sheep  which ate the grass  and also what grew in the grass  tree seedlings .  and so the dark forests died .  there hadn   t been much life in them  not once the tree trunks closed in behind you  it had been dark as the bottom of the sea in there  the leaves far above keeping out the light .  sometimes there was the crash of a branch  or the rattle and patter as acorns the squirrels had missed bounced down  from branch to branch  into the gloom .  mostly it was just hot and silent .  around the edges of the forest were the homes of many creatures .  deep inside the forest  the everlasting forest  was the home of wood .   but the turf lived in the sun  with its hundreds of grasses and flowers and birds and insects .  the nac mac feegle knew that better than most  being so much closer to it .  what looked like a green desert at a distance was a tiny  thriving  roaring jungle    .      ach     said rob anybody .     so that   s yer game  izzit .  weel  ye   re no    takin    over in here too .      he chopped at the spindly thing with his sword and stood back .   the rustling of leaves behind him made him turn .   there were two more saplings unfolding .  and a third .  he looked across the grass and saw a dozen  a hundred tiny trees beginning their race for the sky .   worried though he was  and he was worried to his boots  rob anybody grinned .  if there   s one thing a feegle likes  it   s knowing that wherever you strike  you   re going to hit an enemy .   the sun was going down and the shadows were moving and the turf was dying .   rob charged .   arrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh         what happened during the nac mac feegle   s search for the right smell was remembered by several witnesses  quite apart from all the owls and bats who were left spinning in the air by a broomstick being navigated by a bunch of screaming little blue men  .   one of them was number     a ram owned by a not very imaginative farmer .  but all he remembered was a sudden noise in the night and a draughty feeling on his back .  that was about as exciting as it got for number     so he went back to thinking about grass .   arrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh         then there was mildred pusher  age seven  who was the daughter of the shepherd who owned number    .  one day  when she   d grown up and become a grandmother  she told her grandchildren about the night she came downstairs by candlelight for a drink of water and heard the noises under the sink    .      and there were these little voices  you see  and one said     ach  wullie  you canna drink that  look  it says    poison .     on the bottle     and another voice said     aye  gonnagle  they put that on tae frighten a man from havin    a wee drink     and the first voice said     wullie  it   s rat poison .     and the second voice said     that   s fine  then     cuz i   m no    a rat .     and then i opened the cupboard under the sink  and what do you think   it was full of fairies .  and they looked at me and i looked at them and one of them said     hey  this is a dream you   re having  big wee girl .     and immediately they all agreed .  and the first one said     so  in this dream ye   re having  big wee girl  you wouldna mind telling us where the turpentine is  wouldya .     and so i told them it was outside in the barn  and he said     aye .  then we   re offski .  but here   s a wee gift fra    the fairies for a big wee girl who   s gonna go right back tae sleep .     and then they were gone .      one of her grandchildren  who   d been listening with his mouth open  said     what did they give you  grandma .         this .     mildred held up a silver spoon .     and the strange thing is  it   s just like the ones my mother had  which vanished mysteriously from the drawer the very same night .  i   ve kept it safe ever since .      this was admired by all .  then one of the grandchildren asked     what were the fairies like  grandma .      grandma mildred thought about this .     not as pretty as you might expect     she said at last .     but definitely more smelly .  and just after they   d gone there was a sound like        arrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh         people in the king   s legs  the owner had noticed that there were lots of inns and pubs called the king   s head or the king   s arms  and spotted a gap in the market  looked up when they heard the noise outside .   after a minute or two the door burst open .      good night to ye  fellow bigjobs .     roared a figure in the doorway .   the room fell horribly silent .  awkwardly  legs going in every direction  the scarecrow figure wove unsteadily toward the bar and grabbed it thankfully  hanging on as it sagged to its knees .      a big huge wee drop o    yer finest whisky  me fine fellow barman fellow     it said from somewhere under the hat .      it seems to me that you   ve already had enough to drink  friend     said the barman  whose hand had crept to the cudgel he kept under the bar for special customers .      who   re ye calling    friend     pal .     roared the figure  trying to pull itself up .     that   s fightin    talk  that is .  and i havena had enough to drink  pal     cuz if i have  why   ve i still got all this money  eh .  answer me that .      a hand sagged into a coat pocket  came out jerkily  and slammed down onto the top of the bar .  ancient gold coins rolled in every direction  and a couple of silver spoons dropped out of the sleeve .   the silence of the bar became a lot deeper .  dozens of eyes watched the shiny discs as they spun off the bar and rolled across the floor .      an    i want an ounce o    jolly sailor baccy     said the figure .      why  certainly  sir     said the barman  who had been brought up to be respectful to gold coins .  he felt under the bar and his expression changed .      oh .  i   m sorry  sir  we   ve sold out .  very popular  jolly sailor .  but we   ve got plenty of        the figure had already turned around to face the rest of the room .      okay  i   ll gie a handful o    gold to the first scunner who gi   es me a pipeful o    jolly sailor .     it yelled .   the room erupted .  tables scraped .  chairs overturned .   the scarecrow man grabbed the first pipe and threw the coins into the air .  as fights immediately broke out  he turned back to the bar and said     and i   ll ha    that wee drop o    whisky before i go  barman .  ach  no you willna  big yan .  shame on ye .  hey  youse legs can shut up right noo .  a wee pint of whisky   ll do us no harm .  oh  aye .  who deid and made ye big man  eh .  listen  ye scunner  oour rob is in there .  aye  and he   d have a wee drink  too .      the customers stopped pushing one another out the way to get at the coins  and got up to face a whole body arguing with itself .      anywa     i   m in the heid  right .  the heid   s in charge .  i dinna ha    tae listen to a bunch o    knees .  i said this wuz a bad idea  wullie .  ye ken we ha    trouble getting oout of pubs .  well  speaking on behalf o    the legs  we   re not gonna stand by and watch the heid get pished  thank ye so veerae much .      to the horror of the customers the entire bottom half of the figure turned around and started to walk toward the door  causing the top half to fall forward .  it gripped the edge of the bar desperately  managed to say     okay .  is a deep fried pickled egg totally oout o    the question .     and then the figure        tore itself in half .  the legs staggered a few steps toward the door and fell over .   in the shocked silence a voice from somewhere in the trousers said     crivens .  time for offski .      the air blurred for a moment and the door slammed .   after a while one of the customers stepped forward cautiously and prodded the heap of old clothes and sticks that was all that remained of the visitor .  the hat rolled off  and he jumped back .   a glove that was still hanging on to the bar fell to the floor with a thwap .  that sounded very loud .      well  look at it this way     said the barman .     whatever it was  at least it   s left its pockets .      from outside came the sound of   arrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh         the broomstick hit the thatched roof of miss level   s cottage hard and stuck in it .  feegles fell off  still fighting .   in a struggling  punching mass they rolled into the cottage  conducted guerrilla warfare all the way up the stairs  and ended up in a head butting  kicking heap in tiffany   s bedroom  where those who   d been left behind to guard the sleeping girl and miss level joined in out of interest .   gradually the fighters became aware of a sound .  it was the skirl of the mousepipes  cutting through the battle like a sword .  hands stopped gripping throats  fists stopped in mid punch  kicks hovered in midair .   tears ran down awf   ly wee billy   s face as he played    the bonny flowers     the saddest song in the world .  it was about home  and mothers  and good times gone past  and faces no longer there .  the feegles let go of one another and stared down at their feet as the forlorn notes wound about them  speaking of betrayal and treachery and the breaking of promises        shame on ye .     screamed awf   ly wee billy  letting the pipe drop out of his mouth .     shame on ye .  traitors .  betrayers .  ye shame hearth and hame .  your hag is fightin    for her verra soul .  have ye no honor .     he flung down the mousepipes  which wailed into silence .     i curse my feets that let me stand here in front o    ye .  ye shame the verrae sun shinin    on ye .  ye shame the kelda that birthed ye .  traitors .  scuggans .  what ha    i done to be among this parcel o    rogues .  any man here want tae fight .  then fight me .  aye  fight me .  an    i swear by the harp o    bones i   ll tak    him tae the deeps o    the sea an    then kick him tae the craters o    the moon an    see him ride tae the pit o    heel itself on a saddle made o    hedgehogs .  i tell ye  my rage is the strength of the storm that tears mountains intae sand .  who among ye will stand agin me .      big yan  who was almost three times the size of awf   ly wee billy  cowered back as the little gonnagle stood in front of him .  not a feegle would have raised a hand at that moment  for fear of his life .  the rage of a gonnagle was a dreadful thing to see .  a gonnagle could use words like swords .   daft wullie shuffled forward .      i can see ye   re upset  gonnagle     he mumbled .        tis me that   s at fault  on account o    being daft .  i shoulda remembered aboout us and pubs .      he looked so dejected that awf   ly wee billie calmed down a little .      very well then     he said  but rather coldly because you can   t lose that much anger all at once .     we   ll not talk aboout this again .  but we will remember it  right .     he pointed to the sleeping shape of tiffany .     now pick up that wool  and the tobacco  and the turpentine  understand .  someone tak    the top off the turpentine bottle and pour a wee drop onto a bit o    cloth .  and no one  let me mak   myself clear  is tae drink any of it .      the feegles fell over themselves to obey .  there was a ripping noise as the    bit o    cloth    was obtained from the bottom of miss level   s dress .      right     said awf   ly wee billy .     daft wullie  you tak    all the three things and put them up on the big wee hag   s chest  where she can smell them .         how can she smell them when she   s oout cold like that .     asked wullie .      the nose disna sleep     said the gonnagle flatly .   the three smells of the shepherding hut were laid reverentially just below tiffany   s chin .      noo we wait     said awf   ly wee billy .     we wait  and hope .          it was hot in the little bedroom with the sleeping witches and a crowd of feegles .  it wasn   t long before the smells of sheep   s wool  turpentine  and tobacco rose and twined and filled the air    .   tiffany   s nose twitched .   the nose is a big thinker .  it   s good at memory   very good .  so good that a smell can take you back in memory so hard that it hurts .  the brain can   t stop it .  the brain has nothing to do with it .  the hiver could control brains  but it couldn   t control a stomach that threw up when it was flown on a broomstick .  and it was useless at noses    .   the smell of sheeps    wool  turpentine  and jolly sailor tobacco could carry a mind away  all the way to a silent place that was warm and safe and free from harm         the hiver opened its eyes and looked around .      the shepherding hut .     it said .   it sat up .  red light shone in through the open door  and between the trunks of the saplings growing everywhere .  many of them were quite big now and cast long shadows  putting the setting sun behind bars .  around the shepherding hut  though  they had been cut down .      this is a trick     it said .     it won   t work .  we are you .  we think like you .  we   re better at thinking like you than you are .      nothing happened .   the hiver looked like tiffany  although here it was slightly taller because tiffany thought she was slightly taller than she really was .  it stepped out of the hut and onto the turf .      it   s getting late     it said to the silence .     look at the trees .  this place is dying .  we don   t have to escape .  soon all of this will be part of us .  everything that you really could be .  you   re proud of your little piece of ground .  we can remember when there were no worlds .  we   you could change things with a wave of your hand .  you could make things right or make things wrong  and you could decide which is which .  you will never die .         then why are ye sweatin     ye big heap o    jobbies .  ach  what a scunner .     said a voice behind it .   for a moment the hiver wavered .  its shape changed  many times in the fractions of a second .  there were bits of scales  fins  teeth  a pointy hat  claws   and then it was tiffany again  smiling .      oh  rob anybody  we are glad to see you     it said .     can you help us .         dinna gi    me all that swiddle .     shouted rob  bouncing up and down in rage .     i know a hiver when i sees one .  crivens  but ye   re due a kickin    .      the hiver changed again  became a lion with teeth the size of swords and roared at him .      ach  it   s like that  is it .     said rob anybody .     dinna go awa    .     he ran a few steps and vanished .   the hiver changed back to its tiffany shape again .      your little friend has gone     it said .     come out now .  come out now .  why fear us .  we are you .  you won   t be like the rest  the dumb animals  the stupid kings  the greedy wizards .  together        rob anybody returned  followed by   well  everyone .      ye canna die     he yelled .     but we   ll make ye wish ye could .      they charged .   the feegles had the advantage in most fights because they were small and fought big enemies .  if you   re small and fast  you   re hard to hit .  the hiver fought back by changing shape  all the time .  swords clanged on scales  heads butted fangs   it whirled across the turf  growling and screaming  calling up past shapes to counter every attack .  but feegles were hard to kill .  they bounced when thrown  sprang back when trodden on  and easily dodged teeth and claws .  they fought        and the ground shook so suddenly that even the hiver lost its footing .   the shepherding hut creaked and began to settle into the turf  which opened up around it as easily as butter .  the saplings trembled and began to fall over  one after the other  as if their roots were being cut under the grass .   the land   rose .   rolling down the shifting slope  the feegles saw the hills cimbing toward the sky .  what was there  what had always been there  become more plain .   rising into the dark sky was a head  shoulders  a chest .  someone who had been lying down  growing turf  their arms and legs the hills and valleys of the downland  was sitting up .  they moved with great stony slowness  millions of tons of hill shifting and creaking around them .  what had looked like two long mounds in the shape of a cross became giant green arms  unfolding .   a hand with fingers longer than houses reached down  picked up the hiver  and lifted it up into the air .   far off  something thumped three times .  the sound seemed to be coming from outside the world .  the feegles  turning and watching from the small hill that was one of the knees of the giant girl  ignored it .      she tells the land whut it is  and it tells her who she is     said awf   ly wee billy  tears running down his face .     i canna write a song aboot this .  i   m nae good enough .         is that the big wee hag dreamin    she   s the hills or the hills dreamin    they   re the big wee hag .     said daft wullie .      both  mebbe     said rob anybody .  they watched the huge hand close and winced .      but ye canna kill a hiver     said daft wullie .      aye  but ye can frit it awa        said rob anybody .     it   s a big wee universe oout there .  if i was it  i   d no    think o    tryin    her again .      there were three more booms in the distance  louder this time .      i think     he went on     that   s it   s time we were offski .      in miss level   s cottage someone was knocking heavily on the front door .  thump .  thump .  thump .       chapter        soul and center      tiffany opened her eyes  remembered  and thought  was that a dream  or was that real .   and the next thought was  how do i know i   m me .  suppose i   m not me but just think i   m me .  how can i tell if i   m me or not .  who   s the    me    who   s asking the question .  am i thinking these thoughts .  how would i know if i wasn   t .      dinna ask me     said a voice by her head .     is this one of them tricksie ones .      it was daft wullie .  he was sitting on her pillow .   tiffany squinted down .  she was in bed in miss level   s cottage .  a green quilt stretched out in front of her .  a quilt .  green .  not turf  not hills   but it looked like the downland from here .      did i say all that aloud .     she asked .      oh  aye .         er   it did all happen  didn   t it .     said tiffany .      oh  aye     said daft wullie cheerfully .     the big hag o    hags wuz up here till just noo  but she said ye probably wasna gonna wake up a monster .      more bits of memory landed in tiffany   s head like red hot rocks landing on a peaceful planet .      are you all right .         oh  aye     said daft wullie .      and miss level .      and this rock of memory was huge  a flaming mountain that   d make a million dinosaurs flee for their lives .  tiffany   s hands flew to her mouth .      i killed her .     she said .      noo  then  ye didna           i did .  i felt my mind thinking it .  she made me angry .  i just waved my hand like this      a dozen nac mac feegle dived for cover      and she just exploded into nothing .  it was me .  i remember .         aye  but the hag o    hags said it wuz usin    your mind tae think with       daft wullie began .      i   ve got the memories .  it was me  with this hand .     the feegles who had raised their heads ducked back down again .     and   the memories i   ve got   i remember dust  turning into stars   things   the heat   blood   the taste of blood   i remember   i remember the seeme trick .  oh  no .  i practically invited it in .  i killed miss level .      shadows were closing in around her vision  and there was a ringing in her ears .  tiffany heard the door swing open  and hands picked her up as though she was as light as a bubble .  she was slung over a shoulder and carried swiftly down the stairs and out into the bright morning  where she was swung down onto the ground .         and all of us   we killed her   take one crucible of silver       she mumbled .   a hand slapped her sharply across the face .  she stared through inner mists at the tall dark figure in front of her .  a bucket handle was pressed firmly into her hand .      milk the goats now  tiffany .  now  tiffany  d   you hear .  the trusting creatures look to you .  they wait for you .  tiffany milks the goats .  do it  tiffany .  the hands know how  the mind will remember and grow stronger  tiffany .      she was thrust down into the milking stall and  through the mist in her head  made out the cowering shape of   of   black meg .   the hands remembered .  they placed the pail  grasped a teat  and then  as meg raised a leg to play the foot in the bucket game  grabbed it and forced it safely back down onto the milking platform .   she worked slowly  her head full of hot fog  letting her hands have their way .  buckets were filled and emptied  milked goats got a bucket of feed from the bin    .   sensibility bustle was rather puzzled that his hands were milking a goat .  he stopped .      what is your name .     said a voice behind him .      bustle .  sensibil           no .  that was the wizard  tiffany .  he was the strongest echo  but you   re not him .  get into the dairy  tiffany .      she stumbled into the cool room under the command of that voice  and the world focused .  there was a foul cheese on the slab  sweating and stinking .      who put this here .     she asked .      the hiver did  tiffany .  tried to make a cheese by magic  tiffany .  hah .  and you are not it  tiffany .  you know how to make cheese the right way  don   t you  tiffany .  indeed you do .  what is your name .         all was confusion and strange smells .  in panic  she roared     her face was slapped again .      no  that was the saber toothed tiger  tiffany .  they   re all just old memories the hiver left behind  tiffany .  it   s worn a lot of creatures  but they are not you .  come forward  tiffany .      she heard the words without really understanding them .  they were just out there somewhere  between people who were just shadows .  but it was unthinkable to disobey them .      drat .     said the hazy tall figure     where   s that little blue feller .  mr .  anyone .         here  mistress .  it   s rob anybody  mistress .  i beg o    ye not tae turn me intae somethin    unnatural  mistress .         you said she had a box of keepsakes .  fetch it down here this minute .  i feared this might happen .  i hates doin    it this way .      tiffany was turned around and once again looked into the blurry face while strong hands gripped her arms .  two blue eyes stared into hers .  they shone in the mist like sapphires .      what   s your name  tiffany .     said the voice .      tiffany .      the eyes bored into her .     is it .  really .  sing me the first song you ever learned  tiffany .  now .         hzan  hzana  m   taza           stop .  that was never learned on a chalk hill .  you ain   t tiffany .  i reckon you   re that desert queen who killed twelve of her husbands with scorpion sandwiches .  tiffany is the one i   m after .  back into the dark with you .      things went blurry again .  she could hear whispered discussions through the fog  and the voice said     well  that might work .  what   s your name  pictsie .         awf   ly wee billy bigchin mac feegle  mistress .         you   re very small  aren   t you .         only for my height  mistress .      the grip tightened on tiffany   s arms again .  the blue eyes glinted .      what does your name mean in the old speech of the nac mac feegle  tiffany .  think        it rose from the depths of her mind  trailing the fog behind it .  it came up through the clamoring voices and lifted her beyond the reach of ghostly hands .  ahead  the clouds parted .      my name is land under wave     said tiffany  and slumped forward .      no  no  none of that  we can   t have that     said the figure holding her .     you   ve slept enough .  good  you know who you are .  now you must be up and doing .  you must be tiffany as hard as you may  and the other voices will leave you alone  depend on it .  although it might be a good idea if you don   t make sandwiches for a while .      she did feel better .  she   d said her name .  the clamoring in her head had calmed down  although it was still a chatter that made it hard to think straight .  but now at least she could see clearly .  the black dressed figure holding her wasn   t tall  but she was so good at acting as if she was that it tended to fool most people .      oh   you   re   mistress weatherwax .      mistress weatherwax pushed her down gently into a chair .  from every flat surface in the kitchen  the nac mac feegles watched tiffany .      i am .  and a fine mess we have here .  rest for a moment  and then we must be up and doing           good morning  ladies .  er  how is she .      tiffany turned her head .  miss level stood in the door .  she looked pale  and she was walking with a stick .      i was lying in bed and i thought  well  there   s no reason to stay up here feeling sorry for myself     she said .   tiffany stood up .     i   m so sor       she began  but miss level waved a hand vaguely .      not your fault     she said  sitting down heavily at the table .     how are you .  and  for that matter  who are you .      tiffany blushed .     still me  i think     she mumbled .      i got here last night and saw to miss level     said mistress weatherwax .     watched over you  too  girl .  you talked in your sleep  or rather  sensibility bustle did  what   s left of him .  that ol    wizard was quite helpful  for something that   s nothing much more   n a bunch of memories and habits .         i don   t understand about the wizard     said tiffany .     or the desert queen .         don   t you .     said the witch .     well  a hiver collects people .  tries to add them to itself  you might say  use them to think with .  dr .  bustle was studying them hundreds of years ago  and set a trap to catch one .  it got him instead  silly fool .  it killed him in the end .  it gets    em all killed in the end .  they go mad  one way or the other   they stop remembering what they shouldn   t do .  but it keeps a sort of   pale copy of them  a sort of living memory    .     she looked at tiffany   s puzzled expression and shrugged .     something like a ghost     she said .      and it   s left ghosts in my head .         more like ghosts of ghosts  really     said mistress weatherwax .     something we don   t have a word for  maybe .      miss level shuddered .     well  thank goodness you   ve got rid of the thing  at least     she quavered .     would anyone like a nice cup of tea .         ach  leave that tae us .     shouted rob anybody  leaping up .     daft wullie  you an    the boys mak    some tea for the ladies .         thank you     said miss level weakly  as a clattering began behind her .     i feel so clum   what .  i thought you broke all the teacups when you did the dishes .         oh  aye     said rob cheerfully .     but wullie found a whole load o    old ones shut awa    in a cupboard           that very valuable bone china was left to me by a very dear friend .     shouted miss level .  she sprang to her feet and turned toward the sink .  with amazing speed for someone who was partly dead  she snatched teapot  cup  and saucer from the surprised pictsies and held them up as high as she could .      crivens .     said rob anybody  staring at the crockery .     now that   s what i call hagglin    .         i   m sorry to be rude  but they   re of great sentimental value .     said miss level .      mr .  anybody  you and your men will kindly get away from miss level and shut up .     said mistress weatherwax quickly .     pray do not disturb miss level while she   s making tea .         but she   s holding       tiffany began in amazement .      and let her get on with it without your chatter either  girl .     the witch snapped .      aye  but she picked up yon teapot wi   oot       a voice began .   the old witch   s head spun around .  feegles backed away like trees bending to a gale .      daft william     she said coldly     there   s room in my well for one more frog  except that you don   t have the brains of one .         ahahaha  that   s wholly correct  mistress     said daft wullie  sticking out his chin with pride .     i fooled you there .  i ha    the brains o    a beetle .      mistress weatherwax glared at him  then turned back to tiffany .      i turned someone into a frog .     tiffany said .     it was dreadful .  he didn   t all fit in  so there was this sort of huge pink           never mind that right now     said mistress weatherwax in a voice that was suddenly so nice and ordinary that it tinkled like a bell .     i expect you finds things a bit different here than they were at home  eh .         what .  well  yes  at home i never turned       tiffany began in surprise  then saw that just above her lap the old woman was making frantic circular hand motions that somehow meant keep going as if nothing has happened .   so they chatted madly about sheep  and mistress weatherwax said they were very wooly  weren   t they  and tiffany said that they were  extremely so  and mistress weatherwax said extremely wooly was what she   d heard   while every eye in the room watched miss level        making tea using four arms  two of which did not exist  and not realizing it .   the black kettle sailed across the room and apparently tipped itself into the pot .  cups and saucers and spoons and the sugar bowl floated with a purpose .   mistress weatherwax leaned across to tiffany .      i hope you   re still feeling   alone .     she whispered .      yes  thank you .  i mean  i can   sort of   feel them there  but they   re not getting in the way   er   sooner or later she   s going to realize   i mean  isn   t she .         very funny thing  the human mind     whispered the old woman .     i once had to see to a poor young man who had a tree fall on his legs .  lost both legs from the knee down .  had to have wooden legs made .  still  they were made out of that tree  which i suppose was some comfort  and he gets about pretty well .  but i remember him saying     mistress weatherwax  i can still feel my toes sometimes .     it   s like the head don   t accept what   s happened .  and it   s not like she   s   your everyday kind of person to start with .  i mean  she   s used to havin    arms she can   t see           here we are     said miss level  bustling over with three cups and saucers and the sugar bowl .     one for you  one for you  and one for   oh        the sugar bowl dropped from an invisible hand and spilled its sugar onto the table .  miss level stared at it in horror while  in the other hand that wasn   t there  a cup and saucer wobbled without visible means of support .      shut your eyes  miss level .     and there was something in the voice  some edge or strange tone  that made tiffany shut her eyes too .      right .  now  you know the cup   s there  you can feel your arm     said mistress weatherwax  standing up .     trust it .  your eyes are not in possession of all the facts .  now put the cup down gently   thaaat   s right .  you can open your eyes now  but what i wants you to do  right  as a favor to me  is put the hands that you can see flat down on the table .  right .  good .  now  without takin    those hands away  just go over to the dresser and fetch me that blue biscuit tin  will you .  i   m always partial to a biscuit with my tea .  thank you very much .         but   but i can   t do that now           get past    i can   t     miss level     mistress weatherwax snapped .     don   t think about it  just do it .  my tea   s getting cold .      so this is witchcraft too  tiffany thought .  it   s like granny aching talking to animals .  it   s in the voice .  sharp and soft by turns  and you use little words of command and encouragement and you keep talking  making the words fill the creature   s world  so that the sheepdogs obey you and the nervous sheep are calmed    .   the biscuit tin floated away from the dresser .  as it neared the old woman  the lid unscrewed and hovered in the air beside it .  she reached in delicately .      ooh  store bought teatime assortment     she said  taking four biscuits and quickly putting three of them in her pocket .     very posh .         it   s terribly difficult to do this .     miss level moaned .     it   s like trying not to think of a pink rhinoceros .         well .     said mistress weatherwax .     what   s so special about not thinking of a pink rhinoceros .         it   s impossible to think of one if someone tells you mustn   t     tiffany explained .      no it ain   t     said mistress weatherwax firmly .     i ain   t thinking of one right now  and i gives you my word on that .  you want to take control of that brain of yours  miss level .  so you   ve lost a spare body .  what   s another body when all   s said and done .  just a lot of upkeep  another mouth to feed  wear and tear on the furniture   in a word  fuss .  get your mind right  miss level  and the world is your       the old witch leaned down to tiffany and whispered     what   s that thing  lives in the sea  very small  folks eat it .         shrimp .     tiffany suggested  a bit puzzled .      shrimp .  all right .  the world is your shrimp  miss level .  not only will there be a great saving on clothes and food  which is not to be sneezed at in these difficult times  but when people see you moving things through the air  well  they   ll say     there   s a witch and a half  and no mistake .  and they will be right .  you just hold on to that skill  miss level .  you maintain .  think on what i   ve said .  and now you stay and rest .  we   ll see to what needs doing today .  you just make a little list for me  and tiffany   ll know the way .         well  indeed  i do feel   somewhat shaken     said miss level  absentmindedly brushing her hair out of her eyes with an invisible hand .     let me see   you could just drop in on mr .  umbril  and mistress turvy  and the young raddle boy  and check on mrs .  towney   s bruise  and take some number   ointment to mr .  drover  and pay a call on old mrs .  hunter at saucy corner  and   now  who have i forgotten .      tiffany realized she was holding her breath .  it had been a horrible day  and a dreadful night  but what was looming and lining up for its place on miss level   s tongue was  somehow  going to be worse than either .         ah  yes  have a word with miss quickly at uttercliff  and then probably you   ll need to talk to mrs .  quickly  too  and there   re a few packages to be dropped off on the way  they   re in my basket  all marked up .  and i think that   s it    .  oh  no  silly me  i almost forgot   and you need to drop in on mr .  weavall  too .      tiffany breathed out .  she really didn   t want to .  she   d rather not breathe ever again than face mr .  weavall and open an empty box .      are you sure you   re   totally yourself  tiffany .     said miss level  and tiffany leaped at this lifesaving excuse not to go .      well  i do feel a bit       she began  but mistress weatherwax interrupted with     she   s fine  miss level  apart from the echoes .  the hiver has gone away from this house  i can assure you .         really .     said miss level .     i don   t mean to be rude  but how can you be so certain .      mistress weatherwax pointed down .   grain by grain  the spilled sugar was rolling across the tabletop and leaping into the sugar bowl .   miss level clasped her hands together .      oh  oswald     she said  her face one huge smile     you   ve come back .          miss level  and possibly oswald  watched them go from the gate .      she   ll be fine with your little men keeping her company     said mistress weatherwax as she and tiffany turned away and took the lane through the woods .     it could be the making of her  you know  being half dead .      tiffany was shocked .     how can you be so cruel .         she   ll get some respect when people see her moving stuff through the air .  respect is meat and drink to a witch .  without respect  you ain   t got a thing .  she doesn   t get much respect  our miss level .      that was true .  people didn   t respect miss level .  they liked her  in an unthinking sort of way  and that was it .  mistress weatherwax was right  and tiffany wished she wasn   t .      why did you and miss tick send me to her  then .     she said .      because she likes people     said the witch  striding ahead .     she cares about    em .  even the stupid  mean  drooling ones  the mothers with the runny babies and no sense  the feckless and the silly and the fools who treat her like some kind of a servant .  now that   s what i call magic   seein    all that  dealin    with all that  and still goin    on .  it   s sittin    up all night with some poor old man who   s leavin    the world  taking away such pain as you can  comfortin    their terror  seein       em safely on their way   and then cleanin       em up  layin       em out  making    em neat for the funeral  and helpin    the weeping widow strip the bed and wash the sheets   which is  let me tell you  no errand for the fainthearted   and stayin    up the next night to watch over the coffin before the funeral  and then going home and sitting down for five minutes before some shouting angry man comes bangin   on your door    cuz his wife   s havin    difficulty givin    birth to their first child and the midwife   s at her wits    end and then getting up and fetching your bag and going out again    .  we all do that  in our own way  and she does it better   n me  if i was to put my hand on my heart .  that is the root and heart and soul and center of witchcraft  that is .  the soul and center .     mistress weatherwax smacked her fist into her hand  hammering out her words .     the   soul   and   center .      echoes came back from the trees in the sudden silence .  even the grasshoppers by the side of the track had stopped sizzling .      and mrs .  earwig     said mistress weatherwax  her voice sinking to a growl     mrs .  earwig tells her girls it   s about cosmic balances and stars and circles and colors and wands and   and toys  nothing but toys .     she sniffed .     oh  i daresay they   re all very well as decoration  somethin    nice to look at while you   re workin     somethin    for show  but the start and finish  the start and finish  is helpin    people when life is on the edge .  even people you don   t like .  stars is easy  people is hard .      she stopped talking .  it was several seconds before birds began to sing again .      anyway  that   s what i think     she added in the tones of someone who suspects that she might have gone just a bit further than she meant to .   she turned around when tiffany said nothing  and saw that she had stopped and was standing in the lane looking like a drowned hen .      are you all right  girl .     she said .      it was me .     wailed tiffany .     the hiver was me .  it wasn   t thinking with my brain  it was using my thoughts .  it was using what it found in my head .  all those insults  all that       she gulped .     that   nastiness .  all it was was me with              without the bit of you that was locked away     said mistress weatherwax sharply .     remember that .         yes  but supposing       tiffany began  struggling to get all the woe out .      the locked up bit was the important bit     said mistress weatherwax .     learnin    how not to do things is as hard as learning how to do them .  harder  maybe .  there   d be a sight more frogs in this world if i didn   t know how not to turn people into them .  and big pink balloons  too .         don   t     said tiffany  shuddering .      that   s why we do all the tramping around and doctorin    and stuff     said mistress weatherwax .     well  and because it makes people a bit better  of course .  but doing it moves you into your center  so   s you don   t wobble .  it anchors you .  keeps you human  stops you cackling .  just like your granny with her sheep  which are to my mind as stupid and wayward and ungrateful as humans .  you think you   ve had a sight of yourself and found out you   re bad .  hah .  i   ve seen bad  and you don   t get near it .  now  are you going to stop grizzling .         what .     snapped tiffany .   mistress weatherwax laughed  to tiffany   s sudden fury .      yes  you   re a witch to your boots     she said .     you   re sad  and behind that you   re watching yourself being sad and thinking  oh  poor me  and behind that you   re angry with me for not going    there  there  poor dear .     let me talk to those third thoughts then  because i want to hear from the girl who went to fight a fairy queen armed with nothin    but a fryin    pan  not some child feelin    sorry for herself and wallowing in misery .         what .  i am not wallowing in misery .     tiffany shouted  striding up to her until they were inches apart .     and what was all that about being nice to people  eh .     overhead  leaves fell off the trees .      that doesn   t count when it   s another witch  especially one like you .     mistress weatherwax snapped  prodding her in the chest with a finger as hard as wood .      oh .  oh .  and what   s that supposed to mean .     a deer galloped off through the woods .  the wind got up .      one who   s not paying attention  child .         why  what have i missed that you   ve seen   old woman .         old woman i may be  but i   m tellin    you the hiver is still around .  you only threw it out .     mistress weatherwax shouted .  birds rose from the trees in panic .      i know .     screamed tiffany .      oh yes .  really .  and how do you know that .         because there   s a bit of me still in it .  a bit of me i   d rather not know about  thank you .  i can feel it out there .  anyway  how do you know .         because i   m a bloody good witch  that   s why     snarled mistress weatherwax  as rabbits burrowed deeper to get out of the way .     and what do you want me to do about the creature while you sit there snivelin     eh .         how dare you .  how dare you .  it   s my responsibility .  i   ll deal with it  thank you so very much .         you .  a hiver .  it   ll take more than a frying pan .  they can   t be killed .         i   ll find a way .  a witch deals with things .         hah .  i   d like to see you try .         i will .     shouted tiffany .  it started to rain .      oh .  so you know how to attack it  do you .         don   t be silly .  i can   t .  it can always keep out of my way .  it can even sink into the ground .  but it   ll come looking for me  understand .  me  not anyone else .  i know it .  and this time i   ll be ready .         will you  indeed .     said mistress weatherwax  folding her arms .      yes .         when .         now .         no .      the old witch held up a hand .      peace be on this place     she said quietly .  the wind dropped .  the rain stopped .     no  not yet     she went on as peace once again descended .     it   s not attackin    yet .  don   t you think that   s odd .  it   d be licking its wounds  if it had a tongue .  and you   re not ready yet  whatever you thinks .  no  we   ve got somethin    else to do  haven   t we .      tiffany was speechless .  the tide of outrage inside her was so hot that it burned her ears .  but mistress weatherwax was smiling .  the two facts did not work well together .   her first thoughts were  i   ve just had a blazing row with mistress weatherwax .  they say that if you cut her with a knife  she wouldn   t bleed until she wanted to .  they say that when some vampires bit her  they all started to crave tea and sweet biscuits .  she can do anything  be anywhere .  and i called her an old woman .   her second thoughts were  well  she is .   her third thoughts were  yes  she is mistress weatherwax .  and she   s keeping you angry .  if you   re full of anger  there   s no room left for fear .      you hold that anger     mistress weatherwax said  as if reading all of her mind .     cup it in your heart  remember where it came from  remember the shape of it  save it until you need it .  but now the wolf is out there somewhere in the woods  and you need to see to the flock .      it   s the voice  tiffany thought .  she really does talk to people like granny aching talked to sheep  except she hardly cusses at all .  but i feel   better .      thank you     she said .      and that includes mr .  weavall .         yes     said tiffany .     i know .          chapter         the late bloomer      it was an   interesting day .  everyone in the mountains had heard of mistress weatherwax .  if you didn   t have respect  she said  you didn   t have anything .  today she had it all .  some of it even rubbed off on tiffany .   they were treated like royalty   not the sort who get dragged off to be beheaded or have something nasty done with a red hot poker  but the other sort  when people walk away dazed saying     she actually said hello to me  very graciously .  i will never wash my hand again .      not that many people they dealt with washed their hands at all  tiffany thought with the primness of a dairy worker .  but people crowded around outside the cottage doors  watching and listening  and they sidled up to tiffany to say things like    would she like a cup of tea .  i   ve cleaned our cup .     and in the garden of every cottage they passed  tiffany noticed  the beehives were suddenly bustling with activity .   she worked away  trying to stay calm  trying to think about what she was doing .  you did the doctoring work as neatly as you could  and if it was on something oozy  then you just thought about how nice things would be when you   d stopped doing it .  she felt mistress weatherwax wouldn   t approve of this attitude .  but tiffany didn   t much like hers either .  she lied all the   she didn   t tell the truth all the time .   for example  there was the raddles    privy .  miss level had explained carefully to mr .  and mrs .  raddle several times that it was far too close to the well  and so the drinking water was full of tiny  tiny creatures that were making their children sick .  they   d listened very carefully  every time they heard the lecture  and still they never moved the privy .  but mistress weatherwax told them it was caused by goblins who were attracted to the smell  and by the time they left that cottage  mr .  raddle and three of his friends were already digging a new well the other end of the garden .      it really is caused by tiny creatures  you know     said tiffany  who   d once handed over an egg to a traveling teacher so she could line up and look through his      astounding mikroscopical device .  a zoo in every drop of ditchwater .       she   d almost collapsed the next day from not drinking .  some of those creatures were hairy .      is that so .     said mistress weatherwax sarcastically .      yes .  it is .  and miss level believes in telling them the truth .         good .  she   s a fine  honest woman     said mistress weatherwax .     but what i say is you have to tell people a story they can understand .  right now i reckon you   d have to change quite a lot of the world  and maybe bang mr .  raddle   s stupid fat head against the wall a few times  before he   d believe that you can be sickened by drinking tiny invisible beasts .  and while you   re doing that  those kids of theirs will get sicker .  but goblins  now  they makes sense today .  a story gets things done .  and when i see miss tick tomorrow  i   ll tell her it   s about time them wandering teachers started coming up here .         all right     said tiffany reluctantly     but you told mr .  umbril the shoemaker that his chest pains will clear up if he walks to the waterfall at tumble crag every day for a month and throws three shiny pebbles into the pool for the water sprites .  that   s not doctoring .         no  but he thinks it is .  the man spends too much time sitting hunched up .  a five mile walk in the fresh air every day for a month will see him as right as rain     said mistress weatherwax .      oh     said tiffany .     another story .         if you like     said mistress weatherwax  her eyes twinkling .     and you never know  maybe the water sprites will be grateful for the pebbles .      she glanced sidelong at tiffany   s expression and patted her on the shoulder .      never mind  miss     she said .     look at it this way .  tomorrow  your job is to change the world into a better place .  today  my job is to see that everyone gets there .         well  i think       tiffany began  then stopped .  she looked up at the line of woods between the small fields of the valleys and the steep meadows of the mountains .      it   s still there     she said .      i know     said mistress weatherwax .      it   s moving around  but it   s keeping away from us .         i know     said mistress weatherwax .      what does it think it   s doing .         it   s got a bit of you in it .  what do you think it   s doing .      tiffany tried to think .  why wouldn   t it attack .  oh  she   d be better prepared this time  but it was strong .      maybe it   s waiting until i   m upset again     she said .     but i keep having a thought .  it makes no sense .  i keep thinking about   three wishes .         wishes for what .         i don   t know .  it sounds silly .      mistress weatherwax stopped .     no  it   s not     she said .     it   s a deep part of you trying to send yourself a message .  just remember it .  because now        tiffany sighed .     yes  i know .  mr .  weavall .          no dragon   s cave was ever approached as carefully as the cottage in the overgrown garden .   tiffany paused at the gate and looked back  but mistress weatherwax had diplomatically vanished .  probably she   s found someone to give her a cup of tea and a sweet biscuit  she thought .  she lives on them .   she opened the gate and walked up the path .   you couldn   t say  it   s not my fault .  you couldn   t say  it   s not my responsibility .   you could say  i will deal with this .   you didn   t have to want to .  but you had to do it .   tiffany took a deep breath and stepped into the dark cottage .   mr .  weavall  in his chair  was just inside the door and fast asleep  showing the world an open mouth full of yellow teeth .      um   hello  mr .  weavall     tiffany quavered  but perhaps not quite loudly enough .     just  er  here to see that you  that everything is   is all right    .      there was a snort nonetheless  and he woke  smacking his lips to get the sleep out of his mouth .      oh     tis you     he said .     good afternoon to ye .     he eased himself more upright and started to stare out of the doorway  ignoring her .   maybe he won   t ask  she thought as she did the dishes and dusted and plumped the cushions and  not to put too fine a point on it  emptied the commode .  but she nearly yelped when the arm shot out and grabbed her wrist and the old man gave her his pleading look .      just check the box  mary  will you .  before you go .  only i heard clinking noises last night  see .  could be one o    the sneaky thieves got in .         yes  mr .  weavall     said tiffany  all the while thinking  idon   twanttobehereidon   twanttobehere .   she pulled out the box .  there was no choice .   it felt heavy .  she stood up and lifted the lid .   after the creak of the hinges  there was silence .      are you all right  girl .     said mr .  weavall .      um       said tiffany .      it   s all there  ain   t it .     said the old man anxiously .   tiffany   s mind was a puddle of goo .      um   it   s all here     she managed .     um   and now it   s all gold  mr .  weavall .         gold .  hah .  don   t you pull my leg  girl .  no gold ever came my way .      tiffany put the box on the old man   s lap  as gently as she could  and he stared into it .   tiffany recognized the worn coins .  the pictsies ate off them in the mound .  there had been pictures on them  but they were too worn to make out now .   but gold was gold  pictures or not .   she turned her head sharply and was certain she saw something small and redheaded vanish into the shadows .      well now     said mr .  weavall .     well now .     and that seemed to exhaust his conversation for a while .  then he said     far too much money here to pay for a buryin    .  i don   t recall savin    all this .  i reckon you could bury a king for this amount of money .      tiffany swallowed .  she couldn   t leave things like this .  she just couldn   t .      mr .  weavall  i   ve got something i must tell you     she said .  and she told him .  she told him all of it  not just the good bits .  he sat and listened carefully .      well  now  isn   t that interesting     he said when she   d finished .      um   i   m sorry     said tiffany .  she couldn   t think of anything else to say .      so what you   re saying  right  is    cuz that creature made you take my burying money  right  you think these fairy friends o    yourn filled my ol    box with gold so   s you wouldn   t get into trouble  right .         i think so     said tiffany .      well  it looks like i should thank you  then     said mr .  weavall .      what .         well  it seems to i  if you hadn   t ha    took the silver and copper  there wouldn   t have been any room for all this gold  right .     said mr .  weavall .     and i shouldn   t reckon that ol   dead king up on yon hills needs it now .         yes  but        mr .  weavall fumbled in the box and held up a gold coin that would have bought his cottage .      a little something for you  then  girl     he said .     buy yourself some ribbons or something    .         no .  i can   t .  that wouldn   t be fair .     tiffany protested desperately .  this was completely going wrong .      wouldn   t it  now .     said mr .  weavall  and his bright eyes gave her a long  shrewd look .     well  then  let   s call it payment for this little errand you   re gonna run for i  eh .  you   re gonna run up they stairs  which i can   t quite manage anymore  and bring down the black suit that   s hanging behind the door  and there   s a clean shirt in the chest at the end of the bed .  and you   ll polish my boots and help i up  but i   m thinking i could prob   ly make it down the lane on my own .    cuz  y   see  this is far too much money to buy a man   s funeral  but i reckon it   ll do fine to marry him off  so i am proposin    to propose to the widow tussy that she engages in matrimony with i .      the last sentence took a little working out  and then tiffany said     you are .         that i am     said mr .  weavall  struggling to his feet .     she   s a fine woman who bakes a very reasonable steak and onion pie  and she has all her own teeth .  i know that because she showed i .  her youngest son got her a set of fancy store bought teeth all the way from the big city  and very handsome she looks in    em .  she was kind enough to loan    em to i one day when i had a difficult piece of pork to tackle  and a man doesn   t forget a kindness like that .         er   you don   t think you ought to think about this  do you .     said tiffany .   mr .  weavall laughed .     think .  i got no business to be thinking about it  young lady .  who   re you to tell an old    un like i that he ought to be thinking .  i   m ninety one  i am .  got to be up and doing .  besides  i have reason to believe by the twinkle in her eye that the widow tussy will not turn up her nose at my suggestion .  i   ve seen a fair number of twinkles over the years  and that was a good    un .  and i daresay that suddenly having a box of gold will fill in the corners  as my ol    dad would say .      it took ten minutes for mr .  weavall to get changed  with a lot of struggling and bad language and no help from tiffany  who was told to turn her back and put her hands over her ears .  then she had to help him out into the garden  where he threw away one walking stick and waggled a finger at the weeds .      and i   ll be chopping down the lot of you tomorrow .     he shouted triumphantly .   at the garden gate he grasped the post and pulled himself nearly vertical  panting .      all right     he said  just a little anxiously .     it   s now or never .  i look okay  does i .         you look fine  mr .  weavall .         everything clean .  everything done up .         er   yes     said tiffany .      how   s my hair look .         er   you don   t have any  mr .  weavall     she reminded him .      ah  right .  yes     tis true .  i   ll have to buy one o    they whatdyoucallem   s  like a hat made of hair .  have i got enough money for that  d   you think .         a wig .  you could buy thousands  mr .  weavall .         hah .  right .     his gleaming eyes looked around the garden .     any flowers out .  can   t see too well    .  ah   speckatickles  i saw    em once  made of glass  makes you see good as new .  that   s what i need    .  have i got enough for speckatickles .         mr .  weavall     said tiffany     you   ve got enough for anything .         why  bless you .     said mr .  weavall .     but right now i need a bow kwet of flowers  girl .  can   t go courtin    without flowers and i can   t see none .  anythin    left .      a few roses were hanging on among the weeds and briars in the garden .  tiffany fetched a knife from the kitchen and made them up into a bouquet .      ah  good     he said .     late bloomers  just like i .     he held them tightly in his free hand and suddenly frowned  and fell silent  and stood like a statue .      i wish my toby and my mary was goin    to be able to come to the weddin        he said quietly .     but they   re dead  you know .         yes     said tiffany .     i know  mr .  weavall .         and i could wish that my nancy was alive  too  although bein    as i hopes to be marryin    another lady  that ain   t a sensible wish  maybe .  hah .  nearly everyone one i knows is dead .     mr .  weavall stared at the bunch of flowers for a while  and then straightened up again .     still  can   t do nothin    about that  can we .  not even for a box full of gold .         no  mr .  weavall     said tiffany hoarsely .      oh  don   t cry  girl .  the sun is shinin     the birds is singin     and what   s past can   t be mended  eh .     said mr .  weavall jovially .     and the widow tussy is waitin    .      for a moment he looked panicky  and then he cleared his throat .      don   t smell too bad  do i .     he said .      er   only of mothballs  mr .  weavall .         mothballs .  mothballs is okay .  right  then .  time   s a wastin    .      using only the one stick  waving his other arm with the flowers in the air to keep his balance  mr .  weavall set off with surprising speed .      well     said mistress weatherwax as  with jacket flying  he rounded the corner .     that was nice  wasn   t it .      tiffany looked around quickly .  mistress weatherwax was still nowhere to be seen  but she was somewhere to be unseen .  tiffany squinted at what was definitely an old wall with some ivy growing up it  and it was only when the old witch moved that she spotted her .  she hadn   t done anything to her clothes  hadn   t done any magic as far as tiffany knew  but she   d simply   faded in .      er  yes     said tiffany  taking out a handkerchief and blowing her nose .      but it worries you     said the witch .     you think it shouldn   t have ended like that  right .         no .     said tiffany hotly .      it would have been better if he   d been buried in some ol    cheap coffin paid for by the village  you think .         no .     tiffany twisted up her fingers .  mistress weatherwax was sharper than a field of pins .     but   all right  it just doesn   t seem   fair .  i mean  i wish the feegles hadn   t done that .  i   m sure i could have   sorted it out somehow  saved up           it   s an unfair world  child .  be glad you have friends .      tiffany looked up at the treeline .      yes     said mistress weatherwax .     but not up there .         i   m going away     said tiffany .     i   ve been thinking about it  and i   m going away .         broomstick .     said mistress weatherwax .     it don   t move fast           no .  where would i fly to .  home .  i don   t want to take it there .  anyway  i can   t just fly off with it roaming around .  when it   when i meet it  i don   t want to be near people  you understand .  i know what i   what it can do if it   s angry .  it half killed miss level .         and if it follows you .         good .  i   ll take it up there somewhere .     tiffany waved at the mountains .      all alone .         i don   t have a choice  do i .      mistress weatherwax gave her a look that went on too long .      no     she said .     you don   t .  but neither have i .  that   s why i will come with you .  don   t argue  miss .  how would you stop me  eh .  oh  that reminds me   them mysterious bruises mrs .  towny gets is because mr .  towny beats her  and the father of miss quickly   s baby is young fred turvey .  you might mention that to miss level .      as she spoke  a bee flew out of her ear .       bait  thought tiffany a few hours later  as they walked away from miss level   s cottage and up toward the high moors .  i wonder if i   m bait  just like in the old days when the hunters would tether a lamb or a baby goat to bring the wolves nearer .   she   s got a plan to kill the hiver .  i know it .  she   s worked something out .  it   ll come for me and she   ll just wave a hand .   she must think i   m stupid .   they had argued  of course .  but mistress weatherwax had come up with a deeply unfair one .  it was  you   re eleven .  just like that .  you   re eleven  and what is miss tick going to tell your parents .  sorry about tiffany  but we let her go off by herself to fight an ancient monster that can   t be killed and what   s left of her is in this jar .   miss level had joined in at that part  almost in tears .   if tiffany hadn   t been a witch  she would have whined about everyone being so unfair .   in fact they were being fair .  she knew they were being fair .  they were not thinking just of her but of other people  and tiffany hated herself   well  slightly   because she hadn   t .  but it was sneaky of them to choose this moment to be fair .  that was unfair .   no one had told her she was only nine when she went into fairyland armed with just a frying pan .  admittedly  no one else had known she was going  except the nac mac feegle  and she was much taller than they were .  would she have gone if she   d known what was in there  she wondered .   yes .  i would have .   and you   re going to face the hiver even though you don   t know how to beat it .   yes .  i am .  there   s part of me still in it .  i might be able to do something     but aren   t you just ever so slightly glad that mistress weatherwax and miss level won the argument and now you   re going off very bravely but you happen to be accompanied  completely against your will  by the most powerful witch alive .   tiffany sighed .  it was dreadful when your own thoughts tried to gang up on you .   the feegles hadn   t objected to her going to find the hiver .  they did object to not being allowed to come with her .  they   d been insulted  she knew .  but  as mistress weatherwax had said  this was true haggling and there was no place in it for feegles .  if the hiver came  out there  not in a dream but for real  it   d have nothing about it that could be kicked or head butted .   tiffany had tried to make a little speech  thanking them for their help  but rob anybody had folded his arms and turned his back .  it had all gone wrong .  but the old witch had been right .  they could get hurt .  the trouble was  explaining to feegles how dangerous things were going to be only got them more enthusiastic .   she left them arguing with one another .  it had not gone well .   but now that was all behind her  in more ways than one .  the trees beside the track were less bushy and more pointy   or  if tiffany had known more about trees  she would have said that the oaks were giving way to evergreens .   she could feel the hiver .  it was following them  but a long way back .   if you had to imagine a head witch  you wouldn   t imagine mistress weatherwax .  you might imagine mrs .  earwig  who glided across the floor as though she was on wheels  and had a dress as black as the darkness in a deep cellar  but mistress weatherwax was just an old woman with a lined face and rough hands in a dress as black as night  which is never as black as people think .  it was dusty and ragged around the hem  too .   on the other hand  thought her second thoughts  you once bought granny aching a china shepherdess  remember .  all blue and white and sparkly .   her first thoughts thought  well  yes  but i was a lot younger then .   her second thoughts thought  yes  but which one was the real shepherdess .  the shiny lady in the nice clean dress and buckled shoes  or the old lady who stumped around in the snow with boots filled with straw and a sack across her shoulders .   at which point mistress weatherwax stumbled .  she caught her balance very quickly .      dangerously loose stones on this path     she said .     watch out for them .      tiffany looked down .  there weren   t that many stones  and they didn   t seem very dangerous or particularly loose .   how old was mistress weatherwax .  that was another question she wished she hadn   t asked .  she was skinny and wiry  just like granny aching  the kind of person who goes on and on   but one day granny aching had gone to bed and had never got up again  just like that    .   the sun was setting .  tiffany could feel the hiver in the same way that you can sense that someone is looking at you .  it was still in the woods that hugged the mountain like a scarf .   at last the witch stopped at a spot where rocks like pillars sprouted out of the turf .  she sat down with her back to a big rock .      this   ll have to do     she said .     it   ll be dark soon  and you could turn an ankle on all this loose stone .      there were huge boulders around them  house sized  that had rolled down from the mountains in the past .  the rock of the peaks began not far away  a wall of stone that seemed to hang above tiffany like a wave .  it was a desolate place .  every sound echoed .   she sat down by mistress weatherwax and opened the bag that miss level had packed for the journey .   tiffany wasn   t very experienced at things like this but  according to the book of fairy tales  the typical food for taking on an adventure was bread and cheese .  hard cheese  too .   miss level had made them ham sandwiches  with pickles  and she   d included napkins .  that was kind of a strange thought to keep in your head  we   re trying to find a way of killing a terrible creature  but at least we won   t be covered in crumbs .   there was a bottle of cold tea  too  and a bag of biscuits .  miss level knew mistress weatherwax .      shouldn   t we light a fire .     tiffany suggested .      why .  it   s a long way down to the treeline to get the firewood  and there   ll be a fine half moon up in twenty minutes .  your friend   s keeping its distance  and there   s nothing else that   ll attack us up here .         are you sure .         i walk safely in my mountains     said mistress weatherwax .      but aren   t there trolls and wolves and things .         oh  yes .  lots .         and they don   t try to attack you .         not anymore     said a self satisfied voice in the dark .     pass me the biscuits  will you .         here you are .  would you like some pickles .         pickles gives me the wind something awful .         in that case           oh  i wasn   t saying no     mistress weatherwax said  taking two large pickled cucumbers .   oh  good  tiffany thought .   she   d brought three fresh eggs with her .  getting the hang of a shamble was taking too long .  it was stupid .  all the other girls were able to use them .  she was sure she was doing everything right .   she   d filled her pocket with random things .  now she pulled them out without looking  wove the thread around the egg as she   d done a hundred times before  grasped the pieces of wood  and moved them so that     poc .   the egg cracked and oozed .      i told you     said mistress weatherwax  who   d opened one eye .     they   re toys .  sticks and stones .         have you ever used one .     said tiffany .      no .  couldn   t get the hang of them .  they got in the way .     mistress weatherwax yawned  wrapped the blanket around her  made a couple of mnup  mnup noises as she tried to get comfortable against the rock  and after a while  her breathing became deeper .   tiffany waited in silence  her blanket around her  until the moon came up .  she   d expected that to make things better  but it didn   t .  before  there had just been darkness .  now there were shadows .   there was a snore beside her .  it was one of those good solid ones  like ripping canvas .   silence happened .  it came across the night on silver wings  noiseless as the fall of a feather  silence made into a bird  which alighted on a rock close by .  it swiveled its head to look at tiffany .   there was more than just the curiosity of a bird in that look .   the old woman snored again .  tiffany reached out  still staring at the owl  and shook her gently .  when that didn   t work  she shook her hardly .   there was a sound like three pigs colliding and mistress weatherwax opened one eye and said     whoo .         there   s an owl watching us .  it   s right up close .      suddenly the owl blinked  looked at tiffany as if amazed to see her  spread its wings  and glided off into the night .   mistress weatherwax gripped her throat  coughed once or twice  and then said hoarsely     of course it was an owl  child .  it took me ten minutes to lure it this close .  now just you be quiet while i starts again   otherwise i shall have to make do with a bat  and when i goes out on a bat for any time at all  i ends up thinkin    i can see with my ears  which is no way for a decent woman to behave .         but you were snoring .         i was not snoring .  i was just resting gently while i tickled an owl closer .  if you hadn   t shaken me and scared it away  i   d have been up there with this entire moor under my eye .         you   take over its mind .     said tiffany nervously .      no .  i   m not one of your hivers .  i just   borrows a lift from it  i just   nudges it now and again  it don   t even know i   m there .  now try to rest .         but what if the hiver    .         if it comes anywhere near  it   ll be me that tells you .     mistress weatherwax hissed  and lay back .  then her head jerked up one more time .     and i do not snore .     she added .   after half a minute she started to snore again .   minutes after that the owl came back  or perhaps it was a different owl .  it glided onto the same rock  settled there for a while  and then sped away .  the witch stopped snoring .  in fact  she stopped breathing .   tiffany leaned closer and finally lowered an ear to the skinny chest to see if there was a heartbeat .   her own heart felt as if it was clenched like a fist        because of the day she   d found granny aching in the hut .  she was lying peacefully on the narrow iron bed  but tiffany had known something was wrong as soon as she had stepped inside     boom .   tiffany counted to three .   boom .   well  it was a heartbeat .   very slowly  like a twig growing  a stiff hand moved .  it slid like a glacier into a pocket and came up holding a large piece of card on which was written      i ate    nt dead     tiffany decided she wasn   t going to argue .  but she pulled the blanket over the old woman and wrapped her own around herself .   by moonlight she tried again with her shamble .  surely she should be able to make it do something .  maybe if     by moonlight she very  very carefully     poc .   the egg cracked .  the egg always cracked  and now there was only one left .  tiffany didn   t dare try it with a beetle  even if she could have found one .  it would be too cruel .   she sat back and looked across the landscape of silver and black  and her third thoughts thought  it   s not going to come near .   why .   she thought  i   m not sure why i know .  but i know .  it   s keeping away .  it knows mistress weatherwax is with me .   she thought  how can it know that .  it   d not got a mind .  it doesn   t know what a mistress weatherwax is .   still thinking  thought her third thoughts .   tiffany slumped against the rock .   sometimes her head was too   crowded    .   and then it was morning  and sunlight  and dew on her hair  and mist coming off the ground like smoke   and an eagle sitting on the rock where the owl had been  eating something furry .  she could see every feather on its wing .   it swallowed  glared at tiffany with its crazy bird eyes  and flapped away  making the mist swirl .   beside her  mistress weatherwax began to snore again  which tiffany took to mean that she was in her body .  she gave the old woman a nudge  and the sound that had been a regular gnaaaargrgrgrgrg suddenly became blort .   the old woman sat up coughing and waved a hand irritably at tiffany to pass her the tea bottle .  she didn   t speak until she   d gulped half of it .      ah  say what you like  but rabbit tastes a lot better cooked     she gasped  shoving the cork back in .     and without the fur on .         you took   borrowed the eagle .     said tiffany .      o    course .  i couldn   t expect the poor ol    owl to fly around after daybreak  just to see who   s about .  it was hunting voles all night  and believe me  raw rabbit   s better   n voles .  don   t eat voles .         i won   t     said tiffany  and meant it .     mistress weatherwax  i think i know what the hiver   s doing .  it   s thinking .         i thought it had no brains .      tiffany let her thoughts speak for themselves .      but there   s an echo of me in it  isn   t there .  there must be .  it has an echo of everyone it   s   been .  there must be a bit of me in it .  i know it   s out there  and it knows i   m here with you .  and it   s keeping away .         oh .  why   s that  then .         because it   s frightened of you  i think .         huh .  and why   s that .         yes     said tiffany simply .     it   s because i am .  a bit .         oh dear .  are you .         yes     said tiffany .     it   s like a dog that   s been beaten but won   t run away .  it doesn   t understand what it   s done wrong .  but   there   s something about it that   there   s a thought that i   m nearly having    .      mistress weatherwax said nothing .  her face went blank .      are you all right .     said tiffany .      i was just leavin    you time to have that thought     said mistress weatherwax .      sorry .  it   s gone now .  but   we   re thinking about the hiver in the wrong way .         oh  yes .  and why   s that .         because       tiffany struggled with the idea .     i think it   s because we don   t want to think about it the right way .  it   s something to do with   the third wish .  and i don   t know what that means .      the witch said     keep picking at that thought     and then looked up and added     we   ve got company .      it took tiffany several seconds to spot what mistress weatherwax had seen   a shape at the edge of the woods  small and dark .  it was coming closer  but rather uncertainly .   it resolved itself into the figure of petulia  flying slowly and nervously a few feet above the heather .  sometimes she jumped down and wrenched the stick in a slightly different direction .   she got off again when she reached tiffany and mistress weatherwax  grabbed the broom hastily  and aimed it at a big rock .  it hit it gently and hung there  trying to fly through stone .      um  sorry     she panted .     but i can   t always stop it  and this is better than having an anchor   um .      she started to bob a curtsy to mistress weatherwax  remembered she was a witch  and tried to turn it into a bow halfway down  which was an event you   d pay money to see .  she ended up bent double  and from somewhere in there came the little voice     um  can someone help  please .  i think my octogram of trimontane has got caught up on my pouch of nine herbs    .      there was a tricky minute while they untangled her  with mistress weatherwax muttering     toys  just toys     as they unhooked bangles and necklaces .   petulia stood upright  red in the face .  she saw mistress weatherwax   s expression  whipped off her pointy hat  and held it in front on her .  this was a mark of respect  but it did mean that a two foot  sharp  pointy thing was being aimed at them .      um   i went to see miss level and she said you   d come up here after some horrible thing     she said .     um   so i thought i   d better see how you were .         um   that was very kind of you     said tiffany  but her treacherous second thoughts thought  and what would you have done if it had attacked us .  she had a momentary picture of petulia standing in front of some horrible raging thing  but it wasn   t as funny as she   d first thought .  petulia would stand in front of it  shaking with terror  her useless amulets clattering  scared almost out of her mind   but not backing away .  she   d thought there might be people facing something horrible here  and she   d come anyway .      what   s your name  my girl .     said mistress weatherwax .      um  petulia gristle  mistress .  i   m learning with gwinifer blackcap .         old mother blackcap .     said mistress weatherwax .     very sound .  a good woman with pigs .  you did well to come here .      petulia looked nervously at tiffany .      um  are you all right .  miss level said you   d been   ill .         i   m much better now  but thank you very much for asking anyway     said tiffany wretchedly .     look  i   m sorry about           well  you were ill     said petulia .   and that was another thing about petulia .  she always wanted to think the best of everybody .  this was sort of worrying if you knew that the person she was doing her best to think nice thoughts about was you .      are you going to go back to the cottage before the trials .     petulia went on .      trials .     said tiffany  suddenly lost .      the witch trials     said mistress weatherwax .      today     said petulia .      i   d forgotten all about them .     said tiffany .      i hadn   t     said the old witch calmly .     i never miss a trial .  never missed a trial in sixty years .  would you do a poor old lady a favor  miss gristle  and ride that stick of yours back to miss level   s place and tell her that mistress weatherwax presents her compliments and intends to head directly to the trials .  was she well .         um  she was juggling balls without using her hands .     said petulia in wonderment .     and d   you know what .  i saw a fairy in her garden .  a blue one .         really .     said tiffany  her heart sinking .      yes .  it was rather scruffy  though .  and when i asked it if it really was a fairy  it said it was   um      the big stinky horrible spiky iron stinging nettle fairy from the land o    tinkle     and called me a    scunner .     do you know what that means .      tiffany looked into that round  hopeful face .  she opened her mouth to say     it means someone who likes fairies     but stopped in time .  that just wouldn   t be fair .  she sighed .      petulia  you saw a nac mac feegle     she said .     it is a kind of fairy  but they   re not the sweet kind .  i   m sorry .  they   re good   well  more or less   but they   re not entirely nice .  and    scunner    is a kind of swear word .  i don   t think it   s a particularly bad one  though .      petulia   s expression didn   t change for a while .  then she said     so it was a fairy  then .         well  yes .  technically .      the round pink face smiled .      good  i did wonder  because it was  um  you know   having a wee up against one of miss level   s garden gnomes .         definitely a feegle     said tiffany .      oh well  i suppose the big stinky horrible spiky iron stinging nettle needs a fairy  just like every other plant     said petulia .       chapter         arthur      when petulia had gone  mistress weatherwax stamped her feet and said     let   s go  young lady .  it   s about eight miles to sheercliff .  they   ll have started before we get there .         what about the hiver .         oh  it can come if it likes .     mistress weatherwax smiled .     oh  don   t frown like that .  there   ll be more   n three hundred witches at the trials  and they   re way out in the country .  it   ll be as safe as anything .  or do you want to meet the hiver now .  we could probably do that .  it don   t seem to move fast .         no .     said tiffany  louder than she   d intended .     no  because   things aren   t what they seem .  we   d do things wrong .  er   i can   t explain it .  it   s because of the third wish .         which you don   t know what it is .         yes .  but i will soon  i hope .      the witch stared at her .     yes  i hope so  too     she said .     well  no point in standing around .  let   s get moving .     and with that the witch picked up her blanket and set off as though being pulled by a string .      we haven   t even had anything to eat .     said tiffany  running after her .      i had a lot of voles last night     said mistress weatherwax over her shoulder .      yes  but you didn   t actually eat them  did you .     said tiffany .     it was the owl that actually ate them .         technic   ly  yes     mistress weatherwax admitted .     but if you think you   ve been eating voles all night  you   d be amazed how much you don   t want to eat anything the next morning .  or ever again .      she nodded at the distant  departing figure of petulia .      friend of yours .     she said  as they set out .      er   if she is  i don   t deserve it     said tiffany .      hmm     said mistress weatherwax .     well  sometimes we get what we don   t deserve .      for an old woman mistress weatherwax could move quite fast .  she strode over the moors as if distance was a personal insult .  but she was good at something else too .   she knew about silence .  there was the swish of her long skirt as it snagged the heathers  but somehow that became part of the background noise .   in the silence  as she walked  tiffany could still hear the memories .  there were hundreds of them left behind by the hiver .  most of them were so faint that they were nothing more than a slight uncomfortable feeling in her head  but the ancient tiger still burned brightly in the back of her brain  and behind that was the giant lizard .  they   d been killing machines  the most powerful creatures in their world   once .  the hiver had taken them both .  and then they   d died fighting .   always taking fresh bodies  always driving the owners mad with the urge for power  which would always end with getting them killed   and just as tiffany wondered why  a memory said  because it is frightened .   frightened of what .  tiffany thought .  it   s so powerful .   who knows .  but it   s mad with terror .  completely binkers .      you   re sensibility bustle  aren   t you .     said tiffany  and then her ears informed her that she   d said this aloud .      talkative  ain   t he     said mistress weatherwax .     he talked in your sleep the other night .  used to have a very high opinion of himself .  i reckon that   s why his memories held together for so long .         he doesn   t know binkers from bonkers  though     said tiffany .      well  memory fades     said mistress weatherwax .  she stopped and leaned against a rock .  she sounded out of breath .      are you all right  mistress .     said tiffany .      sound as a bell     said mistress weatherwax  wheezing slightly .     just getting my second wind .  anyway  it   s only another six miles .         i notice you   re limping a bit     said tiffany .      do you  indeed .  then stop noticing .      the shout echoed off the cliffs  full of command .   mistress weatherwax coughed when the echo had died away .  tiffany had gone pale .      it seems to me     said the old witch     that i might just   ve been a shade on the sharp side there .  it was prob   ly the voles .     she coughed again .     them as knows me  or has earned it one way or the other  calls me granny weatherwax .  i shall not take it amiss if you did the same .         granny weatherwax .     said tiffany  shocked out of her shock by this new shock .      not technic   ly     said mistress weatherwax quickly .     it   s what they call a honorific  like old mother so and so  or goodie thingy  or nanny whatshername .  to show that a witch has   is fully   has been        tiffany didn   t know whether to laugh or burst into tears .      i know     she said .      you do .         like granny aching     said tiffany .     she was my granny  but everyone on the chalk called her granny aching .        mrs .  aching    wouldn   t have worked  she knew .  you needed a big  warm  billowing open kind of word .  granny aching was there for everybody .      it   s like being everyone   s grandmother     she added .  and didn   t add  who tells them stories .      well  then .  perhaps so .  granny weatherwax it is     said granny weatherwax  and added quickly     but not technic   ly .  now we   d best be moving .      she straightened up and set off again .   granny weatherwax .  tiffany tried it out in her head .  she   d never known her other grandmother  who   d died before she was born .  calling someone else granny was strange  but oddly  it seemed right .  and you could have two .   the hiver followed them .  tiffany could feel it .  but it was still keeping its distance .  well  there   s a trick to take to the trials  she thought .  granny   her brain tingled as she thought the word   granny has got a plan .  she must have .   but   things weren   t right .  there was another thought she wasn   t quite having  it ducked out of sight every time she thought she had it .  the hiver wasn   t acting right .   she made sure she kept up with granny weatherwax .   as they got nearer to the trials  there were clues .  tiffany saw at least three broomsticks in the air  heading the same way .  they reached a proper track  too  and groups of people were traveling in the same direction  there were a few pointy hats among them  which was a definite clue .  the track dropped on down through some woods  came up in a patchwork of little fields  and headed for a tall hedge from behind which came the sound of a brass band playing a medley of songs from the shows  although by the sound of it no two musicians could agree on what song or which show .   tiffany jumped when she saw a balloon sail up above the trees  catch the wind  and swoop away  but it turned out to be just a balloon and not a lump of excess brian .  she could tell this because it was followed by a long scream of rage mixed with a roar of complaint     aaaargwannawannaaaagongongonaargggaaaabloon .     which is the traditional sound of a very small child learning that with balloons  as with life itself  it is important to know when not to let go of the string .  the whole point of balloons is to teach small children this .   however  on this occasion a broomstick with a pointy hatted passenger rose above the trees  caught up with the balloon  and towed it back down to the trials ground .      didn   t use to be like this     granny weatherwax grumbled as they reached a gate .     when i was a girl  we just used to meet up in some meadow somewhere  all by ourselves .  but now  oh no  it has to be a grand day out for all the family .  hah .      there had been a crowd around the gate leading into the field  but there was something about that    hah .     the crowd parted  as if by magic  and the women pulled their children a little closer to them as granny walked right up to the gate .   there was a boy there selling tickets and wishing  now  that he   d never been born .   granny weatherwax stared at him .  tiffany saw his ears go red .      two tickets  young man     said granny .  little bits of ice tinkled off her words .      that   ll  er  be  er   one child and one senior citizen .     the young man quavered .   granny leaned forward and said     what is a senior citizen  young man .         it   s like   you know   old folks     the boy mumbled .  now his hands were shaking .   granny leaned farther forward .  the boy really  really wanted to step back  but his feet were rooted to the ground .  all he could do was bend backward .      young man     said granny     i am not now  nor shall i ever be  an    old folk .     we   ll take two tickets  which i see on that board there is a penny apiece .     her hand shot out  fast as an adder .  the boy made a noise like gneeee as he leaped back .      here   s tuppence     said granny weatherwax .   tiffany looked at granny   s hand .  the first finger and thumb were held together  but there did not appear to be any coins between them .   nevertheless  the young man  grinning horribly  took the total absence of coins very carefully between his thumb and finger .  granny twitched two tickets out of his other hand .      thank you  young man     she said  and walked into the field .  tiffany ran after her .      what did    .     she began  but granny weatherwax raised a finger to her lips  grasped tiffany   s shoulder  and swiveled her around .   the ticket seller was still staring at his fingers .  he even rubbed them together .  then he shrugged  held them over his leather moneybag  and let go .   clink  clink     the crowd around the gate gave a gasp  and one or two of them started to applaud .  the boy looked around with a sick kind of grin  as if of course he   d expected that to happen .      ah  right     said granny weatherwax happily .     and now i could just do with a cup of tea and maybe a sweet biscuit .         granny  there are children here .  not just witches .      people were looking at them .  granny weatherwax jerked tiffany   s chin up so that she could look into her eyes .      look around  eh .  down here you can   t move for amulets and wands and whatnot .  it   ll be bound to keep away  eh .      tiffany turned to look .  there were sideshows all around the field .  a lot of them were fun fair stuff that she   d seen before at agricultural shows around the chalk  roll a penny  lucky dip  bobbing for piranhas  that sort of thing .  the ducking stool was very popular among young children on such a hot day .  there wasn   t a fortune telling tent  because no fortune teller would turn up at an event where so many visitors were qualified to argue and answer back  but there were a number of witch stalls .  zakzak   s had a huge tent  with a display dummy outside wearing a sky scraper hat and a zephyr billow cloak  which had drawn a crowd of admirers .  the other stalls were smaller  but they were thick with things that glittered and tinkled  and they were doing a brisk trade among the younger witches .  there were whole stores full of dream catchers and curse nets  including the new self emptying ones .  it was odd to think of witches buying them  though .  it was like fish buying umbrellas .   surely a hiver wouldn   t come here  with all these witches .   she turned to granny weatherwax .   granny weatherwax wasn   t there .   it is hard to find a witch at the witch trials .  that is  it is too easy to find a witch at the witch trials  but very hard to find the one you   re looking for  especially if you suddenly feel lost and all alone and you can feel panic starting to open inside you like a fern .   most of the older witches were sitting at trestle tables in a huge roped off area .  they were drinking tea .  pointy hats bobbed as tongues wagged .  every woman seemed capable of talking while listening to all the others at the table at the same time  although this talent isn   t confined to witches .  it was no place to search for an old woman in black with a pointy hat .   the sun was quite high in the sky now .  the field was filling up .  witches were circling to land at the far end  and more and more people were pouring in through the gateway .  the noise was intense .  everywhere tiffany turned  black hats were scurrying .   pushing her way through the throng  she looked desperately for a friendly face  like miss tick or miss level or petulia .  if it came to it  an unfriendly one would do   even mrs .  earwig .   and she tried not to think .  she tried not to think that she was terrified and alone in this huge crowd  and that up on the hill  invisible  the hiver now knew this because just a tiny part of it was her .   she felt the hiver stir .  she felt it begin to move .   tiffany stumbled through a chattering group of witches  their voices sounding shrill and unpleasant .  she felt ill  as though she   d been in the sun too long .  the world was spinning .   a remarkable thing about a hiver  a reedy voice began  somewhere in the back of her head  is that its hunting pattern mimics that of the common shark  among other creatures        i do not want a lecture  mr .  bustle     tiffany mumbled .     i do not want you in my head .      but the memory of sensibility bustle had never taken much notice of other people when he was alive and it wasn   t going to begin now .  it went on in its self satisfied squeak    in that  once it has selected its prey  it will completely ignore other attractive targets     she could see all the way across the trials field  and something was coming .  it moved through the crowd like the wind through a field of grass .  you could plot its progress by the people .  some fainted  some yelped and turned around  some ran .  witches stopped their gossip  chairs were overturned  and the shouting started .  but it wasn   t attacking anything .  it was only interested in tiffany .   like a shark  thought tiffany .  the killer of the sea  where worse things happen .   tiffany backed away  the panic filling her up .  she bumped into witches hurrying toward the commotion and shouted at them      you can   t stop it .  you don   t know what it is .  you   ll flail at it and wave glittery sticks and it will keep coming .  it will keep coming .      she put her hands into her pockets and touched the lucky stone .  and the string .  and the piece of chalk .   if this was a story  she thought bitterly  i   d trust in my heart and follow my star and all that other stuff and it would all turn out all right  right now  by tinkly magikkkk .  but you   re never in a story when you need to be .   story  story  story     the third wish .  the third wish .  the third wish is the important one .   in stories the genie or the witch or the magic cat   offers you three wishes .   three wishes     she grabbed a hurrying witch and looked into the face of annagramma  who stared at her in terror and tried to cower away .      please don   t do anything to me .  please .     she cried .     i   m your friend  aren   t i .         if you like  but that wasn   t me and i   m better now     said tiffany  knowing she was lying .  it had been her  and that was important .  she had to remember that .     quick  annagramma .  what   s the third wish .  quickly .  when you get three wishes  what   s the third wish .      annagramma   s face screwed up into the affronted frown she wore when something had the nerve not to be understandable .     but why do    .         don   t think about it  please .  just answer .         well  er   it could be anything   being invisible or   or blond  or anything       annagramma burbled  her mind coming apart at the seams .   tiffany shook her head and let her go .  she ran to an old witch who was staring at the commotion .      please  mistress  this is important .  in stories  what   s the third wish .  don   t ask me why  please .  just remember .         er   happiness .  it   s happiness  isn   t it .     said the old lady .     yes  definitely .  health  wealth  and happiness .  now if i was you  i   d           happiness .  happiness   thank you     said tiffany  and looked around desperately for someone else .  it wasn   t happiness  she knew that in her boots .  you couldn   t get happiness by magic  and that was another clue right there .   there was miss tick  hurrying between the tents .  there was no time for half measures .  tiffany pulled her around and shouted     hellomisstickyesi   mfineihopeyouare welltoowhatisthethirdwishquicklythisis importantpleasedon   targueoraskquestion thereisn   ttime .      miss tick  to her credit  hesitated only for a moment or two .     to have a hundred more wishes  isn   t it .     she said .   tiffany stared at her and then said     thank you .  it isn   t  but that   s a clue  too .         tiffany  there   s a       miss tick began .   but tiffany had seen granny weatherwax .   she was standing in the middle of the field  in a big square that had been roped off for some reason .  no one seemed to notice her .  she was watching the frantic witches around the hiver  where there was an occasional flash and sparkle of magic .  she had a calm  faraway look .   tiffany brushed miss tick   s arm away  ducked under the rope  and ran up to her .      granny .      the blue eyes turned to her .      yes .         in stories  where the genie or the magic frog or the fairy godmother gives you three wishes   what   s the third wish .         ah  stories     said granny .     that   s easy .  in any story worth the tellin     that knows about the way of the world  the third wish is the one that undoes the harm the first two wishes caused .         yes .  that   s it .  that   s it .     shouted tiffany  and the words piling up behind the question poured out .     it   s not evil .  it can   t be .  it hasn   t got a mind of its own .  this is all about wishes .  our wishes .  it   s like in the stories  where they           calm down .  take a deep breath     said granny .  she took tiffany by the shoulders so that she faced the panicking crowd .      you got frightened for a moment  and now it   s comin    and it   s not going to turn back  not now     cuz it   s desperate .  it don   t even see the crowd .  they don   t mean a thing to it .  it   s you it wants .  it   s you it   s after .  you should be the one who faces it .  are you ready .         but supposing i lose           i never got where i am today by supposin    i was goin    to lose  young lady .  you beat it once   you can do it again .         but i could turn into something terrible .         then you   ll face me     said granny .     you   ll face me  on my ground .  but that won   t happen  will it .  you were fed up with grubby babies and silly women .  then this is   the other stuff .  it   s noon now .  they should   ve started the trials proper  but  hah  it looks as though people have forgotten .  now  then   do you have it in you to be a witch by noonlight  far away from your hills .         yes .     there was no other answer  not to granny weatherwax .   granny weatherwax bowed low and then took a few steps back .      in your own time  then  madam     she said .   wishes  wishes  wishes  thought tiffany  distracted  fumbling in her pockets for the bits to make a shamble .  it   s not evil .  it gives us what we think we want .  and what do people ask for .  more wishes .   you couldn   t say  a monster got into my head and made me do it .  she   d wished the money was hers .  the hiver just took her at her thought .   you couldn   t say  yes  but i   d never have really taken it .  the hiver used what it found   the little secret wishes  the desires  the moments of rage  all the things that real humans knew how to ignore .  it didn   t let you ignore them .   then  as she fumbled to tie the pieces together  the egg flipped out of her hands  trusted in gravity  and smashed on the toe of her boot .   she stared at it  the blackness of despair darkening the noonlight .  why did i try this .  i   ve never made a shamble that worked  so why did i try .  because i believed it had to work this time  that   s why .  like in a story .  suddenly it would all be   all right .   but this isn   t a story  and there are no more eggs    .   there was a scream  but it was high up and the sound of it took tiffany home in the bounce of a heartbeat .  it was a buzzard  in the eye of the sun  getting bigger in its plunge toward the field .   it soared up again as it passed over tiffany   s head  fast as an arrow  and as it did so  something small let go its hold on the buzzard   s talons with a cry of    crivens .      rob anybody dropped like a stone  but there was a thwap .  and suddenly a balloon of cloth snapped open above him .  two balloons  in fact  or to put it another way  rob anybody had    borrowed    hamish   s parachute .   he let go of them as soon as they   d slowed him down  and dropped neatly into the shamble .      did ye think we   d leave ye .     he shouted  holding on to the strings .     i   m under a geas  me .  get on wi    it  right noo .         what .  i can   t .     said tiffany  trying to shake him off .     not with you .  i   ll kill you .  i always crack the eggs .  what goose .         dinna argue .     shouted rob  bouncing up and down in the strings .     do it .  or ye   re no    the hag of the hills .  an    i know ye are .      people were running past now .  tiffany glanced up .  she thought she could see the hiver now as a moving shape in the dust .   she looked at the tangle in her hands and at rob   s grinning face .   the moment twanged .   a witch deals with things  said her second thoughts .  get past the    i can   t .      o kay     why hasn   t it ever worked before .  because there was no reason for it to work .  i didn   t need it to work .   i need it to help me now .  no .  i need me to help me .   so think about it .  ignore the noise  ignore the hiver rolling toward me over the trodden grass     she   d used the things she   d had  so that was right .  calm down .  slow down .  look at the shamble .  think about the moment .  there were all the things from home     no .  not all the things .  not all the things at all .  this time she felt the shape of what wasn   t there        and tugged at the silver horse around her neck  breaking its chain  then hanging it in the threads .   suddenly her thoughts were as cool and clear as ice  as bright and shiny as they needed to be .  let   s see   that looks better there   and that needs to be pulled this way     the movement jerked the silver horse into life .  then it spun gently  passing through the threads and rob anybody  who said    didna hurt a bit .  keep goin    .      tiffany felt a tingle in her feet .  the horse gleamed as it turned .      i dinna want to hurry ye .     said rob anybody .     but hurry .      i   m far from home  thought tiffany  in the same clear way  but i have it in my eye .  now i open my eyes .  now i open my eyes again     ahh     can i be a witch away from my hills .  of course i can .  i never really leave you  land under wave    .       shepherds on the chalk felt the ground shake  like thunder under the turf .  birds scattered from the bushes .  the sheep looked up .   again  the ground trembled .   some people said a shadow crossed the sun .  some people said they heard the sound of hooves .   and a boy trying to catch hares in the little valley of the horse said the hillside had burst and a horse had leaped out like a wave as high as the sky  with a mane like the surf of the sea and a coat as white as chalk .  he said it had galloped into the air like rising mist  and flown toward the mountains like a storm .   he got punished for telling stories  of course  but he thought it was worth it .       the shamble glowed .  silver coursed along the threads .  it was coming from tiffany   s hands  sparking like stars .   in that light she saw the hiver reach her and spread out until it was all around her  invisibility made visible .  it rippled and reflected the light oddly .  in those glints and sparkles there were faces  wavering and stretching like reflections in water .   time was going slowly .  she could see  beyond the wall of hiver  witches staring at her .  one had lost her hat in the commotion  but it was hanging in the air .  it hadn   t had time to fall yet .   tiffany   s fingers moved .  the hiver shimmered in the air  disturbed like a pond when a pebble has been dropped into it .  tendrils of it reached toward her .  she felt its panic  felt its terror as it found itself caught        welcome     said tiffany .   welcome .  said the hiver in tiffany   s own voice .      yes .  you are welcome in this place .  you are safe here .      no .  we are never safe .      you are safe here     tiffany repeated .   please .  said the hiver .  shelter us .      the wizard was nearly right about you     said tiffany .     you hid in other creatures .  but he didn   t wonder why .  what are you hiding from .      everything  said the hiver .      i think i know what you mean     said tiffany .   do you .  do you know what it feels like to be aware of every star  every blade of grass .  yes .  you do .  you call it    opening your eyes again .     but you do it for a moment .  we have done it for eternity .  no sleep  no rest  just endless   endless experience  endless awareness .  of everything .  all the time .  how we envy you  envy you .  lucky humans  who can close your minds to the endless cold deeps of space .  you have this thing you call   boredom .  that is the rarest talent in the universe .  we heard a song   it went    twinkle twinkle little star    .     what power .  what wondrous power .  you can take a billion trillion tons of flaming matter  a furnace of unimaginable strength  and turn it into a little song for children .  you build little worlds  little stories  little shells around your minds  and that keeps infinity at bay and allows you to wake up in the morning without screaming .   completely binkers .  said a cheerful voice at the back of tiffany   s memory .  you just couldn   t keep dr .  bustle down .   pity us  yes  pity us  said the voices of the hiver .  no shield for us  no rest for us  no sanctuary .  but you  you withstood us .  we saw that in you .  you have minds within minds .  hide us .      you want silence .     said tiffany .   yes  and more than silence  said the voice of the hiver .  you humans are so good at ignoring things .  you are almost blind and almost deaf .  you look at a tree and see   just a tree  a stiff weed .  you don   t see its history  feel the pumping of the sap  hear every insect in the bark  sense the chemistry of the leaves  notice the hundred shades of green  the tiny movements to follow the sun  the subtle growth of the wood        but you don   t understand us     said tiffany .     i don   t think any human could survive you .  you give us what you think we want  as soon as we want it  just like in fairy stories .  and the wishes always go wrong .      yes .  we know that now .  we have an echo of you now .  we have   understanding  said the hiver .  so now we come to you with a wish .  it is the wish that puts the others right .      yes     said tiffany .     that   s always the last wish  the third wish .  it   s the one that says    make this not have happened .         teach us the way to die  said the voices of the hiver .      i don   t know it .      all humans know the way  said the voices of the hiver .  you walk it every day of your short  short lives .  you know it .  we envy you your knowledge .  you know how to end .  you are very talented .   i must know how to die  tiffany thought .  somewhere deep down .  let me think .  let me get past the    i can   t .         she held up the glittering shamble .  shafts of light still spun off it  but she didn   t need it anymore .  she could hold the power in the center of herself .  it was all a matter of balance .   the light died .  rob anybody was still hanging in the threads  but all his hair had come unplaited and stood out from his head in a great red ball .  he looked stunned .      i could just murrrder a kebab     he said .   tiffany lowered him to the ground  where he swayed slightly  then she put the rest of the shamble in her pocket .      thank you  rob     she said .     but i want you to go now .  it could get   serious .      it was  of course  the wrong thing to say .      i   m no    leavin    .     he snapped .     i promised jeannie to keep ye safe .  let   s get on wi    it .      there was no arguing .  rob was standing in that half crouch of his  fists bunched  chin out  ready for anything and burning with defiance .      thank you     said tiffany  and straightened up .   death is right behind us  she thought .  life ends  and there   s death  waiting .  so   it must be close .  very close .   it would be   a door .  yes .  an old door  old wood .  dark  too .   she turned .  behind her  there was a black door in the air .   the hinges would creak  she thought .   when she pushed it open  they did .   so oo   she thought  this isn   t exactly real .  i   m telling myself a story i can understand  about doors  and i   m fooling myself just enough for it all to work .  i just have to keep balanced on that edge for it to go on working  too .  that   s as hard as not thinking about a pink rhinoceros .  and if granny weatherwax can do that  i can too .   beyond the door  black sand stretched away under a sky of pale stars .  there were some mountains on the distant horizon .   you must help us through  said the voices of the hiver .      if you   ll tak    my advice  you   ll no    do that     said rob anybody from tiffany   s ankle .     i dinna trust the scunner one wee bitty .         there   s part of me in there .  i trust that     she said .     i did say you don   t have to come  rob .         oh  aye .  an    i   m tae see ye go through there alone  am i .  ye   ll not find me leavin    ye now .         you   ve got a clan and a wife  rob .         aye  an    so i willna dishonor them by lettin    yer step across death   s threshold alone     said rob anybody firmly .   so  thought tiffany as she stared through the doorway  this is what we do .  we live on the edges .  we help those who can   t find the way    .   she took a deep breath and stepped across .   nothing much changed .  the sand felt gritty underfoot and crunched when she walked over it  as she expected  but when it was kicked up  it fell back as slowly as thistledown  and she hadn   t expected that .  the air wasn   t cold  but it was thin and prickly to breathe .   the door shut softly behind her .   thank you  said the voices of the hiver .  what do we do now .   tiffany looked around her  and up at the stars .  they weren   t ones that she recognized .      you die  i think     she said .   but there is no    me    to die  said the voices of the hiver .  there is only us .   tiffany took a deep breath .  this was about words  and she knew about words .     here is a story to believe     she said .     once we were blobs in the sea  and then fishes  and then lizards and rats  and then monkeys  and hundreds of things in between .  this hand was once a fin  this hand once had claws .  in my human mouth i have the pointy teeth of a wolf and the chisel teeth of a rabbit and the grinding teeth of a cow .  our blood is as salty as the sea we used to live in .  when we   re frightened  the hair on our skin stands up  just like it did when we had fur .  we are history .  everything we   ve ever been on the way to becoming us  we still are .  would you like the rest of the story .      tell us  said the hiver .      i   m made up of the memories of my parents and grandparents  all my ancestors .  they   re in the way i look  in the color of my hair .  and i   m made up of everyone i   ve ever met who   s changed the way i think .  so who is    me    .      the piece that just told us that story  said the hiver .  the piece that   s truly you .      well   yes .  but you must have that too .  you know you say you   re    us      who is it saying it .  who is saying you   re not you .  you   re not different from us .  we   re just much  much better at forgetting .  and we know when not to listen to the monkey .      you   ve just puzzled us  said the hiver .      the old bit of our brains that wants to be head monkey  and attacks when it   s surprised     said tiffany .     it reacts .  it doesn   t think .  being human is knowing when not to be the monkey or the lizard or any of the other old echoes .  but when you take people over  you silence the human part .  you listen to the monkey .  the monkey doesn   t know what it needs  only what it wants .  no  you are not an    us .     you are an    i .         i  me  said the hiver .  i .  who am i .      do you want a name .  that helps .      yes .  a name    .      i   ve always liked arthur as a name .      arthur  said the hiver .  i like arthur too .  and if i am  i can stop .  what happens next .      the creatures you   took over  didn   t they die .      yes  said the arthur .  but we   but i didn   t see what happened .  they just stopped being here .   tiffany looked around at the endless sand .  she couldn   t see anybody  but there was something out there that suggested movement .  it was the occasional change in the light  perhaps  as if she was catching glimpses of something she was not supposed to see .      i think     she said     that you have to cross the desert .      what   s on the other side .  asked arthur .   tiffany hesitated .      some people think you go to a better world     she said .     some people think you come back to this one in a different body .  and some think there   s just nothing .  they think you just stop .      and what do you think .  arthur asked .      i think that there are no words to describe it     said tiffany .   is that true .  said arthur .      i think that   s why you have to cross the desert     said tiffany .     to find out .      i will look forward to it .  thank you .      good bye   arthur .      she felt the hiver fall away .  there wasn   t much sign of it   a movement of a few sand grains  a sizzle in the air   but it slid away slowly across the black sand .      an    bad cess an    good riddance tae ye .     rob anybody shouted after it .      no     said tiffany .     don   t say that .         aye  but it killed folk to stay alive .         it didn   t want to .  it didn   t know how people work .         that was a fine load of o    blethers ye gave it  at any rate     said rob admiringly .     not even a gonnagle could make up a load o    blethers like that .      tiffany wondered if it had been .  once  when the wandering teachers had come to the village  she had paid half a dozen eggs for a morning   s education on       wonders of the univers .  .        that was expensive  for education  but it had been thoroughly worth it .  the teacher had been a little bit crazy  even for a teacher  but what he   d said had seemed to make absolute sense .  one of the most amazing things about the universe  he had said  was that  sooner or later  everything is made of everything else  although it   ll probably take millions and millions of years for this to happen .  the other children had giggled or argued  but tiffany knew that what had once been tiny living creatures was now the chalk of the hills .  everything went around  even stars .   that had been a very good morning  especially since she   d been refunded half an egg for pointing out that universe had been spelled wrong .   was it true .  maybe that didn   t matter .  maybe it just had to be true enough for arthur .   her eyes  the inner eyes that opened twice  were beginning to close .  she could feel the power draining away .  you couldn   t stay in that state for long .  you became so aware of the universe that you stopped being aware of you .  how clever of humans to have learned how to close their minds .  was there anything so amazing in the universe as boredom .   she sat down  just for a moment  and picked up a handful of the sand .  it rose above her hand  twisting like smoke  reflecting the starlight  then settled back as if it had all the time in the world .   she had never felt this tired .   she still heard the inner voices .  the hiver had left memories behind  just a few .  she could remember when there had been no stars and when there had been no such thing as    yesterday .     she knew what was beyond the sky and beneath the grass .  but she couldn   t remember when she had last slept  properly slept  in a bed .  being unconscious didn   t count .  she closed her eyes  and closed her eyes again     someone kicked her hard on the foot .      dinna gae to sleep .     rob anybody shouted .     not here .  ye canna gae to sleep here .  rise an    shine .      still feeling muzzy  tiffany pushed herself back onto her feet  through gentle swirls of rising dust  and turned to the dark door .   it wasn   t there .   there were her footprints in the sand  but they went only a few feet and  anyway  were slowly disappearing .  there was nothing around her but dead desert  forever .   she turned back to look toward the distant mountains  but her view was blocked by a tall figure  all in black  holding a scythe .  it hadn   t been there before .   good afternoon  said death .       chapter         the egress      tiffany stared up into a black hood .  there was a skull in it  but the eye sockets glowed blue .   at least bones had never frightened tiffany .  they were only chalk that had walked around .      are you    .     she began  but rob anybody gave a yell and leaped straight for the hood .   there was a thud .  death took a step backward and raised a skeletal hand to his cowl .  he pulled rob anybody out by his hair and held him at arm   s length while the nac mac feegle cursed and kicked .   is this yours .  death asked tiffany .  the voice was heavy and all around her  like thunder .      no .  er   he   s his .      i was not expecting a nac mac feegle today  said death .  otherwise i would have worn protective clothing  ha ha .      they do fight a lot     tiffany admitted .     you are death  aren   t you .  i know this might sound like a silly question .      you are not afraid .      not yet .  but  er   which way to the egress  please .      there was a pause .  then death said  in a puzzled voice  isn   t that a female eagle .      no     said tiffany .     everyone thinks that .  actually  it   s the way out .  the exit .      death pointed  with the hand that still held the incandescently angry rob anybody .   that way .  you have to walk the desert .      all the way to the mountains .      yes .  but only the dead can take that way .      ye   ve got tae let me go sooner or later  ye big    natomy .     yelled rob anybody .     and then ye   re gonna get sich a kickin    .         there was a door here .     said tiffany .   ah  yes  said death .  but there are rules .  that was a way in  you see .      what   s the difference .   a fairly important one  i   m sorry to say .  you will have to see yourselves out .  do not fall asleep here .  sleep here never ends .   death vanished .  rob anybody dropped to the sand and came up ready to fight  but they were alone .      ye   ll have to make a door oout     he said .      i don   t know how .  rob  i told you not to come with me .  can   t you get out .         aye .  probably .  but i   ve got to see ye safe .  the kelda put a geas on me .  i must save the hag o    the hills .         jeannie told you that .         aye .  she was verra definite     said rob anybody .   tiffany slumped down onto the sand again .  it fountained up around her .      i   ll never get out     she said .  how to get in  yes  that wasn   t hard    .   she looked around .  they weren   t obvious  but there were occasional changes in the light  and little puffs of dust .   people she couldn   t see were walking past her .  people were crossing the desert .  dead people  going to find out what was beyond the mountains     i   m eleven  she thought .  people will be upset .  she thought about the farm  and how her mother and father would react .  but there wouldn   t be a body  would there .  so people would hope and hope that she   d come back and was just   missing  like old mrs .  happens in the village  who lit a candle in the window every night for her son who   d been lost at sea thirty years ago .   she wondered if rob could send a message   but what could she say .     i   m not dead  i   m just stuck    .      i should have thought of other people     she said aloud .      aye  weel  ye did     said rob  sitting down by her foot .     yon arthur went off happy  and ye saved other folk fra    being killed .  ye did what ye had to do .      yes  thought tiffany .  that   s what we have to do .  and there   s no one to protect you  because you   re the one who   s supposed to do that sort of thing .   but her second thoughts said  i   m glad i did it .  i   d do it again .  i stopped the hiver killing anyone else  even though we led it right into the trials .  and that thought was followed by a space .  there should have been another thought  but she was too tired to have it .  it had been important .      thank you for coming  rob     she said .     but when   you can leave  you must go straight back to jeannie  understand .  and tell her i   m grateful she sent you .  say i wish we   d had a chance to get to know each other better .         oh  aye .  i   ve sent the lads back anyway .  hamish is waitin    for me .      at which point the door appeared  and opened .   granny weatherwax stepped through and beckoned urgently .      some people don   t have the sense they were born with .  come on  right now .     she commanded .  behind her the door started to swing shut  but she swung around savagely and rammed her boot against the jamb  shouting     oh  no you don   t  you sly devil .         but   i thought there were rules .     said tiffany  getting up and hurrying forward  all tiredness sudden gone .  even a tired body wants to survive .      oh .  really .     said granny .     did you sign anything .  did you take any kind of oath .  no .  then they weren   t your rules .  quickly  now .  and you  mr .  anyone .      rob anybody jumped onto her boot just before she pulled it away .  the door shut with another click  disappeared  and left them in   dead light  it seemed  a space of gray air .      won   t take long     said granny weatherwax .     it doesn   t usually .  it   s the world getting back into line .  oh  don   t look like that .  you showed it the way  right .  out of pity .  well  i know this path already .  you   ll tread it again  no doubt  for some other poor soul  open the door for them as can   t find it .  but we don   t talk about it  understand .         miss level never           we don   t talk about it  i said     said granny weatherwax .     do you know what a part of being a witch is .  it   s making the choices that have to be made .  the hard choices .  but you did   quite well .  there   s no shame in pity .      she brushed some grass seed off her dress .      i hope mrs .  ogg has arrived     she said .     i need her recipe for apple chutney .  oh   when we arrive you might feel a bit dizzy .  i   d better warn you .         granny .     said tiffany  as the light began to grow brighter .  it brought tiredness back with it  too .      yes .         what exactly happened just then .         what do you think happened .      light burst in upon them .       someone was wiping tiffany   s forehead with a damp cloth .   she lay  feeling the beautiful coolness .  there were voices around her  and she recognized the chronic complainer tones of annagramma         and she was really making a fuss in zakzak   s .  honestly  i don   t think she   s quite right in the head .  i think she   s literally gone cuckoo .  she was shouting things and using some kind of  oh  i don   t know  some peasant trick to make us think she   d turned that fool brian into a frog .  well  of course  she didn   t fool me for one minute        tiffany opened her eyes and saw the round pink face of petulia  screwed up with concern .      um  she   s awake .     said the girl .   the space between tiffany and the ceiling filled up with pointy hats .  they drew back  reluctantly  as she sat up .  from above  it must have looked like a dark daisy  closing and opening .      where is this .     she said .      um  the first aid and lost children   s tent     said petulia .     um   you fainted when mistress weatherwax brought you back from   from wherever you   d gone .  everyone   s been in to see you .         she said you   d  like  dragged the monster into  like  the next world .     said lucy warbeck  her eyes gleaming .     mistress weatherwax told everyone all about it .         well  it wasn   t quite       tiffany began .  she felt something prod her in the back .  she reached behind her  and her hand came out holding a pointy hat .  it was almost gray with age and quite battered .  zakzak wouldn   t have dared try to sell something like this  but the other girls stared at it like starving dogs watching a butcher   s hand .      um  mistress weatherwax gave you her hat     breathed petulia .     her actual hat .         she said you were a born witch and no witch should be without a hat .     said dimity hubbub  watching .      that   s nice     said tiffany .  she was used to secondhand clothes .      it   s only an old hat     said annagramma .   tiffany looked up at the tall girl and let herself smile slowly .      annagramma .     she said  raising a hand with the fingers open .   annagramma backed away .     oh no     she said .     don   t you do that .  don   t you do that .  someone stop her doing that .         do you want a balloon  annagramma .     said tiffany  sliding off the table .      no .  please .     annagramma took another step back  holding her arms in front of her face  and fell over a bench .  tiffany picked her up and patted her cheerfully on a cheek .      then i shan   t buy you one     she said .     but please learn what literally really means  will you .      annagramma smiled in a frozen kind of way .     er  yes     she managed .      good .  and then we will be friends .      she left the girl standing there and went back to pick up the hat .      um  you   re probably still a bit woozy     said petulia .     you probably don   t understand .         ha  i wasn   t actually frightened  you know     said annagramma .     it was all for fun  of course .     no one paid any attention .      understand what .     said tiffany .      it   s her actual hat .     the girls chorused .      it   s like  if that hat could talk  what stories it would have to  you know  tell     said lucy warbeck .      it was just a joke     said annagramma to anyone who was listening .   tiffany looked at the hat .  it was very battered  and not extremely clean .  if that hat could talk  it would probably mutter .      where   s granny weatherwax now .     she said .   there was a gasp from the girls .  this was nearly as impressive as the hat .      um   she doesn   t mind you calling her that .     said petulia .      she invited me to     said tiffany .      only we heard you had to have known her for  like  a hundred years before she let you call her that       said lucy warbeck .   tiffany shrugged .     well  anyway     she said     do you know where she is .         oh  having tea with the other old witches and yacking on about chutney and how witches today aren   t what they were when she was a girl     said lulu darling .      what .     said tiffany .     just having tea .      the young witches looked at one another in puzzlement .      um  there   s buns too     said petulia .     if that   s important .         but she opened the door for me .  the door into   out of the   the desert .  you can   t just sit down after that and have buns .         um  the ones i saw had icing on them     petulia ventured nervously .     they weren   t just homemade           look     said lucy warbeck     we didn   t really  you know  see anything .  you were just standing there with this like glow around you and we couldn   t get in and then gran   mistress weatherwax walked up and stepped right in and you both  you know  stood there .  and then the glow went zip and vanished and you  like  fell over .         what lucy   s failing to say very accurately     said annagramma     is that we didn   t actually see you go anywhere .  i   m telling you this as a friend  of course .  there was just this glow  which could have been anything .      annagramma was going to be a good witch  tiffany considered .  she could tell herself stories that she literally believed .  and she could bounce back like a ball .      don   t forget  i saw the horse     said harrieta bilk .   annagramma rolled her eyes .     oh yes  harrieta thinks she saw some kind of horse in the sky .  except it didn   t look like a horse  she says .  she says it looked like a horse would look if you took the actual horse away and just left the horsiness  right  harrieta .         i didn   t say that .     snapped harrieta .      well  pardon me .  that   s what it sounded like .         um  and some people said they saw a white horse grazing in the next field  too     said petulia .     and a lot of the older witches said they felt a tremendous amount of           yes  some people thought they saw a horse in a field  but it isn   t there anymore     said annagramma in the singsong voice she used when she thought it was all stupid .     that must be very rare in the country  seeing horses in fields .  anyway  if there really was a white horse  it was gray .      tiffany sat on the edge of the table  staring at her knees .  anger at annagramma had jolted her to life  but now the tiredness was creeping back again .      i suppose none of you saw a little blue man  about six inches high  with red hair .     she said quietly .      anyone .     said annagramma with malicious cheerfulness .  there was a general mumbling of    no .         sorry  tiffany     said lucy .      don   t worry     said annagramma .     he probably just rode away on his white horse .      this is going to be like fairyland all over again  thought tiffany .  even i can   t remember if it was real .  why should anyone believe me .  but she had to try .      there was a dark doorway     she said slowly     and beyond it was a desert of black sand  and it was light although there were stars in the sky  and death was there .  i spoke to him    .         you spoke to him  did you .     said annagramma .     and what did he say  pray .         he didn   t say pray     said tiffany .     we didn   t talk about much .  but he didn   t know what an egress was .         it   s a small type of heron  isn   t it .     said harrieta .   there was silence  except for the noise of the trials outside .      it   s not your fault     said annagramma in what was  for her  almost a friendly voice .     it   s like i said  mistress weatherwax messes with people   s heads .         what about the glow .     said lucy .      that was probably ball lightning     said annagramma .     that   s very strange stuff .         but people were  like  hammering on it .  it was as hard as ice .         ah  well  it probably felt like that     said annagramma     but it was   probably affecting people   s muscles  maybe .  i   m only trying to be helpful here     she added .     you   ve got to be sensible .  she just stood there .  you saw her .  there weren   t any doors or deserts .  there was just her .      tiffany sighed .  she felt tired .  she wanted to crawl off somewhere .  she wanted to go home .  she   d walk there now if her boots weren   t suddenly so uncomfortable .   while the girls argued  she undid the laces and tugged one off .   silver black dust poured out .  when it hit the ground  it bounced slowly  curving up into the air again like mist .   the girls turned  watching in silence .  then petulia reached down and caught some of the dust .  when she lifted her hand  the fine stuff flowed between her fingers .  it fell as slowly as feathers .      sometimes things go wrong     she said  in a faraway voice .     mistress blackcap told me .  haven   t any of you been there when old folk are dying .     there were one or two nods  but everyone was watching the dust .      sometimes things go wrong     said petulia again .     sometimes they   re dying but they can   t leave because they don   t know the way .  she said that   s when they need you to be there  close to them  to help them find the door so they don   t get lost in the dark .         petulia  we   re not supposed to talk about this     said harrieta gently .      no .     said petulia  her face red .     it is time to talk about it  just here  just us .  because she said it   s the last thing you can do for someone .  she said there   s a dark desert they have to cross  where the sand           hah .  mrs .  earwig says that sort of thing is black magic     said annagramma  her voice as sharp and sudden as a knife .      does she .     said petulia dreamily as the sand poured down .     well  mistress blackcap said that sometimes the moon is light and sometimes it   s in shadow  but you should always remember it   s the same moon .  and   annagramma .         yes .      petulia took a deep breath .      don   t you ever dare interrupt me again as long as you live .  don   t you dare .  don   t you dare .  i mean it .          chapter         the witch trials      and then   there were the trials themselves .  that was the point of the day  wasn   t it .  but tiffany  stepping out with the girls around her  sensed the buzz in the air .  it said  was there any point now .  after what had happened .   still  people had put up the rope square again  and a lot of the older witches dragged their chairs to the edge of it  and it seemed that it was going to happen after all .  tiffany wandered up to the rope  found a space  and sat down on the grass with granny weatherwax   s hat in front of her .   she was aware of the other girls behind her  and also of a buzz or susurration of whispering spreading out into the crowd .         she really did do it  too    .  no  really   all the way to the desert    .  saw the dust   her bootswere full  they say    .      gossip spreads faster among witches than a bad cold .  witches gossip like starlings .   there were no judges and no prizes .  the trials weren   t like that  as petulia had said .  the point was to show what you could do  to show what you   d become  so that people would go away thinking things like    that caramella bottlethwaite  she   s coming along nicely .     it wasn   t a competition  honestly .  no one won .   and if you believed that  you   d believe that the moon is pushed around the sky by a goblin called wilberforce .   what was true was that one of the older witches generally opened the thing with some competent but not surprising trick that everyone had seen before but still appreciated .  that broke the ice .  this year it was old goodie trample and her collection of singing mice .   but tiffany wasn   t paying attention .  on the other side of the roped off square  sitting on a chair and surrounded by older witches like a queen on her throne  was granny weatherwax .   the whispering went on .  maybe opening her eyes had opened her ears  too  because tiffany felt she could hear the whispers all around the square .         din   t have no trainin     just did it    .  did you see that horse .    i never saw no horse .    din   t just open the door  she stepped right in .    yeah  but who was it fetched her back .  esme weatherwax  that   s who .    yes  that   s what i   m sayin     any little fool could   ve opened the door by luck  but it takes a real witch to bring her back  that   s a winner  that is    .  fought the thing  left it there .    i didn   t see you doing anything  violet pulsimone .  that child   was there a horse or not .    was going to do my dancing broom trick  but that   d be wasted now  of course    .  why did mistress weatherwax give the girl her hat  eh .  what   s she want us to think .  she never takes off her hat to no one .      you could feel the tension  crackling from pointy hat to pointy hat like summer lighting .   the mice did their best with    i   m forever blowing bubbles     but it was easy to see that their minds weren   t on it .  mice are high strung and very temperamental .   now people were leaning down beside granny weatherwax .  tiffany could see some animated conversations going on .      you know  tiffany     said lucy warbeck  behind her     all you   ve got to do is  like  stand up and admit it .  everyone knows you did it .  i mean no one   s ever  like  done something like that at the trials .         and it   s about time the old bully lost     said annagramma .   but she   s not a bully  tiffany thought .  she   s tough  and she expects other witches to be tough  because the edge is no place for people who break .  everything with her is a kind of test .  and her third thoughts handed over the thought that had not quite made it back in the tent  granny weatherwax  you knew the hiver would only come for me  didn   t you .  you talked to dr .  bustle  you told me .  did you just turn me into your trick for today .  how much did you guess .  or know .      you   d win     said dimity hubbub .     even some of the older ones would like to see her taken down a peg .  they know big magic happened .  there   s not a whole shamble for miles .      so i   d win because some people don   t like somebody else .  tiffany thought .  oh  yes  that   s really be something to be proud of    .      you can bet she   ll stand up     said annagramma .     you watch .  she   ll explain how the poor child got dragged into the next world by a monster  and she brought her back .  that   s what i   d do  if i was her .      i expect you would  tiffany thought .  but you   re not  and you   re not me  either .   she stared at granny weatherwax  who was waving away a couple of elderly witches .   i wonder  she thought  if they   ve been saying things like    this girl needs taking down a peg  mistress weatherwax .     and as she thought that  granny turned back and caught her eye     the mice stopped singing  mostly in embarrassment .  there was a pause  and then people started to clap  because it was the sort of thing you had to do .   a witch  someone tiffany didn   t know  stepped out into the square  still clapping in that fluttery  hands held close together at shoulder height way that people use when they want to encourage the audience to go on applauding just that little bit longer .      very well done  doris  excellent work  as ever     she trilled .     they   ve come along marvelously since last year  thank you very much  wonderful  well done   ahem        the woman hesitated  while behind her doris trample crawled around on hands and knees trying to urge her mice back into their box .  one of them was having hysterics .      and now  perhaps   some lady would like to  er   take the  er   stage .     said the mistress of ceremonies  as brightly as a glass ball about to shatter .     anyone .      there was stillness  and silence .      don   t be shy  ladies .     the voice of the mistress of ceremonies was getting more strained by the second .  it   s no fun trying to organize a field full of born organizers .     modesty does not become us .  anyone .      tiffany felt the pointy hats turning  some toward her  some toward granny weatherwax .  away across the few yards of grass  granny reached up and brushed someone   s hand from her shoulder  sharply  without breaking eye contact with tiffany .  and we   re not wearing hats  thought tiffany .  you gave me a virtual hat once  granny weatherwax  and i thank you for it .  but i don   t need it today .  today  i know i   m a witch .      oh  come now  ladies .     said the mistress of ceremonies  now almost frantic .     this is the trials .  a place for friendly and instructive contestation in an atmosphere of fraternity and goodwill .  surely some lady   or young lady  perhaps    .      tiffany smiled .  it should be sorority  not fraternity .  we   re sisters  mistress  not brothers .      come on  tiffany .     dimity urged .     they know you   re good .      tiffany shook her head .      oh  well  that   s it     said annagramma  rolling her eyes .     the old baggage has messed with the girl   s head  as usual           i don   t know who   s messed with whose head     snapped petulia  rolling up her sleeves .     but i   m going to do the pig trick .     she got to her feet  and there was a general stir in the crowd .      oh  i see it   s going to be   oh  it   s you  petulia     said the mistress of ceremonies  slightly disappointed .      yes  miss casement  and i intend to perform the pig trick     said petulia loudly .      but  er  you don   t seem to have brought a pig with you     said miss casement  taken aback .      yes  miss casement .  i shall perform the pig trick   without a pig .      this caused a sensation  and cries of    impossible .     and    there are children here  you know .      miss casement looked around for assistance and found none .      oh well     she said helplessly .     if you are sure  dear           yes .  i am .  i shall use   a sausage .     said petulia  producing one from a pocket and holding it up .  there was another sensation .   tiffany didn   t see the trick .  nor did granny weatherwax .  their gaze was like an iron bar  and even miss casement instinctively didn   t step into it .   but tiffany heard the squeal  and the gasp of amazement  and then the thunder of applause .  people would have applauded anything at that point  in the same way that pent up water would take any route out of a dam .   and then witches got up .  miss level juggled balls that stopped and reversed direction in midair .  a middle aged witch demonstrated a new way to stop people from choking  which doesn   t even sound magical until you understand that a way of turning nearly dead people into fully alive people is worth a dozen spells that just go twing .  and other women and girls came up one at a time  with big tricks and handy tips and things that went wheee .  or stopped toothache or  in one case  exploded        and then there were no more entries .   miss casement walked back into the center of the field  almost drunk with relief that there had been a trials  and made one final invitation to any ladies    or  indeed  young ladies    who might like to come forward .   there was a silence so thick you could have stuck pins in it .   and then she said     oh  well   in that case  i declare the trials well and truly closed .  tea will be in the big tent .      tiffany and granny stood up at the same time  to the second  and bowed to each other .  then granny turned away and joined the stampede toward the teas .  it was interesting to see how the crowd parted  all unaware  to let her through  like the sea in front of a particularly good prophet .   petulia was surrounded by other young witches .  the pig trick had gone down very well .  tiffany lined up to give her a hug .      but you could have won .     said petulia  red in the face with happiness and worry .      that doesn   t matter .  it really doesn   t     said tiffany .      you gave it away     said a sharp voice behind her .     you had it in your hand  and you gave it all away .  how do you feel about that  tiffany .  do you have a taste for humble pie .         now you listen to me  annagramma     petulia began  pointing a furious finger .   tiffany reached out and lowered the girl   s arm .  then she turned and smiled so happily at annagramma that it was disturbing .   what she wanted to say was     where i come from  annagramma  they have the sheepdog trials .  shepherds travel there from all over to show off their dogs .  and there   re silver crooks and belts with silver buckles and prizes of all kinds  annagramma  but do you know what the big prize is .  no  you wouldn   t .  oh  there are judges  but they don   t count  not for the big prize .  there is   there was a little old lady who was always at the front of the crowd  leaning on the hurdles with her pipe in her mouth with the two finest sheepdogs ever pupped sitting at her feet .  their names were thunder and lightning  and they moved so fast  they set the air on fire and their coats outshone the sun  but she never  ever put them in the trials .  she knew more about sheep than even sheep know .  and what every young shepherd wanted  really wanted  wasn   t some silly cup or belt but to see her take her pipe out of her mouth as he left the arena and quietly say     that   ll do     because that meant he was a real shepherd and all the other shepherds would know it  too .  and if you   d told him he had to challenge her  he   d cuss at you and stamp his foot and tell you he   d sooner spit the sun dark .  how could he ever win .  she was shepherding .  it was the whole of her life .  what you took away from her you   d take away from yourself .  you don   t understand that  do you .  but it   s the heart and soul and center of it .  the soul   and   center .      but it would be wasted  so what she said was     oh  just shut up  annagramma .  let   s see if there   s any buns left  shall we .      overhead  a buzzard screamed .  she looked up .   the bird turned on the wind and  racing through the air as it began the long glide  headed back toward home .   they were always there .       beside her cauldron  jeannie opened her eyes .      he   s comin    hame .     she said  scrambling to her feet .  she waved a hand urgently at the watching feegles .     don   t ye just stand there gawping .     she commanded .     catch some rabbits to roast .  build up the fire .  boil up a load o    water     cuz i   m takin    a bath .  look at this place     tis like a midden .  get it cleaned up .  i want it sparkling for the big man .  go an    steal some special sheep liniment .  cut some green boughs  holly or yew  mebbe .  shine up the golden plates .  the place must sparkle .  what   re ye all standin    there for .         er  what did ye want us to do first  kelda .     asked a feegle nervously .      all of it .      in her chamber they filled the kelda   s soup bowl bath and she scrubbed  using one of tiffany   s old toothbrushes  while outside there were the sounds of feegles working hard at cross purposes .  the smell of roasting rabbit began to fill the mound .   jeannie dressed herself in her best dress  did her hair  picked up her shawl  and climbed out of the hole .  she stood there watching the mountains until  after about an hour  a dot in the sky got bigger and bigger .   as a kelda  she would welcome home a warrior .  as a wife  she would kiss her husband and scold him for being so long away .  as a woman  she thought she would melt with relief  thankfulness  and joy .       chapter         queen of the bees      and one afternoon about a week later  tiffany went to see granny weatherwax .   it was only fifteen miles as the broomstick flies  and as tiffany still didn   t like flying a broomstick  miss level took her .   it was the invisible part of miss level .  tiffany just lay flat on the stick  holding on with arms and legs and knees and ears if possible  and took along a paper bag to be sick into  because no one likes anonymous sick dropping out of the sky .  she was also holding a large burlap sack  which she handled with care .   she didn   t open her eyes until the rushing noises had stopped and the sounds around her told her she was probably very close to the ground .  in fact miss level had been very kind .  when she fell off  because of the cramp in her legs  the broomstick was just above some quite thick moss .      thank you     said tiffany as she got up  because it always pays to mind your manners around invisible people .   she had a new dress .  it was green  like the last one .  the complex world of favors and obligations and gifts that miss level lived and moved in had thrown up four yards of nice material  for the trouble free birth of miss quickly   s baby boy  and a few hours    dressmaking  mrs .  hunter   s bad leg feeling a lot better  thank you  .  she   d given the black one away .  when i   m old  i shall wear midnight  she   d decided .  but for now she   d had enough of darkness .   she looked around at this clearing on the side of a hill  surrounded by oak and sycamore on three sides but open on the downhill side with a wide view of the countryside below .  the sycamores were shedding their spinning seeds  which whirled down lazily across a patch of garden .  it was unfenced  even though some goats were grazing nearby .  if you wondered why the goats weren   t eating the garden  it was because you   d forgotten who lived here .  there was a well .  and  of course  a cottage .   mrs .  earwig would definitely have objected to the cottage .  it was out of a storybook .  the walls leaned against one another for support  the thatched roof was slipping off like a bad wig  and the chimneys were corkscrewed .  if you thought a gingerbread cottage would be too fattening  this was the next worst thing .   in a cottage deep in the forest lived the wicked old witch    .   it was a cottage out of the nastier kind of fairy tale .   granny weatherwax   s beehives were tucked away down one side of the cottage .  some were the old straw kind  most were patched up wooden ones .  they thundered with activity  even this late in the year .   tiffany turned aside to look at them  and the bees poured out in a dark stream .  they swarmed toward tiffany  formed a column  and     she laughed .  they   d made a witch of bees in front of her  thousands of them all holding station in the air .  she raised her right hand .  with a rise in the level of buzzing  the bee witch raised its right hand .  she turned around .  it turned around  the bees carefully copying every swirl and flutter of her dress  the ones on the very edge buzzing desperately because they had farthest to fly .   she carefully put down the big sack and reached out toward the figure .  with another roar of wings it went shapeless for a moment  then re formed a little way away  but with a hand outstretched toward her .  the bee that was the tip of its forefinger hovered just in front of tiffany   s fingernail .      shall we dance .     said tiffany .   in the clearing full of spinning seeds  she circled the swarm .  it kept up pretty well  moving fingertip to buzzing tip  turning when she turned  although there were always a few bees racing to catch up .   then it raised both its arms and twirled in the opposite direction  the bees in the    skirt    spreading out again as it spun .  it was learning .   tiffany laughed and did the same thing .  swarm and girl whirled across the clearing .   she felt happy and wondered if she   d ever felt this happy before .  the gold light  the falling seeds  the dancing bees   it was all one thing .  this was the opposite of the dark desert .  here  light was everywhere and filled her up inside .  she could feel herself here but see herself from above  twirling with a buzzing shadow that sparkled golden as the light struck the bees .  moments like this paid for it all .   then the witch made of bees leaned closer to tiffany  as if staring at her with its thousands of little jeweled eyes .  there was a faint piping noise from inside the figure and the bee witch exploded into a spreading  buzzing cloud of insects that raced away across the clearing and disappeared .  the only movement now was the whirring fall of the sycamore seeds .   tiffany breathed out .      now  some people would have found that scary     said a voice behind her .   tiffany didn   t turn around immediately .  first she said     good afternoon  granny weatherwax .     then she turned around .     have you ever done this .     she demanded  still half drunk with delight .      it   s rude to start with questions .  you   d better come in and have a cup of tea     said granny weatherwax .   you   d barely know that anyone lived in the cottage .  there were two chairs by the fire  one of them a rocking chair  and by the table were two chairs that didn   t rock but did wobble because of the uneven stone floor .  there was a dresser  and a rag rug in front of the huge hearth .  a broomstick leaned against the wall in one corner  next to something mysterious and pointy  under a cloth .  there was a very narrow and dark flight of stairs .  and that was it .  there was nothing shiny  nothing new  and nothing unnecessary .      to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit .     said granny weatherwax  taking a sooty black kettle off the fire and filling an equally black teapot .   tiffany opened the sack she had brought with her .      i   ve come to bring you your hat back     she said .      ah     said granny weatherwax .     have you .  and why .         because it   s your hat     said tiffany  putting it on the table .     thank you for the loan of it  though .         i daresay there   s plenty of young witches who   d give their high teeth for an ol    hat of mine     said granny  lifting up the battered hat .      there are     said tiffany  and did not add     and it   s eyeteeth  actually .     what she did add was     but i think everyone has to find their own hat .  the right hat for them  i mean .         i see you   re now wearing a shop bought one  then     said granny weatherwax .     one of them sky scrapers .  with stars     she added  and there was so much acid in the word    stars    that it would   ve melted copper and then dropped through the table and the floor and melted more copper in the cellar below .     think that makes it more magical  do you .  stars .         i   did when i bought it .  and it   ll do for now .         until you find the right hat     said granny weatherwax .      yes .         which ain   t mine .         no .         good .      the old witch walked across the room and tugged the cloth off the thing in the corner .  it turned out to be a big wooden spike  just about the size of a pointy hat on a tall stand .  a hat was being   constructed on it  with thin strips of willow and pins and stiff black cloth .      i make my own     she said .     every year .  there   s no hat like the hat you make yourself .  take my advice .  i stiffens the calico and makes it waterproof with special jollop .  it   s amazing what you can put into a hat you make yourself .  but you didn   t come to talk about hats .      tiffany let the question out at last .      was it real .      granny weatherwax poured the tea  picked up her cup and saucer  then carefully poured some of the tea out of the cup and into the saucer .  she held this up and  with care  like someone dealing with an important and delicate task  blew gently on it .  she did this slowly and calmly  while tiffany tried hard to conceal her impatience .      the hiver   s not around anymore .     said granny .      no .  but           and how did it all feel .  when it was happening .  did it feel real .         no     said tiffany .     it felt more than real .         well  there you are  then     said granny weatherwax  taking a sip from the saucer .     and the answer is  if it wasn   t real  it wasn   t false .         it was like a dream where you   ve nearly woken up and can control it  you know .     said tiffany .     if i was careful  it worked .  it was like making myself rise up in the air by pulling hard on my bootlaces .  it was like telling myself a story        granny nodded .      there   s always a story     she said .     it   s all stories  really .  the sun coming up every day is a story .  everything   s got a story in it .  change the story  change the world .         and what was your plan to beat the hiver .     asked tiffany .     please .  i   ve got to know .         my plan .     said granny weatherwax innocently .     my plan was to let you deal with it .         really .  so what would you have done if i   d lost .         the best i can     said granny calmly .     i always do .         would you have killed me if i   d become the hiver again .      the saucer was steady in the old witch   s hand .  she looked reflectively at the tea .      i would have spared you if i could     she said .     but i didn   t have to  right .  the trials was the best place to be .  believe me  witches can act together if they must .  it   s harder   n herding cats  but it can be done .         it   s just that i think we   turned it all into a little show     said tiffany .      hah  no .  we made it into a big show .     said granny weatherwax with great satisfaction .     thunder and lightning and white horses and wonderful rescues .  good value  eh  for a penny .  and you   ll learn  my girl  that a bit of a show every now and again does no harm to your reputation .  i daresay miss level   s findin    that out already  now she can juggle balls and raise her hat at the same time .  depend upon what i say .      she delicately drank her tea out of the saucer  then nodded at the old hat on the table .      your grandmother     she said     did she wear a hat .         what .  oh   not usually     said tiffany  still thinking about the big show .     she used to wear an old sack as a kind of bonnet when the weather was really bad .  she said hats only blow away up on the hill .         she made the sky her hat  then     said granny weatherwax .     and did she wear a coat .         hah  all the shepherds used to say that if you saw granny aching in a coat  it   d mean it was blowing rocks .     said tiffany proudly .      then she made the wind her coat  too     said granny weatherwax .     it   s a skill .  rain don   t fall on a witch if she doesn   t want it to  although personally i prefer to get wet and be thankful .         thankful for what .     said tiffany .      that i   ll get dry later .     granny weatherwax put down the cup and saucer .     child  you   ve come here to learn what   s true and what   s not  but there   s little i can teach you that you don   t already know .  you just don   t know you know it  and you   ll spend the rest of your life learning what   s already in your bones .  and that   s the truth .      she stared at tiffany   s hopeful face and sighed .      come outside then     she said .     i   ll give you lesson one .  it   s the only lesson there is .  it don   t need writing down in no book with eyes on it .      she led the way to the well in her back garden  looked around on the ground  and picked up a stick .      magic wand     she said .     see .     a green flame leaped out of it  making tiffany jump .     now you try .      it didn   t work for tiffany  no matter how much she shook it .      of course not     said granny .     it   s a stick .  now  maybe i made a flame come out of it  or maybe i made you think one did .  that don   t matter .  it was me is what i   m sayin     not the stick .  get your mind right and you can make a stick your wand and the sky your hat and a puddle your magic   your magic   er  what   re them fancy cups called .         er   goblet     said tiffany .      right .  magic goblet .  things aren   t important .  people are .     granny weatherwax looked sidelong at tiffany .     and i could teach you how to run across those hills of yours with the hare  i could teach you how to fly above them with the buzzard .  i could tell you the secrets of the bees .  i could teach you all this and much more besides  if you   d do just one thing  right here and now .  one simple thing  easy to do .      tiffany nodded  eyes wide .      you understand  then  that all the glittery stuff is just toys  and toys can lead you astray .         yes .         then take off that shiny horse you wear around your neck  girl  and drop it in the well .      obediently  half hypnotized by the voice  tiffany reached behind her neck and undid the clasp .   the pieces of the silver horse shone as she held it over the water .   she stared at it as if she was seeing it for the first time .  and then     she tests people  she thought .  all the time .      well .     said the old witch .      no     said tiffany .     i can   t .         can   t or won   t .     said granny sharply .      can   t     said tiffany and stuck out her chin .     and won   t .      she drew her hand back and refastened the necklace  glaring defiantly at granny weatherwax .   the witch smiled .      well done     she said quietly .     if you don   t know when to be a human being  you don   t know when to be a witch .  and if you   re too afraid of goin    astray  you won   t go anywhere .  may i see it  please .      tiffany looked into those blue eyes .  then she undid the clasp again and handed over the necklace .  granny held it up .      funny  ain   t it  that it seems to gallop when the light hits it     said the witch  watching it twist this way and that .     well made thing .  o    course  it   s not what a horse looks like  but it   s certainly what a horse is .      tiffany stared at her with her mouth open .  for a moment granny aching stood there grinning  and then granny weatherwax was back .  did she do that  she wondered  or did i do it myself .  and do i dare find out .      i didn   t just come to bring the hat back     she managed to say .     i brought you a present  too .         i   m sure there   s no call for anyone to bring me a present     said granny weatherwax  sniffing .   tiffany ignored this  because her mind was still spinning .  she fetched her sack again and handed over a small  soft parcel  which moved as it changed shape in her hands .      i took most of the stuff back to mr .  stronginthearm     she said .     but i thought you might have a   a use for this .      the old woman slowly unwrapped the white paper .  the zephyr billow cloak unrolled itself under her fingers and filled the air like smoke .      it   s lovely  but i couldn   t wear it     said tiffany as the cloak shaped itself over the gentle currents of the clearing .     you need gravitas to carry off a cloak like that .         what   s gravitarse .     said granny weatherwax sharply .      oh   dignity .  seniority .  wisdom .  those sorts of things     said tiffany .      ah     said granny  relaxing a little .  she stared at the gently rippling cloak and sniffed .  it really was a wonderful creation .  the wizards had got at least one thing right when they had made it .  it was one of those things that fill a hole in your life that you didn   t know was there until you   d seen it .      well  i suppose there   s those as can wear a cloak like this  and those as can   t     she conceded .  she let it curl around her neck and fastened it there with a crescent shaped brooch .      it   s a bit too grand for the likes of me     she said .     a bit too fancy .  i could look like a flibbertigibbet wearing something like this .     it was spoken like a statement but it had a curl like a question .      no  it suits you  it really does     said tiffany cheerfully .     if you don   t know when to be a human being  you don   t know when to be a witch .      birds stopped singing .  up in the trees  squirrels ran and hid .  even the sky seemed to darken for a moment .      er   that   s what i heard     said tiffany  and added     from someone who knows these things .      the blue eyes stared into hers .  there were no secrets from granny weatherwax .  whatever you said  she watched what you meant .      perhaps you   ll call again sometimes     she said  turning slowly and watching the cloak curve in the air .     it   s always very quiet here .         i should like that     said tiffany .     shall i tell the bees before i come  so you can get the tea ready .      for a moment granny weatherwax glared  and then the lines faded into a wry grin .      clever     she said .   what   s inside you .  tiffany thought .  who are you really  in there .  did you want me to take your hat .  you pretend to be the big bad wicked witch  and you   re not .  you test people all the time  test  test  test  but you really want them to be clever enough to beat you .  because it must be hard  being the best .  you   re not allowed to stop .  you can only be beaten  and you   re too proud ever to lose .  pride .  you   ve turned it into terrible strength  but it eats away at you .  are you afraid to laugh in case you hear an early cackle .   we   ll meet again  one day .  we both know it .  we   ll meet again  at the witch trials .      i   m clever enough to know how you manage not to think of a pink rhinoceros if someone says    pink rhinoceros        she managed to say aloud .      ah  that   s deep magic  that is     said granny weatherwax .      no .  it   s not .  you don   t know what a rhinoceros looks like  do you .      sunlight filled the clearing as the old witch laughed  as clear as a downland stream .      that   s right .     she said .       chapter         a hat full of sky      it was one of those strange days in late february when it   s a little warmer than it should be and  although there   s wind  it seems to be all around the horizons and never quite where you are .   tiffany climbed up onto the downs where  in the sheltered valleys  the early lambs had already found their legs and were running around in a gang in that strange jerky run that lambs have  which makes them look like wooly rocking horses .   perhaps there was something about that day  because the old ewes joined in  too  and skipped with their lambs .  they jumped and spun  half happy  half embarrassed  big winter fleeces bouncing up and down like a clown   s trousers .   it had been an interesting winter .  she   d learned a lot of things .  one of them was that you could be a bridesmaid to two people who between them were over     years old .  this time mr .  weavall  with his wig spinning on his head and his big spectacles gleaming  had insisted on giving one of the gold pieces to    our little helper     which more than made up for the wages that she hadn   t asked for and miss level couldn   t afford .  she   d used some of it to buy a really good brown cloak .  it didn   t billow  it didn   t fly out behind her  but it was warm and thick and kept her dry .   she   d learned lots of other things too .  as she walked past the sheep and their lambs  she gently touched their minds  so softly that they didn   t notice    .       tiffany had stayed up in the mountains for hogswatch  which officially marked the changing of the year .  there   d been a lot to do there  and anyway it wasn   t much celebrated on the chalk .  miss level had been happy to give her leave now  though  for the lambing festival  which the old people called sheepbellies .  it was when the shepherds    year began .  the hag of the hills couldn   t miss that .  that was when  in warm nests of straw shielded from the wind by hurdles and barriers of cut furze  the future happened .  she   d helped it happen  working with the shepherds by lantern light  dealing with the difficult births .  she   d worked with the pointy hat on her head and had felt the shepherds watching her as  with knife and needle and thread and hands and soothing words  she   d saved ewes from the black doorway and helped new lambs into the light .  you had to give them a show .  you had to give them a story .  and she   d walked back home proudly in the morning  bloody to the elbows  but it had been the blood of life .   later she had gone up to the feegles    mound and slid down the hole .  she   d thought about this for some time and had gone prepared   with clean torn up handkerchiefs and some soapwort shampoo made from a recipe miss level had given her .  she had a feeling that jeannie would have a use for these .  miss level always visited new mothers .  it was what you did .   jeannie had been pleased to see her .  lying on her stomach so that she could get part of her body into the kelda   s chamber  tiffany had been allowed to hold all eight of what she kept thinking of as the roblets  born at the same time as the lambs .  seven of them were bawling and fighting one another .  the eighth lay quietly  biding her time .  the future happened .   it wasn   t only jeannie who thought of her differently .  news had got around .  the people of the chalk didn   t like witches .  they had always come from outside .  they had always come as strangers .  but there was our tiffany  birthing the lambs like her granny did  and they say she   s been learning witchery in the mountains .  ah  but that   s still our tiffany  that is .  okay  i   ll grant you that she   s wearing a hat with big stars on it  but she makes good cheese and she knows about lambing and she   s granny aching   s granddaughter  right .  and they   d tap their noses knowingly .  granny aching   s granddaughter .  remember what the old woman could do .  so if witch she be  then she   s our witch .  she knows about sheep  she does .  hah  and i heard they had a big sort of trial for witches up in them mountains and our tiffany showed    em what a girl from the chalk can do .  it   s modern times  right .  we got a witch now  and she   s better   n anyone else   s .  no one   s throwing granny aching   s granddaughter in a pond .   tomorrow she   d go back to the mountains again .  it had been a busy three weeks  quite apart from the lambing .  roland had invited her to tea at the castle .  it had been a bit awkward  as these things are  but it was funny how  in a couple of years  he   d gone from a lumbering oaf to a nervous young man who forgot what he was talking about when she smiled at him .  and they had books in the castle .   he   d shyly presented her with a dictionary of amazingly uncommon words  and she had been prepared enough to bring him a hunting knife made by zakzak stronginthearm  who was excellent at blades even if he was rubbish at magic .  the hat wasn   t mentioned  very carefully .  and when she   d got home  she   d found a bookmark in the p section and a faint pencil underline under the word plongeon     a small curtsy  about one third as deep as the traditional one .  no longer used .     alone in her bedroom  she   d blushed .  it   s always surprising to be reminded that while you   re watching and thinking about people  all knowing and superior  they   re watching and thinking about you  right back at you .   she   d written it down in her diary  which was a lot thicker now  what with all the pressed herbs and extra notes and bookmarks .  it had been trodden on by cows  struck by lightning  and dropped in tea .  and it didn   t have an eye on it .  an eye would have got knocked off on day one .  it was a real witch   s diary .   tiffany had stopped wearing the hat  except in public  because it kept getting bent by low doorways and completely crushed by her bedroom ceiling .  she was wearing it today  though  clutching it occasionally whenever a gust tried to snatch it off her head .   she reached the place where four rusty iron wheels were half buried in the turf and a potbellied stove stood up from the grass .  it made a useful seat .   silence spread out around tiffany  a living silence  while the sheep danced with their lambs and the world turned .   why do you go away .  so that you can come back .  so that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors .  and the people there see you differently  too .  coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving .   the words ran through tiffany   s mind as she watched the sheep  and she found herself filling up with joy   at the new lambs  at life  at everything .  joy is to fun what the deep sea is to a puddle .  it   s a feeling inside that can hardly be contained .      i   ve come back .     she announced to the hills .     better than i went .      she snatched off the hat with stars on it .  it wasn   t a bad hat  for show  although the stars made it look like a toy .  but it was never her hat .  it couldn   t be .  the only hat worth wearing was the one you made for yourself  not one you bought  not one you were given .  your own hat  for your own head .  your own future  not someone else   s .   she hurled the starry hat up as high as she could .  the wind there caught it neatly .  it tumbled for a moment and then was lifted by a gust and  swooping and spinning  sailed away across the downs and vanished forever .   then tiffany made a hat out of the sky and sat on the old potbellied stove  listening to the wind around the horizons while the sun went down .   as the shadows lengthened  many small shapes crept out of the nearby mound and joined her in the sacred place  to watch .   the sun set  which is everyday magic  and warm night came .   the hat filled up with stars    .       author   s note      the doctrine of signatures mentioned on page    really exists in this world  although now it   s better known by historians than doctors .  for hundreds of years  perhaps thousands  people believed that god  who of course had made everything  had    signed    each thing in a way that showed humanity what it could be used for .  for example  goldenrod is yellow and so    must    be good for jaundice  which turns the skin yellow .   a certain amount of guesswork was involved  but sometimes patients survived .    by an amazing coincidence  the horse carved on the chalk is remarkably similar to the uffington white horse  which in this world is carved on the downlands near the village of uffington in southwest oxfordshire .  it   s     feet long  several thousand years old  and carved on the hill in such a way that you can only see all of it in one go from the air .  this suggests that a  it was carved for the gods to see or b  flying was invented a lot earlier that we thought or c  people used to be much  much taller .   oh  and this world had witch trials  too .  they were not fun .       about the author      terry pratchett   s novels have sold more than thirty five million copies and have inspired a devoted worldwide following .  in

things to be correct .  if you want to upset a witch  you don   t have to mess around with charms and spells   you just have to put her in a room with a picture that   s hung slightly crooked and watch her squirm .         first thoughts are the everyday thoughts .  everyone has those .  second thoughts are the thoughts you think about the way you think .  people who enjoy thinking have those .  third thoughts are thoughts that watch the world and think all by themselves .  they   re rare  and often troublesome .  listening to them is part of witchcraft .         knowing the dictionary all the way through does have some uses .         tiffany knew what psychology was  but it hadn   t been a pronunciation dictionary .        one hundred and one things a wizard can do        the monster book of monsters       the hermit elephant of howondaland has a very thin hide  except on its head  and young ones will often move into a small mud hut while the owners are out .  it is far too shy to harm anyone  but most people quit their huts pretty soon after an elephant moves in .  for one thing  it lifts the hut off the ground and carries it away on its back across the veldt  settling it down over any patch of nice grass that it finds .  this makes housework very unpredictable .  nevertheless  an entire village of hermit elephants moving across the plains is one of the finest sights on the continent .        if anyone knew what this meant  they   d know a lot more about the nacmac feegle   s way of traveling .
