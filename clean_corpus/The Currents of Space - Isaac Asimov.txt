the  currents  of  space    isaac asimov     copyright         by isaac asimov      to david  who took his time coming  but was worth waiting for      prolog  a year before    the man from earth came to a decision .  it had been slow in coming and developing  but it was here .   it had been weeks since he had felt the comforting deck of his ship and the cool  dark blanket of space about it .  originally  he had intended a quick report to the local office of the interstellar spatio analytic bureau and a quicker retreat to space .  instead  he had been held here .   it was almost like a prison .   he drained his tea and looked at the man across the table .  he said     i   m not staying any longer .        the other man came to a decision .  it had been slow in coming and developing  but it was here .  he would need time  much more time .  the response to the first letters had been nil .  they might have fallen into a star for all they had accomplished .   that had been no more than he had expected  or  rather  no less .  but it was only the first move .   it was certain that  while future moves developed  he could not allow the man from earth to squirm out of reach .  he fingered the smooth black rod in his pocket .   he said     you don   t appreciate the delicacy of the problem .        the earthman said     what   s delicate about the destruction of a planet .  i want you to broadcast the details to all of sark  to everyone on the planet .         we can   t do that .  you know it would mean panic .         you said at first you would do it .         i   ve thought it over and it just isn   t practical .      the earthman turned to a second grievance .     the representative of the i . s . b .  hasn   t arrived .         i know it .  they are busy organizing proper procedures for this crisis .  another day or two .         another day or two .  it   s always another day or two .  are they so busy they can   t spare me a moment .  they haven   t even seen my calculations .         i have offered to bring your calculations to them .  you don   t want me to .         and i still don   t .  they can come to me or i can go to them .     he added violently     i don   t think you believe me .  you don   t believe florina will be destroyed .         i believe you .         you don   t .  i know you don   t .  i see you don   t .  you   re humoring me .  you can   t understand my data .  you   re not a spatio analyst .  i don   t even think you   re who you say you are .  who are you .         you   re getting excited .         yes  i am .  is that surprising .  or are you just thinking  poor devil  space has him .  you think i   m crazy .         nonsense .         sure you do .  that   s why i want to see the i . s . b .  they   ll know if i   m crazy or not .  they   ll know .      the other man remembered his decision .  he said     now you   re not feeling well .  i   m going to help you .         no  you   re not     shouted the earthman hysterically     because i   m going to walk out .  if you want to stop me  kill me  except that you won   t dare .  the blood of a whole world of people will be on your hands if you do .      the other man began shouting  too  to make himself heard .     i won   t kill you .  listen to me  i won   t kill you .  there   s no need to kill you .      the earthman said     you   ll tie me up .  you   ll keep me here .  is that what you   re thinking .  and what will you do when the i . s . b .  starts looking for me .  i   m supposed to send in regular reports  you know .         the bureau knows you   re safely with me .         do they .  i wonder if they know i   ve reached the planet at all .  i wonder if they received my original message .     the earthman was giddy .  his limbs felt stiff .   the other man stood up .  it was obvious to him that his decision had come none too soon .  he walked slowly about the long table  toward the earthman .   he said soothingly     it will be for your own good .     he took the black rod from his pocket .   the earthman croaked     that   s a psychic probe .     his words were slurred  and when he tried to rise  his arms and legs barely quivered .   he said  between teeth that were clenching in rigor     drugged .         drugged .     agreed the other man .     now look  i won   t hurt you .  it   s difficult for you to understand the true delicacy of the matter while you   re so excited and anxious about it .  i   ll just remove the anxiety .  only the anxiety .      the earthman could no longer talk .  he could only sit there .  he could only think numbly  great space  i   ve been drugged .  he wanted to shout and scream and run  but he couldn   t .   the other had reached the earthman now .  he stood there  looking down at him .  the earthman looked up .  his eyeballs could still move .   the psychic probe was a self contained unit .  its wires needed only to be fixed to the appropriate places on the skull .  the earthman watched in panic until his eye muscles froze .  he did not feel the fine sting as the sharp  thin leads probed through skin and flesh to make contact with the sutures of his skull bones .   he yelled and yelled in the silence of his mind .  he cried  no  you don   t understand .  it   s a planet full of people .  don   t you see that you can   t take chances with hundreds of millions of living people .   the other man   s words were dim and receding  heard from the other end of a long  windy tunnel .     it won   t hurt you .  in another hour you   ll feel well  really well .  you   ll be laughing at all this with me .      the earthman felt the thin vibration against his skull and then that faded too .   darkness thickened and collapsed about him .  some of it never lifted again .  it took a year for even parts of it to lift .       one  the foundling      rik put down his feeder and jumped to his feet .  he was trembling so hard he had to lean against the bare milk white wall .   he shouted     i remember .      they looked at him and the gritty mumble of men at lunch died somewhat .  eyes met his out of faces indifferently clean and indifferently shaven  glistening and white in the imperfect wall illumination .  the eyes reflected no great interest  merely the reflex attention enforced by any sudden and unexpected cry .   rik cried again     i remember my job .  i had a job .      someone called     shoddop .     and someone else yelled     siddown .      the faces turned away  the mumble rose again .  rik stared blankly along the table .  he heard the remark     crazy rik     and a shrug of shoulders .  he saw a finger spiral at a man   s temple .  it all meant nothing to him .  none of it reached his mind .   slowly he sat down .  again he clutched his feeder  a spoonlike affair  with sharp edges and little tines projecting from the front curve of the bowl  which could therefore with equal clumsiness cut  scoop and impale .  it was enough for a millworker .  he turned it over and stared without seeing at his number on the back of the handle .  he didn   t have to see it .  he knew it by heart .  all the others had registration numbers  just as he had  but the others had names also .  he didn   t .  they called him rik because it meant something like    moron    in the slang of the kyrt mills .  and often enough they called him    crazy rik .      but perhaps he would be remembering more and more now .  this was the first time since he had come to the mill that he had remembered anything at all from before the beginning .  if he thought hard .  if he thought with all his mind .   all at once he wasn   t hungry  he wasn   t the least hungry .  with a sudden gesture  he thrust his feeder into the jellied briquet of meat and vegetables before him  pushed the food away  and buried his eyes in the heels of his palms .  his fingers thrust and clutched at his hair and painstakingly he tried to follow his mind into the pitch from which it had extracted a single item  one muddy  undecipherable item .   then he burst into tears  just as a clanging bell announced the end of his lunch shift .     valona march fell in beside him when he left the mill that evening .  he was scarcely conscious of her at first  at least as an individual .  it was only that he heard his footsteps matched .  he stopped and looked at her .  her hair was something between blonde and brown .  she wore it in two thick plaits that she clamped together with little magnetized green stoned pins .  they were very cheap pins and had a faded look about them .  she wore the simple cotton dress which was all that was needed only an open  sleeveless shirt and cotton slacks .   she said     i heard something went wrong lunchtime .      she spoke in the sharp  peasant accents one would expect .  rik   s own language was full of flat vowels and had a nasal touch .  they laughed at him because of it and imitated his way of speaking  but valona would tell him that that was only their own ignorance .   rik mumbled     nothing   s wrong  lona .      she persisted .     i heard you said you remembered something .  is that right  rik .      she called him rik too .  there wasn   t anything else to call him .  he couldn   t remember his real name .  he had tried desperately enough .  valona had tried with him .  one day she had obtained a torn city directory somehow and had read all the first names to him .  none had seemed more familiar than any other .   he looked her full in the face and said     i   ll have to quit the mill .      valona frowned .  her round  broad face with its flat  high cheekbones was troubled .     i don   t think you can .  it wouldn   t be right .         i   ve got to find out more about myself .      valona licked her lips .     i don   t think you should .      rik turned away .  he knew her concern to be sincere .  she had obtained the mill job for him in the first place .  he had had no experience with mill machinery .  or perhaps he had  but just didn   t remember .  in any case  lona had insisted that he was too small for manual labor and they had agreed to the nightmarish days when he could scarcely make sounds and when he didn   t know what food was for  she had watched him and fed him .  she had kept him alive .   he said     i   ve got to .         is it the headaches again  rik .         no .  i really remember something .  i remember what my job was before  before .      he wasn   t sure he wanted to tell her .  he looked away .  the warm  pleasant sun was at least two hours above the horizon .  the monotonous rows of workers    cubicles that stretched out and round the mills were tiresome to look at  but rik knew that as soon as they topped the rise the field would lie before them in all the beauty of crimson and gold .   he liked to look at the fields .  from the very first the sight had soothed and pleased him .  even before he knew that the colors were crimson and gold  before he knew that there were such things as colors  before he could express his pleasure in anything more than a soft gurgle  the headaches would flicker away faster in the fields .  in those days valona would borrow a diamagnetic scooter and take him out of the village every idle day .  they would skim along  a foot above the road  gliding on the cushioned smoothness of the counter gravity field  until they were miles and miles away from any human habitation and there would be left only the wind against his face  fragrant with the kyrt blossoms .   they would sit beside the road then  surrounded by color and scent  and between them share a food briquet  while the sun glowed down upon them until it was time to return again .   rik was stirred by the memory .  he said     let   s go to the fields  lona .         it   s late .         please .  just outside town .      she fumbled at the thin money pouch she kept between herself and the soft blue leather belt she wore  the only luxury of dress she allowed herself .   rik caught her arm .     let   s walk .        they left the highway for the winding  dustless  packed sand roads half an hour later .  there was a heavy silence between them and valona felt a familiar fear clutching at her .  she had no words to express her feelings for him  so she had never tried .   what if he should leave her .  he was a little fellow  no taller than herself and weighing somewhat less  in fact .  he was still like a helpless child in many ways .  but before they had turned his mind off he must have been an educated man .  a very important educated man .   valona had never had any education besides reading and writing and enough trade school technology to be able to handle mill machinery  but she knew enough to know that all people were not so limited .  there was the townman  of course  whose great knowledge was so helpful to all of them .  occasionally squires came on inspection tours .  she had never seen them close up but once  on a holiday  she had visited the city and seen a group of incredibly gorgeous creatures at a distance .  occasionally the millworkers were allowed to listen to what educated people sounded like .  they spoke differently  more fluently  with longer words and softer tones .  rik talked like that more and more as his memory improved .   she had been frightened at his first words .  they came so suddenly after long whimpering over a headache .  they were pronounced queerly .  when she tried to correct him he wouldn   t change .   even then she had been afraid that he might remember too much and then leave her .  she was only valona march .  they called her big lona .  she had never married .  she never would .  a large  big footed girl with work reddened hands like herself could never marry .  she had never been able to do more than look at the boys with dumb resentment when they ignored her at the idle day dinner festivals .  she was too big to giggle and smirk at them .   she would never have a baby to cuddle and hold .  the other girls did  one after the other  and she could only crowd about for a quick glimpse of something red and hairless with screwed up eyes  fists impotently clenched  gummy mouth       it   s your turn next  lona .         when will you have a baby  lona .      she could only turn away .   but when rik had come  he was like a baby .  he had to be fed and taken care of  brought out into the sun  soothed to sleep when the headaches racked him .   the children would run after her  laughing .  they would yell     lona   s got a boy friend .  big lona   s got a crazy boy friend .  lona   s boy friend is a rik .      later on  when rik could walk by himself  she had been as proud the day he took his first step as though he were really only one year old  instead of more like thirty one  and stepped out  unescorted  into the village streets  they had run about him in rings  yelling their laughter and foolish ridicule in order to see a grown man cover his eyes in fear  and cringe  with nothing but whimpers to answer them .  dozens of times she had come charging out of the house  shouting at them  waving her large fists .   even grown men feared those fists .  she had felled her section head with a single wild blow the first day she had brought rik to work at the mill because of a sniggering indecency concerning them which she overheard .  the mill council fined her a week   s pay for that incident  and might have sent her to the city for further trial at the squire   s court  but for the townman   s intervention and the plea that there had been provocation .   so she wanted to stop rik   s remembering .  she knew she had nothing to offer him  it was selfish of her to want him to stay mind blank and helpless forever .  it was just that no one had ever before depended upon her so utterly .  it was just that she dreaded a return to loneliness .   she said     are you sure you remember  rik .         yes .      they stopped there in the fields  with the sun adding its reddening blaze to all that surrounded them .  the mild  scented evening breeze would soon spring up  and the checkerboard irrigation canals were already beginning to purple .   he said     i can trust my memories as they come back  lona .  you know i can .  you didn   t teach me to speak  for instance .  i remembered the words myself .  didn   t i .  didn   t i .      she said reluctantly     yes .         i even remember the times you took me out into the fields before i could speak .  i keep remembering new things all the time .  yesterday i remembered that once you caught a kyrt fly for me .  you held it closed in your hands and made me put my eye to the space between your thumbs so that i could see it flash purple and orange in the darkness .  i laughed and tried to force my hand between yours to get it  so that it flew away and left me crying after all .  i didn   t know it was a kyrt fly then  or anything about it  but it   s all very clear to me now .  you never told me about that  did you  lona .      she shook her head .      but it did happen  didn   t it .  i remember the truth  don   t i .         yes  rik .         and now i remember something about myself from before .  there must have been a before  lona .      there must have been .  she felt the weight on her heart when she thought that .  it was a different before  nothing like the now they lived in .  it had been on a different world .  she knew that because one word he had never remembered was kyrt .  she had to teach him the word for the most important object on all the world of florina .      what is it you remember .     she asked .   at this  rik   s excitement seemed suddenly to die .  he hung back .     it doesn   t make much sense  lona .  it   s just that i had a job once  and i know what it was .  at least  in a way .         what was it .         i analyzed nothing .      she turned sharply upon him  peering into his eyes .  for a moment she put the flat of her hand upon his forehead  until he moved away irritably .  she said     you don   t have a headache again  rik  have you .  you haven   t had one in weeks .         i   m all right .  don   t you go bothering me .      her eyes fell  and he added at once     i don   t mean that you bother me  lona .  it   s just that i feel fine and i don   t want you to worry .      she brightened .     what does    analyzed    mean .     he knew words she didn   t .  she felt very humble at the thought of how educated he must once have been .   he thought a moment .     it means  it means    to take apart .     you know  like we would take apart a sorter to find out why the scanning beam was out of alignment .         oh .  but  rik  how can anyone have a job not analyzing anything .  that   s not a job .         i didn   t say i didn   t analyze anything .  i said i analyzed nothing .  with a capital n .         isn   t that the same thing .     it was coming  she thought .  she was beginning to sound stupid to him .  soon he would throw her off in disgust .      no  of course not .     he took a deep breath .     i   m afraid i can   t explain though .  that   s all i remember about that .  but it must have been an important job .  that   s the way it feels .  i couldn   t have been a criminal .      valona winced .  she should never have told him that .  she had told herself it was only for his own protection that she warned him  but now she felt that it had really been to keep him bound tighter to herself .     it was when he had first begun to speak .  it was so sudden it had frightened her .  she hadn   t even dared speak to the townman about it .  the next idle day she had withdrawn five credits from her life hoard  there would never be a man to claim it as dowry  so that it didn   t matter  and taken rik to a city doctor .  she had the name and address on a scrap of paper  but even so it took two frightening hours to find her way to the proper building through the huge pillars that held the upper city up to the sun .   she had insisted on watching and the doctor had done all sorts of fearful things with strange instruments .  when he put rik   s head between two metal objects and then made it glow like a kyrt fly in the night  she had jumped to her feet and tried to make him stop .  he called two men who dragged her out  struggling wildly .   half an hour afterward the doctor came out to her  tall and frowning .  she felt uncomfortable with him because he was a squire  even though he kept an office down in the lower city  but his eyes were mild  even kind .  he was wiping his hands on a little towel  which he tossed into a wastecan  even though it looked perfectly clean to her .   he said     where did you meet this man .      she had told him the circumstances cautiously  reducing it to the very barest essentials and leaving out all mention of the townman and the patrollers .      then you know nothing about him .      she shook her head .     nothing before that .      he said     this man has been treated with a psychic probe .  do you know what that is .      at first she had shaken her head again  but then she said in a dry whisper     is it what they do to crazy people  doctor .         and to criminals .  it is done to change their minds for their own good .  it makes their minds healthy  or it changes the parts that make them want to steal and kill .  do you understand .      she did .  she grew brick red and said     rik never stole anything or hurt anybody .         you call him rik .     he seemed amused .     now look here  how do you know what he did before you met him .  it   s hard to tell from the condition of his mind now .  the probing was thorough and brutal .  i can   t say how much of his mind has been permanently removed and how much has been temporarily lost through shock .  what i mean is that some of it will come back  like his speaking  as time goes on  but not all of it .  he should be kept under observation .         no  no .  he   s got to stay with me .  i   ve been taking good care of him  doctor .      he frowned  and then his voice grew milder .     well  i   m thinking of you  my girl .  not all the bad may be out of his mind .  you wouldn   t want him to hurt you someday .      at that moment a nurse led out rik .  she was making little sounds to quiet him  as one would an infant .  rik put a hand to his head and stared vacantly  until his eyes focused on valona  then he held out his hands and cried  feebly     lona       she sprang to him and put his head on her shoulder  holding him tightly .  she said to the doctor     he wouldn   t hurt me  no matter what .      the doctor said thoughtfully     his case will have to be reported  of course .  i don   t know how he escaped from the authorities in the condition he must have been in .         does that mean they   ll take him away  doctor .         i   m afraid so .         please  doctor  don   t do that .     she wrenched at the handkerchief  in which were the five gleaming pieces of credit alloy .  she said     you can have it all  doctor .  i   ll take good care of him .  he won   t hurt anyone .      the doctor looked at the pieces in his hand .     you   re a mill worker  aren   t you .      she nodded .      how much do they pay you a week .         two point eight credits .      he tossed the coins gently  brought them together in his closed palm with a tinkle of metal  then held them out to her .     take it  girl .  there   s no charge .      she accepted them with wonder .     you   re not going to tell anyone  doctor .      but he said     i   m afraid i have to .  it   s the law .      she had driven blindly  heavily  back to the village  clutching rik to her desperately .   the next week on the hypervideo newscast there had been the news of a doctor dying in a gyro crash during a short failure in one of the local transit power beams .  the name was familiar and in her room that night she compared it with that on the scrap of paper .  it was the same .   she was sad  because he had been a good man .  she had received his name once long before from another worker as a squire doctor who was good to the mill hands and had saved it for emergencies .  and when the emergency had come he had been good to her too .  yet her joy drowned the sorrow .  he had not had the time to report rik .  at least  no one ever came to the village to inquire .   later  when rik   s understanding had grown  she had told him what the doctor had said so that he would stay in the village and be safe .     rik was shaking her and she left her reveries .   he said     don   t you hear me .  i couldn   t be a criminal if i had an important job .         couldn   t you have done wrong .     she began hesitantly .     even if you were a big man  you might have .  even squires          i   m sure i haven   t .  but don   t you see that i   ve got to find out so that others can be sure .  there   s no other way .  i   ve got to leave the mill and village and find out more about myself .      she felt the panic rise .     rik .  that would he dangerous .  why should you .  even if you analyzed nothing  why is it so important to find out more about it .         because of the other thing i remember .         what other thing .      he whispered     i don   t want to tell you .         you ought to tell somebody .  you might forget again .      he seized her arm .     that   s right .  you won   t tell anyone else  will you  lona .  you   ll just be my spare memory in case i forget .         sure  rik .      rik looked about him .  the world was very beautiful .  valona had once told him that there was a huge shining sign in the upper city  miles above it even  that said     of all the planets in the galaxy  florina is the most beautiful .      and as he looked about him he could believe it .   he said     it is a terrible thing to remember  but i always remember correctly  when i do remember .  it came this afternoon .         yes .      he was staring at her in horror .     everybody in the world is going to die .  everybody on florina .          two  the townman      myrln terens was in the act of removing a book film from its place on the shelf when the door signal sounded .  the rather pudgy outlines of his face had been set in lines of thought  but now these vanished and changed into the more usual expression of bland caution .  he brushed one hand over his thinning  ruddy hair and shouted     one minute .      he replaced the film and pressed the contact that allowed the covering section to spring back into place and become indistinguishable from the rest of the wall .  to the simple millworkers and farm hands he dealt with  it was a matter of vague pride that one of their own number  by birth at any rate  should own films .  it lightened  by tenuous reflection  the unrelieved dusk of their own minds .  and yet it would not do to display the films openly .   the sight of them would have spoiled things .  it would have frozen their none too articulate tongues .  they might boast of their townman   s books  but the actual presence of them before their eyes would have made terens seem too much the squire .   there were  of course  the squires as well .  it was unlikely in the extreme that any of them would visit him socially at his house  but should one of them enter  a row of films in sight would be injudicious .  he was a townman and custom gave him certain privileges but it would never do to flaunt them .   he shouted again     i   m coming .      this time he stepped to the door  closing the upper seam of his tunic as he went .  even his clothing was somewhat squirelike .  sometimes he almost forgot he had been born on florina .   valona march was on the doorstep .  she bent her knees and ducked her head in respectful greeting .   terens threw the door wide .     come in  valona .  sit down .  surely it   s past curfew .  i hope the patrollers didn   t see you .         i don   t think so  townman .         well  let   s hope that   s so .  you   ve got a bad record  you know .         yes  townman .  i am very grateful for what you have done for me in the past .         never mind .  here  sit down .  would you like something to eat or drink .      she seated herself  straight backed  at the edge of a chair and shook her head .     no  thank you  townman .  i have eaten .      it was good form among the villagers to offer refreshment .  it was bad form to accept .  terens knew that .  he didn   t press her .   he said     now what   s the trouble  valona .  rik again .      valona nodded  but seemed at a loss for further explanation .  terens said     is he in trouble at the mill .         no  townman .         headaches again .         no  townman .      terens waited  his light eyes narrowing and growing sharp .     well  valona  you don   t expect me to guess your trouble  do you .  come  speak out or i can   t help you .  you do want help  i suppose .      she said     yes  townman     then burst out     how shall i tell you  townman .  it sounds almost crazy .      terens had an impulse to pat her shoulder  but he knew she would shrink from the touch .  she sat  as usual  with her large hands buried as far as might be in her dress .  he noticed that her blunt  strong fingers were intertwined and slowly twisting .   he said     whatever it is  i will listen .         do you remember  townman  when i came to tell you about the city doctor and what he said .         yes  i do  valona .  and i remember i told you particularly that you were never to do anything like that again without consulting me .  do you remember that .      she opened her eyes wide .  she needed no spur to recollect his anger .     i would never do such a thing again  townman .  it   s just that i want to remind you that you said you would do everything to help me keep rik .         and so i will .  well  then  have the patrollers been asking about him .         no .  oh  townman  do you think they might .         i   m sure they won   t .     he was losing patience .     now  come  valona  tell me what is wrong .      her eyes clouded .     townman  he says he will leave me .  i want you to stop him .         why does he want to leave you .         he says he is remembering things .      interest leaped into terens    face .  he leaned forward and almost he reached out to grip her hand .     remembering things .  what things .        terens remembered the day rik had first been found .  he had seen the youngsters clustered near one of the irrigation ditches just outside the village .  they had raised their shrill voices to call him .      townman .  townman .      he had broken into a run .     what   s the matter  rasie .     he had made it his business to learn the youngsters    names when he came to town .  that went well with the mothers and made the first month or two easier .   rasie was looking sick .  he said     looky here  townman .      he was pointing at something white and squirming  and it was rik .  the other boys were yelling at once in confused explanation .  terens managed to understand that they were playing some game that involved running  hiding and pursuing .  they were intent on telling him the name of the game  its progress  the point at which they had been interrupted  with a slight subsidiary argument as to exactly which individual or side was    winning .     all that didn   t matter  of course .   rasie  the twelve year old black haired one  had heard the whimpering and had approached cautiously .  he had expected an animal  perhaps a field rat that would make good chasing .  he had found rik .   all the boys were caught between an obvious sickness and an equally obvious fascination at the strange sight .  it was a grown human being  nearly naked  chin wet with drool  whimpering and crying feebly  arms and legs moving about aimlessly .  faded blue eyes shifted in random fashion out of a face that was covered with a grown stubble .  for a moment the eyes caught those of terens and seemed to focus .  slowly the man   s thumb came up and inserted itself into his mouth .   one of the children laughed .     looka him  townman .  he   s finger sucking .      the sudden shout jarred the prone figure .  his face reddened and screwed up .  a weak whining  unaccompanied by tears  sounded but his thumb remained where it was .  it showed wet and pink in contrast to the rest of the dirt smeared hand .   terens broke his own numbness at the sight .  he said     all right  look  fellows  you shouldn   t be running around here in the kyrt field .  you   re damaging the crop and you know what that will mean if the farm hands catch you .  get going  and keep quiet about this .  and listen  rasie  you run to mr .  jencus and get him to come here .      ull jencus was the nearest thing to a doctor the town had .  he had passed some time as apprentice in the offices of a real doctor in the city and on the strength of it he had been relieved of duty on the farms or in the mills .  it didn   t work out too badly .  he could take temperatures  administer pills  give injections and  most important  he could tell when some disorder was sufficiently serious to warrant a trip to the city hospital .  without such semiprofessional backing  those unfortunates stricken with spinal meningitis or acute appendicitis might suffer intensively but usually not for long .  as it was  the foremen muttered and accused jencus in everything but words of being an accessory after the fact to a conspiracy of malingering .   jencus helped terens lift the man into a scooter cart and  as unobtrusively as they might  carried him into town .   together they washed off the accumulated and hardened grime and filth .  there was nothing to be done about the hair .  jencus shaved the entire body and did what he could by way of physical examination .   jencus said     no infection i c   n tell of  townman .  he   s been fed .  ribs don   t stick out too much .  i don   t know what to make of it .  how   d he get out there  d   you suppose  townman .      he asked the question with a pessimistic tone as though no one could expect terens to have the answer to anything .  terens accepted that philosophically .  when a village has lost the townman it has grown accustomed to over a period of nearly fifty years  a newcomer of tender age must expect a transition period of suspicion and distrust .  there was nothing personal in it .   terens said     i   m afraid i don   t know .         can   t walk  y   know .  can   t walk a step .  he   d have to be put there .  near   s i c   n make out  he might   s well be a baby .  everything else seems t   be gone .         is there a disease that has this effect .         not   s i know of .  mind trouble might do it  but i don   t know nothing    tall about that .  mind trouble i   d send to the city .  y   ever see this one  townman .      terens smiled and said gently     i   ve just been here a month .      jencus sighed and reached for his handkerchief .     yes .  old townman  he was a fine man .  kept us well  he did .  i been here    most sixty years  and never saw this fella before .  must be from    nother town .      jencus was a plump man .  he had the look of having been born plump  and if to this natural tendency is added the effect of a largely sedentary life  it is not surprising that he tended to punctuate even short speeches by a puff and a rather futile swipe at his gleaming forehead with his large red handkerchief .   he said     don   t    xactly know what t   say t   the patrollers .      the patrollers came all right .  it was impossible to avoid that .  the boys told their parents  their parents told one another .  town life was quiet enough .  even this would be unusual enough to be worth the telling in every possible combination of informer and informee .  and in all the telling  the patrollers could not help but hear .   the patrollers  so called  were members of the florinian patrol .  they were not natives of florina and  on the other hand  they were not countrymen of the squires from the planet sark .  they were simply mercenaries who could be counted on to keep order for the sake of the pay they got and never to be led into the misguidance of sympathy for florinians through any ties of blood or birth .   there were two of them and one of the foremen from the mill came with them  in the fullness of his own midget authority .   the patrollers were bored and indifferent .  a mindless idiot might be part of the day   s work but it was scarcely an exciting part .  one said to the foreman     well  how long does it take you to make an identification .  who is this man .      the foreman shook his head energetically .     i never saw him  officer .  he   s no one around here .      the patroller turned to jencus .     any papers on him .         no  sir .  he just had a rag    bout him .  burned it t   prevent infection .         what   s wrong with him .         no mind  near   s i c   n make out .      at this point terens took the patrollers aside .  because they were bored they were amenable .  the patroller who had been asking the questions put up his notebook and said     all right  it isn   t even worth making a record of .  it has nothing to do with us .  get rid of it somehow .      then they left .   the foreman remained .  he was a freckled man  red of hair  with a large and bristly mustache .  he had been a foreman of rigid principles for five years and that meant his responsibility for the fulfillment of quota in his mill rested heavily upon him .      look here     he said fiercely .     what   s to be done about this .  the damn folk are so busy talking  they ain   t working .       send him t   city hospital  near   s i c   n make out     said jencus  wielding his handkerchief industriously .     noth   n    i c   n do .         to the city .     the foreman was aghast .     who   s going to pay .  who   ll stand the fees .  he ain   t none of us  is he .         not   s far   s i know     admitted jencus .      then why should we pay .  find out who he belongs to .  let his town pay .         how we going t   find out .  tell me that .      the foreman considered .  his tongue licked out and played with the coarse reddish foliage of his upper lip .  he said     then we   ll just have to get rid of him .  like the patroller said .      terens interrupted .     look here .  what do you mean by that .      the foreman said     he might as well be dead .  it would be a mercy .      terens said     you can   t kill a living person .         suppose you tell me what to do then .         can   t one of the townpeople take care of him .         who   d want to .  would you .      terens ignored the openly insolent attitude .     i   ve got other work to do .         so have all the folk .  i can   t have anyone neglecting mill work to take care of this crazy thing .      terens sighed  and said without rancor     now  foreman  let   s be reasonable .  if you don   t make quota this quarter i might suppose it   s because one of your workers is taking care of this poor fellow  and i   ll speak up for you to the squires .  otherwise i   ll just say that i don   t know of any reason you couldn   t make quota  in case you don   t make it .      the foreman glowered .  the townman had only been here a month  and already he was interfering with men who had lived in town all their lives .  still  he had a card marked with squire   s marks .  it wouldn   t do to stand too openly against him too long .   he said     but who   d take him .     a horrible suspicion smote him .     i can   t .  i got three kids of my own and my wife ain   t well .         i didn   t suggest that you should .      terens looked out the window .  now that the patrollers had left  the squirming  whispering crowd had gathered closer about the townman   s house .  most were youngsters  too young to be working  others were farm hands from the nearer farms .  a few were millworkers  away from their shifts .   terens saw the big girl at the very edge of the crowd .  he had noticed her often in the past month .  strong  competent  and hard working .  good natural intelligence hidden under that unhappy expression .  if she were a man she might have been chosen for townman   s training .  but she was a woman  parents dead  and plain enough she was to preclude romantic side interests .  a lone woman  in other words  and likely to remain so .   he said     what about her .      the foreman looked  then roared     damn it .  she ought to be at work .         all right     soothed terens .     what   s her name .         that   s valona march .         that   s right .  i remember now .  call her in .      from that moment terens had made himself an unofficial guardian of the pair .  he had done what he could to obtain additional food rations for her  extra clothing coupons and whatever else was required to allow two adults  one unregistered  to live on the income of one .  he had been instrumental in helping her obtain training for rik at the kyrt mills .  he had intervened to prevent greater punishment on the occasion of valona   s quarrel with a section head .  the death of the city doctor had made it unnecessary for him to attempt further action there than he had taken  but he had been ready .   it was natural for valona to come to him in all her troubles  and he was waiting now for her to answer his question .     valona was still hesitating .  finally she said     he says everyone in the world will die .      terens looked startled .     does he say how .         he says he doesn   t know how .  he just says he remembers that from before he was like  you know  like he is .  and he says he remembers he had an important job  but i don   t understand what it is .         how does he describe it .         he says he an  analyzes nothing with a capital n .      valona waited for comment  then hastened to explain     analyze means taking something apart like          i know what it means  girl .     terens remained lost .   valona watched him anxiously .     do you know what he means  townman .         perhaps  valona .         but  townman  how can anyone do anything to nothing .      terens got to his feet .  he smiled briefly .     why  valona  don   t you know that everything in all the galaxy is mostly nothing .     no light of understanding dawned on valona  but she accepted that .  the townman was a very educated man .  with an unexpected twinge of pride  she was suddenly certain that her rik was even more educated .      come .     terens was holding his hand out to her .   she said     where are we going .         well  where   s rik .         home     she said .     sleeping .         good .  i   ll take you there .  do you want the patrollers to find you on the street alone .          the village seemed empty of life in the nighttime .  the lights along the single street that split the area of workers    cabins in two gleamed without glare .  there was a hint of rain in the air  but only of that light warm rain that fell almost every night .  there was no need to take special precautions against it .   valona had never been out so late on a working evening and it was frightening .  she tried to shrink away from the sound of her own footsteps  while listening for the possible distant step of the patrollers .   terens said     stop trying to tiptoe  valona .  i m with you .      his voice boomed in the quiet and valona jumped .  she hurried forward in response to his urging .     valona   s hut was as dark as the rest and they stepped in gingerly .  terens had been born and brought up in just such a hut and though he had since lived on sark and now occupied a house with three rooms and plumbing  there was still something of a nostalgia about the barrenness of its interior .  one room was all that was required  a bed  a chest of drawers  two chairs  a smooth poured cement floor  a closet in one corner .   there was no need for kitchen facilities  since all meals were eaten at the mill  nor for a bathroom  since a line of community outhouses and shower cells ran along the space behind the houses .  in the mild  unvarying climate  windows were not adapted for protection against cold and rain .  all four walls were pierced by screened openings and eaves above were sufficient ward against the nightly windless sprinkles .   in the flare of a little pocket light which he held cupped in one palm terens noted that one corner of the room was marked off by a battered screen .  he remembered getting it for valona rather recently when rik had become too little of a child or too much of a man .  he could hear the regular breathing of sleep behind it .   he nodded his head in that direction .     wake him  valona .      valona tapped on the screen .     rik .  rik  baby .      there was a little cry .      it   s only lona     said valona .  they rounded the screen and terens played his little light upon their own faces  then upon rik .   rik threw an arm up against the glare .     what   s the matter .      terens sat down on the edge of the bed .  rik slept in the standard cottage bed  he noted .  he had obtained for valona an old  rather rickety cot at the very first  but she had reserved that for herself .      rik     he said     valona says you   re beginning to remember things .         yes  townman .     rik was always very humble before the townman  who was the most important man he had ever seen .  even the mill superintendent was polite to the townman .  rik repeated the scraps his mind had gathered during the day .   terens said     have you remembered anything else since you told this to valona .         nothing else  townman .      terens kneaded the fingers of one hand with those of the other .     all right  rik .  go back to sleep .      valona followed him out of the house .  she was trying hard to keep her face from twisting and the back of one rough hand slid across her eyes .     will he have to leave me  townman .      terens took her hands and said gravely     you must be a grown woman  valona .  he will have to come with me for just a short while but i   ll bring him back .         and after that .         i don   t know .  you must understand  valona .  right now it is the most important thing in all the world that we find out more about rik   s memories .      valona said suddenly     you mean everybody on florina might die  the way he says .      terens    grip tightened .     don   t ever say that to anyone  valona  or the patrollers may take rik away forever .  i mean that .      he turned away and walked slowly and thoughtfully back to his house without really noticing that his hands were trembling .  he tried futilely to sleep and after an hour of that he adjusted the narco field .  it was one of the few pieces of sark he had brought with him when he first returned to florina to become townman .  it fitted about his skull like a thin black felt cap .  he adjusted the controls to five hours and closed contact .   he had time to adjust himself comfortably in bed before the delayed response shorted the conscious centers of his cerebrum and blanketed him into instantaneous  dreamless sleep .       three  the librarian      they left the diamagnetic scooter in a scooter cubby outside the city limits .  scooters were rare in the city and terens had no wish to attract unnecessary attention .  he thought for a savage moment of those of the upper city with their diamagnetic ground cars and anti gray gyros .  but that was the upper city .  it was different .   rik waited for terens to lock the cubby and fingerprint seal it .  he was dressed in a new one piece suit and felt a little uncomfortable .  somewhat reluctantly he followed the townman under the first of the tall bridgelike structures that supported the upper city .   on florina  all other cities had names  but this one was simply the    city .     the workers and peasants who lived in it and around it were considered lucky by the rest of the planet .  in the city there were better doctors and hospitals  more factories and more liquor stores  even a few dribbles of very mild luxury .  the inhabitants themselves were somewhat less enthusiastic .  they lived in the shadow of the upper city .   the upper city was exactly what the name implied  for the city was double  divided rigidly by a horizontal layer of fifty square miles of cementalloy resting upon some twenty thousand steel girdered pillars .  below in the shadow were the    natives .     above  in the sun  were the squires .  it was difficult to believe in the upper city that the planet of its location was florina .  the population was almost exclusively sarkite in nature  together with a sprinkling of patrollers .  they were the upper class in all literalness .   terens knew his way .  he walked quickly  avoiding the stares of passers by  who surveyed his townman clothing with a mixture of envy and resentment .  rik   s shorter legs made his gait less dignified as he tried to keep up .  he did not remember very much from his only other visit to the city .  it seemed so different now .  then it had been cloudy .  now the sun was out  pouring through the spaced openings in the cementalloy above to form strips of light that made the intervening space all the darker .  they plunged through the bright strips in a rhythmic  almost hypnotic fashion .   oldsters sat on wheeled chairs in the strips  absorbing the warmth and moving as the strip moved .  sometimes they fell asleep and would remain behind in the shade  nodding in their chairs until the squeaking of the wheels when they shifted position woke them .  occasionally mothers nearly blocked the strips with their carriageci offspring .   terens said     now  rik  stand up straight .  we   re going up .      he was standing before a structure that filled the space between four square placed pillars  and from ground to upper city .   rik said     i   m scared .      rik could guess what the structure was .  it was an elevator that lifted to the upper level .   these were necessary  of course .  production was below  but consumption was above .  basic chemicals and raw food staples were shipped into lower city  but finished plastic ware and fine meals were matters for upper city .  excess population spawned below  maids  gardeners  chauffeurs  construction laborers were used above .   terens ignored rik   s expression of fright .  he was amazed that his own heart beat so violently .  not fright  of course .  rather a fierce satisfaction that he was going up .  he would step all over that sacred cementalloy  stamp on it  scuff his dirt upon it .  he could do that as a townman .  of course he was still only a florinian native to the squires  but he was a townman and he could step on the cementalloy whenever he pleased .   galaxy  he hated them .   he stopped himself  drew a firm breath and signaled for the elevator .  there was no use thinking hate .  he had been on sark for many years  on sark itself  the center and breeding place of the squires .  he had learned to bear in silence .  he ought not forget what he had learned now .  of all times  not now .   he heard the whir of the elevator settling at the lower level  and the entire wall facing him dropped into its slot .   the native who operated the elevator looked disgusted .     just two of you .         just two     said terens  stepping in .  rik followed .   the operator made no move to restore the fallen wall to its original position .  he said     seems to me you guys could wait for the two o   clock load and move with it .  i ain   t supposed to run this thing up and down for no two guys .     he spat carefully  making sure that the sputum hit lower level concrete and not the floor of his elevator .   he went on     where   s your employment tickets .      terens said     i   m a townman .  can   t you see it by my clothes .         clothes don   t mean nothing .  listen  you think i   m risking my job because you maybe picked up some uniform somewheres .  where   s your card .      terens  without another word  presented the standard document folder all natives had to carry at all times  registration number  employment certificate  tax receipts .  it was open to the crimson of his townman   s license .  the operator scanned it briefly .      well  maybe you picked that up  too  but that   s not my business .  you got it and i pass you  though townman   s just a fancy name for a native to my way of figgering .  what about the other guy .         he   s in my charge     said terens .     he can come with me  or shall we call a patroller and check into the rules .      it was the last thing terens wanted but he suggested it with suitable arrogance .      awrright .  y   don   t have to get sore .     the elevator wall moved up  and with a lurch the elevator climbed .  the operator mumbled direfully under his breath .   terens smiled tightly .  it was almost inevitable .  those who worked directly for the squires were only too glad to identify themselves with the rulers and make up for their real inferiority by a tighter adherence to the rules of segregation  a harsh and haughty attitude toward their fellows .  they were the    uppermen    for whom the other florinians reserved their particular hate  unalloyed by the carefully taught awe they felt for the squires .   the vertical distance traveled was thirty feet  but the door opened again to a new world .  like the native cities of sark  upper city was laid out with a particular eye to color .  individual structures  whether dwelling places or public buildings  were inset in an intricate multicolored mosaic which  close at hand  was a meaningless jumble  but at a distance of a hundred yards took on a soft clustering of hues that melted and changed with the angle of view .      come on  rik     said terens .   rik was staring wide eyed .  nothing alive and growing .  just stone and color in huge masses .  he had never known houses could be so huge .  something stirred momentarily in his mind .  for a second the hugeness was not so strange .   .   .  and then the memory closed down again .   a ground car flashed by .      are those squires .     rik whispered .   there had been time for only a glance .  hair close cropped  wide  flaring sleeves of glossy  solid colors ranging from blue to violet  knickers of a velvety appearance and long  sheer hose that gleamed as if it were woven of thin copper wire .  they wasted no glance at rik and terens .      young ones     said terens .  he had not seen them at such close quarters since he left sark .  on sark they were bad enough but at least they had been in place .  angels did not fit here  thirty feet over hell .  again he squirmed to suppress a useless tremble of hatred .   a two man flatcar hissed up behind them .  it was a new model that had built in air controls .  at the moment it was skimming smoothly two inches above surface  its gleaming flat bottom curled upward at all edges to cut air resistance .  still  the slicing of air against its lower surface sufficed to produce the characteristic hiss which meant    patrollers .      they were large  as all patrollers were  broad faced  flatcheeked  long  straight black hair  light brown in complexion .  to the natives  all patrollers looked alike .  the glossy black of their uniforms  enhanced as they were by the startling silver of strategically placed buckles and ornamental buttons  depressed the importance of the face and encouraged the impression of likeness still more .   one patroller was at the controls .  the other leaped out lightly over the shallow rim of the car .   he said     folder .     stared mechanically and momentarily at it and flipped it back at terens .     your business here .         i intend consulting the library  officer .  it is my privilege .     the patroller turned to rik .     what about you .         i      began rik .      he is my assistant     interposed terens .      he has no townman privileges     said the patroller .      i   ll be responsible for him .      the patroller shrugged .     it   s your lookout .  townmen have privileges  but they   re not squires .  remember that  boy .         yes  officer .  by the way  could you direct me to the library .      the patroller directed him  using the thin  deadly barrel of a needle gun to indicate direction .  from their present angle  the library was a blotch of brilliant vermilion deepening into crimson toward the upper stories .  as they approached  the crimson crept downward .   rik said with sudden vehemence     i think it   s ugly .      terens gave him a quick  surprised glance .  he had been accustomed to all this on sark  but he  too  found the garishness of upper city somewhat vulgar .  but then  upper city was more sark than sark itself .  on sark  not all men were aristocrats .  there were even poor sarkites  some scarcely better off than the average florinian .  here only the top of the pyramid existed  and the library showed that .   it was larger than all but a few on sark itself  far larger than upper city required  which showed the advantage of cheap labor .  terens paused on the curved ramp that led to the main entrance .  the color scheme on the ramp gave the illusion of steps  somewhat disconcerting to rik  who stumbled  but giving the library the proper air of archaism that traditionally accompanied academic structures .   the main hall was large  cold  and all but empty .  the librarian behind the single desk it contained looked like a small  somewhat wrinkled pea in a bloated pod .  she looked up and half rose .   terens said quickly     i   m a townman .  special privileges .  i am responsible for this native .     he had his papers ready and marched them before him .   the librarian seated herself and looked stern .  she plucked a metal sliver from a slot and thrust it at terens .  the townman placed his right thumb firmly upon it .  the librarian took the sliver and put it in another slot where a dim violet light shone briefly .   she said     room     .         thank you .        the cubicles on the second floor had that icy lack of personality that any link in an endless chain would have .  some were filled  their glassite doors frosted and opaque .  most were not .      two forty two     said rik .  his voice was squeaky .      what   s the matter  rik .         i don   t know .  i feel very excited .         ever been in a library before .         i don   t know .      terens put his thumb on the round aluminum disk which  five minutes before  had been sensitized to his thumbprint .  the clear glass door swung open and  as they stepped within  it closed silently and  as though a blind had been drawn  became opaque .   the room was six feet in each direction  without window or adornment .  it was lit by the diffuse ceiling glow and ventilated by a forced air draft .  the only contents were a desk that stretched from wall to wall and an upholstered backless bench between it and the door .  on the desk were three    readers .     their frosted glass fronts slanted backward at an angle of thirty degrees .  before each were the various control dials .      do you know what this is .     terens sat down and placed his soft  plump hand upon one of the readers .   rik sat down too .      books .     he asked eagerly .      well .     terens seemed uncertain .     this is a library  so your guess doesn   t mean much .  do you know how to work the reader .         no .  i don   t think so  townman .         you   re sure .  think about it a little .      rik tried valiantly .     i   m sorry  townman .         then i   ll show you .  look .  first  you see  there   s this knob  labeled    catalog    with the alphabet printed about it .  since we want the encyclopedia first  we   ll turn the knob to e and press downward .      he did so and several things happened at once .  the frosted glass flared into life and printing appeared upon it .  it stood out black on yellow as the ceiling light dimmed .  three smooth panels moved out like so many tongues  one before each reader  and each was centered by a tight light beam .   terens snapped a toggle switch and the panels moved back into their recesses .   he said     we won   t be taking notes .      then he went on     now we can go down the list of e   s by turning this knob .      the long line of alphabetized materials  titles  authors  catalog numbers flipped upward  then stopped at the packed column listing the numerous volumes of the encyclopedia .   rik said suddenly     you press the numbers and letters after the book you want on these little buttons and it shows on the screen .      terens turned on him .     how do you know .  do you remember that .         maybe i do .  i   m not sure .  it just seems the right thing .         well  call it an intelligent guess .      he punched a letter number combination .  the light on the glass faded  then brightened again .  it said     encyclopedia of sark  volume     sol spec .      terens said     now look  rik  i don   t want to put any ideas in your head  so i won   t tell you what   s in my mind .  i just want you to look through this volume and stop at anything that seems familiar .  do you understand .         yes .         good .  now take your time .      the minutes passed .  suddenly rik gasped and sent the dials spinning backward .   when he stopped  terens read the heading and looked pleased .     you remember now .  this isn   t a guess .  you remember .      rik nodded vigorously .     it came to me  townman .  very suddenly .      it was the article on spatio analysis .      i know what it says     rik said .     you   ll see  you   ll see .     he was having difficulty breathing normally and terens  for his part  was almost equally excited .      see     said rik     they always have this part .      he read aloud haltingly  but in a manner far more proficient than could be accounted for by the sketchy lessons in reading he had received from valona .  the article said      it is not surprising that the spatio analyst is by temperament an introverted and  often enough  maladjusted individual .  to devote the greater part of one   s adult life to the lonely recording of the terrible emptiness between the stars is more than can be asked of someone entirely normal .  it is perhaps with some realization of this that the spatio analytic institute has adopted as its official slogan the somewhat wry statement     we analyze nothing .         rik finished with what was almost a shriek .   terens said     do you understand what you   ve read .      the smaller man looked up with blazing eyes .     it said     we analyze nothing .     that   s what i remembered .  i was one of them .         you were a spatio analyst .         yes     cried rik .  then  in a lower voice     my head hurts .         because you   re remembering .         i suppose so .     he looked up  forehead furrowed .     i   ve got to remember more .  there   s danger .  tremendous danger .  i don   t know what to do .         the library   s at our disposal  rik .     terens was watching carefully  weighing his words .     use the catalog yourself and look up some texts on spatio analysis .  see where that leads you .      rik flung himself upon the reader .  he was shaking visibly .  terens moved aside to give him room .      how about wrijt   s treatise of spatio analytic instrumentation .     asked rik .     doesn   t that sound right .         it   s all up to you  rik .      rik punched the catalog number and the screen burned brightly and steadily .  it said     please consult librarian for book in question .      terens reached out a quick hand and neutralized the screen .     better try another book  rik .         but  .   .   .     rik hesitated  then followed orders .  another search through the catalog and then he chose enning   s composition of space .   the screen filled itself once more with a request to consult the librarian .  terens said     damn .     and deadened the screen again .   rik said     what   s the matter .      terens said     nothing .  nothing .  now don   t get panicky  rik .  i just don   t quite see       there was a little speaker behind the grillwork on the side of the reading mechanism .  the librarian   s thin  dry voice emerged therefrom and froze them both .      room     .  is there anyone in room     .      terens answered harshly     what do you want .      the voice said     what book is it you want .         none at all .  thank you .  we are only testing the reader .      there was a pause as though some invisible consultation was proceeding .  then the voice said with an even sharper edge to it     the record indicates a reading request for wrijt   s treatise of spatio analytical instrumentation  and enning   s composition of space .  is that correct .         we were punching catalog numbers at random     said terens .      may i ask your reason for desiring those books .     the voice was inexorable .      i tell you we don   t want them .   .   .   .  now stop it .     the last was an angry aside to rik  who had begun whimpering .   a pause again .  then the voice said     if you will come down to the desk you may have access to the books .  they are on a reserved listing and you will have to fill out a form .      terens held out a hand to rik .     let   s go .         maybe we   ve broken a rule     quavered rik .      nonsense  rik .  we   re leaving .         we won   t fill out the form .         no  we   ll get the books some other time .      terens was hurrying  forcing rik along with him .  he strode down the main lobby .  the librarian looked up .      here now     she cried  rising and circling the desk .     one moment .  one moment .      they weren   t stopping for her .   that is  until a patroller stepped in front of them .     you   re in an awful hurry  laddies .      the librarian  somewhat breathless  caught up to them .     you   re      aren   t you .         look here     said terens firmly     why are we being stopped .         didn   t you inquire after certain books .  we   d like to get them for you .         it   s too late .  another time .  don   t you understand that i don   t want the books .  i   ll be back tomorrow .         the library     said the woman primly     at all times endeavors to give satisfaction .  the books will be made available to you in one moment .     two spots of red burned high upon her cheekbones .  she turned away  hurrying through a small door that opened at her approach .   terens said     officer  if you don   t mind       but the patroller held out his moderately long  weighted neuronic whip .  it could serve as an excellent club  or as a longer range weapon of paralyzing potentialities .  he said     now  laddy  why don   t you sit down quietly and wait for the lady to come back .  it would be the polite thing to do .      the patroller was no longer young  no longer slim .  he looked close to retirement age and he was probably serving out his time in quiet vegetation as library guard  but he was armed and the joviality on his swarthy face had an insincere look about it .   terens    forehead was wet and he could feel the perspiration collecting at the base of his spine .  somehow he had underestimated the situation .  he had been sure of his own analysis of the matter  of everything .  yet here he was .  he shouldn   t have been so reckless .  it was his damned desire to invade upper city  to stalk through the library corridors as though he were a sarkite .   .   .   for a desperate moment he wanted to assault the patroller and then  unexpectedly  he didn   t have to .   it was just a flash of movement at first .  the patroller started to turn a little too late .  the slower reactions of age betrayed him .  the neuronic whip was wrenched from his grasp and before he could do more than emit the beginning of a hoarse cry it was laid along his temple .  he collapsed .   rik shrieked with delight  and terens cried     valona .  by all the devils of sark  valona .        four  the rebel      terens recovered almost at once .  he said     out .  quickly .     and began walking .   for a moment he had the impulse to drag the patroller   s unconscious body into the shadows behind the pillars that lined the main hall  but there was obviously no time .   they emerged onto the ramp  with the afternoon sun making the world bright and warm about them .  the colors of upper city had shifted to an orange motif .   valona said anxiously     come on .     but terens caught her elbow .   he was smiling  but his voice was hard and low .  he said     don   t run .  walk naturally and follow me .  hold on to rik .  don   t let him run .      a few steps .  they seemed to be moving through glue .  were there sounds behind them from the library .  imagination .  terens did not dare look .      in here     he said .  the sign above the driveway he indicated flickered a bit in the light of afternoon .  it didn   t compete very well with florina   s sun .  it said  ambulance entrance .   up the drive  through a side entrance  and between incredibly white walls .  they were blobs of foreign material against the aseptic glassiness of the corridor .   a woman in uniform was looking at them from a distance .  she hesitated  frowned  began to approach .  terens did not wait for her .  he turned sharply  followed a branch of the corridor  then another one .  they passed others in uniform and terens could imagine the uncertainty they aroused .  it was quite unprecedented to have natives wandering about unguarded in the upper levels of a hospital .  what did one do .   eventually  of course  they would be stopped .   so terens felt his heartbeat step up when he saw the unobtrusive door that said  to native levels .  the elevator was at their level .  he herded rik and valona within and the soft lurch as the elevator dropped was the most delightful sensation of the day .   there were three kinds of buildings in the city .  most were lower buildings  built entirely on the lower level .  workers    houses  ranging up to three stories in height .  factories  bakeries  disposal plants .  others were upper buildings  sarkite homes  theaters  the library  sports arenas .  but some few were doubles  with levels and entrances both below and above  the patroller stations  for instance  and the hospitals .   one could therefore use a hospital to go from upper city to lower city and avoid in that manner the use of the large freight elevators with their slow movements and overattentive operators .  for a native to do so was thoroughly illegal  of course  but the added crime was a pinprick to those already guilty of assaulting patrollers .   they stepped out upon the lower level .  the stark aseptic walls were there still  but they had a faintly haggard appearance as though they were less often scrubbed .  the upholstered benches that lined the corridors on the upper level were gone .  most of all there was the uneasy babble of a waiting room filled with wary men and frightened women .  a single attendant was attempting to make sense out of the mess  and succeeding poorly .   she was snapping at a stubbled oldster who pleated and unpleated the wrinkled knee of his raveling trousers and who answered all questions in an apologetic monotone .      exactly what is your complaint .   .   .   .  how long have you had these pains .   .   .   .  ever been to the hospital before .   .   .  now look  you people can   t expect to bother us over every little thing .  you sit down and the doctor will look at you and give you more medicine .      she cried shrilly     next .     then muttered something to herself as she looked at the large timepiece on the wall .   terens  valona and rik were edging cautiously through the crowd .  valona  as though the presence of fellow florinians had freed her tongue of paralysis  was whispering intensely .      i had to come  townman .  i was so worried about rik .  i thought you wouldn   t bring him back and          how did you get to upper city  anyway .     demanded terens over his shoulder  as he shoved unresisting natives to either side .      i followed you and saw you go up the freight elevator .  when it came down i said i was with you and he took me up .         just like that .         i shook him a little .         imps of sark     groaned terens .      i had to     explained valona miserably .     then i saw the patrollers pointing out a building to you .  i waited till they were gone and went there too .  only i didn   t dare go inside .  i didn   t know what to do so i sort of hid until i saw you coming out with the patroller stopping          you people there .     it was the sharp  impatient voice of the receptionist .  she was standing now  and the hard rapping of her metal stylus on the cementalloy desk top dominated the gathering and reduced them to a hard breathing silence .      those people trying to leave .  come here .  you cannot leave without being examined .  there   ll be no evading work days with pretended sick calls .  come back here .      but the three were out in the half shadow of lower city .  there were the smells and noise of what the sarkites called the native quarter about them and the upper level was once more only a roof above them .  but however relieved valona and    .  k might feel at being away from the oppressive richness of sarkite surroundings  terens felt no lifting of anxiety .  they had gone too far and henceforth there might be no safety anywhere .   the thought was still passing through his turbulent mind when rik called     look .      terens felt salt in his throat .   it was perhaps the most frightening sight the natives of the lower city could see .  it was like a giant bird floating down through one of the openings in the upper city .  it shut off the sun and deepened the ominous gloom of that portion of the city .  but it wasn   t a bird .  it was one of the armed ground cars of the patrollers .   natives yelled and began running .  they might have no specific reason to fear  but they scattered anyway .  one man  nearly in the path of the car  stepped aside reluctantly .  he had been hurrying on his way  intent on some business of his own  when the shadow caught him .  he looked about him  a rock of calm in the wildness .  he was of medium height  but almost grotesquely broad across the shoulders .  one of his shirt sleeves was slit down its length  revealing an arm like another man   s thigh .   terens was hesitating  and rik and valona could do nothing without him .  the townman   s inner uncertainty had mounted to a fever .  if they ran  where could they go .  if they remained where they were  what would they do .  there was a chance that the patrollers were after others altogether  but with a patroller unconscious on the library floor through their act  the chances of that were negligible .   the broad man was approaching at a heavy half trot .  for a moment he paused in passing them  as though with uncertainty .  he said in a conversational voice     khorov   s bakery is second left  beyond the laundry .      he veered back .   terens said     come on .      he was sweating freely as he ran .  through the uproar  he heard the barking orders that came naturally to patroller throats .  he threw one look over his shoulder .  a half dozen of them were piling out of the ground car  fanning out .  they would have no trouble  he knew .  in his damned townman   s uniform  he was as conspicuous as one of the pillars supporting the upper city .   two of the patrollers were running in the right direction .  he didn   t know whether or not they had seen him  but that didn   t matter .  both collided with the broad man who had just spoken to terens .  all three were close enough for terens to hear the broad man   s hoarse bellow and the patrollers    sharp cursing .  terens herded valona and rik around the corner .   khorov   s bakery was named as such by an almost defaced    worm    of crawling illuminated plastic  broken in half a dozen places  and was made unmistakable by the wonderful odor that filtered through its open door .  there was nothing to do but enter  and they did .   an old man looked out from the inner room within which they could see the flour obscured gleam of the radar furnaces .  he had no chance to ask their business .   terens began     a broad man      he was holding his arms apart in illustration  and the cries of    patrollers .  patrollers .     began to be heard outside .   the old man said hoarsely     this way .  quickly .      terens held back .     in there .      the old man said     this one is a dummy .      first rik  then valona  then terens crawled through the furnace door .  there was a faint click and the back wall of the furnace moved slightly and hung freely from the hinges above .  they pushed through it and into a small room  dimly lit  beyond .     they waited .  ventilation was bad  and the smell of baking increased hunger without satisfying it .  valona kept smiling at rik  patting his hand mechanically from time to time .  rik stared back at her blankly .  once in a while he put a hand to his flushed face .   valona began     townman       he snapped back in a tight whisper     not now  lona .  please .      he passed the back of his hand across his forehead  then stared at the dampness of ms knuckles .   there was a click  magnified by the close confinement of their hiding place .  terens stiffened .  without quite realizing it  he raised clenched fists .   it was the broad man  poking his immense shoulders through the opening .  they scarcely fit .   he looked at terens and was amused .     come on  man .  we   re not going to be fighting .      terens looked at his fists  and let them drop .   the broad man was in markedly poorer condition now than when they had first seen him .  his shirt was all but removed from his back and a fresh weal  turning red and purple  marked one cheekbone .  his eyes were little and the eyelids crowded them above and below .   he said     they   ve stopped looking .  if you   re hungry  the fare here isn   t fancy  but there   s enough of it .  what do you say .        it was night in the city .  there were lights in the upper city that lit the sky for miles  but in the lower city the darkness was clammy .  the shades were drawn tightly across the front of the bakery to hide the illegal  past curfew lights away from it .   rik felt better with warm food inside him .  his headache began to recede .  he fixed his eyes on the broad man   s cheek .   timidly he asked     did they hurt you  mister .         a little     said the broad one .     it doesn   t matter .  it happens every day in my business .     he laughed  showing large teeth .     they had to admit i hadn   t done anything but i was in their way while they were chasing someone else .  the easiest way of getting a native out of the way      his hand rose and fell  holding an invisible weapon  butt first .   rik flinched away and valona reached out an anxious  protective arm .   the broad man leaned back  sucking at his teeth to get out particles of food .  he said     i   m matt khorov  but they just call me the baker .  who are you people .      terens shrugged .     well .   .   .      the baker said     i see your point .  what i don   t know won   t hurt anyone .  maybe .  maybe .  at that  though  you might trust me .  i saved you from the patrollers  didn   t i .         yes .  thank you .     terens couldn   t squeeze cordiality into his voice .  he said     how did you know they were after us .  there were quite a few people running .      the other smiled .     none of them had the faces you three were wearing .  yours could have been ground up and used for chalk .      terens tried to smile in return .  he didn   t succeed well .     i m not sure i know why you risked your life .  thank you  anyway .  it isn   t much  just saying    thank you     but there   s nothing else i can do right now .         you don   t have to do anything .     the baker   s vast shoulders leaned back against the wall .     i do this as often as i can .  it   s nothing personal .  if the patrollers are after someone i do my best for him .  i hate the patrollers .      valona gasped .     don   t you get into trouble .         sure .  look at this .     he put a finger gently on his bruised cheek .     but you don   t think i ought to let it stop me  i hope .  that   s why i built the dummy oven .  so the patrollers wouldn   t catch me and make things too hard for me .      valona   s eyes were wide with mingled fright and fascination .   the baker said     why not .  you know how many squires there are on florina .  ten thousand .  you know how many patrollers .  maybe twenty thousand .  and there are five hundred million of us natives .  if we all lined up against them  .   .   .     he snapped his fingers .   terens said     we   d be lining up against needle guns and blaster cannon  baker .      the baker retorted     yeah .  we   d have to get some of our own .  you townmen have been living too close to the squires .  you   re scared of them .      valona   s world was being turned upside down today .  this man fought with patrollers and spoke with careless self confidence to the townman .  when rik plucked at her sleeve she disengaged his fingers gently and told him to sleep .  she scarcely looked at him .  she wanted to hear what this man said .   the broad man was saying     even with needle guns and blast cannon  the only way the squires hold florina is with the help of a hundred thousand townmen .      terens looked offended  but the baker went on     for instance  look at you .  very nice clothes .  neat .  pretty .  you   ve got a nice little shack  i   ll bet  with book films  a private hopper and no curfew .  you can even go to upper city if you want to .  the squires wouldn   t do that for you for nothing .      terens felt in no position to lose his temper .  he said     all right .  what do you want the townmen to do .  pick fights with the patrollers .  what good would it do .  i admit i keep my town quiet and up to quota  but i keep them out of trouble .  i try to help them  as much as the law will allow .  isn   t that something .  someday          aah  someday .  who can wait for someday .  when you and i are dead  what difference will it make who runs florina .  to us  i mean .      terens said     in the first place  i hate the squires more than you do .  still      he stopped  reddening .   the baker laughed .     go ahead .  say it again .  i won   t turn you in for hating the squires .  what did you do to get the patrollers after you .      terens was silent .   the baker said     i can make a guess .  when the patrollers fell over me they were plenty sore .  sore in person  i mean  and not just because some squire told them to be sore .  i know them and i can tell .  so i figure that there   s only one thing that could have happened .  you must   ve knocked down a patroller .  or killed him  maybe .      terens was still silent .   the baker lost none of his agreeable tone .     it   s all right to keep quiet but there   s such a thing as being too cautious  townman .  you   re going to need help .  they know who you are .         no  they don   t     said terens hastily .      they must have looked at your cards in the upper city .         who said i was in the upper city .         a guess .  i   ll bet you were .         they looked at my card  but not long enough to read my name .         long enough to know you   re a townman .  all they have to do is find a townman missing from his town or one who can   t account for his movements today .  the wires all over florina are probably scorching right now .  i think you   re in trouble .         maybe .         you know there   s no maybe .  want help .      they were talking in whispers .  rik had curled up in the corner and gone to sleep .  valona   s eyes were moving from speaker to speaker .   terens shook his head .     no  thanks .  i  i   ll get out of this .      the baker   s ready laughter came .     it will be interesting to see how .  don   t look down on me because i haven   t got an education .  i   ve got other things .  look  you spend the night thinking about it .  maybe you   ll decide you can use help .        valona   s eyes were open in the darkness .  her bed was only a blanket thrown on the floor  but it was nearly as good as the beds she was used to .  rik slept deeply on another blanket in an opposite corner .  he always slept deeply on days of excitement after his headaches passed .   the townman had refused a bed and the baker had laughed  he laughed at everything  it seemed   turned out the light and told him he was welcome to sit up in the darkness .   valona   s eyes remained open .  sleep was far away .  would she ever sleep again .  she had knocked down a patroller .   unaccountably  she was thinking of her father and mother .   they were very misty in her mind .  she had almost made herself forget them in the years that had stretched between them and herself .  but now she remembered the sound of whispered conversations during the night  when they thought her asleep .  she remembered people who came in the dark .   the patrollers had awakened her one night and asked her questions she could not understand but tried to answer .  she never saw her parents again after that .  they had gone away  she was told  and the next day they had put her to work when other children her age still had two years of play time .  people looked after her as she passed and other children weren   t allowed to play with her  even when work time was over .  she learned to keep to herself .  she learned not to speak .  so they called her    big lona    and laughed at her and said she was a half wit .   why did the conversation tonight remind her of her parents .      valona .      the voice was so close that its light breath stirred her hair and so low she scarcely heard it .  she tensed  partly in fear  partly in embarrassment .  there was only a sheet over her bare body .   it was the townman .  he said     don   t say anything .  just listen .  i am leaving .  the door isn   t locked .  i   ll be back  though .  do you hear me .  do you understand .      she reached in the darkness  caught his hand  pressed it with her fingers .  he was satisfied .      and watch rik .  don   t let him out of your sight .  and valona .     there was a long pause .  then he went on     don   t trust this baker too much .  i don   t know about him .  do you understand .      there was a faint noise of motion  an even fainter distant creak  and he was gone .  she raised herself to one elbow and  except for rik   s breathing and her own  there was only silence .   she put her eyelids together in the darkness  squeezing them  trying to think .  why did the townman  who knew everything  say this about the baker  who hated patrollers and had saved them .  why .   she could think of only one thing .  he had been there .  just when things looked as black as they could be  the baker had come and had acted quickly .  it was almost as though it had been arranged or as if the baker had been waiting for it all to happen .   she shook her head .  it seemed strange .  if it weren   t for what the townman had said  she would never think this .   the silence was broken into quivering pieces by a loud and unconcerned remark .     hello .  still here .      she froze as a beam of light caught her full .  slowly she relaxed and bunched the sheet about her neck .  the beam fell away .   she did not have to wonder about the identity of the new speaker .  his squat broad form bulked in the half light that leaked backward from the flash .   the baker said     you know  i thought you   d go with him .      valona said weakly     who  sir .         the townman .  you know he left  girl .  don   t waste time pretending .         he   ll be back  sir .         did he say he would be back .  if he did  he   s wrong  the patrollers will get him .  he   s not a very smart man  the townman  or he   d know when a door is left open for a purpose .  are you planning to leave too .      valona said     i   ll wait for the townman .         suit yourself .  it will be a long wait .  go when you please .      his light beam suddenly left her altogether and traveled along the floor  picking out rik   s pale  thin face .  rik   s eyelids crushed together automatically  at the impact of the light  but he slept on .   the baker   s voice grew thoughtful .     but i   d just as soon you left that one behind .  you understand that  i suppose .  if you decide to leave  the door is open  but it isn   t open for him .         he   s just a poor  sick fellow      valona began in a high  frightened voice .      yes .  well  i collect poor sick fellows and that one stays here .  remember .      the light beam did not move from rik   s sleeping face .       five  the scientist      dr .  selim junz had been impatient for a year  but one does not become accustomed to impatience with time .  rather the reverse .  nevertheless the year had taught him that the sarkite civil service could not be hurried  all the more so since the civil servants themselves were largely transplanted florinians and therefore dreadfully careful of their own dignity .   he had once asked old abel  the trantorian ambassador  who had lived on sark so long that the soles of his boots had grown roots  why the sarkites allowed their government departments to be run by the very people they despised so heartily .   abel had wrinkled his eyes over a goblet of green wine .      policy  junz     he said .     policy .  a matter of practical genetics  carried out with sarkite logic .  they   re a small  no account world  these sarkites  in themselves  and are only important so long as they control that everlasting gold mine  florina .  so each year they skim florina   s fields and villages  bringing the cream of its youth to sark for training .  the mediocre ones they set to filing their papers and filling their blanks and signing their forms and the really clever ones they send back to florina to act as native governors for the towns .  townmen they call them .      dr .  junz was a spatio analyst  primarily .  he did not quite see the point of all this .  he said so .   abel pointed a blunt old forefinger at him and the green light shining through the contents of his goblet touched the ridged fingernail and subdued its yellow grayness .   he said     you will never make an administrator .  ask me for no recommendations .  look  the most intelligent elements of florina are won over to the sarkite cause wholeheartedly  since while they serve sark they are well taken care of  whereas if they turn their backs on sark the best they can hope for is a return to a florinian existence  which is not good  friend  not good .      he swallowed the wine at a draught and went on .     further  neither the townmen nor sark   s clerical assistants may breed without losing their positions .  even with female florinians  that is .  interbreeding with sarkites is  of course  out of the question .  in this way the best of the florinian genes are being continually withdrawn from circulation  so that gradually florina will be composed only of hewers of wood and drawers of water .         they   ll run out of clerks at that rate  won   t they .         a matter for the future .        so dr .  junz sat now in one of the outer anterooms of the department for florinian affairs and waited impatiently to be allowed past the slow barriers  while florinian underlings scurried endlessly through a bureaucratic maze .   an elderly florinian  shriveled in service  stood before him .      dr .  junz .         yes .         come with me .      a flashing number on a screen would have been as efficient in summoning him and a fluoro channel through the air as efficient in guiding him  but where manpower is cheap  nothing need be substituted .  dr .  junz thought    manpower    advisedly .  he had never seen women in any government department on sark .  florinian women were left on their planet  except for some house servants who were likewise forbidden to breed  and sarkite women were  as abel said  out of the question .   he was gestured to a seat before the desk of the clerk to the undersecretary .  he knew the man   s title from the channeled glow etched upon the desk .  no florinian could  of course  be more than a clerk  regardless of how much of the actual threads of office ran through his white fingers .  the undersecretary and the secretary of florinian affairs would themselves be sarkites  but though dr .  junz might meet them socially  he knew he would never meet them here in the department .   he sat  still impatiently  but at least nearer the goal .  the clerk was glancing carefully through the file  turning each minutely coded sheet as though it held the secrets of the universe .  the man was quite young  a recent graduate perhaps  and like all florinians  very fair of skin and light of hair .   dr .  junz felt an atavistic thrill .  he himself came from the world of libair  and like all libairians  he was highly pigmented and his skin was a deep  rich brown .  there were few worlds in the galaxy in which the skin color was so extreme as on either libair or florina .  generally  intermediate shades were the rule .   some of the radical young anthropologists were playing with the notion that men of worlds like libair  for instance  had arisen by independent but convergent evolution .  the older men denounced bitterly any notion of an evolution that converged different species to the point where interbreeding was possible  as it certainly was among all the worlds in the galaxy .  they insisted that on the original planet  whatever it was  mankind had already been split into subgroups of varying pigmentation .   this merely placed the problem further back in time and answered nothing so that dr .  junz found neither explanation satisfying .  yet even now he found himself thinking of the problem at times .  legends of a past of conflict had lingered  for some reason  on the dark worlds .  libairian myths  for instance  spoke of times of war between men of different pigmentation and the founding of libair itself was held due to a party of browns fleeing from a defeat in battle .   when dr .  junz left libair for the arcturian institute of spatial technology and later entered his profession  the early fairy tales were forgotten .  only once since then had he really wondered .  he had happened upon one of the ancient worlds of the centaurian sector in the course of business  one of those worlds whose history could be counted in millennia and whose language was so archaic that its dialect might almost be that lost and mythical language  english .  they had a special word for a man with dark skin .   now why should there be a special word for a man with dark skin .  there was no special word for a man with blue eyes  or large ears  or curly hair .  there was no    the clerk   s precise voice broke his reverie .     you have been at this office before  according to the record .      dr .  junz said with some asperity     i have indeed  sir .         but not recently .         no  not recently .         you are still in search of a spatio analyst who disappeared      the clerk flipped sheets     some eleven months and thirteen days ago .         that   s right .         in all that time     said the clerk in his dry  crumbly voice out of which all the juice seemed carefully pressed     there has been no sign of the man and no evidence to the effect that he ever was anywhere in sarkite territory .         he was last reported     said the scientist     in space near sark .      the clerk looked up and his pale blue eyes focused for a moment on dr .  junz  then dropped quickly .     this may be so  but it is not evidence of his presence on sark .      not evidence .  dr .  junz   s lips pressed tightly together .  it was what the interstellar spatio analytic bureau had been telling him with increasing bluntness for months .   no evidence  dr .  junz .  we feel that your time might be better employed  dr .  junz .  the bureau will see to it that the search is maintained  dr .  junz .   what they really meant was  stop wasting our dough  junz .   it had begun  as the clerk had carefully stated  eleven months and thirteen days ago by interstellar standard time  the clerk would  of course  not be guilty of using local time on a matter of this nature  .  two days before that he had landed on sark on what was to be a routine inspection of the bureau   s offices on that planet  but which turned out to be  well  which turned out to be what it was .   he had been met by the local representative of the i . s . b .   a wispy young man who was marked in dr .  junz   s thoughts chiefly by the fact that he chewed  incessantly  some elastic product of sark   s chemical industry .   it was when the inspection was almost over and done with that the local agent had recalled something  parked his lastoplug in the space behind his molars and said     message from one of the field men  dr .  junz .  probably not important .  you know them .      it was the usual expression of dismissal  you know them .  dr .  junz looked up with a momentary flash of indignation .  he was about to say that fifteen years ago he himself had been a    field man     then he remembered that after three months he had been able to endure it no longer .  but it was that bit of anger that made him read the message with an earnest attention .   it went  please keep direct coded line open to i . s . b .  central hq for detailed message involving matter of utmost importance .  all galaxy affected .  am landing by minimum trajectory .   the agent was amused .  his jaws had gone back to their rhythmic champing and he said     imagine  sir .     all galaxy affected .     that   s pretty good  even for a field man .  i called him after i got this to see if i could make any sense out of him  but that flopped .  he just kept saying that the life of every human being on florina was in danger .  you know  half a billion lives at stake .  he sounded very psychopathic .  so  frankly  i don   t want to try to handle him when he lands .  what do you suggest .      dr .  junz had said     do you have a transcript of your talk .         yes  sir .     there was a few minutes searching .  a sliver of film was finally found .   dr .  junz ran it through the reader .  he frowned .     this is a copy  isn   t it .         i sent the original to the bureau of extra planetary transportation here on sark .  i thought it would be best if they met him on the landing field with an ambulance .  he   s probably in a bad way .      dr .  junz felt the impulse to agree with the young man .  when the lonely analysts of the depths of space finally broke over their jobs  their psychopathies were likely to be violent .   then he said     but wait .  you sound as though he hasn   t landed yet .      the agent looked surprised .     i suppose he has  but nobody   s called me about it .         well  call transportation and get the details .  psychopathic or not  the details must be on our records .      the spatio analyst had stopped in again the next day on a last minute check before he left the planet .  he had other matters to attend to on other worlds  and he was in a moderate hurry .  almost at the doorway  he said  over his shoulder     how   s our field man doing .      the agent said     oh  say  i meant to tell you .  transportation hasn   t heard from him .  i sent out the energy pattern of his byperatomic motors and they say his ship is nowhere in near space .  the guy must have changed his mind about landing .      dr .  junz decided to delay his departure for twenty four hours .  the next day he was at the bureau of extra planetary transportation in sark city  capital of the planet .  he met the florinian bureaucracy for the first time and they shook their heads at him .  they had received the message concerning the prospective landing of an analyst of the i . s . b .  oh yes  but no ship had landed .   but it was important  dr .  junz insisted .  the man was very sick .  had they not received a copy of the transcript of his talk with the local i . s . b .  agent .  they opened their eyes wide at him .  transcript .  no one could be found who remembered receiving that .  they were sorry if the man were sick  but no i . s . b .  ship had landed  and no i . s . b .  ship was anywhere in near space .   dr .  junz went back to his hotel room and thought many thoughts .  the new deadline for his leaving passed .  he called the desk and arranged to be moved to another suite more adapted to an extended occupancy .  then he arranged an appointment with ludigan abel  the trantorian ambassador .   he spent the next day reading books on sarkite history  and when it was time for the appointment with abel  his heart had become a slow drumbeat of anger .  he was not going to quit easily  he knew that .   the old ambassador treated it as a social call  pumped his hand  had his mechanical bartender rolled in  and would not allow any discussion of business over the first two drinks .  junz used the opportunity for worth while small talk  asked about the florinian civil service and received the exposition on the practical genetics of sark .  his sense of anger deepened .       junz always remembered abel as he had been that day .  deepset eyes half closed under startling white eyebrows  beaky nose hovering intermittently over his goblet of wine  insunken cheeks accentuating the thinness of his face and body  and a gnarled finger slowly keeping time to some unheard music .  junz began his story  telling it with stolid economy .  abel listened carefully and without interruption .   when junz was finished  he dabbed delicately at his lips and said     look now  do you know this man who has disappeared .         no .         nor met him .         our field analysts are hard men to meet .         has he had delusions before this .         this is his first  according to the records at central i . s . b .  offices  if it is a delusion .         if .     the ambassador did not follow that up .  he said     and why have you come to me .         for help .         obviously .  but in what way .  what can i do .         let me explain .  the sarkite bureau of extra planetary transportation has checked near space for the energy pattern of the motors of our man   s ship  and there is no sign of it .  they wouldn   t be lying about that .  i do not say that the sarkites are above lying  but they are certainly above useless lying  and they must know that i can have the matter checked in the space of two or three hours .         true .  what then .         there are two times when an energy pattern trace will fail .  one  when the ship is not in near space  because it  has jumped through hyperspace and is in another region of the galaxy  and two  when it is not in space at all because it has landed on a planet .  i cannot believe our man has jumped .  if his statements about peril to florina and galactic importance are megalomanic delusions  nothing would stop him from coming to sark to report on them .  he would not have changed his mind and left .  i   ve had fifteen years experience with such things .  if  by any chance  his statements were sane and real  then certainly the matter would be too serious to allow him to change his mind and leave near space .      the old trantorian lifted a finger and waved it gently .     your conclusion then is that he is on sark .         exactly .  again  there are two alternatives .  first  if he is in the grip of a psychosis  he may have landed anywhere on the planet other than at a recognized spaceport .  he may be wandering about  sick and semi amnesiac .  these things are very unusual  even for field men  but they have happened .  usually  in such a case  the fits are temporary .  as they pass  the victim finds the details of his job returning first  before any personal memories at all .  after all  the spatio analyst   s job is his life .  very often the amnesiac is picked up because he wanders into a public library to look up references on spatio analysis .         i see .  then you want to have me help you arrange with the board of librarians to have such a situation reported to you .         no  because i don   t anticipate any trouble there .  i will ask that certain standard works on spatio analysis be placed on reserve and that any man asking for them  other than those who can prove they are native sarkites  be held for questioning .  they will agree to that because they will know  or certain of their superiors will know  that such a plan will come to nothing .         why not .         because     and junz was speaking rapidly now  caught up in a trembling cloud of fury     i am certain that our man landed at sark city spaceport exactly as he planned and  sane or psychotic  was then possibly imprisoned but probably killed by the sarkite authorities .      abel put down his nearly empty glass .     are you joking .         do i look as if i were .  what did you tell me just half an hour ago about sark .  their lives  prosperity and power depend upon their control of florina .  what has all my own reading in this past twenty four hours shown me .  that the kyrt fields of florina are the wealth of sark .  and here comes a man  sane or psychotic  it doesn   t matter  who claims that something of galactic importance has put the life of every man and woman on florina in danger .  look at this transcript of our man   s last known conversation .      abel picked up the sliver of film that had been dashed upon his lap by junz and accepted the reader held out to him .  he ran it through slowly  his faded eyes blinking and peering at the eyepiece .      it   s not very informative .         of course not .  it says there is a danger .  it says there is horrible urgency .  that   s all .  but it should never have been sent to the sarkites .  even if the man were wrong  could the sarkite government allow him to broadcast whatever madness  granting it be madness  he has in his mind and fill the galaxy with it .  leaving out of consideration the panic it might give rise to on florina  the interference with the production of kyrt thread  it remains a fact that the whole dirty mess of sark florina political relationships would be exposed to the view of the galaxy as a whole .  consider that they need do away with only one man to prevent all that  since i can   t take action on this transcript alone and they know it .  would sark hesitate to stop at murder in such a case .  the world of such genetic experimenters as you describe would not hesitate .         and what would you have me do .  i am still  i must say  not certain .     abel seemed unmoved .      find out if they have killed him     said junz grimly .     you must have an organization for espionage here .  oh  let   s not quibble .  i have been knocking about the galaxy long enough to have passed my political adolescence .  get to the bottom of this while i distract their attention with my library negotiations .  and when you find them out for the murderers they are  i want trantor to see to it that no government anywhere in the galaxy ever again has the notion it can kill an i . s . b .  man and get away with it .      and there his first interview with abel had ended .   junz was right in one thing .  the sarkite officials were cooperative and even sympathetic as far as making library arrangements were concerned .   but he seemed right in nothing else .  months passed  and abel   s agents could find no trace of the missing field man anywhere on sark  alive or dead .   for over eleven months that held true .  almost  junz began to feel ready to quit .  almost  he decided to wait for the twelfth month to be done and then no more .  and then the break had come and it was not from abel at all  but from the nearly forgotten straw man he had himself set up .  a report came from sark   s public library and junz found himself sitting across the desk from a florinian civil servant in the bureau of florinian affairs .     the clerk completed his mental arrangement of the case .  he had turned the last sheet .   he looked up .     now what can i do for you .      junz spoke with precision .     yesterday  at      p . m .   i was informed that the florinian branch of the public library of sark was holding a man for me who had attempted to consult two standard texts on spatio analysis and who was not a native sarkite .  i have not heard from the library since .      he continued  raising his voice to override some comment begun by the clerk .  he said     a tele news bulletin received over a public instrument owned by the hotel at which i maintain residence  and timed      p . m .  yesterday  claimed that a member of the florinian patrol had been knocked unconscious in the florinian branch of the public library of sark and that three native florinians believed responsible for the outrage were being pursued .  that bulletin was not repeated in later news broadcast summaries .      now i have no doubt that the two pieces of information are connected .  i have no doubt that the man i want is in the custody of the patrol .  i have asked for permission to travel to florina and been refused .  i have sub ethered florina to send the man in question to sark and have received no answer .  i come to the bureau of florinian affairs to demand action in this respect .  either i go there or he comes here .      the clerk   s lifeless voice said     the government of sark cannot accept ultimata from officers of the i . s . b .  i have been warned by my superiors that you would probably be questioning me in these matters and i have been instructed as to the facts i am to make known to you .  the man who was reported to be consulting the reserved texts  along with two companions  a townman and a florinian female  did indeed commit the assault you referred to  and they were pursued by the patrol .  they were not  however  apprehended .      a bitter disappointment swept over junz .  he did not bother to  y to hide it .     they have escaped .         not exactly .  they were traced to the bakery shop of one matt khorov .      junz stared .     and allowed to remain there .         have you been in conference with his excellency  ludigan abel  lately .         what has that to do with          we are informed that you have been frequently seen at the trantorian embassy .         i have not seen the ambassador in a week .         then i suggest you see him .  we allowed the criminals to remain unharmed at khorov   s shop out of respect for our delicate interstellar relationships with trantor .  i have been instructed to tell you  if it seemed necessary  that khorov  as you probably will not be surprised to hear     and here the white face took on something uncommonly like a sneer     is well known to our department of security as an agent of trantor .          six  the ambassador      it was ten hours before junz had his interview with the clerk that terens left khorov   s bakery .   terens kept a hand on the rough surfaces of the workers    hovels he passed  as he stepped gingerly along the alleys of the city .  except for the pale light that washed down in a periodic glimmer from the upper city  he was in total darkness .  what light might exist in lower city would be the pearly flashes of the patrollers  marching in twos and threes .   lower city lay like a slumbering noxious monster  its greasy coils hidden by the glittering cover of upper city .  parts of it probably maintained a shadowy life as produce was brought in and stored for the coming day  but that was not here  not in the slums .   terens shrank into a dusty alley  even the nightly showers of florina could scarcely penetrate into the shadowy regions beneath the cementalloy  as the distant clank of footsteps reached him .  lights appeared  passed  and disappeared a hundred yards away .   all night long the patrollers marched back and forth .  they needed only to march .  the fear they inspired was strong enough to maintain order with scarcely any display of force .  with no city lights  the darkness might well be cover for innumerable crawling humans  but even without patrollers as a distant threat  that danger could have been discounted .  the food stores and workshops were well guarded  the luxury of upper city was unattainable  and to steal from one another  to parasitize on one another   s misery  was obviously futile .   what would be considered crime on other worlds was virtually non existent here in the dark .  the poor were at hand but had been picked clean  and the rich were strictly out of reach .   terens flitted on  his face gleaming white when he passed under one of the openings in the cementalloy above  and he could not help but look up .   out of reach .   were they indeed out of reach .  how many changes in attitude toward the squires of sark had he endured in his life .  as a child  he had been but a child .  patrollers were monsters in black and silver  from whom one fled as a matter of course  whether one had done wrong or not .  the squires were misty and mystical supermen  enormously good  who lived in a paradise known as sark and brooded watchfully and patiently over the welfare of the foolish men and women of florina .   he would repeat every day in school  may the spirit of the galaxy watch over the squires as they watch over us .   yes  he thought now  exactly .  exactly .  let the spirit be to them as they to us .  no more and no less .  his fists clenched and burned in the shadows .   when he was ten  he had written an essay for school about what he imagined life to be like on sark .  it had been a work of purely creative imagination  designed to show off his penmanship .  he remembered very little  only one passage in fact .  in that  he described the squires  gathering every morning in a great hall with colors like those of the kyrt blossoms and standing about gravely in twenty foot high splendor  debating on the sins of the florinians and sorrowfully somber over the necessities of winning them back to virtue .   the teacher had been very pleased  and at the end of the year  when the other boys and girls proceeded with their short sessions on reading  writing and morality  he had been promoted to a special class where he learned arithmetic  galactography  and sarkite history .  at the age of sixteen he had been taken to sark .   he could still remember the greatness of that day  and he shuddered away from the memory .  the thought of it shamed him .   terens was approaching the outskirts of the city now .  an occasional breeze brought him the heavy night odor of the kyrt blossoms .  a few minutes now and he would be out in the relative safety of the open fields where there were no regular patroller beats and where  through the ragged night clouds  he would see the stars again .  even the hard  bright yellow star that was sark   s sun .   it had been his sun for half his life .  when he first saw it through a spaceship   s porthole as more than a star  as an unbearably bright little marble  he wanted to get on his knees .  the thought that he was approaching paradise removed even the paralyzing fright of his first space flight .   he had landed on his paradise  and been delivered to an old florinian who saw to it that be was bathed and clothed becomingly .  he was brought to a large building  and on the way there his elderly guide had bowed low to a figure that passed .      bow .     the old one muttered angrily to the young terens .   terens did so and was confused .     who was that .         a squire  you ignorant farm hand .         he .  a squire .      he stopped dead in his tracks and had to be urged forward .  it was his first sight of a squire .  not twenty feet tall at all  but a man like men .  other florinian youths might have recovered from the shock of such a disillusion  but not terens .  something changed inside him  changed permanently .   in all the training he received  through all the studies in which he did so well  he never forgot that squires were men .   for ten years he studied  and when he neither studied nor ate nor slept  he was taught to make himself useful in many small ways .  he was taught to run messages and empty wastebaskets  to bow low when a squire passed and to turn his face respectfully to the wall when a squire   s lady passed .   for five more years he worked in the civil service  shifted as usual from post to post in order that his capacities might best be tested under a variety of conditions .   a plump  soft florinian visited him once  smiling his friendship  pinching his shoulder gently  and asked what he thought of the squires .   terens repressed a desire to turn away and run .  he wondered if his thoughts could have imprinted themselves in some obscure code upon the lines of his face .  he shook his head  murmured a string of banalities on the goodness of the squires .   but the plump one stretched his lips and said     you don   t mean that .  come to this place tonight .     he gave him a small card  that crumbled and charred in a few minutes .   terens went .  he was afraid  but very curious .  there he met friends of his  who looked at him with secrecy in their eyes and who met him at work later with bland glances of indifference .  he listened to what they said and found that many seemed to believe what he had been hoarding in his own mind and honestly had thought to be his own creation and no one else   s .   he learned that at least some florinians thought the squires to be vile brutes who milked florina of its riches for their own useless good while they left the hard working natives to wallow in ignorance and poverty .  he learned that the time was coming when there would be a giant uprising against sark and all the luxury and wealth of florina would be appropriated by their rightful owners .   how .  terens asked .  he asked it over and over again .  after all  the squires and the patrollers had the weapons .   and they told him of trantor  of the gigantic empire that had swollen in the last few centuries until half the inhabited worlds of the galaxy were part of it .  trantor  they said  would destroy sark with the help of the florinians .   but  said terens  first to himself  then to others  if trantor was so large and florina so small  would not trantor simply replace sark as a still larger and more tyrannical master .  if that were the only escape  sark was to be endured in preference .  better the master they knew than the master they knew not .   he was derided and ejected  with threats against his life if he ever talked of what he had heard .   but some time afterward  he noted that one by one those of the conspiracy disappeared  until only the original plump one was left .   occasionally he saw that one whisper to some newcomer here and there  but it would not have been safe to warn the young victim that he was being presented with a temptation and a test .  he would have to find his own way  as had terens .   terens even spent some time in the department of security  which only a few florinians could ever expect to accomplish .  it was a short stay  for the power attached to an official in security was such that the time spent there by any individual was even shorter than elsewhere .   but here terens found  somewhat to his surprise  that there were real conspiracies to be countered .  somehow men and women met on florina and plotted rebellion .  usually these were surreptitiously supported by trantorian money .  sometimes the would be rebels actually thought florina would succeed unaided .   terens meditated on the matter .  his words were few  his bearing correct  but his thoughts ranged unchecked .  the squires he hated  partly because they were not twenty feet tall  partly because he might not look at their women  and partly because he had served a few  with bowed head  and had found that for all their arrogance they were foolish creatures no better educated than himself and usually far less intelligent .   yet what alternative to this personal slavery was there .  to exchange the stupid sarkite squire for the stupid trantorian imperial was useless .  to expect the florinian peasants to do something on their own was fantastically foolish .  so there was no way out .   it was the problem that had been in his mind for years  as student  as petty official  and as townman .   and then there had arisen the peculiar set of circumstances that put an undreamed of answer in his hands in the person of this insignificant looking man who had once been a spatio analyst and who now babbled of something that put the life of every man and woman on florina in danger .   terens was out in the fields now  where the night rain was ending and the stars gleamed wetly among the clouds .  he breathed deeply of the kyrt that was florina   s treasure and her curse .   he was under no illusions .  he was no longer a townman .  he was not even a free florinian peasant .  he was a criminal on the run  a fugitive who must hide .   yet there was a burning in his mind .  for the last twenty four hours he had had in his hands the greatest weapon against sark anyone could have dreamed of .  there was no question about it .  he knew that rik remembered correctly  that he had been a spatio analyst once  that he had been psycho probed into near brainlessness  and that what he remembered was something true and horrible and  powerful .   he was sure of it .   and now this rik was in the thick hands of a man who pretended to be a florinian patriot but was actually a trantorian agent .   terens felt the bitterness of his anger in the back of his throat .  of course this baker was a trantorian agent .  he had had no doubt about that from the first moment .  who else among dwellers in the lower city would have the capital to build dummy radar ovens .   he could not allow rik to fall into the hands of trantor .  he would not allow rik to fall into the hands of trantor .  there was no limit to the risks he was prepared to run .  what matter the risks .  he had incurred the death penalty already .   there was a dim gleam in the corner of the sky .  he would wait for dawn .  the various patroller stations would have his description  of course  but it might take several minutes for his appearance to register .   and during those several minutes he would be a townman .  it would give him time to do something that even now  even now  he did not dare let his mind dwell upon .     it was ten hours after junz had had his interview with the clerk that he met ludigan abel again .   the ambassador greeted junz with his usual surface cordiality  yet with a definite and disturbing sensation of guilt .  at their first meeting  it had been a long time ago  nearly a standard year had passed  he had paid no attention to the man   s story per se .  his only thought had been  will this  or can this  help trantor .   trantor .  it was always first in his thought  yet he was not the kind of fool who would worship a cluster of stars or the yellow emblem of spaceship and sun that the trantorian armed forces wore .  in short  he was not a patriot in the ordinary meaning of the word and trantor as trantor meant nothing to him .   but he did worship peace  all the more so because he was growing old and enjoyed his glass of wine  his atmosphere saturated with mild music and perfume  his afternoon nap  and his quiet wait for death .  it was how he imagined all men must feel  yet all men suffered war and destruction .  they died frozen in the vacuum of space  vaporized in the blast of exploding atoms  famished on a besieged and bombarded planet .   how then to enforce peace .  not by reason  certainly  nor by education .  if a man could not look at the fact of peace and the fact of war and choose the former in preference to the latter  what additional argument could persuade him .  what could be more eloquent as a condemnation of war than war itself .  what tremendous feat of dialectic could carry with it a tenth the power of a single gutted ship with its ghastly cargo .   so then  to end the misuse of force  only one solution was left  force itself .   abel had a map of trantor in his study  so designed as to show the application of that force .  it was a clear crystalline ovoid in which the galactic lens was three dimensionally laid out .  its stars were specks of white diamond dust  its nebulae  patches of light or dark fog  and in its central depths there were the few red specks that had been the trantorian republic .   not    were    but    had been .     the trantorian republic had been a mere five worlds  five hundred years earlier .   but it was a historical map  and showed the republic at that stage only when the dial was set at zero .  advance the dial one notch and the pictured galaxy would be as it was fifty years later and a sheaf of stars would redden about trantor   s rim .   in ten stages  half a millennium would pass and the crimson would spread like a widening bloodstain until more than half the galaxy had fallen into the red puddle .   that red was the red of blood in more than a fanciful way .  as the trantorian republic became the trantorian confederation and then the trantorian empire  its advance had lain through a tangled forest of gutted men  gutted ships  and gutted worlds .  yet through it all trantor had become strong and within the red there was peace .   now trantor trembled at the brink of a new conversion  from trantorian empire to galactic empire and then the red would engulf all the stars and there would be universal peace  pax trantorica .     abel wanted that .  five hundred years ago  four hundred years ago  even two hundred years ago  he would have opposed trantor as an unpleasant nest of nasty  materialistic and aggressive people  careless of the rights of others  imperfectly democratic at home though quick to see the minor slaveries of others  and greedy without end .  but the time had passed for all that .   he was not for trantor  but for the all embracing end that trantor represented .  so the question  how will this help galactic peace .  naturally became  how will this help trantor .   the trouble was that in this particular instance he could not be certain .  to junz the solution was obviously a straightforward one .  trantor must uphold the i . s . b .  and punish sark .   possibly this would be a good thing  if something could definitely be proven against sark .  possibly not  even then .  certainly not  if nothing could be proven .  but in any case trantor could not move rashly .  all the galaxy could see that trantor stood at the edge of galactic dominion and there was still a chance that what yet remained of the non trantorian planets might unite against that .  trantor could win even such a war  but perhaps not without paying a price that would make victory only a pleasanter name for defeat .   so trantor must never make an incautious move in this final stage of the game .  abel had therefore proceeded slowly  casting his gentle web across the labyrinth of the civil service and the glitter of the sarkite squiredom  probing with a smile and questioning without seeming to .  nor did he forget to keep the fingers of the trantorian secret service upon junz himself lest the angry libairian do in a moment damage that abel could not repair in a year .   abel was astonished at the libairian   s persistent anger .  he had asked him once     why does one agent concern you so .      he half expected a speech on the integrity of the i . s . b .  and the duty of all to uphold the bureau as an instrument not of this world or that  but of all humanity .  he did not get it .   instead junz frowned and said     because at the bottom of all this lies the relationship between sark and florina .  i want to expose that relationship and destroy it .      abel felt nothing less than nausea .  always  everywhere  there was this preoccupation with single worlds that prevented  over and over again  any intelligent concentration upon the problem of galactic unity .  certainly social injustices existed here and there .  certainly they seemed sometimes impossible to stomach .  but who could imagine that such injustice could be solved on any scale less than galactic .  first  there must be an end to war and national rivalry and only then could one turn to the internal miseries that  after all  had external conflict as their chief cause .  and junz was not even of florina .  he had not even that cause for emotionalized shortsightedness .   abel said     what is florina to you .      junz hesitated .  he said     i feel a kinship .         but you are a libairian .  or at least that is my impression .         i am  but there lies the kinship .  we are both extremes in a galaxy of the average .         extremes .  i don   t understand .      junz said     in skin pigmentation .  they are unusually pale .  we are unusually dark .  it means something .  it binds us together .  it gives us something in common .  it seems to me our ancestors must have had long histories of being different  even of being excluded from the social majority .  we are unfortunate whites and darks  brothers in being different .      by that time  under abel   s astonished gaze  junz stumbled to a halt .  the subject had never been sounded again .     and now  after a year  without warning  without any previous intimations  just at the point where  perhaps  a quiet trailing end might be expected of the whole wretched matter and where even junz showed signs of flagging zeal  it all exploded .   he faced a different junz now  one whose anger was not reserved for sark  but spilled and overflowed onto abel as well .      it is not     the libairian said in part     that i resent the fact that your agents have been set upon my heels .  presumably you are cautious and must rely on nothing and nobody .  good  as far as that goes .  but why was i not informed as soon as our man was located .      abel   s hand smoothed the warm fabric of the arm of his chair .     matters are complicated .  always complicated .  i had arranged that any report on an unauthorized seeker after spatio analytic data be reported to certain of my own agents as well as to you .  i even thought you might need protection .  but on florina       junz said bitterly     yes .  we were fools not to have considered that .  we spent nearly a year proving we could find him nowhere on sark .  he had to be on florina and we were blind to that .  in any case  we have him now .  or you have  and presumably it will be arranged to have me see him .      abel did not answer directly .  he said     you say they told you this man khorov was a trantorian agent .         isn   t he .  why should they lie .  or are they misinformed .         they neither lie nor are they misinformed .  he has been an agent of ours for a decade  and it is disturbing to me that they were aware of it .  it makes me wonder what more they know of us and how shaky our structure may be altogether .  but doesn   t it make you wonder why they told you baldly that he was one of our men .         because it was the truth  i imagine  and to keep me  once and for all  from embarrassing them by further demands that could only cause trouble between themselves and trantor .         truth is a discredited commodity among diplomats and what greater trouble can they cause for themselves than to let us know the extent of their knowledge about us  to give us the opportunity before it is too late  to draw in our damaged net  mend it and put it out whole again .         then answer your own question .         i say they told you of their knowledge of khorov   s true identity as a gesture of triumph .  they knew that the fact of their knowledge could no longer either help or harm them since i have known for twelve hours that they knew khorov was one of our men .         but how .         by the most unmistakable hint possible .  listen .  twelve hours ago matt khorov  agent for trantor  was killed by a member of the florinian patrol .  the two florinians he held at the time  a woman and the man who  in all probability  is the field man you have been seeking  are gone  vanished .  presumably they are in the hands of the squires .      junz cried out and half rose from his seat .   abel lifted a glass of wine to his lips calmly and said     there is nothing i can do officially .  the dead man was a florinian and those who have vanished  for all we can prove to the contrary  are likewise florinians .  so  you see  we have been badly outplayed  and are now being mocked in addition .          seven  the patroller      rik saw the baker killed .  he saw him crumple without a sound  his chest driven in and charred into smoking ruins under the silent push of the blaster .  it was a sight that drowned out for him most of what had preceded and almost all that had followed .   there was the dim memory of the patroller   s first approach  of the quiet but terribly intent manner in which he had drawn his weapon .  the baker had looked up and shaped his lips for one last word that he had no time to utter .  then the deed was done  there was the rushing of blood in rik   s ears and the wild screaming scramble of the mob swirling in all directions  like a river in flood .   for a moment it negated the improvement rik   s mind had made in those last few hours of sleep .  the patroller had plunged toward him  throwing himself forward upon yelling men and women as though they were a viscous sea of mud he would have to slog through .  rik and lona turned with the current and were carried away .  there were eddies and subcurrents  turning and quivering as the flying patrollers    cars began to hover overhead .  valona urged rik forward  ever outward to the outskirts of the city .  for a while he was the frightened child of yesterday  not the almost adult of that morning .   he had awakened that morning in the grayness of a dawn he could not see in the windowless room he slept in .  for long minutes he lay there  inspecting his mind .  something had healed during the night  something had knit together and become whole .  it had been getting ready to happen ever since the moment  two days before  when he had begun to    remember .     the process had been proceeding all through yesterday .  the trip to the upper city and the library  the attack upon the patroller and the flight that followed  the encounter with baker  it had all acted upon him like a ferment .  the shriveled fibers of his mind  so long dormant  had been seized and stretched  forced into an aching activity  and now  after a sleep  there was a feeble pulsing about them .   he thought of space and the stars  of long  long  lonely stretches  and great silences .   finally he turned his head to one side and said     lona .      she snapped awake  lifting herself to an elbow  peering in his direction .      rik .         here i am  lona .         are you all right .         sure .     he couldn   t hold down his excitement .     i feel fine  lona .  listen .  i remember more .  i was in a ship and i know exactly       but she wasn   t listening to him .  she slipped into her dress and with her back to him smoothed the seam shut down the front and then fumbled nervously with her belt .   she tiptoed toward him .     i didn   t mean to sleep  rik .  i tried to stay awake .      rik felt the infection of her nervousness .  he said     is something wrong .         sh  don   t speak so loudly .  it   s all right .         where   s the townman .         he   s not here .  he  he had to leave .  why don   t you go back to sleep  rik .      he pushed her consoling arm aside .     i   m all right .  i don   t want to sleep .  i wanted to tell the townman about my ship .      but the townman wasn   t there and valona would not listen .  rik subsided and for the first time felt actively annoyed with valona .  she treated him as though he were a child and he was beginning to feel like a man .   a light entered the room and the broad figure of the baker entered with it .  rik blinked at him and was  for a moment  daunted .  he did not entirely object when valona   s comforting arm stole about his shoulder .   the baker   s thick lips stretched in a smile .     you   re early awake .      neither answered .  .   the baker said     it   s just as well .  you   ll be moving today .      valona   s mouth  was dry .  she said     you   ll not be giving us to the patrollers .      she remembered the way he had looked at rik after the townman had left .  he was still looking at rik  only at rik .      not to the patrollers     he said .     the proper people have been informed and you   ll be safe enough .      he left  and when he returned shortly thereafter he brought food  clothes and two basins of water .  the clothes were new and looked completely strange .   he watched them as they ate  saying     i   m going to give you new names and new histories .  you   re to listen  and i don   t want you to forget .  you   re not florinians  do you understand .  you   re brother and sister from the planet wotex .  you   ve been visiting florina       he went on  supplying details  asking questions  listening to their answers .   rik was pleased to be able to demonstrate the workings of his memory  his easy ability to learn  but valona   s eyes were dark with worry .   the baker was not blind to that .  he said to the girl     if you give me the least trouble i   ll send him on alone and leave you behind .      valona   s strong hands clenched spasmodically .     i will give you no trouble .      it was well into the morning when the baker rose to his feet and said     let   s go .      his last action was to place little black sheets of limp leatherette in their breast pockets .   once outside  rik looked with astonishment at what he could see of himself .  he did not know clothing could be so complicated .  the baker had helped him get it on  but who would help him take it off .  valona didn   t look like a farm girl at all .  even her legs were covered with thin material  and her shoes were raised at the heels so that she had to balance carefully when she walked .   passers by gathered  staring and gawking  calling to one another .  mostly they were children  marketing women  and skulking  ragged idlers .  the baker seemed oblivious to them .  he carried a thick stick which found itself occasionally  as though by accident  between the legs of any who pressed too closely .   and then  when they were still only a hundred yards from the bakery and had made but one turning  the outer reaches of the surrounding crowd swirled excitedly and rik made out the black and silver of a patroller .   that was when it happened .  the weapon  the blast  and again a wild flight .  was there ever a time when fear had not been with him  when the shadow of the patroller had not been behind him .     they found themselves in the squalor of one of the outlying districts of the city .  valona was panting harshly  her new dress bore the wet stains of perspiration .   rik gasped     i can   t run any more .         we   ve got to .         not like this .  listen .     he pulled back firmly against the pressure of the girl   s grip .     listen to me .      the fright and panic were leaving him .   he said     why don   t we go on and do what the baker wanted us to do .      she said     how do you know what he wanted us to do .     she was anxious .  she wanted to keep moving .   he said     we were to pretend we were from another world and he gave us these .     rik was excited .  he pulled the little rectangle out of his pocket  staring at both sides and trying to open it as though it were a booklet .   he couldn   t .  it was a single sheet .  he felt about the edges and as his fingers closed at one corner he heard  or rather felt  something give  and the side toward him turned a startling milky white .  the close wording on the new surface was difficult to understand though he began carefully making out the syllables .   finally he said     it   s a passport .         what   s that .         something to get us away .     he was sure of it .  it had popped into his head .  a single word     passport     like that .     don   t you see .  he was going to have us leave florina .  on a ship .  let   s go through with that .      she said     no .  they stopped him .  they killed him .  we couldn   t  rik  we couldn   t .      he was urgent about it .  he was nearly babbling .     but it would be the best thing to do .  they wouldn   t be expecting us to do that .  and we wouldn   t go on the ship he wanted us to go on .  they   d be watching that .  we   d go on another ship .  any other ship .      a ship .  any ship .  the words rang in his ears .  whether his idea was a good one or not  he didn   t care .  he wanted to be on a ship .  he wanted to be in space .      please  lona .      she said     all right .  if you really think so .  i know where the spaceport is .  when i was a little girl we used to go there on idle days sometimes and watch from far away to see the ships shoot upward .      they were on their way again  and only a slight uneasiness scratched vainly at the gateway of rik   s consciousness .  some memory not of the far past but of the very near past  something he should remember and could not  could just barely not .  something .   he drowned it in the thought of the ship that waited for them .   the florinian at the entry gate was having his fill of excitement that day  but it was excitement at long distance .  there had been the wild stories of the previous evening  telling of patrollers attacked and of daring escapes .  by this morning the stories had expanded and there were whispers of patrollers killed .   he dared not leave his post  but he craned his neck and watched the air cars pass  and the grim faced patrollers leave  as the spaceport contingent was cut and cut till it was almost nothing .   they were filling the city with patrollers  he thought  and was at once frightened and drunkenly uplifted .  why should it make him happy to think of patrollers being killed .  they never bothered him .  at least not much .  he had a good job .  it wasn   t as though he were a stupid peasant .   but he was happy .   he scarcely had time for the couple before him  uncomfortable and perspiring in the outlandish clothing that marked them at once as foreigners .  the woman was holding a passport through the slot .   a glance at her  a glance at the passport  a glance at the list of reservations .  he pressed the appropriate button and two translucent ribbons of film sprang out at them .      go on     he said impatiently .     get them on your wrists and move on .         which ship is ours .     asked the woman in a polite whisper .   that pleased him .  foreigners were infrequent at the florinian spaceport .  in recent years they had grown more and more infrequent .  but when they did come they were neither patrollers nor squires .  they didn   t seem to realize you were only a florinian yourself and they spoke to you politely .   it made him feel two inches taller .  he said     you   ll find it in berth     madam .  i wish you a pleasant trip to wotex .     he said it in the grand manner .   he then returned to his task of putting in surreptitious calls to friends in the city for more information and of trying  even more unobtrusively  to tap private power beam conversations in upper city .   it was hours before he found out that he had made a horrible mistake .     rik said     lona .      he tugged at her elbow  pointed quickly and whispered     that one .      valona looked at the indicated ship doubtfully .  it was much smaller than the ship in berth     for which their tickets held good .  it looked more burnished .  four air locks yawned open and the main port gaped  with a ramp leading from it like an outstretched tongue reaching to ground level .   rik said     they   re airing it .  they usually air passenger ships before flight to get rid of the accumulated odor of canned oxygen  used and reused .      valona stared at him .     how do you know .      rik felt a sprig of vanity grow within himself .     i just know .  you see  there wouldn   t be anyone in it now .  it isn   t comfortable  with the draft on .      he looked about uneasily .     i don   t know why there aren   t more people about  though .  was it like this when you used to watch it .      valona thought not  but she could scarcely remember .  childhood memories were far away .     there was not a patroller in sight as they walked up the ramp on quivering legs .  what figures they could see were civilian employees  intent on their own jobs  and small in the distance .   moving air cut through them as they stepped into the hold and valona   s dress bellied so that she had to bring her hands down to keep the hemline within bounds .      is it always like this .     she asked .  she had never been on a spaceship before  never dreamed of being on one .  her lips stuck together and her heart pounded .   rik said     no .  just during aeration .      he walked joyfully over the hard metallite passageways  inspecting the empty rooms eagerly .      here     he said .  it was the galley .   he spoke rapidly .     it isn   t food so much .  we can get along without food for quite a while .  it   s water .      he rummaged through the neat and compact nestings of utensils and came up with a large  capped container .  he looked about for the water tap  muttered a breathless hope that they had not neglected to fill the water tanks  then grinned his relief when the soft sound of pumps came  and the steady gush of liquid .      now just take some of the cans .  not too many .  we don   t want them to take notice .      rik tried desperately to think of ways of countering discovery .  again he groped for something he could not quite remember .  occasionally he still ran into those gaps in his thought and  cowardlike  he avoided them  denied their existence .   he found a small room devoted to fire fighting equipment  emergency medical and surgical supplies  and welding equipment .   he said with a certain lack of confidence     they won   t be in here  except in emergencies .  are you afraid  lona .         i won   t be afraid with you  rik     she said humbly .  two days before  no  twelve hours before  it had been the other way around .  but on board ship  by some transmutation of personality she did not question  it was rik who was the adult  she who was the child .   he said     we won   t be able to use lights because they would notice the power drain  and to use the toilets  we   ll have to wait for rest periods and try to get out past any of the night crew .      the draft cut off suddenly .  its cold touch on their faces was no longer there and the soft  steady humming sound  that had distantly accompanied it  stopped and left a large silence to fill its place .   rik said     they   ll be boarding soon  and then we   ll be out in space .      valona had never seen such joy in rik   s face .  he was a lover going to meet his love .     if rik had felt a man on awaking that dawn  he was a giant now  his arms stretching the length of the galaxy .  the stars were his marbles  and the nebulae were cobwebs to brush away .   he was on a ship .  memories rushed back continuously in a long flood and others left to make room .  he was forgetting the kyrt fields and the mill and valona crooning to him in the dark .  they were only momentary breaks in a pattern that was now returning with its raveled ends slowly knitting .   it was the ship .   if they had put him on a ship long ago  he wouldn   t have had to wait so long for his burnt out brain cells to heal themselves .   he spoke softly to valona in the darkness .     now don   t worry .  you   ll feel a vibration and hear a noise but that will be just the motors .  there   ll be a heavy weight on you .  that   s acceleration .      there was no common florinian word for the concept and he used another word for it  one that came easily to mind .  valona did not understand .   she said     will it hurt .      he said     it will be very uncomfortable  because we don   t have anti acceleration gear to take up the pressure  but it won   t last .  just stand against this wall  and when you feel yourself being pushed against it  relax .  see  it   s beginning .      he had picked the right wall  and as the thrumming of the thrusting hyperatomics swelled  the apparent gravity shifted  and what had been a vertical wall seemed to grow more and more diagonal .   valona whimpered once  then lapsed into a hard breathing silence .  their throats rasped as their chest walls  unprotected by straps and hydraulic absorbers  labored to free their lungs sufficiently for just a little air intake .   rik managed to pant out words  any words that might let valona know he was there and ease the terrible fear of the unknown that he knew must be filling her .  it was only a ship  only a wonderful ship  but she had never been on a ship before .   he said     there   s the jump  of course  when we go through hyperspace and cut across most of the distance between the stars all at once .  that won   t bother you at all .  you won   t even know it happened .  it   s nothing compared to this .  just a little twitch in your insides and it   s over .     he got the words out syllable by grunted syllable .  it took a long time .   slowly  the weight on their chests lifted and the invisible chain holding them to the wall stretched and dropped off .  they fell  panting  to the floor .   finally valona said     are you hurt  rik .         i  hurt .     he managed a laugh .  he had not caught his breath yet  but he laughed at the thought that he could be hurt on a ship .   he said     i lived on a ship for years once .  i didn   t land on a planet for months at a time .         why .     she asked .  she had crawled closer and put a hand to his cheek  making sure he was there .   he put his arm about her shoulder  and she rested within it quietly  accepting the reversal .      why .     she asked .   rik could not remember why .  he had done it  he had hated to land on a planet .  for some reason it had been necessary to stay in space  but he could not remember why .  again he dodged the gap .   he said     i had a job .         yes     she said .     you analyzed nothing .         that   s right .     he was pleased .     that   s exactly what i did .  do you know what that means .       no .    he didn   t expect her to understand  but he had to talk .  he had to revel in memory  to delight drunkenly in the fact that he could call up past facts at the flick of a mental finger .   he said     you see  all the material in the universe is made up of a hundred different kinds of substances .  we call those substances elements .  iron and copper are elements .         i thought they were metals .         so they are  and elements too .  also oxygen  and nitrogen  carbon and palladium .  most important of all  hydrogen and helium .  they   re the simplest and most common .         i never heard of those     valona said wistfully .      ninety five per cent of the universe is hydrogen and most of the rest is helium .  even space .         i was once told     said valona     that space was a vacuum .  they said that meant there was nothing there .  was that wrong .         not quite .  there   s almost nothing there .  but you see  i was a spatio analyst  which meant that i went about through space collecting the extremely small amounts of elements there and analyzing them .  that is  i decided how much was hydrogen  how much helium and how much other elements .         why .         well  that   s complicated .  you see  the arrangement of elements isn   t the same everywhere in space .  in some regions there is a little more helium than normal  in other places  more sodium than normal  and so on .  these regions of special analytic makeup wind through space like currents .  that   s what they call them .  they   re the currents of space .  it   s important to know how these currents are arranged because that might explain how the universe was created and how it developed .         how would it explain that .      rik hesitated .     nobody knows exactly .      he hurried on  embarrassed that this immense store of knowledge in which his mind was thankfully wallowing could come so easily to an end marked    unknown    under the questioning of  .   .   .  of  .   .   .  it suddenly occurred to him that valona  after all  was nothing but a florinian peasant girl .   he said     then  again  we find out the density  you know  the thickness  of this space gas in all regions of the galaxy .  it   s different in different places and we have to know exactly what it is in order to allow ships to calculate exactly how to jump through hyperspace .  it   s like .   .   .     his voice died away .   valona stiffened and waited uneasily for him to continue  but only silence followed .  her voice sounded hoarsely in the complete darkness .      rik .  what   s wrong  rik .      still silence .  her hands groped to his shoulders  shaking him .     rik .  rik .      and it was the voice of the old rik  somehow  that answered .  it was weak  frightened  its joy and confidence vanished .      lona .  we did something wrong .         what   s the matter .  we did what wrong .      the memory of the scene in which the patroller had shot down the baker was in his mind  etched hard and clear  as though called back by his exact memory of so many other things .   he said     we shouldn   t have run away .  we shouldn   t be here on this ship .      he was shivering uncontrollably  and valona tried futilely to wipe the moisture from his forehead with her hand .      why .     she demanded .     why .         because we should have known that if the baker were willing to take us out in daylight he expected no trouble from patrollers .  do you remember the patroller .  the one who shot the baker .         yes .         do you remember his face .         i didn   t dare look .         i did  and there was something queer  but i didn   t think .  i didn   t think .  lona  that wasn   t a patroller .  it was the townman  lona .  it was the townman dressed like a patroller .          eight  the lady      samia of fife was five feet tall  exactly  and all sixty inches of her were in a state of quivering exasperation .  she weighed one and a half pounds per inch and  at the moment  each of her ninety pounds represented sixteen ounces of solid anger .   she stepped quickly from end to end of the room  her dark hair piled in high masses  her spiked heels lending a spurious height and her narrow chin  with its pronounced cleft  trembling .   she said     oh no .  he wouldn   t do it to me .  he couldn   t do it to me .  captain .      her voice was sharp and carried the weight of authority .  captain racety bowed with the storm .     my lady .      to any florinian  of course  captain racety would have been a    squire .     simply that .  to any florinian  all sarkites were squires .  but to the sarkites there were squires and real squires .  the captain was simply a squire .  samia of fife was a real squire  or the feminine equivalent of one  which amounted to the same thing .      my lady .     he asked .   she said     i am not to be ordered about .  i am of age .  i am my own mistress .  i choose to remain here .      the captain said carefully     please to understand  my lady  that no orders of mine are involved .  my advice was not asked .  i have been told plainly and flatly what i am to do .      he fumbled for the copy of his orders halfheartedly .  he had tried to present her with the evidence twice before and she had refused to consider it  as though by not looking she could continue  with a clear conscience  to deny where his duty lay .   she said once again  exactly as before     i am not interested in your orders .      she turned away with a ringing of her heels and moved rapidly away from him .   he followed and said softly     the orders include directions to the effect that  if you are not willing to come  i am  if you will excuse my saying so  to have you carried to the ship .      she whirled .     you wouldn   t dare do such a thing .         when i consider     said the captain     who it is who has ordered me to do it  i would dare anything .      she tried cajolery .     surely  captain  there is no real danger .  this is quite ridiculous  entirely mad .  the city is peaceful .  all that has happened is that one patroller was knocked down yesterday afternoon in the library .  really .         another patroller was killed this dawn  again by florinian attack .      that rocked her  but her olive skin grew dusky and her black eyes flashed .     what has that to do with me .  i am not a patroller .         my lady  the ship is being prepared right now .  it will leave shortly .  you will have to be on it .         and my work .  my research .  do you realize   .  no  you wouldn   t realize .      the captain said nothing .  she had turned from him .  her gleaming dress of copper kyrt  with its strands of milky silver  set off the extraordinary warm smoothness of her shoulders and upper arms .  captain racety looked at her with something more than the bald courtesy and humble objectivity a mere sarkite owed such a great lady .  he wondered why such an entirely desirable bite size morsel should choose to spend her time in mimicking the scholarly pursuits of a university don .     samia knew well that her earnest scholarship made her an object of mild derision to people who were accustomed to thinking of the aristocratic ladies of sark as devoted entirely to the glitter of polite society and  eventually  acting as incubators for at least  but not more than  two future squires of sark .  she didn   t care .   they would come to her and say     are you really writing a book  samia .     and ask to see it  and giggle .   those were the women .  the men were even worse  with their gentle condescension and obvious conviction that it would only take a glance from themselves or a man   s arm about her waist to cure her of her nonsense and turn her mind to things of real importance .   it had begun as far back  almost  as she could remember  because she had always been in love with kyrt  whereas most people took it for granted .  kyrt .  the king  emperor  god of fabrics .  there was no metaphor strong enough .   chemically  it was nothing more than a variety of cellulose .  the chemists swore to that .  yet with all their instruments and theories they had never yet explained why on florina  and only on florina in all the galaxy  cellulose became kyrt .  it was a matter of the physical state  that   s what they said .  but ask them exactly in what way the physical state varied from that of ordinary cellulose and they were mute .   she had learned ignorance originally from her nurse .      why does it shine  nanny .         because it   s kyrt  miakins .         why don   t other things shine so  nanny .         other things aren   t kyrt  miakins .      there you had it .  a two volume monograph on the subject had been written only three years before .  she had read it carefully and it could all have been boiled down to her nanny   s explanation .  kyrt was kyrt because it was kyrt .  things that weren   t kyrt  weren   t kyrt because they weren   t kyrt .   of course kyrt didn   t really shine of itself but  properly spun  it would gleam metallically in the sun in a variety of colors or in all colors at once .  another form of treatment could impart a diamond sparkle of the thread .  it could be made  with little effort  completely impervious to heat up to     degrees centigrade  and quite inert to almost all chemicals .  its fibers could be spun finer than the most delicate synthetics and those same fibers had a tensile strength no steel alloy known could duplicate .   it had more uses  more versatility than any substance known to man .  if it were not so expensive it could be used to replace glass  metal  or plastic in any of infinite industrial applications .  as it was  it was the only material used for cross hairs on optical equipment  as molds in the casting of hydrochrons used in hyperatomic motors  and as lightweight  long lived webbing where metal was too brittle or too heavy or both .   but this was  as said  small scale use  since use in quantity was prohibitive .  actually the kyrt harvest of florina went into the manufacture of cloth that was used for the most fabulous garments in galactic history .  florina clothed the aristocracy of a million worlds  and the kyrt harvest of the one world  florina  had to be spread thin for that .  twenty women on a world might have outfits in kyrt  two thousand more might have a holiday jacket of the material  or perhaps a pair of gloves .  twenty million more watched from a distance and wished .   the million worlds of the galaxy shared a slang expression for the snob .  it was the only idiom in the language that was easily and exactly understood everywhere .  it went     you   d think she blew her nose in kyrt .      when samia was older she went to her father .      what is kyrt  daddy .         it   s your bread and butter  mia .         mine .         not just yours  mia .  it   s s ark   s bread and butter .      of course .  she learned the reason for that easily enough .  not a world in the galaxy but had tried to grow kyrt on its own soil .  at first sark had applied the death penalty to anyone  native or foreign  caught smuggling kyrt seed out of the planet .  that had not prevented successful smuggling  and as the centuries passed  and the truth dawned on sark  that law had been abolished .  men from anywhere were welcome to kyrt seed at the price  of course  weight for weight   of finished kyrt cloth .   they might have it  because it turned out that kyrt grown anywhere in the galaxy but on florina was simply cellulose .  white  flat  weak and useless .  not even honest cotton .   was it something in the soil .  something in the characteristics of the radiation of florina   s sun .  something about the bacteria make up of florinian life .  it had all been tried .  samples of florinian soil had been taken .  artificial arc lights duplicating the known spectrum of florina   s sun had been constructed .  foreign soil had been infected with florinian bacteria .  and always the kyrt grew white  flat  weak and useless .   there was so much to be said about kyrt that had never been said .  material other than that contained in technical reports or in research papers or even in travel books .  for five years samia had been dreaming of writing a real book about the story of kyrt  of the land it grew on and of the people who grew it .   it was a dream surrounded by mocking laughter  but she held to it .  she had insisted on traveling to florina .  she was going to spend a season in the fields and a few months in the mills .  she was going to    but what did it matter what she was going to do .  she was being ordered back .   with the sudden impulsiveness that marked her every act she made her decision .  she would be able to fight this on sark .  grimly she promised herself she would be back on florina in a week .   she turned to the captain and said coolly     when do we leave  sir .      samia remained at the observation port for as long as florina was a visible globe .  it was a green  springlike world  much pleasanter than sark in climate .  she had looked forward to studying the natives .  she didn   t like the florinians on sark  sapless men who dared not look at her but turned away when she passed  in accordance with the law .  on their own world  however  the natives  by universal report  were happy and carefree .  irresponsible  of course  and like children  but they had charm .   captain racety interrupted her thoughts .  he said     my lady  would you retire to your room .      she looked up  a tiny vertical crease between her eyes .     what new orders have you received  captain .  ann i a prisoner .         of course not .  merely a precaution .  the space field was unusually empty before the take off .  it seems that another killing had taken place  again by a florinian  and the field   s patroller contingent had joined the rest on a man hunt through the city .         and the connection of that with myself .         it is only that under the circumstances  which i ought to have reacted to by placing a guard of my own  i do not minimize my own offense   unauthorized persons may have boarded the ship .         for what reason .         i could not say  but scarcely to do our pleasure .         you are romancing  captain .         i am afraid not  my lady .  our energometrics were  of course  useless within planetary distance of florina   s sun  but that is not the case now and i am afraid there is definite excess heat radiation from emergency stores .         are you serious .      the captain   s lean  expressionless face regarded her aloofly for a moment .  he said     the radiation is equivalent to that which would be given off by two ordinary people .         or a heating unit someone forgot to turn off .         there is no drain on our power supply  my lady .  we are ready to investigate  my lady  and ask only that you first retire to your room .      she nodded silently and left the room .  two minutes later his calm voice spoke unhurriedly into the communi tube .     break into emergency stores .        myrlyn terens  had he released his taut nerves the slightest  might easily  and even thankfully  have gone into hysteria .  he had been a trifle too late in returning to the bakery .  they had already left it and it was only by good fortune that he met them in the street .  his next action had been dictated  it was in no way a matter of free choice  and the baker lay quite horribly dead before him .   afterward  with the crowd swirling  rik and valona melting into the crowd  and the air cars of the patrollers  the real patrollers  beginning to put in their vulture appearance  what could he do .   his first impulse to race after rik he quickly fought down .  it would do no good .  he would never find them  and there was too great a chance that the patrollers would not miss him .  he scurried in another direction  toward the bakery .   his only chance lay in the patroller organization itself .  there had been generations of a quiet life .  at least there had been no florinian revolts to speak of in two centuries .  the institution of the townman  he grinned savagely at the thought  had worked wonders and the patrollers had only perfunctory police duties since .  they lacked the fine pointed teamwork that would have developed under more strenuous conditions .   it had been possible for him to walk into a patroller station at dawn  where his description must have already been sent  though obviously it had not been much regarded .  the lone patroller on duty was a mixture of indifference and sulkiness .  terens had been asked to state his business  but his business included a plastic two by four he had wrenched from the side of a crazy hovel at the outskirts of town .   he had brought it down upon the patroller   s skull  changed clothing and weapons .  the list of his crimes was already so formidable that it did not bother him in the least to discover that the patroller had been killed  not stunned .   yet he was still at large and the rusty machinery of patroller justice had so far creaked after him in vain .   he was at the bakery .  the baker   s elderly helper  standing in the doorway in a vain attempt to peer knowledge of the disturbance into himself  squeaked thinly at the sight of the dread black and silver of patrollerhood and oozed back into his shop .   the townman lunged after him  crumpling the man   s loose  floury collar into his pudgy fist and twisting .     where was the baker going .      the old man   s lips yawned open  but no sound came .   the townman said     i killed a man two minutes ago .  i don   t care if i kill another .         please .  please .  i do not know  sir .         you will die for not knowing .         but he did not tell me .  he made some sort of reservations .         you have overheard so much  have you .  what else did you overhear .         he mentioned wotex once .  i think the reservations were on a spaceship .      terens thrust him away .   he would have to wait .  he would have to let the worst of the excitement outside die .  he would have to risk the arrival of real patrollers at the bakery .   but not for long .  not for long .  he could guess what his erstwhile companions would do .  rik was unpredictable  of course  but valona was an intelligent girl .  from the way they ran  they must have taken him for a patroller indeed and valona was sure to decide that their only safety lay in continuing the flight that the baker had begun for them .   the baker had made reservations for them .  a spaceship would be waiting .  they would be there .   and he would have to be there first .   there was this about the desperation of the situation .  nothing more mattered .  if he lost rik  if he lost that potential weapon against the tyrants of sark  his life was a small additional loss .   so when he left  it was without a qualm  though it was broad daylight  though the patrollers must know by now it was a man in patroller uniform they sought  and though two air cars were in easy sight .     terens knew the spaceport that would be involved .  there was only one of its type on the planet .  there were a dozen tiny ones in upper city for the private use of space yachts and there were hundreds all over the planet for the exclusive use of the ungainly freighters that carried gigantic bolts of kyrt cloth to sark  and machinery and simple consumer goods back .  but among all those there was only one spaceport for the use of ordinary travelers  for the poorer sarkites  florinian civil servants and the few foreigners who managed to obtain permission to visit florina .   the florinian at the port   s entry gate observed terens    approach with every symptom of lively interest .  the vacuum that surrounded him had grown insupportable .      greetings  sir     he said .  there was a slyly eager tone in his voice .  after all  patrollers were being killed .     considerable excitement in the city  isn   t there .      terens did not rise to the bait .  he had drawn the arced visor of his hat low and buttoned the uppermost button of the tunic .   gruffly he snapped     did two persons  a man and a woman  enter the port recently en route to wotex .      the gatekeeper looked startled .  for a moment he gulped and then  in a considerably subdued tone  said     yes  officer .  about half an hour ago .  maybe less .     he reddened suddenly .     is there any connection between them and  officer  they had reservations which were entirely in order .  i wouldn   t let foreigners through without proper authority .      terens ignored that .  proper authority .  the baker had managed to establish that in the course of a night .  galaxy  he wondered  how deeply into the sarkite administration did the trantorian espionage organization go .      what names did they give .         gareth and hansa barne .         has their ship left .  quickly .         no no  sir .         what berth .         seventeen .      terens forced himself to refrain from running  but his walk was little short of that .  had there been a real patroller in sight that rapid  undignified half run of his would have been his last trip in freedom .   a spaceman in officer   s uniform stood at the ship   s main air lock .   terens panted a little .  he said     have gareth and hansa barne boarded ship .         no  they haven   t     said the spaceman phlegmatically .  he was a sarkite and a patroller was only another man in uniform to him .     do you have a message for them .      with cracking patience terens said     they haven   t boarded .         that   s what i   ve said .  and we   re not waiting for them .  we leave on schedule  with or without them .      terens turned away .   he was at the gatekeeper   s booth again .     have they left .         left .  who  sir .         the barnes .  the ones for wotex .  they   re not on board ship .  did they leave .         no  sir .  not to my knowledge .         what about the other gates .         they   re not exits  sir .  this is the only exit .         check them  you miserable idiot .      the gatekeeper lifted the communi tube in a state of panic .  no patroller had ever spoken to him so in anger and he dreaded the results .  in two minutes he put it down .   he said     no one has left  sir .      terens stared at him .  under his black hat his sandy hair was damping against his skull and down each cheek there was the gleaming mark of perspiration .   he said     has any ship left the port since they entered .      the gatekeeper consulted the schedule .     one     he said     the liner endeavor .      volubly he went on  eager to gain favor with the angry patroller by volunteering information .     the endeavor is making a special trip to sark to carry the lady samia of fife back from florina .      he did not bother to describe exactly by what refined manner of eavesdropping he had managed to acquaint himself with the    confidential report .      but to terens now  nothing mattered .   he backed slowly away .  eliminate the impossible and whatever remained  however improbable  was the truth .  rik and valona had entered the spaceport .  they had not been captured or the gatekeeper would certainly have known about it .  they were not simply wandering about the port  or they would by now have been captured .  they were not on the ship for which they had tickets .  they had not left the field .  the only object that had left the field was the endeavor .  therefore  on it  possibly as captives  possibly as stowaways  were rik and valona .   and the two were equivalent .  if they were stowaways they would soon be captives .  only a florinian peasant girl and a mindwrecked creature would fail to realize that one could not stow away on a modern spaceship .   and of all spaceships to choose  they chose that which carried the daughter of the squire of fife .   the squire of fife .       nine  the squire      the squire of fife was the most important individual on sark and for that reason did not like to be seen standing .  like his daughter  he was short  but unlike her  he was not perfectly proportioned  since most of the shortness lay in his legs .  his torso was even beefy  and his head was undoubtedly majestic  but his body was fixed upon stubby legs that were forced into a ponderous waddle to carry their load .   so he sat behind a desk and except for his daughter and personal servants and  when she had been alive  his wife  none saw him in any other position .   there he looked the man he was .  his large head  with its wide  nearly lipless mouth  broad  large nostriled nose  and pointed  cleft chin  could look benign and inflexible in turn  with equal ease .  his hair  brushed rigidly back and  in careless disregard for fashion  falling nearly to his shoulders  was blue black  untouched by gray .  a shadowy blue marked the regions of his cheeks  lips and chin where his florinian barber twice daily battled the stubborn growth of facial hair .   the squire was posing and he knew it .  he had schooled expression out of his face and allowed his hands  broad  strong and short fingered  to remain loosely clasped on a desk whose smooth  polished surface was completely bare .  there wasn   t a paper on it  no communi tube  no ornament .  by its very simplicity the squire   s own presence was emphasized .   he spoke to his pale  fish white secretary with the special lifeless tone he reserved for mechanical appliances and florinian civil servants .     i presume all have accepted .      he had no real doubt as to the answer .   his secretary replied in a tone as lifeless     the squire of bort stated that the press of previous business arrangements prevented his attending earlier than three .         and you told him .         i stated that the nature of the present business made any delay inadvisable .         the result .         he will be here  sir .  the rest have agreed without reservation .      fife smiled .  half an hour this way or that would have made no difference .  there was a new principle involved  that was all .  the great squires were too touchy with regard to their own independence  and such touchiness would have to go .   he was waiting  now .  the room was large  the places for the others were prepared .  the large chronometer  whose tiny powering spark of radioactivity had not failed or faltered in a thousand years  said two twenty one .   what an explosion in the last two days .  the old chronometer might yet witness events equal to any in the past .   yet that chronometer had seen many in its millennium .  when it counted its first minutes sark had been a new world of hand hewn cities with doubtful contacts among the other  older worlds .  the timepiece had been in the wall of an old brick building then  the very bricks of which had since become dust .  it had counted its even tenor through three short lived sarkite    empires    when the undisciplined soldiers of sark managed to govern  for a longer or shorter interval  some half a dozen surrounding worlds .  its radioactive atoms had exploded in strict statistical sequence through two periods when the fleets of neighboring worlds dictated policy on sark .   five hundred years ago it had marked cool time as sark discovered that the world nearest to it  florina  had a treasure in its soil past counting .  it had moved evenly through two victorious wars and recorded solemnly the establishment of a conqueror   s peace .  sark had abandoned its empires  absorbed florina tightly  and become powerful in a way that trantor itself could not duplicate .   trantor wanted florina and other powers had wanted it .  the centuries had marked florina as a world for which hands stretched out through space  groping and reaching eagerly .  but it was sark whose hand clasped it and sark  sooner than release that grasp  would allow galactic war .   trantor knew that .  trantor knew that .   it was as though the silent rhythm of the chronometer set up the little singsong in the squire   s brain .   it was two twenty three .     nearly a year before  the five great squires of sark had met .  then  as now  it had been here  in his own hall .  then  as now  the squires  scattered over the face of the planet  each on his own continent  had met in trimensic personification .   in a bald sense  it amounted to three dimensional television in life size with sound and color .  the duplicate could he found in any moderately well to do private home on sark .  where it went beyond the ordinary was in the lack of any visible receiver .  except for fife  the squires present were present in every possible way but reality .  the wall could not be seen behind them  they did not shimmer  yet a hand could have been passed through their bodies .   the true body of the squire of rune was sitting in the antipodes  his continent the only one upon which  at the moment  night prevailed .  the cubic area immediately surrounding his image in fife   s office had the cold  white gleam of artificial light  dimmed by the brighter daylight about it .   gathered in the one room  in body or in image  was sark itself .  it was a queer and not altogether heroic personification of the planet .  rune was bald and pinkly fat  while balle was gray and dryly wrinkled .  steen was powdered and rouged  wearing the desperate smile of a worn out man pretending to a life force he no longer had  and bort carried indifference to creature comforts to the unpleasant point of a two day growth of beard and dirty fingernails .   yet they were the five great squires .   they were the topmost of the three rungs of ruling powers on sark .  the lowest rung was  of course  the florinian civil service  which remained steady through all the vicissitudes that marked the rise and fall of the individual noble houses of sark .  it was they who actually greased the axles and turned the wheels of government .  above them were the ministers and department heads appointed by the hereditary  and harmless  chief of state .  their names and that of the chief himself were needed on state papers to make them legally binding  but their only duties consisted of signing their names .   the highest rung was occupied by these five  each tacitly allowed a continent by the remaining four .  they were the heads of the families that controlled the major volume of the kyrt trade  and the revenues therefrom derived .  it was money that gave power and eventually dictated policy on sark  and these had it .  and of the five  it was fife who had the most .   the squire of fife had faced them that day  nearly a year ago  and said to the other masters of the galaxy   s second richest single planet  second richest after trantor  which  after all  had half a million worlds to draw upon  rather than two       i have received a curious message .      they said nothing .  they waited .   fife handed a slip of metallite film to his secretary  who stepped from one seated figure to another  holding it well up for each to see  lingering just long enough for each to read .   to each of the four who attended the conference in fife   s office  he  himself  was real  and the others  including fife  only shadows .  the metallite film was a shadow as well .  they could only sit and observe the light rays that focused across vast world sectors from the continent of fife to those of balle  bort  steen  and the island continent of rune .  the words they read were shadows on shadow .   only bort  direct and ungiven to subtleties  forgot that fact and reached for the message .   his hand extended to the edge of the rectangular image receptor and was cut off .  his arm ended in a featureless stump .  in his own chambers  fife knew  bores arm had succeeded merely in closing upon nothingness and passing through the filmed message .  he smiled  and so did the others .  steen giggled .   bort reddened .  he drew back his arm and his hand reappeared .   fife said     well  you have each seen it .  if you don   t mind  i will now read it aloud so that you may consider its significance .      he reached upward  and his secretary  by hastening his steps  managed to hold the film in the proper position for fife   s grasp to close upon it without an instant   s groping .   fife read mellowly  imparting drama to the words as though the message were his own and he enjoyed delivering it .   he said     this is the message     you are a great squire of sark and there is none to compete with you in power and wealth .  yet that power and wealth rest on a slender foundation .  you may think that a planetary supply of kyrt  such as exists on florina  is by no means a slender foundation  but ask yourself  how long will florina exist .  forever .       no .  florina may be destroyed tomorrow .  it may exist for a thousand years .  of the two  it is more likely to be destroyed tomorrow .  not by myself  to be sure  but in a way you cannot predict or foresee .  consider that destruction .  consider  too  that your power and wealth are already gone  for i demand the greater part of them .  you will have time to consider  but not too much time .       attempt to take too much time and i shall announce to all the galaxy and particularly to florina the truth about the waiting destruction .  after that there will be no more kyrt  no more wealth  no more power .  none for me  but then i am used to that .  none for you  and that would be extremely serious  since you were born to great wealth .       turn over most of your estates to myself in the amount and in the manner which i shall dictate in the near future and you will remain in secure possession of what remains .  not a great deal will be left you by your present standards  to be sure  but it will be more than the nothing that will otherwise be left you .  do not sneer at the fragment you will retain  either .  florina may last your lifetime and you will live  if not lavishly  at least comfortably .      fife had finished .  he turned the film over and over in his hand  then folded it gently into a silvery translucent cylinder through which the stenciled letters merged into a reddish blur .   he said in his natural voice     it is an amusing letter .  there is no signature and the tone of the letter  as you heard  is stilted and pompous .  what do you think of it  squires .      rune   s ruddy face was set in displeasure .  he said     it   s obviously the work of a man not far removed from the psychotic .  he writes like a historical novel .  frankly  fife  i don   t see that such rubbish is a decent excuse to disrupt our traditions of continental autonomy by calling us together .  and i don   t like all this going on in the presence of your secretary .         my secretary .  because he is a florinian .  are you afraid his mind will be unsettled by such things as this letter .  nonsense .     his tone shifted from one of mild amusement to the unmodulated syllables of command .     turn to the squire of rune .      the secretary did so .  his eyes were discreetly lowered and his white face was uncreased by lines and unmarred by expression .  it almost seemed untouched by life .      this florinian     said fife  careless of the man   s presence     is my personal servant .  he is never away from me  never with others of his kind .  but it is not for that reason that he is absolutely trustworthy .  look at him .  look at his eyes .  isn   t it obvious to you that he has been under the psychic probe .  he is incapable of any thought which is disloyal to myself in the slightest degree .  with no offense intended  i can say that i would sooner trust him than any of you .      bort chuckled .     i don   t blame you .  none of us owes you the loyalty of a probed florinian servant .      steen giggled again and writhed in his seat as though it were growing gently warm .   not one of them made any comment on fife   s use of a psychic probe for personal servants .  fife would have been tremendously astonished had they done so .  the use of the psychic probe for any reason other than the correction of mental disorders or the removal of criminal impulses was forbidden .  strictly speaking  it was forbidden even to the great squires .   yet fife probed whenever he felt it necessary  particularly when the subject was a florinian .  the probing of a sarkite was a much more delicate matter .  the squire of steen  whose writhings at the mention of the probing fife did not miss  was well reputed to make use of probed florinians of both sexes for purposes far removed from the secretarial .      now .     fife put his blunt fingers together .     i did not bring you all together for the reading of a crackpot letter .  that  i hope  is understood .  actually i am afraid we have an important problem on our hands .  first of all  i ask myself  why bother only with me .  to be sure  i am the wealthiest of the squires  but alone  i control only a third of the kyrt trade .  together the five of us control it all .  it is easy to make five cello copies of a letter  as easy as it is to make one .         you use too many words     muttered bort .     what do you want .      balle   s withered and colorless lips moved in a dull gray face .     he wants to know  my lord of bort  if we have received copies of this letter .         then let him say so .         i thought i was saying so     said fife evenly .     well .      they looked at one another  doubtfully or defiantly  as the personality of each dictated .   rune spoke first .  his pink forehead was moist with discrete drops of perspiration and he lifted a soft square of kyrt to mop the dampness out of the creases between the folds of fat that ran semicircles from ear to ear .   he said     i wouldn   t know  fife .  i can ask my secretaries  who are all sarkites  by the way .  after all  even if such a letter had reached my office  it would have been considered a  what is it we say .   a crank letter .  it would never have come to me .  that   s certain .  it   s only your own peculiar secretarial system that kept you from being spared this trash yourself .      he looked about and smiled  his gums gleaming wetly between his lips above and below artificial teeth of chrome steel .  each individual tooth was buried deeply  knit to the jawbone  and stronger than any tooth of mere enamel could ever be .  his smile was more frightening than his frown could possibly be .   balle shrugged .     i imagine that what rune has just said can hold for all of us .      steen tittered .     i never read mail .  really  i never do .  it   s such a bore  and such loads come in that i just wouldn   t have any time .     he looked about him earnestly  as though it were really necessary to convince the company of this important fact .   bort said     nuts .  what   s wrong with you all .  afraid of fife .  look here  fife  i don   t keep any secretary because i don   t need anyone between myself and my business .  i got a copy of that letter and i   m sure these three did too .  want to know what i did with mine .  i threw it into the disposal chute .  i   d advise you to do the same with yours .  let   s stop this .  i   m tired .      his hand reached upward for the toggle switch that would cut contact and release his image from its presence in fife .      wait  bort .     fife   s voice rang out harshly .     don   t do that .  i   m not done .  you wouldn   t want us to take measures and come to decisions in your absence .  surely you wouldn   t .         let us linger  squire bort     urged rune in his softer tones  though his little fat buried eyes were not particularly amiable .     i wonder why squire fife seems to worry so about a trifle .         well     said balle  his dry voice scratching at their ears     perhaps fife thinks our letter writing friend has information about a trantorian attack on florina .         pooh     said fife with scorn .     how would he know  whoever he is .  our secret service is adequate  i assure you .  and how would he stop the attack if he received our properties as bribe .  no  no .  he speaks of the destruction of flora as though he meant physical destruction and not political destruction .         it   s just too insane     said steen .      yes .     said fife .     then you don   t see the significance of the events of the last two weeks .         which particular events .     asked bort .      it seems a spatio analyst has disappeared .  surely you   ve heard of that .      bort looked annoyed and in no way soothed .     i   ve heard from abel of trantor about it .  what of it .  i know nothing of spatio analysts .         at least you   ve read a copy of the last message to his base on sank before he turned up missing .         abel showed it to me .  i paid no attention to it .         what about the rest of you .     fife   s eyes challenged them one by one .     your memory goes back a week .         i read it     said rune .     i remember it too .  of course .  it spoke of destruction also .  is that what you   re getting at .         look here     steen said shrilly     it was full of nasty hints that made no sense .  really  i do hope we   re not going to discuss it now .  i could scarcely get rid of abel  and it was just before dinner  too .  most distressing .  really .         there   s no help for it  steen     said fife with more than a trace of impatience .   what could one do with a thing like steen .      we must speak of it again .  the spatio analyst spoke of the destruction of florina .  coincident with his disappearance  we receive messages also threatening the destruction of florina .  is that coincidence .         you are saying that the spatio analyst sent the blackmailing message .     whispered old balle .      not likely .  why say it first in his own name  then anonymously .         when he spoke of it at first     said balle     he was communicating with his district office  not with us .         even so .  a blackmailer deals with no one but his victim if he can help it .         well then .         he has disappeared .  call the spatio analyst honest .  but he broadcast dangerous information .  he is now in the hands of others who are not honest and they are blackmailers .         what others .      fife sat grimly back in his chair  his lips scarcely moving .     you ask me seriously .  trantor .      steen shivered .     trantor .     his high pitched voice broke .      why not .  what better way to gain control of florina .  it   s one of the prime aims of their foreign policy .  and if they can do it without war  so much the better for them .  look here  if we accede to this impossible ultimatum  florina is theirs .  they offer us a little     he brought two fingers close together before his face      but how long shall we keep even that .      on the other hand  suppose we ignore this  and  really  we have no choice .  what would trantor do then .  why  they will spread rumors of an imminent end of the world to the florinian peasants .  as their rumors spread the peasants will panic  and what can follow but disaster .  what force can make a man work if he thinks the end of the world will come tomorrow .  the harvest will rot .  the warehouses will empty .      steen lifted a finger to smooth the coloring on one cheek  as he glanced at a mirror in his own apartments  out of range of the receptor cube .   he said     i don   t think that would harm us much .  if the supply goes down  wouldn   t the price go up .  then after a while it would turn out that florina was still there and the peasants would go back to work .  besides  we could always threaten to clamp down on exports .  really  i don   t see how any cultured world could be expected to live without kyrt .  oh  it   s king kyrt all right .  i think this is a fuss about nothing .      he threw himself into an attitude of boredom  one finger placed delicately upon his cheek .   balle   s old eyes had been closed through all of this last .  he said     there can be no price increases now .  we   ve got them at absolute ceiling height .         exactly     said fife .     it won   t come to serious disruption anyway .  trantor waits for any sign of disorder on florina .  if they could present the galaxy with the prospect of a sark that was unable to guarantee kyrt shipments  it would be the most natural thing in the universe for them to move in to maintain what they call order and to keep the kyrt coming .  and the danger would be that the free worlds of the galaxy would probably play along with them for the sake of the kyrt .  especially if traritor agreed to break the monopoly  increase production and lower prices .  afterward it would be another story  but meanwhile  they would get their support .      it   s the only logical way that trantor could possibly grip florina .  if it were simple force  the free galaxy outside the trantorian sphere of influence would join us in sheer self protection .      rune said     how does the spatio analyst fit in this .  is he necessary .  if your theory is adequate it should explain that .         i think it does .  these spatio analysts are unbalanced for the most part  and this one has developed some     fife   s fingers moved  as though building a vague structure     some crazy theory .  it doesn   t matter what .  trantor can   t let it come out  or the spatio analytic bureau would quash it .  to seize the man and learn the details would  however  give them something that would probably possess a surface validity to non specialists .  they could use it  make it sound real .  the bureau is a trantorian puppet  and their denials  once the story is spread by way of scientific rumormongering  would never be forceful enough to overtake the lie .         it sounds too complicated     said bort .     nuts .  they can   t let it come out  but then again they will let it come out .         they can   t let it come out as a serious scientific announcement  or even reach the bureau as such     said fife patiently .     they can let it leak out as a rumor .  don   t you see that .        what   s old abel doing wasting his time looking for the spatio analyst then .         you expect him to advertise the fact that he   s got him .  what abel does and what abel seems to be doing are two different things .         well     said rune     if you   re right  what are we to do .      fife said     we have learned the danger  and that is the important thing .  we   ll find the spatio analyst if we can .  we must keep all known agents of trantor under strict scrutiny without really interfering with them .  from their actions we may learn the course of coming events .  we must suppress thoroughly any propaganda on florina to the effect of the planet   s destruction .  the first faint whisper must meet with instant counteraction of the most violent sort .      most of all  we must remain united .  that is the whole purpose of this meeting  in my eyes  the forming of a common front .  we all know about continental autonomy and i   m sure there is no one more insistent upon it than i am .  that is  under ordinary circumstances .  these are not ordinary circumstances .  you see that .      more or less reluctantly  for continental autonomy was not a thing to be abandoned lightly  they saw that .      then     said fife     we will wait for the second move .        that had been a year ago .  they had left and there had followed the strangest and most complete fiasco ever to have fallen to the lot of the squire of fife in a moderately long and a more than moderately audacious career .   no second move followed .  there were no further letters to any of them .  the spatio analyst remained unfound  while trantor maintained a desultory search .  there was no trace of apocalyptic rumors on florina  and the harvesting and processing of kyrt continued its smooth pace .   the squire of rune took to calling fife at weekly intervals .      fife     he would call .     anything new .     his fatness would quiver with delight and thick chuckles would force their way out of his gullet .   fife took it bleakly and stolidly .  what could he do .  over and over again he sifted the facts .  it was no use .  something was missing .  some vital factor was missing .   and then it all began exploding at once  and he had the answer .  he knew he had the answer  and it was what he had not expected .   he had called a meeting once again .  the chronometer now said two twenty nine .   they were beginning to appear now .  bort first  lips compressed and a rough hangnailed finger rasping against the grain of his grizzly stubbled cheek .  then steen  his face freshly washed clear of its paint and presenting a pallid  unhealthy appearance .  balle  indifferent and tired  his cheeks sunken  his armchair well cushioned  a glass of warm milk at his side .  lastly rune  two minutes late  wet lipped and sulky  sitting in the night once again .  this time his lights were dimmed to the point where he was a hazy bulk sitting in a cube of shadow which fife   s lights could not have illuminated though they had had the power of sark   s sun .   fife began .     squires .  last year i speculated on a distant and complicated danger .  in so doing i fell into a trap .  the danger exists  but it is not distant .  it is near us  very near .  one of you already knows what i mean .  the others will find out shortly .         what do you mean .     asked bort shortly .      high treason .     shot back fife .       ten  the fugitive      merlyn terens was not a man of action .  he told himself that as an excuse  since now  leaving the spaceport  he found his mind paralyzed .   he had to pick his pace carefully .  not too slowly  or he would seem to be dawdling .  not too quickly  or he would seem to be running .  just briskly  as a patroller would walk  a patroller who was about his business and ready to enter his ground car .   if only he could enter a ground car .  driving one  unfortunately  did not come within the education of a florinian  not even a florinian townman  so he tried to think as he walked and could not .  he needed silence and leisure .   and he felt almost too weak to walk .  he might not be a man of action but he had acted quickly now for a day and a night and part of another day .  it had used up his lifetime   s supply of nerve .   yet he dared not stop .   if it were night he might have had a few hours to think .  but it was early afternoon .   if he could drive a ground car he could put the miles between himself and the city .  just long enough to think a bit before deciding on the next step .  but he had only his legs .   if he could think .  that was it .  if he could think .  if he could suspend all motion  all action .  if he could catch the universe between instants of time  order it to halt  while he thought things through .  there must be some way .   he plunged into the welcome shade of lower city .  he walked stiffly  as he had seen the patrollers walk .  he swung his shock stick in a firm grip .  the streets were bare .  the natives were huddling in their shacks .  so much the better .   the townman chose his house carefully .  it would be best to choose one of the better ones  one with patches of colored plastic briquets and polarized glass in the windows .  the lower orders were sullen .  they had less to lose .  an    upper man    would be falling over himself to help .   he walked up a short path to such a house .  it was set back from the street  another sign of affluence .  he knew he would have no need of pounding the door or breaking it in .  there had been a noticeable movement at one window as he walked up the ramp .   how generations of necessity enabled a florinian to smell the approach of a patroller .   the door would open .   it did open .   a young girl opened it  her eyes white rimmed circles .  she was gawky in a dress whose frills showed a determined effort on the part of her parents to uphold their status as something more that the ordinary run of    florinian trash .     she stood aside to let him pass  her breath coming quickly between parted lips .   the townman motioned to her to shut the door .     is your father here  girl .      she screamed     pa .     then gasped     yes  sir .         pa    was moving in apologetically from another room .  he came slowly .  it was no news to him that a patroller was at the door .  it was simply safer to let a young girl admit him .  she was less apt to be knocked down out of hand than he himself was  if the patroller happened to be angry .      your name .     asked the townman .      jacof  if it please you  sir .      the townman   s uniform had a thin sheeted notebook in one of its pockets .  the townman opened it  studied it briefly  made a crisp check mark and said     jacof .  yes .  i want to see every member of the household .  quickly .      if he could have found room for any emotion but one of hopeless oppression  terens would almost have enjoyed himself .  he was not immune to the seductive pleasures of authority .   they filed in .  a thin woman  worried  a child of about two years wriggling in her arms .  then the girl who had admitted him and a younger brother .      that   s all .         everyone  sir     said jacof humbly .      can i tend the baby .     asked the woman anxiously .     it   s her nap time .  i was putting her to bed .     she held the young child out as though the sight of young innocence might melt a patroller   s heart .   the townman did not look at her .  a patroller  he imagined  would not have  and he was a patroller .  he said     put it down and give it a sugar sucker to keep it quiet .  now  you .  jacof .         yes  sir .         you   re a responsible boy  aren   t you .     a native of whatever age was  of course  a    boy .         yes  sir .     jacof   s eyes brightened and his shoulders lifted a trifle .     i   m a clerk in the food processing center .  i   ve had mathematics  long division .  i can do logarithms .      yes  the townman thought  they   ve shown you how to use a table of logarithms and taught you how to pronounce the word .   he knew the type .  the man would be prouder of his logarithms than a squireling of his yacht .  the polaroid in his windows was the consequence of his logarithms and the tinted briquets advertised his long division .  his contempt for the uneducated native would be equal to that of the average squire for all natives and his hatred would be more intense since he had to live among them and was taken for one of them by his betters .      you believe in the law  don   t you  boy  and in the good squires .     the townman maintained the impressive fiction of consulting his notebook .      my husband is a good man     burst in the woman volubly .     he hasn   t ever been in trouble .  he doesn   t associate with trash .  and i don   t .  no more do the children .  we always       terens waved her down .     yes .  yes .  now look  boy  i want you to sit right here and do what i say .  i want a list of everyone you know about on this block .  names  addresses  what they do  and what kind of boys they are .  especially the last .  if there   s one of these troublemakers  i want to know .  we   re going to clean up .  understand .         yes  sir .  yes  sir .  there   s husting first of all .  he   s down the block a way .  he          not like that  boy .  get him a piece of paper  you .  now you sit there and write it all down .  every bit .  write it slowly because i can   t read native chicken tracks         i have a trained writing hand  sir .         let   s see it  then .      jacof bent to his task  hand moving slowly .  his wife looked over his shoulder .   terens spoke to the girl who had let him in .     go to the window and let me know if any other patrollers come this way .  i   ll want to speak to them  don   t you call them .  just tell me .      and then  finally  he could relax .  he had made a momentarily secure niche for himself in the midst of danger .   except for the noisy sucking of the baby in the corner  there was reasonable silence .  he would be warned of the enemy   s approach in time for a fighting chance at escape .   now he could think .   in the first place  his role as patroller was about over .  there were undoubtedly road blocks at all possible exits from the town  and they knew he could use no means of transportation more complicated than a diamagnetic scooter .  it would not be long before it would dawn on the search rusty patrollers that only by a systematic quartering of the town  block by block and house by house  could they be sure of their man .   when they finally decided that  they would undoubtedly start at the outskirts and work inward .  if so  this house would be among the first to be entered  so his time was particularly limited .   until now  despite its black and silver conspicuousness  the patroller uniform had been useful .  the natives themselves had not questioned it .  they had not stopped to see his pale florinian face  they had not studied his appearance .  the uniform had been enough .   before long the pursuing hounds would find that fact dawning upon them .  it would occur to them to broadcast instructions to all natives to hold any patroller unable to show proper identification  particularly one with a white skin and sandy hair .  temporary identifications would be passed out to all legitimate patrollers .  rewards would be offered .  perhaps only one native in a hundred would be courageous enough to tackle the uniform no matter how patently false the occupant was .  one in a hundred would be enough .   so he would have to stop being a patroller .   that was one thing .  now another .  he would be safe nowhere on florina from now on .  killing a patroller was the ultimate crime and in fifty years  if he could elude capture so long  the chase would remain hot .  so he would have to leave florina .   how .   well  he gave himself one more day of life .  this was a generous estimate .  it assumed the patrollers to be at maximum stupidity and himself in a state of maximum luck .   in one way this was an advantage .  a mere twenty four hours of life was not much to risk .  it meant he could take chances no sane man could possibly take .   he stood up .   jacof looked up from his paper .     i   m not quite done  sir .  i   m writing very carefully .         let me see what you have written .      he looked at the paper handed him and said     it is enough .  if other patrollers should come  don   t waste their time saying that you have already made a list .  they are in a hurry and may have other tasks for you .  just do as they say .  are there any coming now .      the girl at the window said     no  sir .  shall i go out in the street and look .         it   s not necessary .  let   s see now .  where is the nearest elevator .         it   s about a quarter of a mile to the left  sir  as you leave the house .  you can          yes  yes .  let me out .      a squad of patrollers turned into the street just as the door of the elevator ground into place behind the townman .  he could feel his heart pound .  the systematic search was probably starting  and they were at his heels .   a minute later  heartbeat still drumming  he stepped out of the elevator into upper city .  there would be no cover here .  no pillars .  no cementalloy hiding him from above .   he felt like a moving black dot among the glare of the garish buildings .  he felt visible for two miles on every side and for five miles up in the sky .  there seemed to be large arrows pointing to him .   there were no patrollers in view .  the squires who passed looked through him .  if a patroller was an object of fear to a florinian  he was an object of nothing at all to a squire .  if anything would save him  that would .   he had a vague notion of the geography of upper city .  somewhere in this section was city park .  the most logical step would have been to ask directions  the next most logical to enter any moderately tall building and look out from several of the upperstory terraces .  the first alternative was impossible .  no patroller could possibly need directions .  the second was too risky .  inside a building  a patroller would be more conspicuous .  too conspicuous .   he simply struck out in the direction indicated by his memory of the maps of upper city he had seen on occasion .  it served well enough .  it was unmistakably city park that he came across in five minutes    time .   city park was an artificial patch of greenery about one hundred acres in area .  on sark itself  city park had an exaggerated reputation for many things from bucolic peace to nightly orgies .  on florina  those who had vaguely heard of it imagiped it ten to a hundred times its actual size and a hundred to a thousand times its actual luxuriance .   the reality was pleasant enough .  in florina   s mild climate it was green all year round .  it had its patches of lawn  wooded areas and stony grottoes .  it had a little pool with decorative fish in it and a larger pool for children to paddle in .  at night it was aflame with colored illumination till the light rain started .  it was between twilight and the rain that it was most alive .  there was dancing  trimensional shows  and couples losing themselves along the winding walks .   terens had never actually been inside it .  he found its artificiality repellent when he entered the park .  he knew that the soil and rocks he stepped on  the water and trees around him  all rested on a dead flat cementalloy bottom and it annoyed him .  he thought of the kyrt fields  long and level  and the mountain ranges of the south .  he despised the aliens who had to build toys for themselves in the midst of magnificence .   for half an hour terens tramped the walks aimlessly .  what he had to do would have to be done in city park .  even here it might be impossible .  elsewhere it was impossible .   no one saw him .  no one was conscious of him .  he was sure of that .  let them ask the squires and squirettes who passed him     did you see a patroller in the park yesterday .      they could only stare .  they might as well be asked whether they had seen a tree midge skitter across the path .   the park was too tame .  he felt panic begin to grow .  he made his way up a staircase between boulders and began descending into the cuplike hollow circled by small caves designed to shelter couples caught in the nightly rainfall .   more were caught than could be accounted for by chance alone .    and then he saw what he was looking for .   a man .  a squire  rather .  stepping back and forth quickly .  smoking the stub of a cigarette with sharp drags  cramming it into an ash recess  where it lay quietly for a moment  then vanished with a quick flash .  consulting a pendant watch .   there was no one else in the hollow .  it was a place made for the evening and night .   the squire was waiting for someone .  so much was obvious .  terens looked about him .  no one was following him up the stairs .   there might be other stairs .  there were sure to be .  no matter .  he could not let the chance go .   he stepped down toward the squire .  the squire did not see him  of course  until terens said     if you   ll pardon me .      it was respectful enough  but a squire is not accustomed to having a patroller touch the crook of his elbow in however respectful a fashion .      what the hell .     he said .   terens abandoned neither the respect nor the urgency in his tone .   keep him talking .  keep his eyes on yours for just half a minute .   he said     this way  sir .  it is in connection with the city wide search for the native murderer .         what are you talking about .         it will take just a moment .      unobtrusively terens had drawn his neuronic whip .  the squire never saw it .  it buzzed a little and the squire strained into rigor and toppled .   the townman had never raised a hand against a squire before .  he was surprised at how sick and guilty he felt .   there was still no one in sight .  he dragged the wooden body  with its glazed and staring eyes  into the nearest cave .  he dragged it to the cave   s shallow end .   he stripped the squire  yanking clothing off the stiffened arms and legs with difficulty .  he stepped out of his own dusty  sweat stained patroller uniform and climbed into the squire   s underclothing .  for the first time he felt kyrt fabric with some part of himself beside his fingers .   then the rest of the clothing  and the squire   s skullcap .  the last was necessary .  skullcaps were not entirely fashionable among the younger set but some wore them  this squire luckily among them .  to terens it was a necessity as otherwise his light hair would make the masquerade impossible .  he pulled the cap down tightly  covering his ears .   then he did what had to be done .  the killing of a patroller was  he suddenly realized  not the ultimate crime after all .   he adjusted his blaster to maximum dispersion and turned it on the unconscious squire .  in ten seconds only a charred mass was left .  it would delay identification  confuse the pursuers .   he reduced the patroller   s uniform to a powdery white ash with the blaster and clawed out of the heap blackened silver buttons and buckles .  that  too  would make the chase harder .  perhaps he was buying only an additional hour  but that  too  was worth it .   and now he would have to leave without delay .  he paused a moment just outside the mouth of the cave to sniff .  the blaster worked cleanly .  there was only the slightest odor of burned flesh and the light breeze would clear it in a few moments .   he was walking down the steps when a young girl passed him on the way up .  for a moment he dropped his eyes out of habit .  she was a lady .  he lifted them in time to see that she was young and quite good looking  and in a hurry .   his jaws set .  she wouldn   t find him  of course .  but she was late  or he wouldn   t have been staring at his watch so .  she might think he had grown tired of waiting and had left .  he walked a trifle faster .  he didn   t want her returning  pursuing him breathlessly  asking if he had seen a young man .   he left the park  walking aimlessly .  another half hour passed .   what now .  he was no longer a patroller  he was a squire .   but what now .       he stopped at a small square in which a fountain was centered in a plot of lawn .  to the water a small quantity of detergent had been added so that it frothed and foamed in gaudy iridescence .   he leaned against the railing  back to the western sun  and  bit by bit  slowly  he dropped blackened silver into the fountain .   he thought of the girl who had passed him on the steps as he did so .  she had been very young .  then he thought of lower city and the momentary spasm of remorse left him .   the silver remnants were gone and his hands were empty .  slowly he began searching his pockets  doing his best to make it seem casual .   the contents of the pockets were not particularly unusual .  a booklet of key slivers  a few coins  an identification card .   holy sark .  even the squires carried them .  but then  they didn   t have to produce them for every patroller that came along .    his new name  apparently  was aistare deamone .  he hoped he wouldn   t have to use it .  there were only ten thousand men  women and children in upper city .  the chance of his meeting one among them who knew deamone personally was not large  but it wasn   t insignificant either .   he was twenty nine .  again he felt a rising nausea as he thought of what he had left in the cave  and fought it .  a squire was a squire .  how many twenty nine year old florinians had been done to death at their hands or by their directions .  how many nine year old florinians .   he had an address  too  but it meant nothing to him .  his knowledge of upper city geography was rudimentary .   say .   a color portrait of a young boy  perhaps three  in pseudotrimension .  the colors flashed as he drew it out of its container  faded progressively as he returned it .  a young son .  a nephew .  there had been the girl in the park so it couldn   t be a son  could it .   or was he married .  was the meeting one of those they called    clandestine .     would such a meeting take place in daylight .  why not  under certain circumstances .   terens hoped so .  if the girl were meeting a married man she would not quickly report his absence .  she would assume he had not been able to evade his wife .  that would give him time .   no  it wouldn   t .  instant depression seized him .  children playing hide and seek would stumble on the remains and run screaming .  it was bound to happen within twenty four hours .   he turned to the pocket   s contents once more .  a pocket copy license as yacht pilot .  he passed it by .  all the richer sarkites owned yachts and piloted them .  it was this century   s fad .  finally  a few strips of sarkite credit vouchers .  now those might be temporarily useful .   it occurred to him that he hadn   t eaten since the night before at the baker   s place .  how quickly one could grow conscious of hunger .   suddenly he turned back to the yacht license .  wait  now  the yacht wasn   t in use now  not with the owner dead .  and it was his yacht .  its hangar number was     at port   .  well .   where was port   .  he hadn   t the slightest notion .   he leaned his forehead against the coolness of the smooth railing around the fountain .  what now .  what now .   the voice startled him .      hello     it said .     not sick .      terens looked up .  it was an older squire .  he was smoking a long cigarette containing some aromatic leaf while a green stone of some sort hung suspended from a gold wristband .  his expression was one of kindly interest that astonished terens into a moment of speechlessness  until he remembered .  he was one of the clan himself now .  among themselves  squires might well be decent human beings .   the townman said     just resting .  decided to take a walk and lost track of time .  i   m afraid i   m late for an appointment now .      he waved his hand in a wry gesture .  he could imitate the sarkite accent fairly well from long association but he didn   t make the mistake of trying to exaggerate it .  exaggeration was easier to detect than insufficiency .   the other said     stuck without a skeeter  hey .     he was the older man  amused by the folly of youth .      no skeeter     admitted terens .      use mine     came the instant offer .     it   s parked right outside .  you can set the controls and send it back here when you   re through .  i won   t be needing it for the next hour or so .      to terens  that was almost ideal .  the skeeters were fast and skittery as chain lightning  could outspeed and outmaneuver any patroller ground car .  it fell short of ideal only in that terens could no more drive the skeeter than he could fly without it .      from here to sark     he said .  he knew that piece of squire slang for    thanks     and threw it in .     i think i   ll walk .  it isn   t far to port   .         no  it isn   t far     agreed the other .   that left terens no better off than before .  he tried again .     of course  i wish i were closer .  the walk to kyrt highway is healthy enough by itself .         kyrt highway .  what   s that got to do with it .      was he looking queerly at terens .  it occurred to the townman  suddenly  that his clothing probably lacked the proper fitting .  he said quickly     wait .  i   m twisted at that .  i   ve got myself crossed up walking .  let   s see now .     he looked about vaguely .      look .  you   re on recket road .  all you have to do is go down to triffis and turn left  then follow it into the port .     he had pointed automatically .   terens smiled .     you   re right .  i   m going to have to stop dreaming and start thinking .  from here to sark  sir .         you can still use my skeeter .         kind of you  but .   .   .      terens was walking away  a bit too quickly  waving his hand .  the squire stared after him .   perhaps tomorrow  when they found the corpse in the rocks and began searching  the squire might think of this interview again .  he would probably say     there was something queer about him  if you know what i mean .  he had an odd turn of phrase and didn   t seem to know where he was .  i   ll swear he   d never heard of triffis avenue .      but that would be tomorrow .   he walked in the direction that the squire had pointed out .  he came to the glittering sign    triffis avenue     almost drab against the iridescent orange structure that was its background .  he turned left .     port   was alive with youth in yachting costume  which seemed to feature high peaked hats and hip bellying breeches .  terens felt conspicuous but no one paid attention to him .  the air was full of conversation spiced with terms he did not understand .   he found booth    but waited for minutes before approaching it .  he wanted no squire remaining persistently in its vicinity  no squire who happened to own a yacht in a nearby booth who would know the real alstare deamone by sight and would wonder what a stranger was doing about his ship .   finally  with the booth   s neighborhood apparently safe  he walked over .  the yacht   s snout peered out from its hangar into the open field about which the booths were placed .     he craned his neck to stare at it .   now what .   he had killed three men in the last twelve hours .  he had risen from florinian townman to patroller  from patroller to squire .  he had come from lower city to upper city and from upper city to a spaceport .  to all intents and purposes he owned a yacht  a vessel sufficiently spaceworthy to take him to safety on any inhabited world in this sector of the galaxy .   there was only one catch .   he could not pilot a yacht .   he was tired to the bone  and hungry to boot .  he had come this far  and now he could go no further .  he was on the edge of space but there was no way of crossing the edge .   by now the patrollers must have decided he was nowhere in lower city .  they would turn the search to upper city as soon as they could get it through their thick skulls that a florinian would dare .  then the body would be found and a new direction would be taken .  they would look for an impostor squire .   and here he was .  he had climbed to the farthest niche of the blind alley and with his back to the closed end he could only wait for the faint sounds of pursuit to grow louder and louder until eventually the bloodhounds would be on him .   thirty six hours ago the greatest opportunity of his life had been in his hands .  now the opportunity was gone and his life would soon follow .       eleven  the captain      it was the first time  really  that captain racety had found himself unable to impose his will upon a passenger .  had that passenger been one of the great squires themselves  he might still have counted on co operation .  a great squire might be all powerful on his own continent  but on a ship he would recognize that there could be only one master  the captain .   a woman was different .  any woman .  and a woman who was daughter of a great squire was completely impossible .   he said     my lady  how can i allow you to interview them in private .      samia of fife  her dark eyes snapping  said     why not .  are they armed  captain .         of course not .  that   s not the point .         anyone can see they   re only a pair of very frightened creatures .  they   re half scared to death .         frightened people can be very dangerous  my lady .  they can   t he counted on to act sensibly .         then why do you keep them frightened .     she had the tiniest stammer when she was angry .     you   ve got three tremendous sailors standing over them with blasters  poor things .  captain  i   ll not forget this .      no  she wouldn   t  the captain thought .  he could feel himself beginning to give way .      if your ladyship pleases  will you tell me exactly what it is that you want .         it   s simple .  i   ve told you .  i want to speak to them .  if they   re florinians  as you say they are  i can get tremendously valuable information from them for my book .  i can   t do that  though  if they   re too frightened to speak .  if i could be with them alone it would be fine .  alone  captain .  can you understand a simple word .  alone .         and what would i say to your father  my lady  if he discovers that i allowed you to remain unguarded in the presence of two desperate criminals .         desperate criminals .  oh  great space .  two poor fools that tried to escape their planet and had no more sense than to board a ship going to sark .  besides  how would my father know .         if they hurt you he would know .         why should they hurt me .     her small fist lifted and vibrated  while she put every atom of force she could find into her voice .     i demand it  captain .      captain racety said     how about this then  my lady .  i will be present .  i shall not be three sailors with blasters .  i shall be one man with no blaster in view .  otherwise     and in his turn he put all his resolution into his voice     i must refuse your demand .         very well  then .     she was breathless .     very well .  but if i can   t get them to speak because of you i will personally see to it that you captain no more ships .        valona put her hand hastily over rik   s eyes as samia entered the brig .      what   s the matter  girl .     asked samia sharply  before she could remember that she was going to speak to them comfortingly .   valona spoke with difficulty .  she said     he is not bright  lady .  he wouldn   t know you were a lady .  he might have looked at you .  i mean without intending any harm  lady .         oh  goodness     said samia .     let him look .     she went on     must they stay here  captain .         would you prefer a stateroom  my lady .      samia said     surely you could manage a cell not quite so grim .         it is grim to you  my lady .  to them  i am sure this is luxury .  there is running water here .  ask them if there was any in their hut on florina .         well  tell those men to leave .      the captain motioned to them .  they turned  stepping out nimbly .   the captain set down the light aluminum folding chair he had brought with him .  samia took it .   he said brusquely to rik and valona     stand up .      samia broke in instantly .     no .  let them sit .  you   re not to interfere  captain .      she turned to them .     so you are a florinian  girl .      valona shook her head .     we   re from wotex .         you needn   t be frightened .  it doesn   t matter that you   re from florina .  no one will hurt you .         we   re from wotex .         but don   t you see that you   ve practically admitted you   re from florina  girl .  why did you cover the boy   s eyes .         he   s not allowed to look at a lady .         even if he   s from wotex .      valona was silent .   samia let her think about it .  she tried to smile in a friendly way .  then she said     only florinians aren   t allowed to look at ladies .  so you see you   ve admitted that you   re a florinian .      valona burst out     he   s not .         are you .         yes  i am .  but he   s not .  don   t do anything to him .  he really isn   t a florinian .  he was just found one day .  i don   t know where he comes from  but it   s not florina .     suddenly she was almost voluble .   samia looked at her with some surprise .     well  i   ll speak to him .  what   s your name  boy .      rik was staring .  was that how women squires looked .  so small  and friendly looking .  and she smelled so nice .  he was very glad she had let him look at her .   samia said again     what   s your name  boy .      rik came to life but stumbled badly in the attempt to shape a monosyllable .      rik     he said .  then he thought  why  that   s not my name .  he said     i think it   s rik .         don   t you know .      valona  looking woebegone  tried to speak  but samia held up a sharply restraining hand .   rik shook his head .     i don   t know .         are you a florinian .      rik was positive here .     no .  i was on a ship .  i came here from somewhere else .     he could not bear to look away from samia but he seemed to see the ship co existing with her .  a small and very friendly and homelike ship .   he said     it was on a ship that i came to florina and before that i lived on a planet .         what planet .      it was as though the thought were forcing its way painfully through mental channels too small for it .  then rik remembered and was delighted at the sound his voice made  a sound so long forgotten .      earth .  i come from earth .         earth .      rik nodded .   samia turned to the captain .     where is this planet earth .      captain racety smiled briefly .     i never heard of it .  don   t take the boy seriously  my lady .  a native lies the way he breathes .  it comes naturally to him .  he says whatever comes first into his mind .         he doesn   t talk like a native .     she turned to rik again .     where is earth  rik .         i      he put a shaking hand to his forehead .  then he said     it   s in the sirius sector .     the intonation of the statement made it half a question .   samia said to the captain     there is a sirius sector  isn   t there .         yes  there is .  i   m amazed he has that right .  still  that doesn   t make earth any more real .      rik said vehemently     but it is .  i remember  i tell you .  it   s been so long since i remembered .  i can   t be wrong now .  i can   t .      he turned  gripping valona   s elbows and clawing at her sleeve .     lona  tell them i come from earth .  i do .  i do .      valona   s eyes were wide with anxiety .     we found him one day  lady  and he had no mind at all .  he couldn   t dress himself or talk or walk .  he was nothing .  ever since then he   s been remembering little by little .  so far everything he   s remembered has been so .     she cast a quick  fearful glance at the bored face of the captain .     he may really have come from earth  squire .  no contradiction intended .      the last was a long established conventional phrase that went with any statement that seemed in contradiction to a previous statement by a superior .   captain racety grunted .     he may have come from the center of sark for all that story proves  my lady .         maybe  but there   s something queer about all this     insisted samia  making up her mind flatly  woman wise  on the side of romance .     i   m sure of it .   .   .   .  what made him so helpless when you found him  girl .  had he been hurt .      valona said nothing at first .  her eyes darted helplessly back and forth .  first to rik  whose fingers clutched at his hair  then to the captain  who was smiling without humor  finally to samia  who waited .      answer me  girl     said samia .   it was a hard decision for valona to make  but no conceivable lie could substitute for the truth in this place and at this time .  she said     a doctor once looked at him .  he said m my rik was psycho probed .         psycho probed .     samia felt a slight wash of repulsion well over her .  she pushed her chair away .  it squeaked against the metal floor .     you mean he was psychotic .         i don   t know what that means  lady     said valona humbly .      not in the sense you   re thinking of  my lady     said the captain almost simultaneously .     natives aren   t psychotic .  their needs and desires are too simple .  i   ve never heard of a psychotic native in my life .         but then          it   s simple  my lady .  if we accept this fantastic story the girl tells  we can only conclude that the boy had been a criminal  which is a way of being psychotic  i suppose .  if so  he must have been treated by one of those quacks who practice among the natives  been nearly killed and was then dumped in a deserted section to avoid detection and prosecution .         but it would have to be someone with a psycho probe     protested samia .     surely you wouldn   t expect natives to be able to use them .         perhaps not .  but then you wouldn   t expect an authorized medical man to use one so inexpertly .  the fact that we arrive at a contradiction proves the story to be a lie throughout .  if you will accept my suggestion  my lady  you will leave these creatures to our handling .  you see that it   s useless to expect anything out of them .      samia hesitated .     perhaps you   re right .      she rose and looked uncertainly at rik .  the captain stepped behind her  lifted the little chair and folded it with a snap .   rik jumped to his feet .     wait .         if you please  my lady     said the captain  holding the door open for her .     my men will quiet him .      samia stopped at the threshold .     they won   t hurt him .         i doubt if he   ll make us go to extremes .  he will be easy handling .         lady .  lady .     rik called .     i can prove it .  i   m from earth .      samia stood irresolute for a moment .     let   s hear what he has to say .      the captain said coldly     as you wish  my lady .      she returned  but not very far .  she remained a step from the door .   rik was flushed .  with the effort of remembering  his lips drew back into the caricature of a smile .  he said     i remember earth .  it was radioactive .  i remember the forbidden areas and the blue horizon at night .  the soil glowed and nothing would grow in it .  there were just a few spots men could live on .  that   s why i was a spatio analyst .  that   s why i didn   t mind staying in space .  my world was a dead world .      samia shrugged .     come along  captain .  he   s simply raving .      but this time it was captain racety who stood there  open mouthed .  he muttered     a radioactive world .      she said     you mean there is such a thing .         yes .     he turned wondering eyes on her .     now where could he have picked that up .         how could a world be radioactive and inhabited .         but there is one .  and it is in the sirius sector .  i don   t remember its name .  it might even be earth .         it is earth     said rik  proudly and with confidence .     it is the oldest planet of the galaxy .  it is the planet on which the whole human race originated .      the captain said softly     that   s so .      samia said  mind whirling     you mean the human race originated on this earth .         no  no     said the captain abstractedly .     that   s superstition .  it   s just that that   s how i came to hear about the radioactive planet .  it claims to be man   s home planet .         i didn   t know we were supposed to have a home planet .         i suppose we started somewhere  my lady  but i doubt that anyone can possibly know on what planet it happened .      with sudden decision he walked toward rik .     what else do you remember .      he almost added    boy     but held it back .      the ship mostly     said rik     and spatio analysis .      samia joined the captain .  they stood there  directly before rik  and samia felt the excitement returning .     then it   s all true .  but then how did he come to be psycho probed .         psycho probed .     said captain racety thoughtfully .     suppose we ask him .  here  you  native or outworlder or whatever you are .  how did you come to be psycho probed .      rik looked doubtful .     you all say that .  even lona .  but i don   t know what the word means .         when did you stop remembering  then .         i   m not sure .     he began again  desperately .     i was on a ship .         we know that .  go on .      samia said     it   s no use barking  captain .  you   ll drive out what few wits are left him .      rik was entirely absorbed in wrenching at the dimness within his mind .  the effort left no room for any emotion .  it was to his own astonishment that he said     i   m not afraid of him  lady .  i   m trying to remember .  there was danger .  i   m sure of that .  great danger to florina  but i can   t remember the details about it .         danger to the whole planet .     samia cast a swift glance at the captain .      yes .  it was in the currents .         what currents .     asked the captain .      the currents of space .      the captain spread his hands and let them drop .     this is madness .         no  no .  let him go on .     the tide of belief had shifted to samia again .  her lips were parted  her dark eyes gleamed and little dimples between cheek and chin made their appearance as she smiled .     what are the currents of space .         the different elements     said rik vaguely .  he had explained that before .  he didn   t want to go through that again .   he went on rapidly  nearly incoherently  speaking as the thoughts came to him  driven by them .     i sent a message to the local office on sark .  i remember that very clearly .  i had to be careful .  it was a danger that went beyond florina .  yes .  beyond florina .  it was as wide as the milky way .  it had to be handled carefully .      he seemed to have lost all real contact with those who listened to him  to be living in a world of the past before which a curtain was tearing away in places .  valona placed a soothing hand upon his shoulder and said     don   t .     but he was unresponsive even to that .      somehow     he went on breathlessly     my message was intercepted by some official on sark .  it was a mistake .  i don   t know how it happened .      he frowned .     i   m sure i sent it to the local office on the bureau   s own wave length .  do you suppose the sub ether could have been tapped .     he did not even wonder that the word    sub ether    came so easily to him .   he might have been waiting for an answer  but his eyes were still unseeing .     anyway  when i landed on sark they were waiting for me .      again a pause  this time long and meditative .  the captain did nothing to break it  he seemed to be meditating himself .   samia  however  said     who was waiting for you .  who .      rik said     i  i don   t know .  i can   t remember .  it wasn   t the office .  it was someone of sark .  i remember speaking to him .  he knew about the danger .  he spoke of it .  i   m sure he spoke of it .  we sat at a table together .  i remember the table .  he sat opposite me .  it   s as clear as space .  we spoke for quite a while .  it seems to me i wasn   t anxious to give details .  i   m sure of that .  i would have had to speak to the office first .  and then he .   .   .         yes .     prompted samia .      he did something .  he   no  nothing more will come .  nothing will come .      he screamed the words and then there was silence  a silence that was anticlimactically broken by the prosaic buzz of the captain   s wrist communo .   he said     what is it .      the answering voice was reedy and precisely respectful .     a message to the captain from sark .  it is requested that he accept it personally .         very well .  i will be at the sub etherics presently .      he turned to samia .     my lady  may i suggest that it is  in any case  dinnertime .      he saw that the girl was about to protest her lack of appetite  to urge him to leave and not to bother about her .  he continued  more diplomatically     it is also time to feed these creatures .  they are probably tired and hungry .      samia could say nothing against that .     i must see them again  captain .      the captain bowed silently .  it might have been acquiescence .  it might not .   samia of fife was thrilled .  her studies of florina satisfied a certain aspiration to intellect within her  but the mysterious case of the psycho probed earthman  she thought of the matter in capitals  appealed to something much more primitive and much more demanding .  it roused the sheer animal curiosity in her .   it was a mystery .   there were three points that fascinated her .  among these was not the perhaps reasonable question  under the circumstances  of whether the man   s story was a delusion or a deliberate lie  rather than the truth .  to believe it anything other than truth would spoil the mystery and samia could not allow that .   the three points were therefore these .      what was the danger that threatened florina  or  rather  the entire galaxy .      who was the person who had psycho probed the earthman .      why had the person used the psycho probe .   she was determined to sift the matter to her own thorough satisfaction .  no one is so modest as not to believe himself a competent amateur sleuth  and samia was far from modest .   as soon after dinner as she could politely manage  she hurried down to the brig .   she said to the guard     open the door .      the sailor remained perfectly erect  staring blankly and respectfully ahead .  he said     if your ladyship pleases  the door is not to be opened .      samia gasped .     how dare you say so .  if you do not open the door instantly  the captain shall be informed .         if your ladyship pleases  the door is not to be opened .  that is by the strict order of the captain .      she stormed up the levels once more  bursting into the captain   s stateroom like a tornado compressed into sixty inches .      captain .         my lady .         have you ordered the earthman and the native woman to be kept from me .         i believe  my lady  it was agreed that you were to interview them only in my presence .         before dinner  yes .  but you saw they were harmless .         i saw that they seemed harmless .      samia simmered .     in that case i order you to come with me now .         i cannot  my lady .  the situation has changed .         in what way .         they must be questioned by the proper authorities on sark and until then i think they should be left alone .      samia   s lower jaw dropped  but she rescued it from its undignified position almost immediately .     surely you are not going to deliver them to the bureau of florinian affairs .         well     temporized the captain     that was certainly the original intention .  they have left their village without permission .  in fact they have left their planet without permission .  in addition  they have taken secret passage on a sarkite vessel .         the last was a mistake .         was it .         in any case  you knew all their crimes before our last interview .         but it was only at the interview that i heard what the so called earthman had to say .         so called .  you said yourself that the planet earth existed .         i said it might exist .  but  my lady  may i be so bold as to ask what you would like to see done with these people .         i think the earthman   s story should be investigated .  he speaks of a danger to florina and of someone on sark who has deliberately attempted to keep knowledge of that danger from the proper authorities .  i think it is even a case for my father .  in fact i would take him to my father  when the proper time came .      the captain said     the cleverness of it all .         are you being sarcastic  captain .      the captain flushed .     your pardon  my lady .  i was referring to our prisoners .  may i be allowed to speak at some length .         i don   t know what you mean by    some length     she retorted angrily     but i suppose you may begin .         thank you .  in the first place  my lady  i hope you will not minimize the importance of the disturbances on florina .         what disturbances .         you cannot have forgotten the incident in the library .         a patroller killed .  really  captain .         and a second patroller killed this morning  my lady  and a native as well .  it is not very usual for natives to kill patrollers and here is one who has done it twice  and yet remains uncaught .  is he a lone hand .  is it an accident .  or is it all part of a carefully laid scheme .         apparently you believe the last .         yes  i do .  the murdering native had two accomplices .  their description is rather like that of our two stowaways .         you never said so .         i did not wish to alarm your ladyship .  you   ll remember  however  that i told you repeatedly that they could be dangerous .         very well .  what follows from all this .         what if the murders on florina were simply side shows intended to distract the attention of the patroller squadrons while these two sneaked aboard our ship .         that sounds so silly .         does it .  why are they running away from florina .  we haven   t asked them .  let us suppose they are running away from the patrollers since that is certainly the most reasonable assumption .  would they be running to sark of all places .  and on a ship that carries your ladyship .  and then he claims to be a spatio analyst .      samia frowned .     what of that .         a year ago a spatio analyst was reported missing .  the story was never given wide publicity .  i knew  of course  because my ship was one of those that searched near space for signs of his ship .  whoever is backing these florinian disorders has undoubtedly seized on that fact  and just knowing that the matter of the missing spatio analyst is known to them shows what a tight and unexpectedly efficient organization they have .         it might be that the earthman and the missing spatio analyst have no connection .         no real connection  my lady  undoubtedly .  but to expect no connection at all is to expect too much of coincidence .  it is an impostor we are dealing with .  that is why he claims to have been psycho probed .         oh .         how can we prove he isn   t a spatio analyst .  he knows no details of the planet earth beyond the bare fact that it is radioactive .  he cannot pilot a ship .  he knows nothing of spatioanalysis .  and he covers up by insisting he was psycho probed .  do you see  my lady .      samia could make no direct answer .     but to what purpose .     she demanded .      so that you might do exactly what you said you intended to do  my lady .         investigate the mystery .         no  my lady .  take the man to your father .         i still see no point .         there are several possibilities .  at the best  he could be a spy upon your father  either for florina or possibly for trantor .  i imagine old abel of trantor would certainly come forward to identify him as an earthman  if for no other reason than to embarrass sark by demanding the truth concerning this fictitious psycho probing .  at the worst  he will be your father   s assassin .         captain .         my lady .         this is ridiculous .         perhaps  my lady .  but if so  the department of security is also ridiculous .  you will recall that just before dinner i was called away to receive a message from sark .         yes .         this is it .      samia received the thin translucent foil with its red lettering .  it said     two florinians are reported to have taken secret  illegal passage on your ship .  secure them immediately .  one of them may claim to be a spatio analyst and not a florinian native .  you are to take no action in this matter .  you will be held strictly responsible for the safety of these people .  they are to be held for delivery to depsec .  extreme secrecy .  extreme urgency .      samia felt stunned .     depsec     she said .     the department of security .         extreme secrecy     said the captain .     i stretch a point to tell you this  but you have left me no choice  my lady .      she said     what will they do to him .         i cannot say for certain     said the captain .     certainly a suspected spy and assassin cannot expect gentle treatment .  probably his pretense will become partly a reality and he will learn what a psycho probe is really like .          twelve  the detective      the four great squires regarded the squire of fife each in his own way .  bort was angry  rune was amused  balle was annoyed  and steen was frightened .   rune spoke first .  he said     high treason .  are you trying to frighten us with a phrase .  what does it mean .  treason against you .  against bort .  against myself .  by whom and how .  and for s ark   s sake  fife  these conferences interfere with my normal sleeping hours .         the results     said fife     may interfere with many sets of sleeping hours .  i don   t refer to treason against any of us  rune .  i mean treason against sark .      bort said     sark .  what   s that  anyway  if not us .         call it a myth .  call it something ordinary sarkites believe in .         i don   t understand     moaned steen .     you men always seem so interested in talking each other down .  really .  i wish you   d get all this over with .      balle said     i agree with steen .     steen looked gratified .   fife said     i   m perfectly willing to explain immediately .  you have heard  i suppose  of the recent disturbances on florina .      rune said     the depsec dispatches speak of several patrollers killed .  is that what you mean .      bort broke in angrily .     by sark  if we must have a conference  let   s talk about that .  patrollers killed .  they deserve to be killed .  do you mean to say a native can simply come up to a patroller and bash his head in with a two by four .  why should any patroller let any native with a two by four in his hand come close enough to use it .  why wasn   t the native burned down at twenty paces .      by sark  i   d rattle the patrol corps from captain to recruit and send every dunderhead out on ship duty .  the entire corps is just an accumulation of fat .  it   s too easy a life for them down there .  i say that every five years we should put florina under martial law and scrape out the troublemakers .  it would keep the natives quiet and our own men on their toes .         are you through .     asked fife .      for now  yes .  but i   ll take it up again .  it   s my investment down there  too  you know .  it may not be as big as yours  fife  but it   s big enough for me to worry about .      fife shrugged .  he turned suddenly to steen .     and have you heard of the disturbances .      steen jumped .     i have .  i mean  i   ve heard you just saying          you haven   t read the depsec announcements .         well  really .     steen became intensely interested in his long  pointed fingernails with their exquisitely applied coppery coating .     i don   t always have time to read all the announcements .  i didn   t know it was required of me .  in fact     and he gathered his courage in both hands and looked full at fife     i didn   t know you were making rules for me .  really .         i haven   t     said fife .     just the same since you  at least  know none of the details  let me summarize it for you .  the rest may find it interesting as well .      it was surprising into how few words the events of forty eight hours could be put and how flat they could sound .  first  there had been an unexpected reference to spatio analysis texts .  then a blow on the head of a superannuated patroller who died of a fractured skull two hours later .  then a pursuit that ended with untouchability in the lair of a trantorian agent .  then a second patroller dead at dawn with the murderer tricked out in the patroller   s uniform and the trantorian agent dead in his turn some hours later .      if you wish the very latest nugget of news     fife concluded     you might add this to this catalog of apparent trivia .  some hours ago a body  or  rather  the bony remnants of one  was found in city park on florina .         whose body .     asked rune .      just a moment  please .  lying next to it was a pile of ash that seemed to be the charred remnants of clothing .  anything of metal had been carefully removed from it  but the ash analysis proved it to be what was left of a patroller uniform .         our impostoring friend .     asked balle .      not likely     said fife .     who would kill him in secret .         suicide     said bort viciously .     how long did the bloody bastard expect to keep out of our hands .  i imagine he had a better death this way .  personally  i   d find out who in the corps were responsible for letting him reach the suicide stage and put a one charge blaster in their hands .         not likely     said fife again .     if the man committed suicide he either killed himself first  then took off his uniform  blasted it to ash  removed the buckles and braid  and then got rid of them .  or else he first removed his uniform  ashed it  removed the buckles and braid  left the cave naked  or perhaps in his underwear  discarded them  came back and killed himself .         the body was in a cave .     asked bort .      in one of the ornamental caves of the park .  yes .         then he had plenty of time and plenty of privacy     said bort belligerently .  he hated to give up a theory .     he could have taken off the buckles and braid first  then          ever try to remove braid from a patroller uniform that hasn   t been ashed first .     asked fife sarcastically .     and ca  you suggest a motive  if the body were that of the impostor after suicide .  besides  i have a report from the medical examiners who studied the bone structure .  the skeleton is that of neither a patroller nor a florinian .  it is of a sarkite .      steen cried     really .      balle   s old eyes opened wide  rune   s metal teeth  which  by catching a gleam of light now and then  added a bit of life to the cube of dusk in which he sat  vanished as he closed his mouth .  even bort was dumfounded .      do you follow .     asked fife .     now you see why the metal was removed from the uniform .  whoever killed the sarkite wanted the ash to be taken for that of the sarkite   s own clothing  removed and ashed before the killing  which we might then take for suicide or for the result of a private feud in no way connected with our patroller impostor friend .  what he did not know was that ash analysis could distinguish between the kyrt of sarkite clothing and the cellulite of a patroller uniform even with the buckles and braid removed .      now given a dead sarkite and the ash of a patroller uniform  we can only assume that somewhere in upper city there is a live townman in sarkite clothing .  our florinian  having posed as a patroller long enough  and finding the danger too great and growing greater  decided to become a squire .  and he did that in the only way he could .         has he been caught .     inquired bort thickly .      no  he hasn   t .         why not .  by sark  why not .         he will be caught     said fife indifferently .     at the moment we have more important things to wonder about .  this last atrocity is a trifle in comparision .         get to the point .     demanded rune instantly .      patience .  first  let me ask you if you remember the missing spatio analyst of last year .      steen giggled .   bort said with infinite contempt     that again .      steen asked     is there a connection .  or are we just going to talk about that horrible affair of last year all over again .  i   m tired .      fife was unmoved .  he said     this explosion of yesterday and day before yesterday began with a request at the florinian library for reference books on spatio analysis .  that is connection enough for me .  let   s see if i can   t make the connection for the rest of you as well .  i will begin by describing the three people involved in the library incident  and please  let me have no interruptions for a few moments .      first  there is a townman .  he is the dangerous one of the three .  on sark he had an excellent record as an intelligent and faithful piece of material .  unfortunately he has now turned his abilities against us .  he is undoubtedly the one responsible for four killings now .  quite a record for anyone .  considering that the four include two patrollers and a sarkite  it is unbelievably remarkable for a native .  and he is still uncaught .      the second person involved is a native woman .  she is uneducated and completely insignificant .  however  the last couple of days have seen an extensive search into every facet of this affair and we know her history .  her parents were members of the    soul of kyrt    if any of you remember that rather ridiculous peasant conspiracy that was wiped out without trouble some twenty years ago .      this brings us to the third person  the most unusual one of the three .  this third person was a common mill hand and an idiot .      there was an expulsion of breath from bort and another high pitched giggle from steen .  balle   s eyes remained closed and rune was motionless in the dark .   fife said     the word    idiot    is not used figuratively .  depsec has driven itself mercilessly but his history could not be traced back more than ten and a half months .  at that time he was found in a village just outside florina   s main metropolis in a state of complete mindlessness .  he could neither walk nor talk .  he could not even feed himself .      now note that he made this first appearance some few weeks after the disappearance of the spatio analyst .  note in addition that  in a matter of months  he learned how to talk and even how to fill a job at a kyrt mill .  what kind of an idiot could learn so quickly .      steen began  almost eagerly     oh  really  if he were psycho probed properly  it could be arranged so  .   .   .     his voice trailed off .   fife said sardonically     i can think of no greater authority on the subject .  even without steen   s expert opinion  however  the same thought occurred to me .  it was the only possible explanation .      now the psycho probing could have taken place only on sark or in upper city on florina .  as a matter of simple thoroughness  doctors    offices in upper city were checked .  there was no trace of any unauthorized psycho probing .  it was then the notion of one of our agents to check the records of doctors who had died since the idiot first made his appearance .  i shall see to it that he is promoted for that idea .      we found a record of our idiot in just one of those offices .  he had been brought in for a physical checkup about six months ago by the peasant woman who is the second of our trio .  apparently this was done secretly since she was absent that day from her job on quite another pretext .  the doctor examined the idiot and recorded definite evidence of psycho probic tampering .      now here is the interesting point .  the doctor was one of those who kept double deck offices in upper city and lower city .  he was one of these idealists who thought the natives deserved first rate medical care .  he was a methodical man and kept duplicate records in full in both his offices to avoid unnecessary elevator travel .  also it pleased his idealism  i imagine  to practice no segregation between sarkite and florinian in his files .  but the record of the idiot in question was not duplicated  and it was the only record not duplicated .      why should that be .  if  for some reason  he had decided of his own accord not to duplicate that particular record  why should it have appeared only in the upper city records  which is where it did appear .  why not only in the lower city records  which is where it did not appear .  after all  the man was a florinian .  he had been brought in by a florinian .  he had been examined in the lower city office .  all that was plainly recorded in the copy we found .      there is only one answer to that particular puzzle .  the record was duly entered in both files  but it was destroyed in the lower city files by somebody who did not realize there would remain another record in the upper city office .  now let   s pass on .      included with the idiot   s examination record was the definite notation to include the findings of this case with the doctor   s next routine report to depsec .  that was entirely proper .  any case of psycho probing could involve a criminal or even a subversive .  but no such report was ever made .  within the week he was dead in a traffic accident .      the coincidences pile up past endurance  don   t they .      balle opened his eyes .  he said     this is a detective thriller you are telling us .         yes     cried fife with satisfaction     a detective thriller .  and for the moment i am the detective .         and who are the accused .     asked balle in a tired whisper .      not yet .  let me play the detective for a moment longer .      in the middle of what fife considered to be the most dangerous crisis that had ever confronted sark  he suddenly found that he was enjoying himself hugely .   he said     let   s approach the story from the other end .  we will  for the moment  forget the idiot and remember the spatio analyst .  the first we hear of him is the notification to the bureau of transportation that his ship will soon land .  a message received from him earlier accompanies the notification .      the spatio analyst never arrives .  he is located nowhere in near space .  furthermore  the message sent by the spatio analyst  which had been forwarded to butrans  disappeared .  the i . s . b .  claimed that we were deliberately concealing the message .  depsec believed that they were inventing a fictitious message for propaganda purposes .  it now occurs to me that we were both wrong .  the message had been delivered but it had not been concealed by the government of sark .      let us invent someone and  for the moment  call him x .  x has access to the records of butrans .  he learns of this spatio analyst and his message and has the brains and ability to act quickly .  he arranges that a secret sub ethergram be sent out to the spatio analyst   s ship  directing the man   s landing on some small  private field .  the spatio analyst does so and x meets him there .      x has taken the spatio analyst   s message of doom with him .  there may be two reasons for that .  first  it would confuse possible attempts at detection by eliminating a piece of evidence .  second  it would serve  perhaps  to win the confidence of the mad spatio analyst .  if the spatio analyst felt he could talk only to his own superiors  and he might well feel that  x might persuade him to grow confidential by proving that he was already in possession of the essentials of the story .      undoubtedly the spatio analyst talked .  however incoherent  mad  and generally impossible that talk might have been  x recognized it as an excellent handle for propaganda .  he sent out his blackmailing letter to the great squires  to us .  his procedure  as then planned  was probably precisely that which i attributed to trantor at the time .  if we didn   t come to terms with him  he intended to disrupt florinian production by rumors of destruction until he forced surrender .      but then came his first miscalculation .  something frightened him .  we   ll consider exactly what that was later .  in any case  he decided he would have to wait before continuing .  waiting  however  involved one complication .  x didn   t believe the spatio analyst   s story  but there is no question that the spatio analyst himself was madly sincere .  x would have to arrange affairs so that the spatio analyst would be willing to allow his    doom    to wait .      the spatio analyst could not do that unless his warped mind was put out of action .  x might have killed him  but i am of the opinion that the spatio analyst was necessary to him as a source of further information  after all  he knew nothing of spatioanalysis himself and he couldn   t conduct successful blackmail on total bluff  and  perhaps  as ransom in case of ultimate failure .  in any case  he used a psycho probe .  after treatment  he had on his hands  not a spatio analyst  but a mindless idiot who would  for a time  cause him no trouble .  and after a time his senses would be recovered .      the next step .  that was to make certain that during the year   s wait the spatio analyst would not be located  that no one of importance would see him even in his role as idiot .  so he proceeded with a masterly simplicity .  he carried his man to florina and for nearly a year the spatio analyst was simply a half wit native  working in the kyrt mills .      i imagine that during that year he  or some trusted subordinate  visited the town where he had    planted    the creature  to see that he was safe and in reasonable health .  on one of these visits he learned  somehow  that the creature had been taken to a doctor who knew a psycho probing when he saw one .  the doctor died and his report disappeared  at least from his lower city office .  that was x   s first miscalculation .  he never thought a duplicate might be in the office above .      and then came his second miscalculation .  the idiot began regaining his senses a little too quickly and the village townman had brains enough to see that there was something more to it than simple raving .  perhaps the girl who took care of the idiot told the townman about the psycho probing .  that   s a guess .      there you have the story .      fife clasped his strong hands and waited for the reaction .   rune supplied it first .  the light had turned on in his cubicle some moments earlier and he sat there  blinking and smiling .  he said     and a moderately dull story it was  fife .  another moment in the dark and i would have been asleep .         as nearly as i can see     said balle slowly     you have created a structure as insubstantial as the one of last year .  it is nine tenths guesswork .         hogwash .     said bort .      who is x  anyway .     asked steen .     if you don   t know who x is  it just doesn   t make any sense .     and he yawned delicately  covering his small white teeth with a bent forefinger .   fife said     at least one of you sees the essential point .  the identity of x is the nub of the affair .  consider the characteristics that x must possess if my analysis is accurate .      in the first place  x is a man with contacts in the civil service .  he is a man who can order a psycho probing .  he is a man who thinks he can arrange a powerful blackmailing campaign .  he is a man who can take the spatio analyst from sark to florina without trouble .  he is a man who can arrange the death of a doctor on florina .  he isn   t a nobody  certainly .      in fact he is a very definite somebody .  he must be a great squire .  wouldn   t you say so .      bort rose from his seat .  his head disappeared and he sat down again .  steen burst into high  hysterical laughter .  rune   s eyes  half buried in the pulpy fat that surrounded them  glittered feverishly .  balle slowly shook his head .   bort yelled     who in space is being accused  fife .         no one yet .     fife remained even tempered .     no one specifically .  look at it this way .  there are five of us .  not another man on sark could have done what x did .  only we five .  that can be taken as settled .  now which of the five is it .  to begin with  it isn   t myself .         we can take your word for it  can we .     sneered rune .      you don   t have to take my word for it     retorted fife .     i   m the only one here without a motive .  x   s motive is to gain control of the kyrt industry .  i have control of it .  i own a third of florina   s land outright .  my mills  machine plants and shipping fleets are sufficiently predominant to force any or all of you out of business if i wish .  i wouldn   t have to resort to complicated blackmail .      he was shouting over their united voices .     listen to me .  the rest of you have every motive .  rune has the smallest continent and the smallest holdings .  i know he doesn   t like that .  he can   t pretend he likes it .  balle has the oldest lineage .  there was a time when his family ruled all of sark .  he probably hasn   t forgotten that .  bort resents the fact that he is always outvoted in council and cannot therefore conduct business in his territories in quite the whip and blaster fashion he would like .  steen has expensive tastes and his finances are in a bad way .  the necessity of recouping is a hard driving one .  we have it there .  all the possible motives .  envy .  greed for power .  greed for money .  questions of prestige .  now which of you is it .      there was a gleam of sudden malice in balle   s old eyes .     you don   t know .         it doesn   t matter .  now hear this .  i said that something frightened x  let   s still call him x  after his first letters to us .  do you know what it was .  it was our first conference when i preached the necessity of united action .  x was here .  x was  and is  one of us .  he knew united action meant failure .  he had counted on winning over us because he knew that our rigid ideal of continental autonomy would keep us at odds to the last moment and beyond .  he saw that he was wrong and he decided to wait until the sense of urgency vanished and he could proceed again .      but he is still wrong .  we will still take united action and there is only one way we can do it safely  considering that x is one of us .  continental autonomy is at an end .  it is a luxury we can no longer afford  for x   s schemes will end only with the economic defeat of the rest of us or the intervention of trantor .  i  myself  am the only one i can trust  so from now on i head a united sark .  are you with me .      they were out of their seats  shouting .  bort was waving his fist .  there was a light froth at the corner of his lips .   physically  there was nothing they could do .  fife smiled .  each was a continent away .  he could sit behind his desk and watch them foam .   he said     you have no choice .  in the year since our first conference  i  too  have made my preparations .  while you four have been quietly in conference  listening to me  officers loyal to myself have taken charge of the navy .         treason .     they howled .      treason to continental autonomy     retorted fife .     loyalty to sark .      steen   s fingers intertwined nervously  their ruddy  copper tips the only splash of color upon his skin .     but it   s x .  even if x is one of us  there are three innocent .  i   m not x .     he cast a poisonous glance about him .     it   s one of the others .         those of you who are innocent will form part of my government if they wish .  they have nothing to lose .         but you won   t say who is innocent     bawled bort .     you will keep us all out on the story of x  on the  on the      breathlessness brought him to a halt .      i will not .  in twenty four hours i will know who x is .  i have not told you .  the spatio analyst we have all been discussing is now in my hands .      they fell silent .  they looked at one another with reserve and suspicion .   fife chuckled .     you are wondering which of you can be x .  one of you knows  be sure of that .  and in twenty four hours we shall all know .  now keep in mind  gentlemen  that you are all quite helpless .  the ships of war are mine .  good day .      his gesture was one of dismissal .   one by one they went out  like stars in the depths of the vacuum being blotted out on the visiplate by the passing and unseen bulk of a wrecked spaceship .   steen was the last to leave .     fife     he said tremulously .   fife looked up .     yes .  you wish to confess now that we two are alone .  you are  steen   s face twisted in wild alarm .     no  no .  really .  i just wanted to ask if you   re really serious .  i mean  continental autonomy and all that .  really .      fife stared at the old chronometer in the wall .     good day .      steen whimpered .  his hand went up to the contact switch and he  too  disappeared .     fife sat there  stony and unmoving .  with the conference over  the heat of the crisis gone  depression seized him .  his lipless mouth was a severe gash in his large face .   all calculations began with this fact  that the spatio analyst was mad  there was no doom .  but over a madman  so much had taken place .  would junz of the i . s . b .  have spent a year searching for a madman .  would he be so unyielding in his chase after fairy stories .   fife had told no one this .  he scarcely dared share it with his own soul .  what if the spatio analyst had never been mad .  what if destruction dangled over the world of kyrt .   the florinian secretary glided before the great squire  his voice pallid and dry .      sir .         what is it .         the ship with your daughter has landed .         the spatio analyst and the native woman are safe .         yes  sir .         let there be no questioning in my absence .  they are to be held incommunicado until i arrive .   .   .   .  is there news from florina .         yes  sir .  the townman is in custody and is being brought to sark .          thirteen  the yachtsman      the port   s lights brightened evenly as the twilight deepened .  at no time did the over all illumination vary from that to be expected of a somewhat subdued late afternoon .  at port    as at the other yacht ports of upper city  it was daylight throughout florina   s rotation .  the brightness might grow unusually pronounced under the midday sun  but that was the only deviation .   markis genro could tell that the day proper had passed only because  in passing into the port  he had left the colored night lights of the city behind him .  those were bright against the blackening sky but they made no pretense of substituting for day .   genro paused just inside the main entrance and seemed in no way impressed by the gigantic horseshoe with its three dozen hangars and five take off pits .  it was part of him  as it was part of any experienced yachtsman .   he took a long cigarette  violet in color and tipped with the filmiest touch of silvery kyrt  and put it to his lips .  he cupped his palms about the exposed tip and watched it glow to greenish life as he inhaled .  it burned slowly and left no ash .  an emerald smoke filtered out his nostrils .   he murmured     business as usual .      a member of the yacht committee  in yachting costume  with only a discreet and tasteful lettering above one tunic button to indicate that he was a member of the committee  had moved up quickly to meet genro  carefully avoiding any appearance of hurry .      ah  genro .  and why not business as usual .         hello  doty .  i only thought that with all this fume and fuss going on it might occur to some bright boy to close the ports .  thank sark it hasn   t .      the committeeman sobered .     you know  it may come to that .  have you heard the latest .      genro grinned .     how can you tell the latest from the next to the latest .         well  have you heard that it   s definite now about the native .  the killer .         you mean they   ve caught him .  i hadn   t heard that .         no  they haven   t caught him .  but they know he   s not in lower city .         no .  where is he then .         why  in upper city .  here .         go on .     genro   s eyes widened  then narrowed in disbelief .      no  really     said the committeeman  a little hurt     i have it for a fact .  the patrollers are swooping up and down kyrt highway .  they   ve got city park surrounded and they   re using central arena as a co ordination point .  this is all authentic .         well  maybe .     genro   s eyes roved carelessly over the hangared ships .     i haven   t been at g for two months  i think .  are there any new ships in the place .         no .  well  yes  there   s hjordesse   s flame arrow .      genro shook his head .     i   ve seen that .  it   s all chromium and nothing else .  i hate to think i   ll have to end by designing my own .         are you selling comet v .       selling it or junking it .  i   m tired of these late models .  they   re too automatic .  with their automatic relays and trajectory computers  they   re killing the sport .         you know  i   ve heard others say the same thing     agreed the committeeman .     tell you what .  if i hear of an old model in good condition on the market  i   ll let you know .         thanks .  mind if i wander about the place .         of course not .  go ahead .     the committeeman grinned  waved  trotted away .   genro made his slow rounds  his cigarette  half gone  drooping from one side of his mouth .  he stopped at each occupied hangar  appraising its contents shrewdly .   at hangar    he displayed a heightened interest .  he looked over the low barrier and said     squire .      the call was one of polite inquiry  but after a pause of several moments he had to call again  a little more peremptorily  a little less politely .   the squire who emerged to view was not an impressive sight .  for one thing  he was not in yachting costume .  secondly  he needed a shave  and his rather repellent looking skullcap was yanked down in a most unfashionable manner .  it seemed to cover half his face .  lastly  his attitude was one of peculiarly suspicious overcaution .   genro said     i   m markis genro .  is this your craft  sir .         yes  it is .     the words were slow and tense .   genro disregarded that .  he tilted his head back and looked over the yacht   s lines carefully .  he removed what was left of his cigarette from between his lips and flicked it high in the air .  it had not yet reached the high point of its arc when  with a little flash  it vanished .   genro said     i wonder if you   d mind my coming in .     the other hesitated  then stepped aside .  genro entered .   he said     what kind of motor does the craft carry  sir .         why do you ask .      genro was tall  skin and eyes were dark  hair crisp and cut short .  he topped the other by half a head  and his smile showed white  evenly spaced teeth .  he said     to be very frank  i   m in the market for a new ship .         you mean you   re interested in this one .         i don   t know .  something like it  maybe  if the price is right .  but anyway  i wonder if you   d mind my looking at the controls and engines .      the squire stood there silently .   genro   s voice grew a trifle colder .     as you please  of course .     he turned away .   the squire said     i might sell .     he fumbled in his pockets .     here   s the license .      genro looked at each side with a quick  experienced glance .  he handed it back .     you   re deamone .      the squire nodded .     you can come in if you wish .      genro looked briefly at the large port chronometer  the luminescent hands  sparking brightly even in the daylight illumination  indicating the beginning of the second hour after sunset .      thank you .  won   t you lead the way .      the squire rummaged his pockets again and held out a booklet of key slivers .     after you  sir .      genro took the booklet .  he leafed through the slivers  looking at the small code marks for the    ship stamp .     the other man made no attempt to help him .   finally he said     this one  i suppose .      he walked up the short ramp to the air lock balcony and considered the fine seam at the right of the lock carefully .     i don   t see  oh  here it is     and he stepped to the other side of the lock .   slowly  noiselessly  the lock yawned and genro moved into the blackness .  the red air lock light went on automatically as the door closed behind them .  the inner door opened and as they stepped into the ship proper white lights flickered on over all the length of the ship .     myrlyn terens had no choice .  he no longer remembered the time  long since  when such a thing as    choice    had existed .  for three long  wretched hours  now  he had remained near deamone   s ship  waiting and helpless to do anything else .  it had led to nothing till now .  he did not see that it could lead to anything but capture .   and then this fellow had come with an eye to the ship .  to deal with him at all was madness .  he could not possibly maintain his imposture at such close quarters .  but then he could not possibly remain where he was  either .   at least within the ship there might be food .  strange that that had not occurred to him before .   there was .   terens said     it   s close to dinnertime .  would you like to have something .      the other had scarcely looked over his shoulder .     why  later  perhaps .  thank you .      terens did not urge him .  he let him roam the ship and applied himself thankfully to the potted meat and cellulite wrapped fruit .  he drank thirstily .  there was a shower across the corridor from the kitchen .  he locked its door and bathed .  it was a pleasure to be able to remove the tight skullcap  at least temporarily .  he even found a shallow closet from which he could choose a change of clothing .   he was far more master of himself when genro returned .   genro said     say  would you mind if i tried to fly this ship .         i have no objection .  can you handle this model .     asked terens with an excellent imitation of nonchalance .      i think so     said the other with a little smile .     i flatter myself i can handle any of the regular models .  anyway  i   ve taken the liberty of calling the control tower and there   s a take off pit available .  here   s my yachtsman   s license if you   d like to see it before i take over .      terens gave it as cursory a glance as genro had given his .     the controls are yours     he said .     the ship rolled out of the hangar like an air borne whale  moving slowly  its diamagnetized hull clearing the smooth packed clay of the field by three inches .   terens watched genro handling the controls with finger tip precision .  the ship was a live thing under his touch .  the small replica of the field that was upon the visiplate shifted and changed with each tiny motion of every contact .   the ship came to a halt  pinpointed at the lip of a take off pit .  the diamagnetic field strengthened progressively towards the ship   s prow and it began tipping upward .  terens was mercifully unaware of this as the pilot room turned on its universal gimbals to meet the shifting gravity .  majestically  the ship   s rear flanges fitted into the appropriate grooves of the pit .  it stood upright  pointing to the sky .   the duralite cover of the take off pit slipped into its recess  revealing the neutralized lining  a hundred yards deep  that received the first energy thrusts of the hyperatomic motors .   genro kept up a cryptic exchange of information with the control tower .  finally     ten seconds to take off     he said .   a rising red thread in a quartz tube marked off the disappearing seconds .  it made contact and the first surge of power tore backward .   terens grew heavier  felt himself pressing against the seat .  panic tore at him .   he grunted     how does it handle .      genro seemed impervious to acceleration .  his voice had almost its natural timbre as he said     moderately well .      terens leaned back in his chair  trying to relax with the pressure  watching the stars in the visiplate turn hard and bright as the atmosphere vanished from between himself and them .  the kyrt next to his skin felt cold and damp .     they were out in space now .  genro was putting the ship through its paces .  terens had no way of telling that first hand but he could see the stars march steadily across the visiplate as the yachtsman   s long  slim fingers played with the controls as though they were the keys of a musical instrument .  finally a bulky orange segment of a globe filled the visiplate   s clear surface .      not bad     said genro .     you keep your craft in good condition  deamone .  it   s small but it has its points .      terens said carefully     i suppose you   d like to test its speed and its jumping capacity .  you may  if you like .  i have no objection .      genro nodded .     very well .  where do you suggest we take ourselves .  what about      he hesitated  then went on     well  why not to sark .      terens breathed a little more quickly .  he had expected that .  he was on the point of believing himself to be living in a world of magic .  how things forced his moves  even without his connivance .  it would not have been difficult to convince him that it was not    things    but design that prompted the moves .  his childhood had been steeped in the superstitions that the squires fostered among the natives and such things are hard to outgrow .  on sark was rik with his returning memories .  the game was not over .   he said wildly     why not  genro .      genro said     sark it is then .      with gathering speed  the globe of florina slanted out beyond the visiplate   s view and the stars returned .      what   s your best time on the sark florina run .     asked genro .      nothing record breaking     said terens .     about average .         then you   ve done it in better than six hours  i suppose .         on occasion  yes .         do you object to my trying to shave five .         not at all     said terens .     it took hours to reach a point far enough from star mass distortion of the space fabric to make a jump possible .   terens found wakefulness a torture .  this was his third night with little or no sleep and the tensions of the days had exaggerated that lack .   genro looked at him askance .     why don   t you turn in .      terens forced an expression of liveliness onto his sagging facial muscles .  he said     it   s nothing .  nothing .      he yawned prodigiously and smiled in apology .  the yachtsman turned back to his instruments and terens    eyes glazed over once again .   seats in a space yacht are comfortable by very necessity .  they must cushion the person against accelerations .  a man not particularly tired can easily and sweetly fall asleep upon them .  terens  who could  at the moment  have slept on broken glass  never knew when he passed the border line .   he slept for hours  he slept as deeply and as dreamlessly as ever in his life .   he did not stir  he showed no single sign of life other than his even breathing when the skullcap was removed from his head .     terens woke blearily  slowly .  for long minutes he had not the slightest notion of his whereabouts .  he thought he was back in his townman   s cottage .  the true state of affairs seeped back in stages .  eventually he could smile at genro  who was still at the controls  and say     i guess i fell asleep .         i guess you did .  there   s sark .     genro nodded toward the large white crescent in the visiplate .      when do we land .         about an hour .      terens was awake enough now to sense a subtle change in the other   s attitude .  it was an icy shock to him that the steel gray object in genro   s hand turned out to be the graceful barrel of a needle gun .      what in space      began terens  rising to his feet .      sit down     said genro carefully .  there was a skullcap in his other hand .   terens raised a hand to his head and his fingers found themselves clutching sandy hair .      yes     said genro     it   s quite obvious .  you   re a native .      terens stared and said nothing .   genro said     i knew you were a native before i ever got on poor deamone   s ship .      terens    mouth was cotton dry and his eyes burned .  he watched the tiny  deadly muzzle of the gun and waited for a sudden  noiseless flash .  he had carried it so far  so far  and had lost the gamble after all .   genro seemed in no hurry .  he held the needle gun steady and his words were even and slow .      your basic mistake  townman  was the thought that you could really outwit an organized police force indefinitely .  even so  you would have done better if you hadn   t made the unfortunate choice of deamone as your victim .         i didn   t choose him     croaked terens .      then call it luck .  alstare deamone  some twelve hours ago  was standing in city park  waiting for his wife .  there was no reason  other than sentiment  for him to meet her there of all places .  they had met in that very spot originally  and they met there again on every anniversary of that meeting .  there   s nothing particularly original about that sort of ceremony between young husbands and wives  but it seems important to them .  of course deamone did not realize that the comparative isolation of the spot made him an appropriate victim for a murderer .  who would have thought that in upper city .      in the ordinary course of events the murder might not have been discovered for days .  deamone   s wife  however  was on the scene within half an hour of the crime .  the fact that her husband was not there astonished her .  he was not the type  she explained  to leave in a fury because she herself was a trifle late .  she was often late .  he would more or less have expected that .  it occurred to her that her husband might be waiting for her inside    their    cave .      deamone had been waiting outside    their    cave  naturally .  it was the nearest one to the scene of the assault  consequently  and the one into which he was dragged .  his wife entered that cave and found well  you know what she found .  she managed to relay the news to the patrol corps through our own depsec offices  although she was almost incoherent with shock and hysteria .      how does it feel  townman  to kill a man in cold blood  leaving him to be found by his wife at the one spot most steeped with happy memories for them both .      terens was choking .  he gasped out  through a red mist of anger and frustration     you sarkites have killed millions of florinians .  women .  children .  you   ve grown rich out of us .  this yacht      it was all he could manage .      deamone wasn   t responsible for the state of affairs he found at birth     said genro .     if you had been born a sarkite  what would you have done .  resigned your estates  if any  and gone to work in the kyrt fields .         well then  shoot     cried terens  writhing .     what are you waiting for .         there   s no hurry .  there is plenty of time to finish my story .  we weren   t certain as to the identity of either the corpse or the murderer  but it was a very good guess that they were deamone and yourself respectively .  it seemed obvious to us from the fact that the ashes next to the body were of a patroller uniform that you were masquerading as a sarkite .  it seemed further probable that you would make for deamone   s yacht .  don   t overestimate our stupidity  townman .      matters were still rather complex .  you were a desperate man .  it was insufficient to track you down .  you were armed and would undoubtedly commit suicide if trapped .  suicide was something we did not wish .  they wanted you on sark and they wanted you in working order .      it was a particularly delicate affair for myself and it was quite necessary to convince depsec that i could handle it alone  that i could get you to sark without noise or difficulty .  you   ll have to admit that is just what i   m doing .      to tell you the truth  i wondered at first if you were really our man .  you were dressed in ordinary business costume on the yacht port grounds .  it was in incredibly bad taste .  no one  it seemed to me  would dream of impersonating a yachtsman without the proper costume .  i thought you were being deliberately sent in as a decoy  that you were trying to be arrested while the man we wanted escaped in another direction .      i hesitated and tested you in other ways .  i fumbled with the ship   s key in the wrong place .  no ship ever invented opened at the right side of the air lock .  it opens always and invariably at the left side .  you never showed any surprise at my mistake .  none at all .  then i asked you if your ship had ever made the sark florina run in less than six hours .  you said you had  occasionally .  that is quite remarkable .  the record time for the run is over nine hours .      i decided you couldn   t be a decoy .  the ignorance was too supreme .  you had to be naturally ignorant and probably the right man .  it was only a question of your falling asleep  and it was obvious from your face that you needed sleep desperately   disarming you and covering you quietly with an adequate weapon .  i removed your hat more out of curiosity than anything else .  i wanted to see what a sarkite costume looked like with a red haired head sticking out of it .      terens kept his eyes on the whip .  perhaps genro saw his jaw muscles bunch .  perhaps he simply guessed at what terens was thinking .   he said     of course i must not kill you  even if you jump me .  i can   t kill you even in self defense .  don   t think that gives you an advantage .  begin to move and i   ll shoot your leg off .      the fight went out of terens .  he put the heels of his palms to his forehead and sat rigid .   genro said softly     do you know why i tell you all this .      terens did not answer .      first     said genro     i rather enjoy seeing you suffer .  i don   t like murderers and i particularly don   t like natives who kill sarkites .  i   ve been ordered to deliver you alive but nothing in my orders says i have to make the trip pleasant for you .  secondly  it is necessary for you to be fully aware of the situation since  after we land on sark  the next steps will be up to you .      terens looked up .     what .         depsec knows you   re coming in .  the florinian regional office sent the word as soon as this craft cleared florina   s atmosphere .  you can be sure of that .  but i said it was quite necessary for me to convince depsec that i could handle this alone and the fact that i have makes all the difference .         i don   t understand you     said terens desperately .   with composure  genro answered     i said    they    wanted you on sark     they    wanted you in working order .  by    they    i don   t mean depsec  i mean trantor .          fourteen  the renegade      selim junz had never been the phlegmatic type .  a year of frustration had done nothing to improve that .  he could not sip wine carefully while his mental orientation sat upon suddenly trembling foundations .  in short  he was not ludigan abel .   and when junz had done with his angry shouting that on no account was sark to be allowed freedom to kidnap and imprison a member of the i . s . b .  regardless of the condition of trantor   s espionage network  abel merely said     i think you had better spend the night here  doctor .      junz said freezingly     i have better things to do .      abel said     no doubt  man  no doubt .  just the same  if my men are being blasted to death  sark must be bold indeed .  there is a great possibility that some accident may happen to you before the night is over .  let us wait a night then and see what comes of a new day .      junz   s protests against inaction came to nothing .  abel  without ever losing his cool  almost negligent air of indifference  was suddenly hard of hearing .  junz was escorted with firm courtesy to a chamber .   in bed  he stared at the faintly luminous  frescoed ceiling  on which glowed a moderately skillful copy of lenhaden   s    battle of the arcturian moons     and knew he would not sleep .  then he caught one whiff  a faint one  of the gas  somnin  and was asleep before he could catch another .  five minutes later  when a forced draft swept the room clean of the anesthetic  enough had been administered to assure a healthful eight hours .     he was awakened in the cold half light of dawn .  he blinked up at abel .      what time is it .     he asked .      six .         great space .     he looked about and thrust his bony legs out from under the sheet .     you   re up early .         i haven   t slept .         what .         i feel the lack  believe me .  i don   t respond to antisomnin as i did when i was younger .      junz murmured     if you will allow me a moment .      this once his morning preparations for the day took scarcely more than that .  he re entered the room  drawing the belt about his tunic and adjusting the magneto seam .      well .     he asked .     surely you don   t wake through the night and rouse me at six unless you have something to tell me .         you   re right .  you   re right .     abel sat down on the bed vacated by junz and threw his head back in a laugh .  it was high pitched and rather subdued .  his teeth showed  their strong  faintly yellow plastic incongruous against his shrunken gums .      i beg your pardon  junz     he said .     i am not quite myself .  this drugged wakefulness has me a little lightheaded .  i almost think i will advise trantor to replace me with a younger man .      junz said  with a flavor of sarcasm not entirely unmixed with sudden hope     you find they haven   t got the spatio analyst after all .         no  they do .  i   m sorry but they do .  i   m afraid that my amusement is due entirely to the fact that our nets are intact .      junz would have liked to say     damn your nets     but refrained .   abel went on     there is no doubt they knew khorov was one of our agents .  they may know of others on florina .  those are small fry .  the sarkites knew that and never felt it worth while to do more than hold them under observation .         they killed one     junz pointed out .      they did not     retorted abel .     it was one of the spatio analyst   s own companions in a patroller disguise who used the blaster .      junz stared .     i don   t understand .         it   s a rather complicated story .  won   t you join me at breakfast .  i need food badly .        over the coffee  abel told the story of the last thirty six hours .  junz was stunned .  he put down his own coffee cup  half full  and returned to it no more .     even allowing them to have stowed away on that ship of all ships  the fact still remains they might not have been detected .  if you send men to meet that ship as it lands          bah .  you know better than that .  no modem ship could fail to detect the presence of excess body heat .         it might have been overlooked .  instruments may be infallible but men are not .         wishful thinking .  look here .  at the very time that the ship with the spatio analyst aboard is approaching sark  there are reports of excellent reliability that the squire of fife is in conference with the other great squires .  these intercontinental conferences are spaced as widely as the stars of the galaxy .  coincidence .         an intercontinental conference over a spatio analyst .         an unimportant subject in itself  yes .  but we have made it important .  the i . s . b .  has been searching for him for nearly a year with remarkable pertinacity .         not the i . s . b .      insisted junz .     myself .  i   ve been working in almost an unofficial manner .         the squires don   t know that and wouldn   t believe it if you told them .  then  too  trantor has been interested .         at my request .         again they don   t know that and wouldn   t believe it .      junz stood up and his chair moved automatically away from the table .  hands firmly interlocked behind his back  he strode the carpet .  up and back .  up and back .  at intervals he glanced harshly at abel .   abel turned unemotionally to a second cup of coffee .   junz said     how do you know all this .         all what .         everything .  how and when the spatio analyst stowed away .  how and in what manner the townman has been eluding capture .  is it your purpose to deceive me .         my dear dr .  junz .         you admitted you had your men watching for the spatio analyst independently of myself .  you saw to it that i was safely out of the way last night  leaving nothing to chance .     junz remembered  suddenly  that whiff of somnin .      i spent a night  doctor  in constant communication with certain of my agents .  what i did and what i learned comes under the heading of  shall we say  classified material .  you had to be out of the way  and yet safe .  what i have told you just now i learned from my agents last night .         to learn what you did you would need spies in the sarkite government itself .         well  naturally .      junz whirled on the ambassador .     come  now .         you find that surprising .  to be sure  sark is proverbial for the stability of its government and the loyalty of its people .  the reason is simple enough since even the poorest sarkite is an aristocrat in comparison with florinians and can consider himself  however fallaciously  to be a member of a ruling class .      consider  though  that sark is not the world of billionaires most of the galaxy thinks it is .  a year   s residence must have well convinced you of that .  eighty per cent of its population has its living standard at a par with that of other worlds and not much higher than the standard of florina itself .  there will always be a certain number of sarkites who  in their hunger  will be sufficiently annoyed with the small fraction of the population obviously drenched in luxury to lend themselves to my uses .      it is the great weakness of the sarkite government that for centuries they have associated rebellion only with florina .  they have forgotten to watch over themselves .      junz said     these small sarkites  assuming they exist  can   t do you much good .         individually  no .  collectively  they form useful tools for our more important men .  there are members even of the real ruling class who have taken the lessons of the last two centuries to heart .  they are convinced that in the end trantor will have established its rule over all the galaxy  and  i believe  rightly convinced .  they even suspect that the final dominion may take place within their lifetimes  and they prefer to establish themselves  in advance  on the winning side .      junz grimaced .     you make interstellar politics sound a very dirty game .         it is  but disapproving of dirt doesn   t remove it .  nor are all its facets unrelieved dirt .  consider the idealist .  consider the few men in sark   s government who serve trantor neither for money nor for promises of power but only because they honestly believe that a unified galactic government is best for humanity and that only trantor can bring such a government about .  i have one such man  my best one  in sark   s department of security  and at this moment he is bringing in the townman .      junz said     you said he had been captured .         by depsec  yes .  but my man is depsec and my man .     for a moment abel frowned and turned pettish .     his usefulness will be sharply reduced after this .  once he lets the townman get away  it will mean demotion at the best and imprisonment at the worst .  oh well .         what are you planning now .         i scarcely know .  first  we must have our townman .  i am sure of him only to the point of arrival at the spaceport .  what happens thereafter  .   .   .     abel shrugged  and his old  yellowish skin stretched parchmentlike over his cheekbones .   then he added     the squires will be waiting for the townman as well .  they are under the impression they have him  and until one or the other of us has him in our fists  nothing more can happen .      but that statement was wrong .     strictly speaking  all foreign embassies throughout the galaxy maintained extraterritorial rights over the immediate areas of their location .  generally this amounted to nothing more than a pious wish  except where the strength of the home planet enforced respect .  in actual practice it meant that only trantor could truly maintain the independence of its envoys .   the grounds of the trantorian embassy covered nearly a square mile and within it armed men in trantorian costume and insignia maintained patrol .  no sarkite might enter but on invitation  and no armed sarkite on any account .  to be sure  the sum of trantorian men and arms could withstand the determined attack of a single sarkite armored regiment for not more than two or three hours  but behind the small band was the power of reprisal from the organized might of a million worlds .   it remained inviolate .   it could even maintain direct material communication with trantor  without the need of passing through sarkite ports of entry or debarkation .  from the hold of a trantorian mothership  hovering just outside the hundred mile limit that marked off the boundary between    planetary space    and    free space     small gyro ships  vane equipped for atmospheric travel with minimum power expenditure  might emerge and needle down  half coasting  half driven  to the small port maintained within the embassy grounds .   the gyro ship which now appeared over the embassy port  however  was neither scheduled nor trantorian .  the mosquito might of the embassy was brought quickly and truculently into play .  a needle cannon lifted its puckered muzzle into the air .  force screens went up .   radioed messages whipped back and forth .  stubborn words rode the impulses upward  agitated ones slipped down .   lieutenant camrum turned away from the instrument and said     i don   t know .  he claims he   ll be shot out of the sky in two minutes if we don   t let him down .  he claims sanctuary .      captain elyut had just entered .  he said     sure .  then sark will claim we   re interfering in politics and if trantor decides to let things ride  you and i are broken as a gesture .     who is he .         won   t say     said the lieutenant with more than a little exasperation .     says he must speak to the ambassador .  suppose you tell me what to do  captain .      the short wave receiver sputtered and a voice  half hysterical  said     is anyone there .  i   m just coming down  that   s all .  really .  i can   t wait another moment  i tell you .     it ended in a squeak .   the captain said     great space  i know that voice .  let him down .  my responsibility .      the orders went out .  the gyro ship sank vertically  more quickly than it should have  the result of a hand at the controls that was both inexperienced and panicky .  the needle cannon maintained focus .   the captain established a through line to abel and the embassy was thrown into full emergency .  the flight of sarkite ships that hovered overhead not ten minutes after the first vessel had landed maintained a threatening vigil for two hours  then departed .     they sat at dinner  abel  junz and the newcomer .  with admirable aplomb  considering the circumstances  abel had acted the unconcerned host .  for hours he had refrained from asking why a great squire needed sanctuary .   junz was far less patient .  he hissed at abel     space .  what are you going to do with him .      and abel smiled back .     nothing .  at least until i find out whether i have my townman or not .  i like to know what my hand is before tossing chips onto the table .  and since he   s come to me  waiting will rattle him more than it will us .      he was right .  twice the squire launched into rapid monolog and twice abel said     my dear squire .  surely serious conversation is unpleasant on an empty stomach .     he smiled gently and ordered dinner .   over the wine  the squire tried again .  he said     you   ll want to know why i have left steen continent .         i cannot conceive of any reason     admitted abel     for the squire of steen ever to have fled from sarkite vessels .      steen watched them carefully .  his slight figure and thin  pale face were tense with calculation .  his long hair was bound into carefully arranged tufts held by tiny clips that rubbed against one another with a rustling sound whenever he moved his head  as though to call attention to his disregard for the current sarkite clipped hair fashion .  a faint fragrance came from his skin and clothing .   abel  who did not miss the slight tightening of junz   s lips and the quick way in which the spatio analyst patted his own short  woolly hair  thought how amusing junz   s reaction might have been if steen had appeared more typically  with rouged cheeks and coppered fingernails .   steen said     there was an intercontinental conference today .         really .     said abel .   abel listened to the tale of the conference without a quiver of countenance .      and we have twenty four hours     steen said indignantly .     it   s sixteen hours now .  really .         and you   re x     cried junz  who had been growing increasingly restless during the recitation .     you   re x .  you   ve come here because he   s caught you .  well now  that   s fine .  abel  here   s our proof as to the identity of the spatio analyst .  we can use him to force a surrender of the man .      steen   s thin voice had difficulty making itself heard over junz   s staunch baritone .      now really .  i say  now really .  you   re mad .  stop it .  let me speak  i tell you .   .   .   .  your excellency  i can   t remember this man   s name .         dr .  selim junz  squire .         well then  dr .  selim junz  i have never in my life seen this idiot or spatio analyst or whatever in the world he may be .  really .  i never heard such nonsense .  i am certainly not x .  really .  i   ll thank you not even to use the silly letter .  imagine believing fife   s ridiculous melodrama .  really .      junz clung to his notion .     why did you run then .         good sark  isn   t it clear .  oh  i could choke .  really .  look here  don   t you see what fife was doing .      abel interrupted quietly .     if you   ll explain  squire  there will be no interruptions .         well  thank you at least .     he continued  with an air of wounded dignity .     the others don   t think much of me because i don   t see the point of bothering with documents and statistics and all those boring details .  but  really  what is the civil service for  i   d like to know .  if a great squire can   t be a great squire .      still that doesn   t mean i   m a ninny  you know  just because i like my comfort .  really .  maybe the others are blind  but i can see that fife doesn   t give a darn for the spatio analyst .  i don   t even think he exists .  fife just got the idea a year ago and he   s been manipulating it ever since .      he   s been playing us for fools and idiots .  really .  and so the others are .  disgusting fools .  he   s arranged all this perfectly awful nonsense about idiots and spatio analysis .  i wouldn   t be surprised if the native who   s supposed to be killing patrollers by the dozen isn   t just one of fife   s spies in a red wig .  or if he   s a real native  i suppose fife has hired him .      i wouldn   t put it past fife .  really .  he would use natives against his own kind .  that   s how low he is .      anyway  it   s obvious that he   s using it just as an excuse to ruin the rest of us and to make himself dictator of sark .  isn   t it obvious to you .      there isn   t any x at all  but tomorrow  unless he   s stopped  he   ll spread the sub etherics full of conspiracies and declarations of emergencies and he   ll have himself declared leader .  we haven   t had a leader on sark in five hundred years but that won   t stop fife .  he   d just let the constitution go hang .  really .      only i mean to stop him .  that   s why i had to leave .  if i were still in steen  i   d be under house arrest .      as soon as the conference was over i had my own personal port checked  and  you know  his men had taken over .  it was in clear disregard of continental autonomy .  it was the act of a cad .  really .  but nasty as he is  he isn   t so bright .  he thought some of us might try to leave the planet so he had the spaceports watched  but     here he smiled in vulpine fashion and emitted the ghost of a giggle     it didn   t occur to him to watch the gyro ports .      probably he thought there wasn   t a place on the planet that would be safe for us .  but i thought of the trantorian embassy .  it   s more than the others did .  they make me tired .  especially bort .  do you know bort .  he   s terribly uncouth .  actually dirty .  talks at me as though there were something wrong with being clean and smelling pleasant .      he put his finger tips to his nose and inhaled gently .   abel put a light hand on junz   s wrist as the latter moved restlessly in his seat .  abel said     you have left a family behind .  have you thought that fife can still hold a weapon over you .         i couldn   t very well pile all my pretty ones in my gyroplane .     he reddened a trifle .     fife wouldn   t dare touch them .  besides  i   ll be back in steen tomorrow .         how .     asked abel .   steen looked at him in astonishment .  his thin lips parted .     i   m offering alliance  your excellency .  you can   t pretend trantor isn   t interested in sark .  surely you   ll tell fife that any attempt to change sark   s constitution would necessitate trantor   s intervention .         i scarcely see how that can be done  even if i felt my government would back me     said abel .      how can it not be done .     asked steen indignantly .     if he controls the entire kyrt trade he   ll raise the price  ask concessions for rapid delivery and all sorts of things .         don   t the five of you control the price as is .      steen threw himself back in the seat .     well  really .  i don   t know all the details .  next you   ll be asking me for figures .  goodness  you   re as bad as bort .     then he recovered and giggled .     i   m just teasing  of course .  what i mean is that  with fife out of the way  trantor might make an arrangement with the rest of us .  in return for your help  it would only be right that trantor get preferential treatment  or even maybe a small interest in the trade .         and how would we keep intervention from developing into a galaxy wide war .         oh  but really  don   t you see .  it   s plain as day .  you wouldn   t be aggressors .  you would just be preventing civil war to keep the kyrt trade from disruption .  i   d announce that i   d appealed to you for help .  it would be worlds removed from aggression .  the whole galaxy would be on your side .  of course  if trantor benefits from it afterward  why  that   s nobody   s business at all .  really .      abel put his gnarled fingers together and regarded them .     i can   t believe you really mean to join forces with trantor .      an intense look of hatred passed momentarily over steen   s weakly smiling face .  he said     rather trantor than fife .      abel said     i don   t like threatening force .  can   t we wait and let matters develop a bit          no  no     cried steen .     not a day .  really .  if you   re not firm now  right now  it will be too late .  once the deadline is past  he   ll have gone too far to retreat without losing face .  if you   ll help me now  the people of steen will back me  the other great squires will join me .  if you wait even a day  fife   s propaganda mill will begin to grind .  i   ll be smeared as a renegade .  really .  i .  i .  a renegade .  he   ll use all the anti trantor prejudice he can whip up and you know  meaning no offense  that   s quite a bit .         suppose we ask him to allow us to interview the spatio analyst .         what good will that do .  he   ll play both ends .  he   ll tell us the florinian idiot is a spatio analyst  but he   ll tell you the spatio analyst is a florinian idiot .  you don   t know the man .  he   s awful .      abel considered that .  he hummed to himself  his forefinger keeping gentle time .  then he said     we have the townman  you know .             what townman .         the one who killed the patrollers and the sarkite .         oh .  well  really .  do you suppose fife will care about that if it   s a question of taking all sark .         i think so .  you see  it isn   t that we have the townman .  it   s the circumstances of his capture .  i think  squire  that fife will listen to me and listen very humbly  too .      for the first time in his acquaintance with abel  junz sensed a lessening of coolness in the old man   s voice  a substitution for it of satisfaction  almost of triumph .       fifteen  the captive      it was not very usual for the lady samia of fife to feel frustrated .  it was unprecedented  even inconceivable  that she had felt frustrated for hours now .   the commander of the spaceport was captain racety all over again .  he was polite  almost obsequious  looked unhappy  expressed his regrets  denied the least willingness to contradict her  and stood like iron against her plainly stated wishes .   she was finally forced from stating her desires to demanding her rights as though she were a common sarkite .  she said     i suppose that as a citizen i have the right to meet any incoming vessel if i wish .      she was poisonous about it .   the commander cleared his throat and the expression of pain on his lined face grew  if anything  clearer and more definite .  finally he said     as a matter of fact  my lady  we have no wish at all to exclude you .  it is only that we have received specific orders from the squire  your father  to forbid your meeting the ship .      samia said frozenly     are you ordering me to leave the port  then .         no  my lady .     the commander was glad to compromise .     we were not ordered to exclude you from the port .  if you wish to remain here you may do so .  but  with all due respect  we will have to stop you from approaching closer to the pits .      he was gone and samia sat in the futile luxury of her private ground car  a hundred feet inside the outermost entrance of the port .  they had been waiting and watching for her .  they would probably keep on watching her .  if she as much as rolled a wheel onward  she thought indignantly  they would probably cut her power drive .   she gritted her teeth .  it was unfair of her father to do this .  it was all of a piece .  they always treated her as though she understood nothing .  yet she had thought he understood .   he had risen from his seat to greet her  a thing he never did for anyone else now that mother was dead .  he had clasped her  squeezed her tightly  abandoned all his work for her .  he had even sent his secretary out of the room because he knew she was repelled by the native   s still  white countenance .   it was almost like the old days before grandfather died when father had not yet become great squire .   he said     mia  child  i   ve counted the hours .  i never knew it was such a long way from florina .  when i heard that those natives had hidden on your ship  the one i had sent just to insure your safety  i was nearly wild .         daddy .  there was nothing to worry about .         wasn   t there .  i almost sent out the entire fleet to take you off and bring you in with full military security .      they laughed together at the thought .  minutes passed before samia could bring the conversation back to the subject that filled her .   she said casually     what are you going to do with the stowaways  dad .         why do you want to know  mia .         you don   t think they   ve plans to assassinate you  or anything like that .      fife smiled .     you shouldn   t think morbid thoughts .         you don   t think so  do you .     she insisted .      of course not .         good .  because i   ve talked to them  dad  and i just don   t believe they   re anything more than poor harmless people .  i don   t care what captain racety says .         they   ve broken a considerable number of laws for    poor harmless people     mia .         you can   t treat them as common criminals  dad .     her voice rose in alarm .      how else .         the man isn   t a native .  he   s from a planet called earth and he   s been psycho probed and he   s not responsible .         well then  dear  depsec will realize that .  suppose you leave it to them .         no  it   s too important to just leave to them .  they won   t understand .  nobody understands .  except me .         only you in the whole world  mia .     he asked indulgently  and put out a finger to stroke a lock of hair that had fallen over her forehead .   samia said with energy     only i .  only i .  everyone else is going to think he   s crazy  but i   m sure he isn   t .  he says there is some great danger to florina and to all the galaxy .  he   s a spatio analyst and you know they specialize in cosmogony .  he would know .       how do you know he   s a spatio analyst  mia .         he says so .         and what are the details of the danger .         he doesn   t know .  he   s been psycho probed .  don   t you see that that   s the best evidence of all .  he knew too much .  someone was interested in keeping it dark .     her voice instinctively fell and grew huskily confidential .  she restrained an impulse to look over her shoulder .  she said     if his theories were false  don   t you see  there wouldn   t have been any need to psycho probe him .         why didn   t they kill him  if that   s the case .     asked fife and instantly regretted the question .  there was no use in teasing the girl .   samia thought awhile  fruitlessly  then said     if you   ll order depsec to let me speak to him  i   ll find out .  he trusts me .  i know he does .  i   ll get more out of him than depsec can .  please tell depsec to let me see him  dad .  it   s very important .      fife squeezed her clenched fists gently and smiled at her .     not yet  mia .  not yet .  in a few hours we   ll have the third person in our hands .  after that  perhaps .         the third person .  the native who did all the killings .         exactly .  the ship carrying him will land in about an hour .         and you won   t do anything with the native girl and the spatio analyst till then .         not a thing .         good .  i   ll meet the ship .     she rose .      where are you going  mia .         to the port  father .  i have a great deal to ask of this other native .     she laughed .     i   ll show you that your daughter can be quite a detective .      but fife did not respond to her laughter .  he said     i   d rather you didn   t .         why not .         it   s essential that there be nothing out of the way about this man   s arrival .  you   d be too conspicuous at the port .         what of it .         i can   t explain statecraft to you  mia .         statecraft  pooh .     she leaned toward him  pecked a quick kiss at the center of his forehead and was gone .   now she sat helplessly car bound in the port while far overhead there was a growing speck in the sky  dark against the brightness of the late afternoon .   she pressed the button that opened the utility compartment and took out her polo glasses .  ordinarily they were used to follow the gyrating antics of the one man speedsters which took part in stratospheric polo .  they could be put to more serious use too .  she put them to her eyes and the descending dot became a ship in miniature  the ruddy glow of its stern drive plainly visible .   she would at least see the men as they left  learn as much as she could by the one sense of sight  arrange an interview somehow  somehow thereafter .   sark filled the visiplate .  a continent and half an ocean  obscured in part by the dead cotton white of clouds  lay below .   genro said  his words a trifle uneven as the only indication that the better part of his mind was perforce on the controls before him     the spaceport will not be heavily guarded .  that was at my suggestion too .  i said that any unusual treatment of the arrival of the ship might warn trantor that something was up .  i said that success depended upon trantor being at no time aware of the true state of affairs until it was too late .  well  never mind that .      terens shrugged his shoulders glumly .     what   s the difference .         plenty  to you .  i will use the landing pit nearest the east gate .  you will get out the safety exit in the rear as soon as i land .  walk quickly but not too quickly toward that gate .  i have some papers that may get you through without trouble and may not .  i   ll leave it to you to take necessary action if there is trouble .  from past history  i judge i can trust you that far .  outside the gate there will be a car waiting to take you to the embassy .  that   s all .         what about you .      slowly sark was changing from a huge featureless sphere of blinding browns and greens and blues and cloud white into something more alive  into a surface broken by rivers and wrinkled by mountains .   genro   s smile was cool and humorless .     your worries may end with yourself .  when they find you gone  i may be shot as a traitor .  if they find me completely helpless and physically unable to stop you  they may merely demote me as a fool .  the latter  i suppose  is preferable  so i will ask you  before you leave  to use a neuronic whip on me .      the townman said     do you know what a neuronic whip is like .         quite .     there were small drops of perspiration at his temples .      how do you know i won   t kill you afterward .  i   m a squire killer  you know .         i know .  but killing me won   t help you .  it will just waste your time .  i   ve taken worse chances .      the surface of sark as viewed in the visiplate was expanding  its edges rushed out past the border of visibility  its center grew and the new edges rushed out in turn .  something like the rainbow of a sarkite city could be made out .      i hope     said genro     you have no ideas of striking out on your own .  sark is no place for that .  it   s either trantor or the squires .  remember .      the view was definitely that of a city now and a green brown patch on its outskirts expanded and became a spaceport below them .  it floated up toward them at a slowing pace .   genro said     if trantor doesn   t have you in the next hour the squires will have you before the day is out .  i don   t guarantee what trantor will do to you  but i can guarantee what sark will do to you .      terens had been in the civil service .  he knew what sark would do with a squire killer .   the port held steady in the visiplate  but genro no longer regarded it .  he was switching to instruments  riding the pulse beam downward .  the ship turned slowly in air  a mile high  and settled  tail down .   a hundred yards above the pit  the engines thundered high .  over the hydraulic springs  terens could feel their shuddering .  he grew giddy in his seat .   genro said     take the whip .  quickly now .  every second is important .  the emergency lock will close behind you .  it will take them five minutes to wonder why i don   t open the main lock  another five minutes to break in  another five minutes to find you .  you have fifteen minutes to get out of the port and into the car .      the shuddering ceased and in the thick silence terens knew they had made contact with sark .   the shifting diamagnetic fields took over .  the yacht tipped majestically and slowly moved down upon its side .   genro said     now .     his uniform was wet with perspiration .   terens  with swimming head  and eyes that all but refused to focus  raised his neuronic whip .   .     terens felt the nip of a sarkite autumn .  he had spent years in its harsh seasons until he had almost forgotten the soft eternal june of florina .  now his days in civil service rushed back upon him as though he had never left this world of squires .   except that now he was a fugitive and branded upon him was the ultimate crime  the murder of a squire .   he was walking in time to the pounding of his heart .  behind him was the ship and in it was genro  frozen in the agony of the whip .  the lock had closed softly behind him  and he was walking down a broad  paved path .  there were workmen and mechanics in plenty about him .  each had his own job and his own troubles .  they didn   t stop to stare a man in the face .  they had no reason to .   had anyone actually seen him emerge from the ship .   he told himself no one had  or by now there would have been the clamor of pursuit .   he touched his hat briefly .  it was still down over his ears  and the little medallion it now carried was smooth to the touch .  genro had said that it would act as identification .  the men from trantor would be watching for just that medallion  glinting in the sun .   he could remove it  wander away on his own  find his way to another ship  somehow .  he would get away from sark   somehow .  he would escape  somehow .   too many somehows .  in his heart he knew he had come to the final end  and as genro had said  it was either trantor or sark .  he hated and feared trantor  but he knew that in any choice it could not and must not be sark .        you .  you there .      terens froze .  he looked up in cold panic .  the gate was a hundred feet away .  if he ran .   .   .  but they wouldn   t allow a running man to get out .  it was a thing he dared not do .  he must not run .   the young woman was looking out the open window of a car such as terens had never seen  not even during fifteen years on sark .  it gleamed with metal and sparkled with translucent gemmite .   she said     come here .      terens    legs carried him slowly to the car .  genro had said trantor   s car would be waiting outside the port .  or had he .  and would they send a woman on such an errand .  a girl  in fact .  a girl with a dark  beautiful face .   she said     you arrived on the ship that just landed  didn   t you .      he was silent .   she became impatient .     come  i saw you leave the ship .     she tapped her polo glasses .  he had seen such glasses before .   terens mumbled     yes .  yes .         get in then .      she held the door open for him .  the car was even more luxurious inside .  the seat was soft and it all smelled new and fragrant and the girl was beautiful .   she said     are you a member of the crew .      she was testing him  terens imagined .  he said     you know who i am .     he raised his fingers momentarily to the medallion .   without any sound of motive power the car backed and turned .   at the gate terens shrank back into the soft  cool  kyrt covered upholstery  but there was no need for caution .  the girl spoke peremptorily and they passed through .   she said     this man is with me .  i am samia of fife .      it took seconds for the tired terens to hear and understand that .  when he lurched tensely forward in his seat the car was traveling along the express lanes at a hundred per .     a laborer within the port looked up from where he stood and muttered briefly into his lapel .  he entered the building then and returned to his work .  his superintendent frowned and made a mental note to talk to tip about this habit of lingering outside to smoke cigarettes for half an hour at a time .   outside the port one of two men in a ground car said with annoyance     got into a car with a girl .  what car .  what girl .     for all his sarkite costume  his accent belonged definitely to the arcturian worlds of the trantorian empire .   his companion was a sarkite  well versed in the visicast news releases .  when the car in question rolled through the gate and picked up speed as it began to veer off and upward to the express level  he half rose in his seat and cried     it   s the lady samia   s car .  there isn   t another like it .  good galaxy  what do we do .         follow     said the other briefly .      but the lady samia          she   s nothing to me .  she shouldn   t be anything to you either .  or what are you doing here .      their own car was making the turn  climbing upward onto the broad  nearly empty stretches on which only the speediest of ground travel was permitted .   the sarkite groaned     we can   t catch that car .  as soon as she spots us she   ll kick out resistance .  that car can make two fifty .         she   s staying at a hundred so far     said the arcturian .   after a while he said     she   s not going to depsec .  that   s for sure .      and after another while he said     she   s not going to the palace of fife .      still another interval and he said     i   ll be spun in space if i know where she   s going .  she   ll be leaving the city again .      the sarkite said     how do we know it   s the squire killer that   s in there .  suppose it   s a game to get us away from the post .  she   s not trying to shake us and she wouldn   t use a car like that if she didn   t want to be followed .  you can   t miss it at two miles .         i know  but fife wouldn   t send his girl to get us out of the way .  a squad of patrollers would have done the job better .         maybe it isn   t really the lady in it .         we   re going to find out  man .  she   s slowing .  flash past and stop around a curve .         i want to speak to you     said the girl .   terens decided it was not the ordinary kind of trap he had first considered it .  she was the lady of fife .  she must be .  it did not seem to occur to her that anyone could or ought to interfere with her .   she had never looked back to see if she were followed .  three times as they turned he had noted the same car to the rear  keeping its distance  neither closing the gap nor falling behind .   it was not just a car .  that was certain .  it might be trantor  which would be well .  it might be sark  in which case the lady would be a decent sort of hostage .   he said     i   m ready to speak .      she said     you were on the ship that brought the native from florina .  the one wanted for all those killings .         i said i was .         very well .  now i   ve brought you out here so that there   ll be no interference .  was the native questioned during the trip to sark .      such na  vet    terens thought  could not be assumed .  she really did not know who he was .  he said guardedly     yes .         were you present at the questioning .         yes .         good .  i thought so .  why did you leave the ship  by the way .      that  thought terens  was the question she should have asked first of all .   he said     i was to bring a special report to      he hesitated .  she seized on the hesitation eagerly .     to my father .  don   t worry about that .  i   ll protect you completely .  i   ll say you came with me at my orders .      he said     very well  my lady .      the words    my lady    struck deeply into his own consciousness .  she was a lady  the greatest in the land  and he was a florinian .  a man who could kill patrollers could learn easily how to kill squires  and a squire killer might  by the same token  look a lady in the face .   he looked at her  his eyes hard and searching .  he lifted his head and stared down at her .   she was very beautiful .   and because she was the greatest lady in the land  she was unconscious of his regard .  she said     i want you to tell me everything that you heard at the questioning .  i want to know all that was told to you by the native .  it   s very important .         may i ask why you are interested in the native  my lady .         you may not     she said flatly .      as you wish  my lady .      he didn   t know what he was going to say .  with half his consciousness he was waiting for the pursuing car to catch up .  with the other half he was growing more aware of the face and body of the beautiful girl sitting near him .   florinians in the civil service and those acting as townmen were  theoretically  celibates .  in actual practice  most evaded that restriction when they could .  terens had done what he dared and what was expedient in that direction .  at best  his experiences had never been satisfactory .   so it was all the more important that he had never been so near a beautiful girl in a car of such luxuriance under conditions of such isolation .   she was waiting for him to speak  dark eyes  such dark eyes  aflame with interest  full red lips parted in anticipation  a figure more beautiful for being set off in beautiful kyrt .  she was completely unaware that anyone  anyone  could possibly dare harbor dangerous thought with regard to the lady of fife .   the half of his consciousness that waited for the pursuers faded out .   he suddenly knew that the killing of a squire was not the ultimate crime after all .   he wasn   t quite aware that he moved .  he knew only that her small body was in his arms  that it stiffened  that for an instant she cried out  and then he smothered the cry with his lips     there were hands on his shoulder and the drift of cool air on his back through the opened door of the car .  his fingers groped for his weapon  too late .  it was ripped from his hand .   samia gasped wordlessly .   the sarkite said with horror     did you see what he did .      the arcturian said     never mind .      he put a small black object into his pocket and smoothed the seam shut .     get him     he said .   the sarkite dragged terens out of the car with the energy of fury .     and she let him     he muttered .     she let him .         who are you .     cried samia with sudden energy .     did my father send you .      the arcturian said     no questions  please .         you   re a foreigner     said samia angrily .   the sarkite said     by sark  i ought to bust his head in .     he cocked his fist .      stop it .     said the arcturian .  he seized the sarkite   s wrist and forced it back .   the sarkite growled sullenly     there are limits .  i can take the squire killing .  i   d like to kill a few myself  but standing by and watching a native do what he did is just about too much for me .      samia said in an unnaturally high pitched voice     native .      the sarkite leaned forward  snatched viciously at terens    cap .  the townman paled but did not move .  he kept his gaze steadily upon the girl and his sandy hair moved slightly in the breeze .   samia moved helplessly back along the car seat as far as she could and then  with a quick movement  she covered her face with both hands  her skin turning white under the pressure of her fingers .   the sarkite said     what are we going to do with her .         nothing .         she saw us  she   ll have the whole planet after us before we   ve gone a mile .         are you going to kill the lady of fife .     asked the arcturian sarcastically .      well  no .  but we can wreck her car .  by the time she gets to a radio phone  we   ll be all right .         not necessary .     the arcturian leaned into the car .     my lady  i have only a moment .  can you hear me .      she did not move .   the arcturian said     you had better hear me .  i am sorry i interrupted you at a tender moment but luckily i have put that moment to use .  i acted quickly and was able to record the scene by tri camera .  this is no bluff .  i will transmit the negative to a safe place minutes after i leave you and thereafter any interference on your part will force me to be rather nasty .  i   m sure you understand me .      he turned away .     she won   t say anything about this .  not a thing .  come along with me  townman .      terens followed .  he could not look back at the white  pinched face in the car .   whatever might now follow  he had accomplished a miracle .  for one moment he had kissed the proudest lady on sark  had felt the fleeting touch of her soft  fragrant lips .       sixteen  the accused      diplomacy has a language and a set of attitudes all its own .  relationships between the representatives of sovereign states  if conducted strictly according to protocol  are stylized and stultifying .  the phrase    unpleasant consequences    becomes synonymous with war and    suitable adjustment    with surrender .   when on his own  abel preferred to abandon diplomatic double talk .  with a tight personal beam connecting himself and fife  he might merely have been an elderly man talking amiably over a glass of wine .   he said     you have been hard to reach  fife .      fife smiled .  he seemed at ease and undisturbed .     a busy day  abel .         yes .  i   ve heard a bit about it .         steen .     fife was casual .      partly .  steen   s been with us about seven hours .         i know .  my own fault  too .  are you considering turning him over to us .         i   m afraid not .         he   s a criminal .      abel chuckled and turned the goblet in his hand  watching the lazy bubbles .     i think we can make out a case for his being a political refugee .  interstellar law will protect him on trantorian territory .         will your government back you .         i think it will  fife .  i haven   t been in the foreign service for thirty seven years without knowing what trantor will back and what it won   t .         i can have sark ask for your recall .         what good would that do .  i m a peaceable man with whom you are well acquainted .  my successor might be anybody .      there was a pause .  fife   s leonine countenance puckered .     i think you have a suggestion .         i do .  you have a man of ours .         what man of yours .         a spatio analyst .  a native of the planet earth  which  by the way  is part of the trantorian domain .         steen told you this .         among other things .         has he seen this earthman .         he hasn   t said he has .         well  he hasn   t .  under the circumstances  i doubt that you can have faith in his word .      abel put down his glass .  he clasped his hands loosely in his lap and said     just the same  i   m sure the earthman exists .  i tell you  fife  we should get together on this .  i have steen and you have the earthman .  in a sense we   re even .  before you go on with your current plans  before your ultimatum expires and your coup d   etat takes place  why not a conference on the kyrt situation generally .         i don   t see the necessity .  what is happening on sark now is an internal matter entirely .  i m quite willing to guarantee personally that there will be no interference with the kyrt trade regardless of political events here .  i think that should end trantor   s legitimate interests .      abel sipped at his wine  seemed to consider .  he said     it seems we have a second political refugee .  a curious case .  one of your florinian subjects  by the way .  a townman .  myrlyn terens  he calls himself .      fife   s eyes blazed suddenly .     we half suspected that .  by sark  abel  there   s a limit to the open interference of trantor on this planet .  the man you have kidnaped is a murderer .  you can   t make a political refugee out of him .         well  now  do you want the man .         you have a deal in mind .  is that it .         the conference i spoke of .         for one florinian murderer .  of course not .         but the manner in which the townman managed to escape to us is rather curious .  you may be interested .   .   .        junz paced the floor  shaking his head .  the night was already well advanced .  he would like to be able to sleep but he knew he would require somnin once again .   abel said     i might have had to threaten force  as steen suggested .  that would have been bad .  the risks would have been awful  the results uncertain .  yet until the townman was brought to us i saw no alternative  except of course  a policy of do nothing .      junz shook his head violently .     no .  something had to be done .  yet it amounted to blackmail .         technically  i suppose so .  what would you have had me do .         exactly what you did .  i   m not a hypocrite  abel .  or i try not to be .  i won   t condemn your methods when i intend to make full use of the results .  still  what about the girl .         she won   t be hurt as long as fife keeps his bargain .         i   m sorry for her .  i   ve grown to dislike the sarkite aristocrats for what they   ve done to florina  but i can   t help feeling sorry for her .         as an individual  yes .  but the true responsibility lies with sark itself .  look here  old man  did you ever kiss a girl in a ground car .      the tip of a smile quivered at the corners of junz   s mouth .     yes .         so have i  though i have to call upon longer memories than you do  i imagine .  my eldest granddaughter is probably engaged in the practice at this moment  i shouldn   t wonder .  what is a stolen kiss in a ground car  anyway  except the expression of the most natural emotion in the galaxy .      look here  man .  we have a girl  admittedly of high social standing  who  through mistake  finds herself in the same car with  let us say  a criminal .  he seizes the opportunity to kiss her .  it   s on impulse and without her consent .  how ought she to feel .  how ought her father to feel .  chagrined .  perhaps .  annoyed .  certainly .  angry .  offended .  insulted .  all that  yes .  but disgraced .  no .  disgraced enough to be willing to endanger important affairs of state to avoid exposure .  nonsense .      but that   s exactly the situation and it could happen only on sark .  the lady samia is guilty of nothing but willfulness and a certain na  vet   .  she has  i am sure  been kissed before .  if she kissed again  if she kissed innumerable times  anyone but a florinian  nothing would be said .  but she did kiss a florinian .      it doesn   t matter that she did not know he was a florinian .  it doesn   t matter that he forced the kiss upon her .  to make public the photograph we have of the lady samia in the arms of the florinian would make life unbearable for her and for her father .  i saw fife   s face when he stared at the reproduction .  there was no way of telling for certain that the townman was a florinian .  he was in sarkite costume with a cap that covered his hair well .  he was light skinned  but that was inconclusive .  still  fife knew that the rumor would be gladly believed by many who were interested in scandal and sensation and that the picture would be considered incontrovertible proof .  and he knew that his political enemies would make the greatest possible capital out of it .  you may call it blackmail  junz  and maybe it is  but it   s a blackmail that would not work on any other planet in the galaxy .  their own sick social system gave us this weapon and i have no compunction about using it .      junz sighed .     what   s the final arrangement .         we   ll meet at noon tomorrow .         his ultimatum has been postponed then .         indefinitely .  i will be at his office in person .         is that a necessary risk .         it   s not much of one .  there will be witnesses .  and i am anxious to be in the material presence of this spatio analyst you have been searching for so long .         i   ll attend .     asked junz anxiously .      oh yes .  the townman as well .  we   ll need him to identify the spatio analyst .  and steen  of course .  all of you will be present by trimensic personification .         thank you .      the trantorian ambassador smothered a yawn and blinked at junz through watering eyes .     now  if you don   t mind  i   ve been awake for two days and a night and i   m afraid my old body can take no more antisomnin .  i must sleep .        with trimensic personification perfected  important conferences were rarely held face to face .  fife felt strongly an element of actual indecency in the material presence of the old ambassador .  his olive complexion could not be said to have darkened  but its lines were set in silent anger .   it had to be silent .  he could say nothing .  he could only stare sullenly at the men who faced him .   abel .  an old dotard in shabby clothes with a million worlds behind him .   junz .  a dark skinned  woolly haired interferer whose perseverance had precipitated the crisis .  steen .  the traitor .  afraid to meet his eyes .   the townman .  to look at him was most difficult of all .  he was the native who had dishonored his daughter with his touch yet who could remain safe and untouchable behind the walls of the trantorian embassy .  he would have been glad to grind his teeth and pound his desk if he had been alone .  as it was  not a muscle of his face must move though it tore beneath the strain .   if samia had not  .   .   .  he dropped that .  his own negligence had cultivated her willfulness and he could not blame her for it now .  she had not tried to excuse herself or soften her own guilt .  she had told him all the truth of her private attempts to play the interstellar spy and how horribly it had ended .  she had relied completely  in her shame and bitterness  on his understanding  and she would have that much .  she would have that much  if it meant the ruin of the structure he had been building .   he said     this conference has been forced upon me .  i see no point in saying anything .  i   m here to listen .      abel said     i believe steen would like to have his say first .      fife   s eyes filled with contempt that stung steen .   steen yelled his answer .     you made me turn to trantor  fife .  you violated the principle of autonomy .  you couldn   t expect me to stand for that .  really .      fife said nothing and abel said  not without a little contempt of his own     get to your point  steen .  you said you had something to say .  say it .      steen   s sallow cheekbones reddened without benefit of rouge .     i will  and right now .  of course i don   t claim to be the detective that the squire of fife represents himself to be  but i can think .  really .  and i   ve been thinking .  fife had a story to tell yesterday  all about a mysterious traitor he called x .  i could see it was just a lot of talk so that he could declare an emergency .  i wasn   t fooled a minute .         there   s no x .     asked fife quietly .     then why did you run .  a man who runs needs no other accusation .         is that so .  really .     cried steen .     well  i would run out of a burning building even if i had not set the fire myself .         go on  steen     said abel .   steen licked his lips and turned to a minute consideration of his fingernails .  he smoothed them gently as he spoke .     but then i thought  why make up that particular story with all its complications and things .  it   s not his way .  really .  it   s not fife   s way .  i know him .  we all know him .  he has no imagination at all  your excellency .  a brute of a man .  almost as bad as bort .      fife scowled .     is he saying something  abel  or is he babbling .         go on  steen     said abel .      i will  if you   ll let me talk .  my goodness .  whose side are you on .  i said to myself  this was after dinner   i said  why would a man like fife make up a story like that .  there was only one answer .  he couldn   t make it up .  not with his mind .  so it was true .  it must be true .  and  of course  patrollers had been killed  though fife is quite capable of arranging to have that happen .      fife shrugged his shoulders .   steen drove on .     only who is x .  it isn   t i .  really .  i know it isn   t i .  and i   ll admit it could only have been a great squire .  but what great squire knew most about it  anyway .  what great squire has been trying to use the story of the spatio analyst for a year now to frighten the others into some sort of what he calls    united effort    and what i call surrender to a fife dictatorship .      i   ll tell you who x is .     steen stood up  the top of his head brushing the edge of the receptor cube and flattening as the uppermost inch sliced off into nothingness .  he pointed a trembling finger .     he   s x .  the squire of fife .  he found this spatio analyst .  he put him out of the way  when he saw the rest of us weren   t impressed with his silly remarks at our first conference  and then he brought him out again after he had already arranged a military coup .      fife turned wearily to abel .     is he through .  if so  remove him .  he is an unbearable offense to any decent man .      abel said     have you any comment to make on what he says .         of course not .  it isn   t worth comment .  the man is desperate .  he   ll say anything .         you can   t just brush it off  fife     called steen .  he looked about at the rest .  his eyes narrowed and the skin at his nostrils was white with tension .  he remained standing .     listen .  he said his investigators found records in a doctor   s office .  he said the doctor had died by accident after diagnosing the spatio analyst as the victim of psycho probing .  he said it was murder by x to keep the identity of the spatio analyst secret .  that   s what he said .  ask him .  ask him if that isn   t what he said .         and if i did .     asked fife .      then ask him how he could get the records from the office of a doctor who was dead and buried for months unless he had them all along .  really .      fife said     this is foolish .  we can waste time indefinitely this way .  another doctor took over the dead man   s practice and his records as well .  do any of you think medical records are destroyed along with a physician .      abel said     no  of course not .      steen stuttered  then sat down .   fife said     what   s next .  have any of you more to say .  more accusations .  more anything .     his voice was low .  bitterness showed through .   abel said     why  that was steen   s say  and we   ll let it pass .  now junz and i  we   re here on another kind of business .  we would like to see the spatio analyst .      fife   s hands had been resting upon the desk top .  they lifted now and came down to clutch the edge of the desk .  his black eyebrows drew together .   he said     we have in custody a man of subnormal mentality who claims to be a spatio analyst .  i   ll have him brought in .        valona march had never  never in her life dreamed such impossibilities could exist .  for over a day now  ever since she had landed on this planet of sark  there had been a touch of wonder about everything .  even the prison cells in which she and rik had been separately placed seemed to have an unreal quality of magnificence about them .  water came out of a hole in a pipe when you pressed a button .  heat came out of the wall  although the air outside had been colder than she had thought air could possibly get .  and everyone who spoke to her wore such beautiful clothes .   she had been in rooms in which were all sorts of things she had never seen before .  this one now was larger than any yet but it was almost bare .  it had more people in it  though .  there was a stern looking man behind a desk  and a much older  very wrinkled man in a chair  and three others .   one was the townman .   she jumped up and ran to him .     townman .  townman .      but he wasn   t there .   he had gotten up and waved at her .     stay back  lona .  stay back .      and she passed right through him .  she had reached out to seize his sleeve  he moved it away .  she lunged  half stumbling  and passed right through him .  for a moment the breath went out of her body .  the townman had turned  was facing her again  but she could only stare down at her legs .   both of them were thrusting through the heavy arm of the chair in which the townman had been sitting .  she could see it plainly  in all its color and solidity .  it encircled her legs but she did not feel it .  she put out a trembling hand and her fingers sank an inch deep into upholstery they could not feel either .  her fingers remained visible .   she shrieked and fell  her last sensation being that of the townman   s arms reaching automatically for her and herself f ailing through their circle as though they were pieces of flesh tinted air .   she was in a chair again  rik holding one hand tightly and the old  wrinkled man leaning over her .   he was saying     don   t be frightened  my dear .  it   s just a picture .  a photograph  you know .      valona looked about .  the townman was still sitting there .  he wasn   t looking at her .   she pointed a finger .     isn   t he there .      rik said suddenly     it   s a trimensic personification  lona .  he   s somewhere else  but we can see him from here .      valona shook her head .  if rik said so  it was all right .  but she lowered her eyes .  she dared not look at people who were there and not there at the same time .   abel said to rik     so you know what trimensic personification is  young man .         yes  sir .     it had been a tremendous day for rik  too  but where valona was increasingly dazzled  he had found things increasingly familiar and comprehensible .      where did you learn that .         i don   t know .  i knew it before  before i forgot .      fife had not moved from his seat behind the desk during the wild plunge of valona march toward the townman .   he said acidly     i am sorry to have to disturb this meeting by bringing in a hysterical native woman .  the so called spatio analyst required her presence .         it   s all right     said abel .     but i notice that your florinian of subnormal mentality seems to be acquainted with trimensic personification .         he has been well drilled  i imagine     said fife .   abel said     has he been questioned since arriving on sark .         he certainly has .         with what result .         no new information .      abel turned to rik .     what   s your name .         rik is the only name i remember     said rik calmly .      do you know anyone here .      rik looked from face to face without fear .  he said     only the towriman .  and lona  of course .         this     said abel  gesturing toward fife     is the greatest squire that ever lived .  he owns the whole world .  what do you think of him .      rik said boldly     i m an earthman .  he doesn   t own me .      abel said in an aside to fife     i don   t think an adult native florinian could be trained into that sort of defiance .         even with a psycho probe .     returned fife scornfully .      do you know this gentleman .     asked abel  returning to rik .      no  sir .         this is dr .  selim junz .  he   s an important official at the interstellar spatio analytic bureau .      rik looked at him intently .     then he   d be one of my chiefs .  but     with disappointment     i don   t know him .  or maybe i just don   t remember .      junz shook his head gloomily .     i   ve never seen him  abel .         that   s something for the record     muttered fife .      now listen  rik     said abel .     i m going to tell you a story .  i want you to listen with all your mind and think .  think and think .  do you understand me .      rik nodded .   abel talked slowly .  his voice was the only sound in the room for long minutes .  as he went on  rik   s eyelids closed and screwed themselves tight shut .  his lips drew back  his fists moved up to his chest  and his head bent forward .  he had the look of a man in agony .   abel talked on  passing back and forth across the reconstruction of events as they had originally been presented by the squire of fife .  he talked of the original message of disaster  of its interception  of the meeting between rik and x  of the psycho probing  of how rik had been found and brought up on florina  of the doctor who diagnosed him and then died  of his returning memory .   he said     that   s the whole story  rik .  i   ve told you all of it .  does anything sound familiar to you .      slowly  painfully  rik said     i remember the last parts .  you know  the last few days .  i remember something further back  too .  maybe it was the doctor  when i first started talking .  it   s very dim .   .   .   .  but that   s all .      abel said     but you do remember further back .  you remember danger to florina .         yes .  yes .  that was the first thing i remembered .         then can   t you remember after that .  you landed on sark and met a man .      rik moaned     i can   t .  i can   t remember .         try .  try .      rik looked up .  his white face was wet with perspiration .     i remember a word .         what word  rik .         it doesn   t make sense .         tell us anyway .         it goes along with a table .  long  long ago .  very dim .  i was sitting .  i think  maybe  someone else was sitting .  then he was standing  looking down at me .  and there   s a word .      abel was patient .     what word .      rik clenched his fists and whispered     fife .      every man but fife rose to his feet .  steen shrieked     i told you     and burst into a high pitched bubbling cackle .       seventeen  the accuser      fife said with tightly controlled passion     let us end this farce .      he had waited before speaking  his eyes hard and his face expressionless  until in sheer anticlimax the rest were forced to take their seats again .  rik had bent his head  eyes screwed painfully shut  probing his own aching mind .  valona pulled him toward herself  trying hard to cradle his head on her shoulder  stroking his cheek softly .   abel said shakily     why do you say this is a farce .      fife said     isn   t it .  i agreed to this meeting in the first place only because of a particular threat you held over me .  i would have refused even so if i had known the conference was intended to be a trial of myself with renegades and murderers acting as both prosecutors and jury .      abel frowned and said with chilling formality     this is not a trial  squire .  dr .  junz is here in order to recover the person of a member of the i . s . b .   as is his right and duty .  i am here to protect the interests of trantor in a troubled time .  there is no doubt in my mind that this man  rik  is the missing spatio analyst .  we can end this part of the conference immediately if you will agree to turn over the man to dr .  junz for further examination  including a check of physical characteristics .  we would naturally require your further help in finding the guilty psycho prober and in setting up safeguards against a future repetition of such acts against what is  after all  an interstellar agency which has consistently held itself above regional politics .      fife said     quite a speech .  but the obvious remains obvious and your plans are quite transparent .  what would happen if i gave up this man .  i rather think that the i . s . b .  will manage to find out exactly what it wants to find out .  it claims to be an interstellar agency with no regional ties  but it   s a fact  isn   t it  that trantor contributes two thirds of its annual budget .  i doubt that any reasonable observer would consider it really neutral in the galaxy of today .  its findings with regard to this man will surely suit trantor   s imperial interests .      and what will these findings be .  that   s obvious too .  the man   s memory will slowly come back .  the i . s . b .  will issue daily bulletins .  bit by bit he will remember more and more of the necessary details .  first my name .  then my appearance .  then my exact words .  i will be solemnly declared guilty .  reparations will be required and trantor will be forced to occupy sark temporarily  an occupation which will somehow become permanent .      there are limits beyond which any blackmail breaks down .  yours  mr .  ambassador  ends here .  if you want this man  have trantor send a fleet after him .         there is no question of force     said abel .     yet i notice that you have carefully avoided denying the implication in what the spatio analyst has last said .         there isn   t any implication that i need dignify by a denial .  he remembers a word  or says he does .  what of it .         doesn   t it mean anything that he does .         nothing at all .  the name fife is a great one on sark .  even if we assume the so called spatio analyst is sincere  he had a year   s opportunity to hear the name on florina .  he came to sark on a ship that carried my daughter  a still better opportunity to have heard the name of fife .  what is more natural than that the name became involved with his trace memories .  of course  he may not be sincere .  this man   s bit by bit disclosures may be well rehearsed .      abel thought of nothing to say .  he looked at the others .  junz was frowning darkly  the fingers of his right hand slowly kneading his chin .  steen was simpering foolishly and muttering to himself .  the florinian townman stared blankly at his knees .   it was rik who spoke  forcing himself from valona   s grasp and standing up .      listen     he said .  his pale face was twisted .  his eyes mirrored pain .   fife said     another disclosure  i suppose .      rik said     listen .  we were sitting at a table .  the tea was drugged .  we had been quarreling .  i don   t remember why .  then i couldn   t move .  i could only sit there .  i couldn   t talk .  i could only think  great space  rye been drugged .  i wanted to shout and scream and run  but i couldn   t .  then the other one  fife  came .  he had been shouting at me .  only now he wasn   t shouting .  he didn   t have to .  he came around the table .  he stood there  towering over me .  i couldn   t say anything .  i couldn   t do anything .  i could only try to turn my eyeballs up toward him .      rik remained standing  silent .   selim junz said     this other man was fife .         i remember his name was fife .         well  was he that man .      rik did not turn to look .  he said     i can   t remember what he looked like .         are you sure .         i   ve been trying .     he burst out     you don   t know how hard it is .  it hurts .  it   s like a red hot needle .  deep .  in here .     he put his hands to his head .   junz said softly     i know it   s hard .  but you must try .  don   t you see  you must keep on trying .  look at that man .  turn and look at him .      rik twisted toward the squire of fife .  for a moment he stared  then turned away .   junz said     can you remember now .         no .  no .      fife smiled grimly .     has your man forgotten his lines  or will the story seem more believable if he remembers my face the next time around .      junz said hotly     i have never seen this man before  and i have never spoken to him .  there has been no arrangement to frame you and i am tired of your accusations in that direction .  i am after the truth only .         then may i ask him a few questions .         go ahead .         thank you  i   m sure  for your kindness .  now you  rik  or whatever your real name is       he was a squire  addressing a florinian .   rik looked up .     yes  sir .         you remember a man approaching you from the other side of the table as you sat there  drugged and helpless .         yes  sir .         the last thing you remember is this man staring down at you .         yes  sir .         you stared up at him  or tried to .         yes  sir .         sit down .      rik did so .   for a moment fife did nothing .  his lipless mouth might have grown tighter  the jaw muscles under the blue black sheen of the stubble on his cheeks and chin bunched a bit .  then he slid down from his chair .   slid down .  it was as though he had gotten down on his knees there behind the desk .   but he moved from behind it and was seen plainly to be standing .   junz   s head swam .  the man  so statuesque and formidable in his seat  had been converted without warning into a pitiful midget .   fife   s deformed legs moved under him with an effort  carrying the ungainly mass of torso and head forward .  his face flushed but his eyes kept their look of arrogance intact .  steen broke into a wild giggle and choked it off when those eyes turned on him .  the rest sat in fascinated silence .   rik  wide eyed  watched him approach .   fife said     was i the man who approached you around the table .         i can   t remember his face  sir .         i don   t ask you to remember his face .  can you have forgotten this .     his two arms went wide  framing his body .     can you have forgotten my appearance  my walk .      rik said miserably     it seems i shouldn   t  sir  but i don   t know .         but you were sitting  he was standing  and you were looking up at him .         yes  sir .         he was looking down at you     towering    over you  in fact .         yes  sir .         you remember that at least .  you   re certain of that .         yes  sir .      the two were now face to face .      am i looking down at you .      rik said     no  sir .         are you looking up at me .      rik  sitting  and fife  standing  stared levelly at one another  eye to eye .      no  sir .         could i have been the man .         no  sir .         are you certain .         yes  sir .         you still say the name you remember is fife .         i remember that name     insisted rik stubbornly .      whoever it was  then  used my name as a disguise .         he  he must have .      fife turned and with slow dignity struggled back to his desk and climbed into his seat .   he said     i have never allowed any man to see me standing before this in all my adult life .  is there any reason why this conference should continue .      abel was at once embarrassed and annoyed .  so far the conference had backfired badly .  at every step fife had managed to put himself in the right  the others in the wrong .  fife had successfully presented himself as a martyr .  he had been forced into conference by trantorian blackmail  and made the subject of false accusations that had broken down at once .   fife would see to it that his version of the conference flooded the galaxy and he would not have to depart very far from the truth to make it excellent anti trantorian propaganda .   abel would have liked to cut his losses .  the psycho probed spatio analyst would be of no use to trantor now .  any    memory    he might have thereafter would be laughed down  made ridiculous  however true it might be .  he would be accepted as an instrument of trantorian imperialism  and a broken instrument at that .   but he hesitated  and it was junz who spoke .   junz said     it seems to me there   s a very good reason for not ending the conference just yet .  we have not yet determined exactly who is responsible for the psycho probing .  you have accused the squire of steen  and steen has accused you .  granting that both of you are mistaken and that both are innocent  it still remains true that you each believe one of the great squires is guilty .  which one  then .         does it matter .     asked fife .     as far as you   re concerned  i   m sure it doesn   t .  that matter would have been solved by now except for the interference of trantor and the i . s . b .  eventually i will find the traitor .  remember that the psycho prober  whoever he is  had the original intention of forcing a monopoly of the kyrt trade into his own hands  so i am not likely to let him escape .  once the psycho prober is identified and dealt with  your man here will be returned unharmed to you .  that is the only offer i can make and it is a very reasonable one .         what will you do with the psycho prober .         that is a purely internal matter that does not concern you .         but it does     junz said energetically .     this is not just a question of the spatio analyst .  there   s something of greater importance involved and i   m surprised that it hasn   t been mentioned yet .  this man rik wasn   t psycho probed just because he was a spatio analyst .      abel was not sure what junz   s intentions were  but he threw his weight into the scales .  he said blandly     dr .  junz is referring  of course  to the spatio analyst   s original message of danger .      fife shrugged .     as far as i know  no one has yet attached any importance to that  including dr .  junz over the past year .  however  your man is here  doctor .  ask him what it   s all about .         naturally  he won   t remember     junz retorted angrily .     the psycho probe is most effective upon the more intellectual chains of reasoning stored in the mind .  the man may never recover the quantitative aspects of his lifework .         then it   s gone     said fife .     what can be done about that .         something very definite .  that   s the point .  there   s someone else who knows  and that   s the psycho prober .  he may not have been a spatio analyst himself  he may not know the precise details .  however  he spoke to the man in a state of untouched mind .  he will have learned enough to put us far on the right track .  without having learned enough he would not have dared to destroy the source of his information .  still  for the record  do you remember  rik .         only that there was danger and that it involved the currents of space     muttered rik .   fife said     even if you find out  what will you have .  how reliable are any of the startling theories that sick spatio analysts are forever coming up with .  many of them think they know the secrets of the universe when they   re so sick they can barely read their instruments .         it may be that you are right .  are you afraid to let me find out .         i am against starting any morbid rumors that might  whether true or false  affect the kyrt trade .  don   t you agree with me  abel .      abel squirmed inwardly .  fife was maneuvering himself into the position where any break in kyrt deliveries resulting from his own coup could be blamed on trantorian maneuvers .  but abel was a good gambler .  he raised the stakes calmly and unemotionally .   he said     i don   t .  i suggest you listen to dr .  junz .         thanks     said junz .     now you have said  squire fife  that whoever the psycho prober was  he must have killed the doctor who examined this man rik .  that implies that the psycho prober had kept some sort of watch over rik during his stay on florina .         well .         there must be traces of that kind of watching .         you mean you think these natives would know who was watching them .         why not .      fife said     you are not a sarkite and so you make mistakes .  i assure you that natives keep their places .  they don   t approach squires and if squires approach them they know enough to keep their eyes on their toes .  they would know nothing of being watched .      junz quivered visibly with indignation .  the squires had their despotism so ingrained that they saw nothing wrong or shameful in speaking of it openly .   he said     ordinary natives perhaps .  but we have a man here who is not an ordinary native .  i think he has shown us rather thoroughly that he is not a properly respectful florinian .  so far he has contributed nothing to the discussion and it is time to ask him a few questions .      fife said     that native   s evidence is worthless .  in fact  i take the opportunity once more to demand that trantor surrender him to proper trial by the courts of sark .         let me speak to him first .      abel put in mildly     i think it will do no harm to ask him a few questions  fife .  if he proves unco operative or unreliable  we may consider your request for extradition .      terens  who  till now  had stolidly concentrated on the fingers of his clasped hands  looked up briefly .   junz turned to terens .  he said     rik has been in your town since he was first found on florina  hasn   t he .         yes .         and you were in town all that time .  i mean you weren   t on any extended business trips  were you .         townmen don   t make business trips .  their business is in their town .       all right .  now relax and don   t get touchy .  it would be part of your business to know about any squire that might come to town  i imagine .         sure .  when they come .         did they come .      terens shrugged .     once or twice .  pure routine  i assure you .  squires don   t dirty their hands with kyrt .  unprocessed kyrt  that is .      be respectful .     roared fife .   terens looked at him and said     can you make me .      abel interrupted smoothly     let   s keep this between the man and dr .  junz  fife .  you and i are spectators .      junz felt a glow of pleasure at the townman   s insolence  but he said     answer my questions without side comments please  townman .  now who exactly were the squires who visited your town this past year .      terens said fiercely     how can i know .  i can   t answer that question .  squires are squires and natives are natives .  i may be a townman but i   m still a native to them .  i don   t greet them at the town gates and ask their names .      i get a message  that   s all .  it   s addressed    townman .     it says there   ll be a squire   s inspection on such and such a day and i   m to make the necessary arrangements .  i must then see to it that the mill workers have on their best clothes  that the mill is cleaned up and working properly  that the kyrt supply is ample  that everyone looks contented and pleased  that the houses have been cleaned and the streets policed  that some dancers are on hand in case the squires would care to view some amusing native dance  that maybe a few pretty g          never mind that  townman     said junz .      you never mind that .  i do .      after his experiences with the florinians of the civil service  junz found the townman as refreshing as a drink of cold water .  he made up his mind that what influence the i . s . b .  could bring to bear would be used to prevent any surrender of the townman to the squires .   terens went on  in calmer tones     anyway  that   s my part .  when they come  i line up with the rest .  i don   t know who they are .  i don   t speak to them .         was there any such inspection the week before the city doctor was killed .  i suppose you know what week that happened .         i think i heard about it in the newscasts .  i don   t think there was any squire   s inspection at that time .  i can   t swear to it .         whom does your land belong to .      terens pulled the corners of his mouth back .     to the squire of fife .      steen spoke up  breaking into the give and take with rather surprising suddenness .     oh  look here .  really .  you   re playing into fife   s hands with this kind of questioning  dr .  junz .  don   t you see you won   t get anywhere .  really .  do you suppose if fife were interested in keeping tabs on that creature there that he would go to all the trouble of making trips to florina to look at him .  what are patrollers for .  really .      junz looked flustered .     in a case like this  with a world   s economy and maybe its physical safety resting on the contents of one man   s mind  it   s natural that the psycho prober would not care to leave the guardianship to patrollers .      fife intervened .     even after he had wiped out that mind  to all intents .      abel pushed out his lower lip and frowned .  he saw his latest gamble sliding into fife   s hands with all the rest .   junz tried again  hesitantly .     was there any particular patroller or group of patrollers that was always underfoot .         i   d never know .  they   re just uniforms to me .      junz turned to valona with the effect of a sudden pounce .  a moment before she had gone a sickly white and her eyes had become wide and stary .  junz had not missed that .   he said     what about you  girl .      but she only shook her head  wordlessly .   abel thought heavily  there   s nothing more to do .  it   s all over .   but valona was on her feet  trembling .  she said in a husky whisper     i want to say something .      junz said     go ahead  girl .  what is it .      valona talked breathlessly and with fright obvious in every line of her countenance and every nervous twitch of her fingers .  she said     i   m just a country girl .  please don   t be angry with me .  it   s just that it seems that things can only be one way .  was my rik so very important .  i mean  the way you said .      junz said gently     i think he was very  very important .  i think he still is .         then it must be like you said .  whoever it was who had put him on florina wouldn   t have dared take his eye away for even a minute hardly .  would he .  i mean  suppose rik was beaten by the mill superintendent or was stoned by the children or got sick and died .  he wouldn   t be left helpless in the fields  would he  where he might die before anyone found him .  they wouldn   t suppose that it would just be luck that would keep him safe .     she was speaking with an intense fluency now .      go on     said junz  watching her .      because there was one person who did watch rik from the start .  he found him in the fields  fixed it so i would take care of him  kept him out of trouble and knew about him every day .  he even knew all about the doctor  because i told him .  it was he .  it was he .      with her voice at screaming intensity  her finger pointed rigidly at myrlyn terens  townman .   and this time even fife   s superhuman calm broke and his arms stiffened on his desk  lifting his massive body a full inch off his seat  as his head swiveled quickly toward the townman .       eighteen  the victors      it was as though vocal paralysis had gripped them all .  even rik  with disbelief in his eyes  could only stare woodenly  first at valona  then at terens .   then came steen   s high pitched laugh and the silence was broken .   steen said     i believe it .  really .  i said so all along .  i said the native was in fife   s pay .  that shows you the kind of man fife is .  he   d pay a native to          that   s an infernal lie .      it wasn   t fife who spoke  but the townman .  he was on his feet  eyes glistening with passion .   abel  who of them all seemed the least moved  said     what is .      terens stared at him a moment  not comprehending  then said chokingly     what the squire said .  i am in the pay of no sarkite .         and what the girl said .  is that a lie too .      terens wet his dry lips with the tip of his tongue .     no  that   s true .  i am the psycho prober .     he hurried on .     don   t look at me like that  lona .  i didn   t mean to hurt him .  i didn   t intend any of what happened .     he sat down again .   fife said     this is a sort of device .  i don   t know exactly what you   re planning  abel  but it   s impossible on the face of it that this criminal could have included this particular crime in his repertoire .  it   s definite that only a great squire could have had the necessary knowledge and facilities .  or are you anxious to take your man steen off the hook by arranging for a false confession .      terens  hands tightly clasped  leaned forward in his seat .     i don   t take trantorian money  either .      fife ignored him .   junz was the last to come to himself .  for minutes  he could not adjust to the fact that the townman was not really in the same room with him  that he was somewhere else on the embassy grounds  that he could see him only in image form  no more real actually than was fife  who was twenty miles away .  he wanted to go to the townman  grip him by the shoulder  speak to him alone  but he couldn   t .  he said     there   s no point in arguing before we hear the man .  let   s have the details .  if he is the psycho prober  we need the details badly .  if he isn   t  the details he   ll try to give us will prove it .         if you want to know what happened     cried terens     i   ll tell you .  holding it back won   t do me any good any longer .  it   s sark or trantor after all  so to space with it .  this will at least give me a chance to get one or two things into the open .      he pointed at fife in scorn .     there   s a great squire .  only a great squire  says this great squire  can have the knowledge or the facilities to do what the psycho prober did .  he believes it  too .  but what does he know .  what do any of the sarkites know .      they don   t run the government .  florinians do .  the florinian civil service does .  they get the papers  they make the papers  they file the papers .  and it   s the papers that run sark .  sure  most of us are too beaten even to whimper  but do you know what we could do if we wanted to  even under the noses of our damned squires .  well  you see what i   ve done .      i was temporarily traffic manager at the spaceport a year ago .  part of my training .  it   s in the records .  you   ll have to dig a little to find it because the listed traffic manager is a sarkite .  he had the title but i did the actual work .  my name would be found in the special section headed native personnel .  no sarkite would have dirtied his eyes looking there .      when the local i . s . b .  sent the spatio analyst   s message to the port with a suggestion that we meet the ship with an ambulance  i got the message .  i passed on what was safe .  this matter of the destruction of florina was not passed on .      i arranged to meet the spatio analyst at a small suburban port .  i could do that easily .  all the wires and strings that ran sark were at my finger tips .  i was in the civil service  remember .  a great squire who wanted to do what i did  couldn   t  unless he ordered some florinian to do it for him .  i could do it without anyone   s help .  so much for knowledge and facility .      i met the spatio analyst  kept him away from both sark and the i . s . b .  i squeezed as much information out of him as i could and set about using that information for florina and against sark .      words were forced out of fife .     you sent those first letters .         i sent those first letters  great squire     said terens calmly .     i thought i could force control of enough of the kyrt lands into my own hands to make a deal with trantor on my terms and drive you off the planet .         you were mad .         maybe .  anyway  it didn   t work .  i had told the spatio analyst i was the squire of fife .  i had to  because he knew that fife was the biggest man on the planet  and as long as he thought i was fife  he was willing to talk openly .  it made me laugh to realize that he thought fife was anxious to do whatever was best for florina .      unfortunately  he was more impatient than i was .  he insisted that every day lost was a calamity  while i knew that my dealings with sark needed time more than anything else .  i found it difficult to control him and eventually had to use a psychic probe .  i could get one .  i had seen it used in hospitals .  i knew something about it .  unfortunately  not enough .      i set the probe to wipe out the anxiety from the surface layers of his mind .  that   s a simple operation .  i still don   t know what happened .  i think the anxiety must have run deeper  very deep  and the probe automatically followed it  digging out most of the conscious mind along with it .  i was left with a mindless thing on my hands m sorry  rik .      rik  who had been listening intently  said sadly     you shouldn   t have interfered with me  townman  but i know how you must have felt .         yes     said terens     you   ve lived on the planet .  you know about patrollers and squires and the difference between lower city and upper city .      he took up the current of his story again .     so there i was with the spatio analyst completely helpless .  i couldn   t let him be found by anyone who might trace his identity .  i couldn   t kill him .  i felt sure his memory would return and i would still need his knowledge  to say nothing of the fact that killing him would forfeit the good will of trantor and the i . s . b .   which i would eventually need .  besides  in those days  i was incapable of killing .      i arranged to be transferred to florina as townman and i took the spatio analyst with me on forged papers .  i arranged to have him found  i picked valona to take care of him .  there was no danger thereafter except for that one time with the doctor .  then i had to enter the power plants of upper city .  that was not impossible .  the engineers were sarkites but the janitors were florinian .  on sark i learned enough about power mechanics to know how to short a power line .  it took me three days to find the proper time for it .  after that  i could murder easily .  i never knew  though  that the doctor kept duplicate records in both halves of his office .  i wish i had .      terens could see fife   s chronometer from where he sat .     then  one hundred hours ago  it seems like a hundred years   rik began remembering again .  now you have the whole story .         no     said junz     we have not .  what are the details of the spatio analyst   s story of planetary destruction .         do you think i understood the details of what he had to say .  it was some sort of  pardon me  rik  madness .         it wasn   t     blazed rik .     it couldn   t have been .         the spatio analyst had a ship     said junz .     where is it .         on the scrap heap long ago     said terens .     an order scrapping it was sent out .  my superior signed it .  a sarldte never reads papers  of course .  it was scrapped without question .         and rik   s papers .  you said he showed you papers .         surrender that man to us     said fife suddenly     and we   ll find out what he knows .         no     said junz .     his first crime was against the i . s . b .  he kidnaped and damaged the mind of a spatio analyst .  he belongs to us .      abel said     junz is correct .      terens said     now look here .  i don   t say a word without safeguards .  i know where rik   s papers are .  they   re where no sarkite or trantorian will ever find them .  if you want them you   ll have to agree that i   m a political refugee .  whatever i did was out of patriotism  out of a regard for the needs of my planet .  a sarkite or a trantorian may claim to be patriotic  why not a florinian as well .         the ambassador     said junz     has said you will be given over to the i . s . b .  i assure you that you will not be turned over to sark .  for your treatment of the spatio analyst  you will be tried .  i cannot guarantee the result  but if you co operate with us now  it will count in your favor .      terens looked searchingly at junz .  then he said     i   ll take my chance with you  doctor .   .   .   .  according to the spatio analyst  florina   s sun is in the pre nova stage .         what .     the exclamation or its equivalent came from all but valona .      it   s about to explode and go boom     said terens sardonically .     and when that happens all of florina will go poof  like a mouthful of tobacco smoke .      abel said     i   m no spatio analyst  but i have heard that there is no way of predicting when a star will explode .         that   s true .  until now  anyway .  did rik explain what made him think so .     asked junz .      i suppose his papers will show that .  all i can remember is about the carbon current .         what .         he kept saying     the carbon current of space .  the carbon current of space .     that  and the words    catalytic effect .     there it is .   steen giggled .  fife frowned .  junz stared .   then junz muttered     pardon me .  i   ll be right back .     he stepped out of the limits of the receptor cube and vanished .   he was back in fifteen minutes .   junz looked about in bewilderment when he returned .  only abel and fife were present .   he said     where       abel broke in instantly .     we have been waiting for you  dr .  junz .  the spatio analyst and the girl are on their way to the embassy .  the conference is ended .         ended .  great galaxy  we have only begun .  i   ve got to explain the possibilities of nova formation .      abel shifted uneasily in his seat .     it is not necessary to do that  doctor .         it is very necessary .  it is essential .  give me five minutes .         let him speak     said fife .  he was smiling .   junz said     take it from the beginning .  in the earliest recorded scientific writings of galactic civilization it was already known that stars obtained their energy from nuclear transformations in their interiors .  it was also known that  given what we know about conditions in stellar interiors  two types  and only two types  of nuclear transformations can possibly yield the necessary energy .  both involve the conversion of hydrogen to helium .  the first transformation is direct  two hydrogens and two neutrons combine to form one helium nucleus .  the second is indirect  with several steps .  it ends up with hydrogen becoming helium  but in the intermediate steps  carbon nuclei take part .  these carbon nuclei are not used up but are re formed as the reactions proceed  so that a trifling amount of carbon can be used over and over again  serving to convert a great deal of hydrogen to helium .  the carbon acts as a catalyst  in other words .  all this has been known back to the days of prehistory  back to the time when the human race was restricted to a single planet  if there ever was such a time .         if we all know it     said fife     i would suggest that you are contributing nothing but a waste of time .         but this is all we know .  whether stars use one or the other  or both  nuclear processes has never been determined .  there have always been schools of thought in favor of each of the alternatives .  usually the weight of opinion has been in favor of the direct hydrogen helium conversion as being the simpler of the two .      now rik   s theory must be this .  the hydrogen helium direct conversion is the normal source of stellar energy  but under certain conditions the carbon catalysis adds its weight  hastening the process  speeding it up  heating up the star .      there are currents in space .  you all know that well .  some of these are carbon currents .  stars passing through the currents pick up innumerable atoms .  the total mass of atoms attracted  however  is incredibly microscopic in comparison to the star   s weight and does not affect it in any way .  except for carbon .  a star that passes through a current containing unusual concentrations of carbon becomes unstable .  i don   t know how many years or centuries or millions of years it takes for the carbon atoms to diffuse into the star   s interior  but it probably takes a long time .  that means that a carbon current must be wide and a star must intersect it at a small angle .  in any case  once the quantity of carbon percolating into the star   s interior passes a certain critical amount  the star   s radiation is suddenly boosted tremendously .  the outer layers give way under an unimaginable explosion and you have a nova .      do you see .      junz waited .   fife said     have you figured all this out in two minutes as a result of some vague phrase the townman remembered the spatio analyst to have said a year ago .         yes .  yes .  there   s nothing surprising in that .  spatio analysis is ready for that theory .  if rik had not come up with it  someone else would have shortly .  in fact  similar theories have been advanced before  but they were never taken seriously .  they were put forward before the techniques of spatio analysis were developed and no one was ever able to account for the sudden acquisition of excess carbon by the star in question .      but now we know there are carbon currents .  we can plot their courses  find out what stars intersected those courses in the past ten thousand years  check that against our records for nova formation and radiation variations .  that   s what rik must have done .  those must have been the calculations and observations he tried to show the townman .  but that   s all beside the immediate point .      what must be arranged for now is the immediate beginning of an evacuation of florina .         i thought it would come to that     said fife composedly .      i   m sorry  junz     said abel     but that   s quite impossible .         why impossible .         when will florina   s sun explode .         i don   t know .  from rik   s anxiety a year ago  i   d say we had little time .         but you can   t set a date .         of course not .         when will you be able to set a date .         there   s no way of telling .  even if we get rik   s calculations  it would all have to be rechecked .         can you guarantee that the spatio analyst   s theory will prove to be correct .      junz frowned .     i am personally certain of it  but no scientist can guarantee any theory in advance .         then it turns out that you want florina evacuated on mere speculation .         i think the chance of killing the population of a planet is not one that can be taken .         if florina were an ordinary planet i would agree with you .  but florina bears the galactic supply of kyrt .  it can   t be done .      junz said angrily     is that the agreement you came to with fife while i was gone .      fife intervened .  he said     let me explain  dr .  junz .  the government of sark would never consent to evacuate florina  even if the i . s . b .  claimed it had proof of this nova theory of yours .  trantor cannot force us because while the galaxy might support a war against sark for the purpose of maintaining the kyrt trade  it will never support one for the purpose of ending it .         exactly     said abel .     i am afraid our own people would not support us in such a war .      junz found revulsion growing strong within him .  a planet full of people meant nothing against the dictates of economic necessity .   he said     listen to me .  this is not a matter of one planet  but of a whole galaxy .  there are now twenty full novae originating within the galaxy every year .  in addition  some two thousand stars among the galaxy   s hundred billion shift their radiation characteristics sufficiently to render uninhabitable any habitable planet they may have .  human beings occupy one million stellar systems in the galaxy .  that means that on an average of once every fifty years some inhabited planet somewhere becomes too    hot for life .  such cases are a matter of historical record .  every five thousand years some inhabited planet has a fifty fifty chance of being puffed to gas by a nova .      if trantor does nothing about florina  if it allows it to vaporize with its people on it  that will serve notice to all the people of the galaxy that when their own turn comes they may expect no help  if such help is in the way of the economic convenience of a few powerful men .  can you risk that  abel .      on the other hand  help florina and you will have shown that trantor puts its responsibility to the people of the galaxy above the maintenance of mere property rights .  trantor will win good will that it could never win by force .      abel bowed his head .  then he shook it wearily .     no  junz .  what you say appeals to me  but it is not practical .  i can   t count on emotions as against the assured political effect of any attempt to end the kyrt trade .  in fact  i think it might be wise to avoid investigating the theory .  the thought that it might be true would do too much harm .         but what if it is true .         we must work on the assumption that it is not .  i take it that when you were gone a few moments ago it was to contact the i . s . b .         yes .         no matter .  trantor  i think  will have enough influence to stop their investigations .         i   m afraid not .  not these investigations .  gentlemen  we will soon have the secret of cheap kyrt .  there will be no kyrt monopoly within a year  whether or not there is a nova .         what do you mean .         the conference is reaching the essential point now  fife .  kyrt grows only on florina of all inhabited planets .  its seeds produce ordinary cellulose elsewhere .  florina is probably the only inhabited planet  on a chance basis  that is currently pre nova  and it has probably been pre nova since it first entered the carbon current  perhaps thousands of years ago  if the angle of intersection was small .  it seems quite probable  then  that kyrt and the prenova stage go together .         nonsense     said fife .      is it .  there must be a reason why kyrt is kyrt on florina and cotton elsewhere .  scientists have tried many ways of artificially producing kyrt elsewhere  but they tried blindly  so they   ve always failed .  now they will know it is due to factors induced in a pre nova stellar system .      fife said scornfully     they   ve tried duplicating the radiation qualities of fife   s sun .         with appropriate arc lights  yes  that duplicated the visible and ultraviolet spectrum only .  what about radiation in the infrared and beyond .  what about magnetic fields .  what about electron emission .  what about cosmic ray effects .  i   m not a physical biochemist so there may be factors i know nothing about .  but people who are physical biochemists will be looking now  a whole galaxy of them .  within the year  i assure you  the solution will be found .      economics is on the side of humanity now .  the galaxy wants cheap kyrt  and if they find it or even if they imagine they will shortly find it  they will want florina evacuated  not only out of humanity  but out of a desire to turn the tables  at long last  on the kyrt gouging sarkites .         bluff .     growled fife .      do you think so  abel .     demanded junz .     if you help the squires  trantor will be looked on not as the saviors of the kyrt trade but of the kyrt monopoly .  can you chance that .         can trantor chance a war .     demanded fife .      war .  nonsense .  squire  in one year your holdings on florina will be worthless  nova or not .  sell out .  sell out all florina .  trantor can pay for it .         buy a planet .     said abel in dismay .      why not .  trantor has the funds  and its gain in good will among the people of the universe will pay it back a thousandfold .  if telling them that you are saving hundreds of millions of lives is not enough  tell them that you will bring them cheap kyrt .  that will do it .         i   ll think about it     said abel .   abel looked at the squire .  fife   s eyes fell .   after a long pause he too said     i   ll think about it .      junz laughed harshly .     don   t think too long .  the kyrt story will break quickly enough .  nothing can stop it .  after that  neither one of you will have freedom of action .  you can each strike a better bargain now .        the townman seemed beaten .     it   s really true .     he kept repeating .     really true .  no more florina .         it   s true     said junz .   terens spread his arms  let them fall against his side .     if you want the papers i got from rik  they   re filed among vital statistic files in my home town .  i picked the dead files  records a century back and more .  no one would ever look there for any reason .         look     said junz     i   m sure we can make an agreement with the i . s . b .  we   ll need a man on florina  one who knows the florinian people  who can tell us how to explain the facts to them  how best to organize the evacuation  how to pick the most suitable planets of refuge .  will you help us .         and beat the game that way  you mean .  get away with murder .  why not .     there were sudden tears in the townman   s eyes .     but i lose anyway .  i will have no world  no home .  we all lose .  the florinians lose their world  the sarkites lose their wealth  the trantorians their chance to get that wealth .  there are no winners at all .         unless     said junz gently     you realize that in the new galaxy  a galaxy safe from the threat of stellar instability  a galaxy with kyrt available to all  and a galaxy in which political unification will be so much closer  there will be winners after all .  one quadrillion winners the people of the galaxy  they are the victors .          epilog  a year after         rik .  rik .     selim junz hurried across the port grounds toward the ship  hands outstretched .     and lona .  i   d never have recognized either of you .  how are you .  how are you .         as well as we could wish .  our letter reached you  i see     said rik .      of course .  tell me  what do you think of it all .     they were walking back together  toward junz   s offices .   valona said sadly     we visited our old town this morning .  the fields are so empty .     her clothing was now that of a woman of the empire  rather than that of a peasant of florina .      yes  it must be dreary for a person who has lived here .  it grows dreary even for me  but i will stay as long as i can .  the radiation recordings of florina   s sun are of tremendous theoretical interest .         so much evacuation in less than a year .  it speaks for excellent organization .         we   re doing our best  rik .  oh  i think i should be calling you by your real name .         please don   t .  i   ll never be used to it .  i   m rik .  that   s still the only name i remember .      junz said     have you decided whether you   re going to return to spatio analysis .      rik shook his head .     i   ve decided  but the decision is  no .  i   ll never remember enough .  that part   s gone forever .  it doesn   t bother me  though .  i   ll be returning to earth .   .   .   .  by the way  i rather hoped i   d see the townman .         i think not .  he decided to go off today .  i think he   d rather not see you .  he feels guilty  i think .  you have no grudge against him .      rik said     no .  he meant well  and he changed my life in many ways for the better .  for one thing  i met lana .     his arm went about her shoulder .   valona looked at him and smiled .      besides     rik went on     he cured me of something .  i   ve found out why i was a spatio analyst .  i know why nearly a third of all spatio analysts are recruited from the one planet  earth .  anyone living on a radioactive world is bound to grow up in fear and insecurity .  a misstep can mean death and our planet   s own surface is the greatest enemy we have .      that makes for a sort of anxiety bred into us  dr .  junz  a fear of planets .  we   re only happy in space  that   s the only place we can feel safe .         and you don   t feel that way any longer  rik .         i certainly don   t .  i don   t even remember feeling that way .  that   s it  you see .  the townman had set his psychic probe to remove feelings of anxiety and he hadn   t bothered to set the intensity controls .  he thought he had a recent  superficial trouble to deal with .  instead there was this deep  ingrained anxiety he knew nothing of .  he got rid of all of it .  in a sense  it was worth getting rid of it even though so much else went with it .  i don   t have to stay in space now .  i can go back to earth .  i can work there and earth needs men .  it always will .         you know     junz said     why can   t we do for earth what we   re doing for florina .  there   s no need to bring up earthmen in such fear and insecurity .  the galaxy is big .         no     said rik vehemently .     it   s a different case .  earth has its past  dr .  junz .  many people may not believe it  but we of earth know that earth was the original planet of the human race .         well  perhaps .  i can   t say  one way or the other .         it was .  it   s a planet that can   t be abandoned  it mustn   t be abandoned .  someday we   ll change it  change its surface back to what it once must have been .  till then  we   re staying .      valona said softly     and i   m an earthwoman now .      rik was looking out at the horizon .  upper city was as garish as ever  but the people were gone .   he said     how many are left on florina .         about twenty million     said junz .     we work slower as we go along .  we have to keep our withdrawals balanced .  the people that are left must always maintain themselves as an economic unit in the months that are left .  of course  resettlement is in its earliest stages .  most of the evacuees are still in temporary camps on neighboring worlds .  there is unavoidable hardship .         when will the last person leave .         never  really .         i don   t understand .         the townman has applied unofficially for permission to remain .  it   s been granted  also unofficially .  it won   t be a matter of public record .         remain .     rik was shocked .     but for the sake of all the galaxy  why .         i didn   t know     said junz     but i think you explained it when you talked of earth .  he feels as you do .  he says he can   t bear the thought of leaving florina to die alone .
