derring do novels about david  lucky  starr and his battles against malefactors within the solar system .  each of the six took place in a different region of the system  and in each case i made use of the astronomical facts    as they were then known .   now  a quarter century later  fawcett is bringing out the novels in new editions  but what a quarter century it has been .  more has been learned about the worlds of our solar system in this last quarter century than in all the thousands of years that went before .   lucky starr and the big sun of mercury was written in      and at that time  astronomers were convinced that mercury presented only one face to the sun  and that it rotated on its axis in    days  which was exactly the length of the year .  i made that conviction a central part of the plot of the book .   in       however  astronomers studied radar beam reflections from the surface of mercury and found  to their surprise  that this was not so .  mercury rotates on its axis in    days  so that there is no perpetual day side or night side .   every part of the planet gets both day and night  and the sun moves in a rather complicated path in mercury s sky  growing larger and smaller  and backtracking on some occasions .  if i were writing this book today  i would take all this into account       i hope my gentle readers enjoy this book anyway  as an adventure story  but please don t forget that the advance of science can outdate even the most conscientious science fiction writer and that my astronomical descriptions are no longer accurate in all respects .   isaac asimov     the ghosts of the sun  lucky starr and his small friend  john bigman jones  followed the young engineer up the ramp toward the air lock that led to the surface  of the planet mercury .   lucky thought  at least things are breaking fast .   he had been on mercury only an hour .  he had had scarcely time to do more than see his ship  the shooting starr  safely stowed in the underground hangar .  he had met only the technicians who had handled the landing red tape and seen to his ship .   those technicians  that is  and scott mindes  engineer in charge of project light .  it had been almost as though the young man had been lying in wait .  almost at once he had suggested a trip to the surface .   to see some of the sights  he had explained .   lucky did not believe that  of course .  the engineer s small chinned face had been haunted with trouble  and his mouth twitched as he spoke .  his eyes slid away from l ucky s cool  level glance .   yet lucky agreed to visit the surface .  as yet  all he knew of the troubles on mercury was that they posed a ticklish problem for the council of science .  he was willing to go along with mindes and see where that led him .   as for bigman jones  he was always glad to follow          lucky anywhere and any time  for any reason and no reason .   but it was bigman whose eyebrows lifted as all three were getting into their suits .  he nodded almost unno ticeably toward the holster attachment on mindes s suit .   lucky nodded calmly in return .  he  too  had noticed that protruding from the holster was the butt of a heavy caliber blaster .   the young engineer stepped out onto the surface of the planet first .  lucky starr followed and bigraan came last .   for the moment  they lost contact with one another in the nearly total darkness .  only the stars were visible  bright and hard in the cold airlessness .   bigman recovered first .  the gravity here on mercury was almost exactly equal to that on his native mars .  the martian nights were almost as dark .  the stars in its night sky were almost as brilliant .   his treble voice sounded brightly in the receivers of the others .   hey  i m beginning to make things out .    so was lucky  and the fact puzzled him .  surely starlight could not be that bright .  there was a faint  luminous haze that lay over the fumbled landscape and touched its sharp crags with a pale milkiness .   lucky had seen something of the sort on the moon during its two week long night .  there  also  was the completely barren landscape  rough and broken .  never  in millions of years  either there on the moon or here on mercury  had there been the softening touch of wind or rain .  the bare rock  colder than imagination could       picture  lay without a touch of frost in a waterless world .   and in the moon s night  too  there had been this milkiness .  but there  over half the m oon at least  there had been earth light .  when earth was full it shone with sixteen times the brightness of the full moon as seen from earth .   here on mercury  at the solar observatory at the north pole  there was no near by planet to account for the light .    is that starlight .   he finally asked  knowing it wasn t .   scott mindes said wearily   that s the coronal glimmer .     great galaxy   said lucky with a light laugh .   the corona .  of course .  i should have known .      known what .   cried bigman .   what s going on .  hey  mindes  come on  give .    mindes said   turn around .  you ve got your back to it .    they all turned .  lucky whistled softly between his teeth  bigman yelped with surprise .  mindes said nothing .   a section of the horizon was etched sharply against a pearly region of the sky .  every pointed irregularity of that part of the horizon was in keen focus .  above it  the sty was in a soft glow  fading with height  a third of the way to the zenith .  the glow consisted of bright  curving streamers of pale light .    that s the corona  mr .  jones   said mindes .   even in his astonishment bigman was not forgetful of his own conception of the proprieties .  he growled        call me bigman .   then he said   you mean the corona around the sun .  i didn t think it was that big .     it s a million miles deep or more   said mindes   and we re on mercury  the planet closest to the sun .  we re only thirty million miles from the sun right now .  you re from mars  aren t you .     born and bred   said bigman .    well  if you could see the sun right now  you d find it was thirty six times as big as it is when seen from mars  and so s the corona .  and thirty six times as bright too .    lucky nodded .  sun and corona would be nine times as large as seen from earth .  and the corona could not be seen at all on earth  except during periods of total eclipse .   well  mindes had not altogether lied .  there were sights to be seen on mercury .  he tried to fill out the corona  to imagine the sun it surrounded which was now hidden just below the horizon .  it would be a majestic sight .   mindes went on  an unmistakable bitterness in his voice .   they call this light  the white ghost of the sun .     lucky said   i like that .  a rather good phrase .     rather good .   said mindes savagely .   i don t think so .  there s too much talk about ghosts on this planet .  this planet s all jinx .  nothing ever goes right on it .  the mines failed  .   .   .   his voice trailed off .   lucky thought  we ll let that simmer .   aloud he said   where is this phenomenon we were to see  mindes .     oh yes .  we ll have to walk a bit .  not far  considering the gravity  but watch your footing .  we don t have       roads here  and the coronal glimmer can be awfully confusing .  i suggest the helmet lights .    he clicked his on as he spoke  and a shaft of light sprang out from above the face plate  turning the ground into a rough patchwork of yellow and black .  two other lights flashed on  and the three figures moved forward on their thickly insulated boots .  they made no sound in the vacuum  but each could sense the soft vibrations set up by each footfall in the air within their suits .   mindes seemed to be brooding about the planet as he walked .  he said in a low  tense voice   i hate mercury .  i ve been here six months  two mermurian years  and i m sick of it .  i didn t think i d be here more than six months to begin with  and here the time s up and nothing s done .  nothing .  everything about this place is wrong .  it s the smallest planet .  it s the closest to the sun .  only one side faces the sun .  over there    and his arm swung in the direction of the corona s gleam     is the sun side  where it gets hot enough in places to melt lead and boil sulfur .  over there in the other direction    again his arm swung    is the one planetary surface in the whole solar system that never sees the sun .  everything about the place is miserable .    he paused to jump over a shallow  six foot wide rift in the surface  a reminder of some eons old mercury quake  perhaps  which could not heal over without wind and weather .  he made the jump clumsily  the picture of an earthman who  even on mercury  stayed close to the artificial gravity of the observatory dome .   bigman clicked his tongue disapprovingly at the sight .  he and lucky negotiated the jump with scarcely anything more than a lengthening of stride .       a quarter mile farther on  mindes said abruptly   we can see it from here  and just in time too .    he stopped  teetering forward  with arms outflung for balance .  bigman and lucky halted with a small hop which kicked up a spurt of gravel .   mindes s helmet flash went out .  he was pointing .  lucky and bigman put out their own lights and there  in the darkness  where mindes had pointed  was a small  irregular splotch of white .   it was brilliant  a more burning sunshine than lucky had ever seen on earth .    this is the best angle for seeing it   said mindes .   it s the top of black and white mountain .     is that its name .   asked bigman .    that s right .  you see why  don t you .  it stands just  far enough nightward of the terminator that s  the boundary between the dark side and the sun side .     i know that   said bigman indignantly .   you think i m ignorant .     i m just explaining .  there s this little spot around the north pole  and another around the south pole  where the terminator doesn t move much as mercury circles the sun .  down at the equator  now  the terminator moves seven hundred miles in one direction for forty four days and then seven hundred miles back in the next forty four .  here it just moves half or mile or so altogether  which is why this is a good place for an observatory .  the sun and the stars stand still .    anyway  black and white mountain is just far enough away so that only the top half of it is lit up at most .  then  as the sun creeps away  the light moves up the mountain slopes .          and now   interposed lucky   only the peak is lit up .     only the top foot or two maybe  and that will be gone soon .  it will be all dark for an earth day or two  and then the light starts coming back .    even as he spoke the white splotch shrank to a dot that burned like a bright star .   the three men waited .    look away   advised mindes   so that your eyes get accustomed to darkness .    and after slow minutes he said   all right  look back .    lucky and bigman did so and for a while saw nothing .   and then it was as though the landscape had turned bloody .  or a piece of it had  at any rate .  first there was just the sensation of redness .  then it could be made out  a rugged mountain climbing up to a peak .  the peak was brightly red now  the red deepening and fading as the eye traveled downward until all was black .    what is it .   asked bigman .    the sun   said mindes   has sunk just low enough now so that  from the mountain peak  all that remains above the horizon is the corona and the prominences .  the prominences are jets of hydrogen gas that lift thousand of miles above the sun s surface  and they re a bright red in color .  their light is there all the time  but ordinary sunlight drowns it out .    again lucky nodded .  the prominences were again something which on earth could be seen only during a total eclipse or with special instruments  thanks to the atmosphere .        in fact   added mindes in a low voice   they call this  the red ghost of the sun .       that s two ghosts   said lucky suddenly   a white one and a red one .  is it because of the ghosts that you carry a blaster  mr .  mindes .    mindes shouted   what .   then  wildly   what are you talking about .     i m saying   said lucky   that it s time you told us why you really brought us out here .  not just for the sights  i m sure  or you wouldn t carry a blaster on an empty  desolate planet .    it took a while for mindes to answer .  when he did  he said   you re david starr  aren t you .     that s right   said lucky patiently .    you re a member of the council of science .  you re the man they call lucky starr .    members of the council of science shunned publicity  and it was with a certain reluctance that lucky said again   that s right .     then i m not wrong .  you re one of their ace investigators  and you re here to investigate project light .    lucky s lips thinned as they pressed together .  he would much rather that were not so easily known .  he said   maybe that s true  maybe it isn t .  why did you bring me here .     i know it s true  and i brought you here    mindes was panting    to tell you the truth before the others could fill you   full of   lies .     about what .     about the failures that have been haunting   i hate that word   the failures in project light .     but you might have told me what you wanted to back at the dome .  why bring me here .          for two reasons   said the engineer .  his breathing continued rapid and difficult .   in the first place  they all think it s my fault .  they think i can t pull the project through  that i m wasting tax money .  i wanted to get you away from them .  understand .  i wanted to keep you from listening to them first .     why should they think it s your fault .     they think i m too young .     how old are you .     twenty two .    lucky starr  who wasn t very much older  said   and your second reason .     i wanted you to get the feeling of mercury .  i  wanted you to absorb the   the   he fell silent .   lucky s suited figure stood straight and tall on mercury s forbidding surface  and the metal of one shoulder caught and reflected the milky light of the corona   the white ghost of the sun .    he said   very well  mindes  suppose i accept your statement that you are not responsible for failures in the project .  who is .    the engineer s voice was a vague mutter at first .  it  coalesced gradually into words .   i don t know at  least      i don t understand you   said lucky .    look   said mindes desperately   i ve investigated .   i spent waking and sleeping periods trying to pinpoint  the blame .  i watched everybody s movements .  i noted  times when accidents took place  when there were  breaks in the cables or when conversion plates were  smashed .  and one thing i m sure of     which is .     that nobody at the dome can be directly responsi       ble .  nobody .  there are only about fifty people in the dome  fifty two to be exact  and the last six times something has gone wrong i ve been able to account for each one .  nobody was anywhere near the scenes of the accidents .   his voice had gone high pitched .   lucky said   then how do you account for the accidents .  mercury quakes .  action of the sun .     ghosts .   cried the engineer wildly  flinging his arms  about .   there s a white ghost and a red ghost .  you ve  seen those .  but there are two legged ghosts too .  i ve  seen them  but will anyone believe me .   he was almost  incoherent .   i tell you i tell you    bigman said   ghosts .  are you nuts .    at once mindes screamed   you don t believe me either .  but i ll prove it .  i ll blast the ghost .  i ll blast the fools who won t believe me .  i ll blast everyone .  everyone .    with a harsh screech of laughter he had drawn his  blaster  and with frenzied speed  before bigman could  move to stop him  he had aimed it at lucky at point   blank range and squeezed its trigger .  its invisible field  of disruption lashed out     mad or sane .   it would have been the end of lucky if he and mindes had been on earth .   lucky had not missed the gathering madness in mindes s voice .  he had been waiting carefully for some break  some action to suit the violence of the engineer s hard breathed sentences .  yet he had not entirely expected an outright assault with the blaster .   when mindes s hand flashed to his holster  lucky leaped to one side .  on earth  that movement would have come too late .   on mercury  however  matters were different .  mercury s gravity was two fifths that of earth  and lucky s contracting muscles threw his abnormally light body  even including the suit he wore  farther to one side .  mindes  unaccustomed to low gravity  stumbled as he turned too quickly in order that his blaster might follow lucky s motion .   the blaster s energy  therefore  struck bare ground  inches from lucky s sinking body .  it gouged a foot deeo hole into the frigid rock .   before mindes could recover and aim again  bigman had struck him at the end of a long  iow tackle carried through with the natural grace of a born martian accustomed to low gravity .           mindes went down .  he shrieked wordlessly and then was silent  whether unconscious as the result of the fall or as the climax of his fevered emotions could not be told .   bigman did not believe either possibility .   he s shamming   he cried passionately .   the dirty cobber is playing dead .   he had wrenched the blaster from the fallen engineer s unresisting grip  and now he pointed it at the man s head .   lucky said sharply   none of that  bigman .    bigman hesitated .   he tried to kill you  lucky .   it was obvious that the little martian would not have been half as angry if it had merely been himself who had been in danger of death .  yet he backed away .   lucky was on his knees examining mindes s face through the face plate  shining his helmet light onto the other s pale  drawn features .  he checked the pressure gauge of mindes s suit  making sure the shock  of the fall had not loosened any of its joints .  then  seizing the fallen figure by a wrist and ankle  he slung it across his shoulders and rose to his feet .    back to the dome   he said   and  i m afraid  to a  problem that s a little more complicated than the chief thinks .    bigman granted and followed lucky s long stride closely  his own smaller build forcing him into a gravity lengthened half trot .  he kept his blaster ready  maneuvering his position to enable him  in case of need  to strike at mindes without blasting down lucky .   the  chief was hector conway  head of the council of science .  at more informal times he was called uncle hector by lucky  since it was hector conway        along with augustus henree  who were the guardians of the young lucky after the death of lucky s parents as the result of a pirate attack near the orbit of venus .   a week earlier conway had said to lucky with a casual air  almost as though he were offering him a vacation   how would you like to go to mercury  lucky .     what s up  uncle hector .   asked lucky .    nothing really   said conway  frowning   except some cheap politics .  we re supporting a rather expensive project up at mercury  one of those basic research things that may come to nothing  you know  and  on the other hand  may turn out to be quite revolutionary .  it s a gamble .  all those things are .    lucky said   is it anything i know about .     i don t think so .  it s quite recent .  anyway  senator swenson has pounced on it as an example of how the council wastes taxpayers  money .  you know the line .  he s pressing for an investigation  and one of his boys went out to mercury some months ago .     senator swenson .  i see .   lucky nodded .  this was nothing new .  the council of science over the past decades had slowly come to the fore of the fight against the dangers to earth from both within and without the solar system .  in this age of galactic civilization  with humanity spread through all the planets of all the stars in the milky way  only scientists could properly cope with mankind s problems .  in fact  only the specially trained scientists of the council were adequate .   yet there were some men of earth s government who feared the growing power of this council of science and others who used this suspicion to further their own ambitions .  senator swenson was the foremost of the      latter group .  his attacks  usually directed against the council s  wasteful  way of supporting research  were making him famous .   lucky said   who s the man in charge of the project on mercury .  anyone i know .     it s called project light  by the way .  and the man in charge is an engineer named scott mindes .  a bright boy  but he s not the man to handle this .  the most embarrassing thing is that since swenson kicked up this fuss all sorts of things have been going wrong with project light .     i ll look into it if you wish  uncle hector .     good .  the accidents and bad breaks are nothing  i m sure  but we don t want swenson .  to maneuver us into some bad looking spot .  see what he s up to .  and watch out for that man of his .  urteil is his name and he has a reputation of being a capable and dangerous fellow .    so that was all it started out as .  just a bit of investigation to forestall political difficulties .  nothing more .   lucky landed on mercury s north pole expecting nothing more  and in two hours found himself at the wrong end of a .  blaster bolt .   lucky thought as he slogged back to the dome with mindes over his shoulders  there s more than just a bit of politics here .   dr .  karl gardoma stepped out of the small hospital room and faced lucky and bigman somberly .  he was wiping his strong hands on a pad of fluffy plastosorb  which he tossed into the disposal unit when he finished .  his dark complexioned face  almost brown  was disturbed  his heavy eyebrows lowering .  even his black       hair  cut close so that it stood up stiffly in thick array  seemed to accentuate his troubled appearance .    well  doctor .   said lucky .   dr .  gardoma said   i ve got him under sedation .  he ll be all right when he wakes .  i don t know if he ll remember clearly what happened .     has he had attacks like this before .     not since he came to mercury  mr .  starr .  i don t know what happened before then  but these last few months he s been under a great strain .     why .     he feels responsible for the accidents that have been interfering with the progress of project light .     is he responsible .     no  of course not .  but you can see how he feels .  he s sure everyone blames him .  project light is vitally important .  a great deal of money and effort has been put into it .  mindes is in charge of ten construction men  all five to ten years older than he is  and of an enormous amount of equipment .     how does it happen he s so young .    the doctor smiled grimly  but despite his grimness his white  even teeth made him look pleasant  even charming .  he said   sub etheric optics  mr .  starr  is a completely new branch of science .  only young men  fresh out of school  know enough about it .     you sound as though you know a bit about it yourself .     only what mindes told me .  we arrived in mercury on the same ship  you know  and he fascinated me  quite won me over with what his project hopes to accomplish .  do you know about it .     not a thing .         well  it involves hyperspace  that portion of space  that lies outside the ordinary boundary of the space we  know .  the laws of nature that apply to ordinary space  don t apply to hyperspace .  for instance  in ordinary  space it is impossible to move faster than the speed of  light  so that it would take at least four years to reach  the nearest star .  in going through hyperspace any speed  is possible   the physician broke off with a sud  den  apologetic smile .   you know all this  i m sure .     i suppose most people know that the discovery of hyperspatial flight made travel to the stars possible   said lucky   but what about project light .     well   said dr .  gardoma   in ordinary space  light travels in straight lines in a vacuum .  it can only be bent by large gravitational forces .  in hyperspace  on the other hand  it can be bent as easily as if it were a cotton thread .  it can be focused  dispersed  bent back upon itself .  that s what the theory of hyperoptics says .     and scott mindes  i suppose  is here to test that theory .     that s right .     why here .   asked lucky .   i mean  why on mercury .     because there s no other planetary surface in the solar system where there is such a concentration of light over so large an area .  the effects mindes is looking for can be detected most easily here .  it would be a hundred tunes as expensive to set up the project on earth  and results would be a hundred times as uncertain .  so mindes tells me .     only now we re having these accidents .    dr .  gardoma snorted .   they re no accidents .  and  mr .  starr  they have to be stopped .  do you know what       the success of project light would mean .   he drove on  caught up in the vision .   earth would no longer be the slave of the sun .  space stations circling earth could intercept sunlight  push it through hyperspace  and spread it evenly over the earth .  the desert heat and the polar cold would vanish .  the seasons would be rearranged to our liking .  we could control the weather by controlling the distribution of sunlight .  we could have eternal sunlight where we wanted it  night of any length where we wanted it .  earth would be an ak conditioned paradise .     it would take time  i imagine .     a great deal of it  but this is the beginning .   .   .   .  look  i may be out of order here  but aren t you the david starr who cleared up the matter of the food poisonings on mars .    there was an edge to lucky s voice as he answered  and his brows contracted slightly .   what makes you think so .    dr .  gardoma said   i am a physician  after all .  the poisonings seemed at first to be a disease epidemic  and i was much interested in it at the tune .  there were rumors about a young councilman s having played the chief role in straightening the mystery  and names were mentioned .    lucky said   suppose we let it go at that .   he was displeased  as always  at any intimation that he was becoming well known .  first mindes  now gardoma .   dr .  gardoma said   but if you are that starr  you re here  i hope  to stop these so called accidents .    lucky did not seem to hear .  he said   when will i be able to talk to scott mindes  dr .  gardoma .     not for at least twelve hours .         and will he be rational .      i m certain of that .    a new guttural baritone voice broke in .   are you  gardoma .  is that because you know our boy mindes was never irrational .    dr .  gardoma whirled at the sound and made no effort to hide the look of acute dislike on his face .   what are you doing here  urteil .     keeping my eyes and ears open  though i suppose you d rather i kept them closed   the newcomer said .   both lucky and bigman were staring at him curiously .  he was a large man  not tall  but broad of shoulder and thick muscled .  his cheeks were blue with stubble  and there was a rather unpleasant air of self assurance about him .   dr .  gardoma said   i don t care what you do with your eyes and ears  but not in my office  if you don t mind .     why not in your office .   demanded urteil .   you re a doctor .  patients have a right to come in .  maybe i m a patient .     what s your complaint .     how about these two .  what are their complaints .  hormone deficiency  for one thing  i suppose .   his eyes fell lazily on bigman jones as he said that .   there was a breathless interlude in which bigman turned a deathly white and then seemed to swell .  slowly he rose from his seat  his eyes round and staring .  his lips moved as though forming the words  hormone deficiency   as though he were trying to convince himself that he had actually heard the words and that it was no illusion .   then  with the speed of a cobra striking  bigman s       five foot two of cord whip muscle launched itself at the broad  sneering figure before him .   but lucky moved faster .  his hands shot downward  catching bigman at each shoulder .   easy  bigman .    the small martian struggled desperately .   you heard him  lucky .  you heard him .     not now  bigman .    urteil s laugh was a series of sharp barks .   let him go  fella .  i ll smear the little boy over the floor with my finger .    bigman howled and writhed in lucky s grip .   lucky said   i wouldn t say anything else  urteil  or you may be in a kind of trouble your senator friend won t be able to get you out of .    his eyes had become brown ice as he spoke and his voice was smooth steel .   urteil s glance locked with lucky s for a moment  then fell away .  he mumbled something about joking .  bigman s harsh breathing calmed somewhat  and as lucky slowly released his grip the martian took his seat  still trembling with almost unbearable fury .   dr .  gardoma  who had watched the bit of byplay tensely  said   you know urteil  mr .  starr .     by reputation .  he s jonathan urteil  senator swen son s roving investigator .     well  call it that   muttered the physician .    and i know you too  david starr  lucky starr  whatever you call yourself   said urteil .   you re the roving wonder boy for the council of science .  mars poisonings .  asteroid pkates .  venusian telepathy .  do   have the list correct .     you have   said lucky tonelessly .   urteil grinned triumphantly .   there isn t much the      senator s office doesn t know about the council of science .  and there isn t much i don t know about things happening here .  for instance  i know about the attempt on your life  and i ve come here to see you about it .     why .     to give you a little warning .  just a friendly little warning .  i suppose the medic here has been telling you what a nice guy mindes is .  just a momentary splash of unbearable strain  he s been telling you  i suppose .  they re great friends  mindes and he .     i just said   began dr .  gardoma .    let me say   said urteil .   let me say this  scott mindes is about as harmless as a two ton asteroid heading for a space ship .  he wasn t temporarily insane when he pointed a blaster at you .  he knew what he was doing .  he tried to kill you in cold blood  starr  and if you don t watch out  he ll succeed next time .  because you can bet your small friend s martian hip boots he ll try again .       death waits in a room  the silence that followed seemed pleasant for no one but urteil .   then lucky said   why .  what s his motive .    urteil said calmly   because he s afraid .  he s out here with millions of cash invested  cash that s been given him by a lax council of science  and he can t make his experiments work .  he s calling his incompetence bad breaks .  eventually he ll go back to earth and cry about mercury s jinx .  then he ll get more money out of the council  or  rather  out of the taxpayers  for some other fool scheme .  now you re coming to mercury to investigate  and he s afraid that the council  in  spite of itself  may learn a little of the truth you  take it from there .    lucky said   if this is the truth  you know it already .     yes  and i hope to prove it .     but you re the danger to mindes  then .  by your reasoning  it is you he should try to kill .    urteil grinned and his plump cheeks broadened until his jowly face looked wider than it was long .  he said   he has tried to kill me .  true enough .  but i ve been through many tough sieges working for the senator .  i can handle myself .             scott mindes never tried to kill you or anybody   said dr .  gardoma  his face pinched and white .   you know it  too .    urteil made no direct answer .  he spoke instead to lucky .   and keep an eye on the good doctor too .  as i said  he s great friends with mindes .  if i were you  i wouldn t let him treat me for as much as a headache .   pills and injections can   he snapped ms fingers  with a sharp cracking noise .   dr .  gardoma  words coming thickly  said   some  day  someone will kill you for    urteil said carelessly   yes .  are you planning on being the one .   he turned to go  then said over his shoulder   oh  i forgot .  i hear that old man peverale wants to see you .  he s very disturbed at there being no official welcome .  he s upset .  so go see him and pat his  poor old head for him and  starr  another hint .   after this  don t use any protective suits of any kind without checking them for leaks .  know what i mean .   with that  finally  he left .   long moments passed before gardoma was near normality again  before he could talk without choking .  then he said   he riles me more every time i see him .  he s a mean mouthed  lying       a mighty shrewd fellow   said lucky dryly .   it seems obvious that one of his methods of attack is deliberately to say exactly what is calculated most to anger his opponent .  an angry opponent is a half helpless one .  .  .  .  and  bigman  that goes for you .  you can t just flail away at anyone who hints you re under sk feet .     lucky   wailed the pint sized martian   he said i was hormone deficient .          then learn to wait for the appropriate moment to convince him otherwise .    bigman grumbled rebelliously  and one clenched fist beat softly against the tough plastic of his silver and vermilion hip boots  the colorfully designed hip boots that no one but a martian farm boy would wear and which no martian farm boy would be without .  bigman owned a dozen  each more glaring than the last  .   lucky said   well  we ll look up dr .  peverale .  he s the head of the observatory  isn t he .     the head of the whole dome   said the doctor .   actually  he s getting old and he s lost touch .  i m glad to say that he hates urteil as much as any of us do  but there s nothing he can do about it .  he can t buck the senator .  i wonder if the council of science can .   he ended gloomily .   lucky said   i think so .  now remember  i ll want to see mindes when he wakes up .     all right .  take care of yourself .     lucky stared at him curiously .   take care of myself .  how do you mean .    dr .  gardoma flushed .   just an expression .  i always say it .  i don t mean anything by it .     i see .  well  then  we ll be meeting again .  come along  bigman  and stop frowning .    dr .  lance peverale shook them both by the hand with a vigor that was surprising in a man so old .  his dark eyes were lit with concern and appeared the darker for the white eyebrows that topped them .  his hair  still abundant  retained a considerable amount of its original color and had not faded past an iron gray .  his lined and leathery cheeks  above which sharp      cheekbones stood out prominently  did most to give him the appearance of age .   he spoke slowly and gently .   i am sorry  gentlemen  most concerned that you should have had such a distressing experience so soon after arriving at the observatory .  i blame myself .     you have no reason to  dr .  peverale   said lucky .    the fault is mine  sir .  had i been here to greet you  as i ought to have but there  we were following an  important and quite anomalous prominence  and i m afraid i allowed my profession to tempt me from the proper expression of hospitality .     in any case  you are forgiven   said lucky  and he glanced sidewise with some amusement at bigman  who was listening  open mouthed  to the old man s stately flow of words .    i am past forgiveness   said the astronomer   but it pleases me that you make the attempt .  meanwhile  i have ordered that quarters be placed at your disposal .   he linked arms with both of them  urging them along the well lit but narrow corridors of the dome .   our facilities are crowded  particularly since dr .  mindes and his engineers have arrived and   and others .  still  i imagine you will find it welcome to have an opportunity to refresh yourselves and to sleep  perhaps .  you will wish for food  i am sure  and it will be sent to you .  tomorrow will be time enough for you to meet us all socially  and for us to find out your purpose in coming here .  for myself  the fact that the council of science vouches for you is sufficient .  we will have a kind of banquet in your honor .    the corridor level was sinking as they walked  and       they were burrowing into mercury s vitals toward the residential level of the dome .   lucky said   you are very kind .  perhaps i will also have the opportunity to inspect the observatory .    peverale seemed delighted at that .   i will be at your service in the matter  and i am sure you will not regret time spent in such an inspection .  our major equipment is mounted on a movable platform designed to move with the advancing or receding terminator .  in that fashion  a particular portion of the sun can be kept continually in view despite mercury s motions .     wonderful .  but now  dr .  peverale  one question .  what is your opinion of dr .  mindes .  i d appreciate a frank answer without any consideration for such things as diplomacy .    peverale frowned .   are you a sub temporal engineer too .     not quite   said lucky   but i was asking about dr .  mindes .     exactly .  well    and the astronomer looked thoughtful    he is a pleasant young man  quite competent  i should think  but nervous  very nervous .  he is easily offended  too easily offended .  it has shown up as time has gone on and things have not been quite right with his project  and it is making him a little difficult to get along with .  a pity  for as i say  he is a pleasant young man  otherwise .  i am his superior  of course  while he is here at the dome  but i don t really interfere with him .  his project has no connection with our observatory work .     and your opinion of jonathan urteil .    the old astronomer stopped walking on the instant .   what about him .         how does he get along here .     i am not interested in discussing the man   said peverale .   they walked on in silence for a short while .  the astronomer s face was lowering .   lucky said   are there any other outsiders at the dome .  there are you and your men  mindes and his men  and urteil .  anyone else .     the doctor  of course .  dr .  gardoma .     you do not consider him one of your own men .     well  he s a doctor and not an astronomer .  he supplies the one service the dome must have and can t use machinery for .  he cares for our health .  he s new here .     how new .     he replaced our old doctor after the latter s one year shift .  dr .  gardoma arrived on the same ship that carried mindes s group  as a matter of fact .     one year shift .  is that common for doctors here .     and most of the men .  it makes it difficult to keep up continuity  and it is hard to train a man and have him leave  but then  mercury is not an easy place to remain  and our men must be replaced frequently .     then in the last six months how many new men have you received here .     perhaps twenty .  the exact figures are in our records  but twenty is about it .     surely you yourself have been here quite a while .    the astronomer laughed .   many years .  i hate to think how many .  and dr .  cook  my assistant director  has been here for six years .  of course we take vacations frequently .   .   .   .  well  here are your quarters        gentlemen .  if there is anything you should wish  do not hesitate to inform me .    bigman looked about him .  the room was a small one  but it held two beds that could fold up into a wall recess when not in use  two chairs of which the same was true  a one piece desk chair combination  a small closet  and an adjoining wash room .    hey   he said   a lot better than the ship  anyway  huh .     not bad   said lucky .   this is probably one of their better rooms .     why not .   said bigman .   i guess he knows who you are .     i guess not  bigman   said lucky .   he thought i might be a sub temporal engineer .  all he knows is that the council sent me .     everyone else knows who you are   said bigman .    not everyone .  mindes  gardoma  and urteil .   .   .   .  look  bigman  why don t you use the washroom .  i ll have some food sent up and have them bring in the general utility kit from the shooting starr    suits me   said bigman cheerily .   bigman sang loudly through the shower .  as usual on a waterless world  the bath water was strictly rationed  with stern warnings on the wall as to the amount it was permissible to use .  but bigman had been born and bred on mars .  he had a huge respect for water and would no more think of splashing idly in it than in beef stew .  so he used detergent copiously and water carefully and sang loudly .   he stepped in front of the forced hot air dryer which      tingled his skin with its jets of bone dry air and slapped his body with his hands to enhance the effect .    hey  lucky   he yelled   is there food on the table .  i m hungry .    he heard lucky s voice speaking softly but could make out no words .    hey  lucky   he repeated  and stepped out of the washroom .  the desk had two steaming platters of roast beef and potatoes on it .   a slight sharpness in the aroma indicated the meat  at least  to be really a yeast imitation from the sub sea gardens of venus .   lucky  however  was not eating  but sat on the bed and spoke into the room s talkie .   dr .  peverale s face was gazing out of the receiving plate .   lucky said   well  then  was it general knowledge that this was to be our room .     not general knowledge  but i gave the order to prepare your room over an open hookup .  there was no reason for secrecy as far as i could see .  i suppose anyone might have overheard .  furthermore  your room is one of a few such that are reserved for distinguished guests .  there is no secret about it .     i see .  thank you  sir .     is anything wrong .     not at all   said lucky  smiling  and broke connection .  his smile disappeared and he looked thoughtful .    nothing wrong  my foot   exploded bigman .   what s up  lucky .  don t tell me there isn t anything wrong .     something is wrong  yes .  i ve been looking at the       equipment here .  these are special insulated suits for use on the sun side  i imagine .    bigman lifted one of the suits hanging in a special wall recess .  it was amazingly light for its bulk  nor could that be attributed to mercurian gravity  since gravity here in the dome was maintained at earth normal .   he shook his head .  as usual  if he had to use a suit supplied him out of stock rather than one built to specifications  he would have to reduce all fittings to the minimum and even so find it inconvenient to use .  he sighed resignedly .  it was the penalty he paid for not being exactly tall .  he always thought of it that way   not exactly tall .   he never thought of his five foot two as being actually  short .    he said   sands of mars  they ve got everything here for us  all set and waiting .  bed .  bath .  food .  suits .     and something else too   said lucky gravely .   death is waiting in this room .  see here .    lucky lifted one arm of the larger suit .  the ball joint at the shoulder moved easily  but where it joined the shaft of the shoulder there was a tiny  all but unnoticeable gap .  it would have been completely un noticeable if lucky s fingers had not spread it apart .   it was a slash .  man made  obviously .  insulation showed .    on the inner surface   said lucky   there s a similar slash .  this suit would have lasted just long enough to get me out on the sun side  and then it would have killed me neatly .       over the banquet table   urteil .   cried bigman at once  with a ferocity that  stiffened every muscle of his small body .   that dirty  cobber     why urteil .   asked lucky softly .    he warned us to watch our suits  lucky .  remember .     of course .  and it s exactly what i did .     sure .  he set it up for us .  we find a slashed suit and we think he s a great guy .  then we re cold meat for him  next time around .  don t fall for that  lucky .  he s  a     now wait  bigman  wait .  don t make your mind up so fast .  look at it this way .  urteil said mindes had tried to kill him  too .  suppose we believe him .  suppose mindes had tried to gimmick urteil s suit and urteil had spotted it in time .  urteil would warn us to watch out for the same trick .  maybe mindes did this .     sands of mars  lucky  that can t be .  this guy  mindes  is ladled full of sleeping pills  and before that he wasn t out of our sight from the minute we got onto this miserable rock .     all right .  how do we know mindes is asleep and under medication .   asked lucky .    gardoma says   began bigman  and fell silent .            exactly .  gardoma says .  we haven t seen mindes  though .  we only know what dr .  gardoma said  and dr .  gardoma is a great friend of mindes s .     the two of them are in it together   said bigman   with instant conviction .   jumping comets     wait  wait  don t you jump so .  great galaxy  big man  i m just trying to straighten out my thoughts  and you take me up on everything .   his tone was as disapproving as it could ever be with respect to his small friend .  he went on   now you ve complained a dozen times that i don t tell you everything on my mind until everything s done with .  this is why  you blaster happy nitwit .  as soon as i advance a theory  you re off on a charge  all your weapons cocked and ready .     i m sorry  lucky   said bigman .   go ahead .     all right .  now urteil is easy to suspect .  nobody  likes him .  even dr .  peverale doesn t .  you saw how he  reacted just to the mention of his name .  we ve met him  only once and you dislike him      i ll say   muttered bigman .       while i don t exactly like him  either .  anyone can slash this suit and hope that suspicion will fall on urteil if it should happen to be discovered  and it would be surely discovered after it s killed someone  if not before .     i see all that  lucky .     on the other hand   went on lucky smoothly   mindes has already tried to get rid of me with a blaster .  if that were a serious attempt  he doesn t seem the type to do anything as indirect as suit slashing .  as for dr .  gardoma  i don t see him involving himself in the murder of a councilman just out of friendship for mindes .          then what s the decision .   cried bigman impatiently .    there isn t any so far   said lucky   except maybe that we go to sleep .   he turned down the bed sheets and stepped into the washroom .   bigman looked after him and shrugged his shoulders .   scott mindes was sitting up in bed when lucky and bigman entered his quarters the next morning .  he was pale and looked tired .    hello   he said .   karl gardoma told me what happened .  you don t know how sorry i am .    lucky passed it off with a shrug .   how do you feel .     wrung out but all right  if you know what i mean .  i ll be at the dinner party old peverale is giving tonight .     is that wise .     i won t leave urteil there holding the fort   said mindes  hatred suddenly flooding his face with momentary color   telling everyone i m crazy .  or dr .  peverale  either  for that matter .     dr .  peverale doubts your sanity .   asked lucky softly .    well look  starr  i ve been scouting the sun   side in a small rocket scooter ever since the accidents  started getting bad .  i had to do it .  it s my project .   twice  now  i   i ve seen something .    mindes paused and lucky prodded mm .   seen what  dr .  mindes .     i wish i could say for sure .  i saw it only from a distance each time .  something moving .  something that      looked human .  something in a space suit .  not one of our inso suits  our special insulated jobs  you know .  it looked more like an ordinary space suit .  ordinary metal  you know .     did you try to get closer .     yes  and i lost it .  and the photographs showed nothing either .  just spots of light and dark that might have been something  or nothing .  but it was something  all right .  something that moved under the sun as though it didn t care a thing for the heat and radiation .  it would even stand still in the sun for minutes at a time .  that s what got me .     is that strange .  standing still  i mean .    mindes laughed shortly .   on the mercury sun side .  it sure is .  nobody stands still .  insulated suit and all  you go about your business as fast as you can and get out from under as fast as you can .  this near the terminator the heat isn t so bad .  it s the radiation  though .  it s just good practice to take as little of it as possible .  the inso suits aren t complete protection against gamma rays .  if you must stand still  you move into the shade of a rock .     what s your explanation of it all .    mindes s voice fell to an almost shamed whisper .   i don t think it s a man .     you re not going to say it s a two legged ghost  are you .   said bigman suddenly  before lucky could nudge him into silence .   but mindes only shook his head .   did i use that  phrase on the surface .  i seem to remember no   i think it s a mercurian .     what .   cried bigman  sounding as if he thought that were worse .         how else could it endure the sun s radiation and heat so .     why would it need a space suit then .   asked lucky .    well  i don t know .   mindes s eyes flashed  and a restless wildness settled upon them .   but it s something .  when i got back to the dome  every man and every suit could be accounted for each time .  dr .  peverale won t authorize an expedition to make a real search .  he says we re not equipped for it .     have you told him what you told me .     he thinks i m crazy .  i m sure of it .  he thinks i m seeing reflections and building men out of them in my imagination .  but that s not so  starr .    lucky said   have you contacted the council of science .     how can i .  dr .  peverale wouldn t back me .  urteil would say i was mad and they would listen to him .  who would listen to me .     i would   said lucky .   mindes sat up in bed with a jerk .  his hand shot out as though it were ready to grasp the other s sleeve but then held back .  he said  in a choked voice   then you ll investigate it .     in my way   promised lucky   i will .    the others were already at the banquet table that evening when lucky and bigman arrived .  above the hum of greeting that rose as they entered and the beginning of the introductions  there were obvious signs that the gathering was not entirely a pleasant one .   dr .  peverale sat at the head of the table  his thin lips set and his sunken cheeks quivering  the picture of      dignity maintained under difficulty .  at his left was the broad shouldered figure of urteil  lounging back in his chair  thick fingers playing delicately with the rim of a drinking glass .   toward the foot of the table was scott mindes  looking painfully young and tired as he stared with angry frustration at urteil .  next to him was dr .  gardoma  watching with an anxious and thoughtful eye as though ready to interfere in case mindes grew rash .   the remaining seats  except for two empty ones at dr .  peverale s right  were occupied by several of the senior men of the observatory .  one in particular  han ley cook  second in command at the dome  leaned his tall  lean body forward and took lucky s hand firmly in his own .   lucky and bigman took their seats and the salads were served .   urteil said at once in a harsh voice that effectively took over the conversation   we were wondering just before you came in whether young mindes ought not to tell you of the great wonders in store for earth as a result of his experiments .     no such thing   snapped mindes   and i ll do my own talking if you don t mind .     oh  come on  scott   said urteil  grinning broadly   don t be bashful .  well  then  look here  i ll tell the man .    dr .  gardoma s hand fell  as though by accident  on mindes s shoulder  and the young engineer swallowed a cry of indignation and remained silent .   urteil said   now i warn you  starr  this is going to  be good .  it    lucky interrupted   i know something of the experi        ments .  the grand result of an air conditioned planet is quite possible  i think .    urteil scowled .   that so .  i m glad you re optimistic .  poor scott can t even make the pilot experiment work .  or at least he says he can t  don t you  scott .    mindes half rose  but again dr .  gardoma s hand was on his shoulder .   bigman s eyes traveled from speaker to speaker  resting on urteil with black distaste .  he said nothing .   the arrival of the main course stopped the conversation momentarily  and dr .  peverale tried desperately to turn it into less explosive channels .  for a while he succeeded  but then urteil  with the last of his helping of roast beef impaled on his fork  leaned toward lucky and said   so you go for the project mindes is running  do you .     i think it s a reasonable one .     you have to think that  being a member of the council of science .  but what if i told you that the experiments here were phony  they could be run on earth for one per cent of the cost if the council were only interested enough in the taxpayers  money to save a little of it .  what would you say if i told you that .     the same thing i would say if you told me anything at all   retorted lucky composedly .   i would say  mr .  urteil  that the chances are that you re lying .  it s your greatest talent and  i believe  pleasure .    instantly a great silence fell on the banqueters  even on urteil .  his thick cheeks seemed to sag in surprise and his eyes to bulge .  with sudden passion  he leaned directly across dr .  peverale s place  rising from his seat and bringing his right hand down hard and flat just short of lucky s platter .        no council lackey     he began in a roar .   and as he did that  bigman moved  too .  no eye at the table saw the details of that move  since it flashed with the speed of a striking snake  but urteil s roar ended in a shout of dismay .   urteil s hand  which had come down with such hard finality  now showed the carved metallic haft of a force knife growing out of it .   dr .  peverale scraped his chair back suddenly  and there was a cry or an exclamation from every man there but bigman himself .  even lucky seemed startled .   bigman s tenor voice rose in delight .   spread your fingers  you tub of mineral oil .  spread them and then grease back down into your seat .    urteil stared at his small tormenter without understanding for a moment and then very slowly spread his fingers .  his hand was not hurt  not a sliver of skin had been removed .  the force knife stood quivering in the hard plastic table top  an inch of its waveringly luminescent force blade  it wasn t matter  merely a thin field of immaterial force  in sight .  the knife had entered the table  working its way neatly and unerringly between the second and third finger of urteil s hand .   urteil snatched ms hand away as though it were suddenly in flames .   bigman crowed with delight and said   and next time you reach a hand in lucky s direction or in mine  you cobber  i chop it right off .  what would you say if i told you that .  and whatever you say  say it politely .   he reached out for the force knife  deactivating the blade as he seized the haft  and returned it to its inconspicuous holster on his belt .   lucky said  with a light frown   i wasn t aware that       my friend was armed .  i m sure he s sorry for having disturbed the meal  but i believe mr .  urteil may take this incident to heart .    someone laughed and there was a tight smile on mindes s face .   urteil looked with hot eyes from face to face .  he said   i won t forget this treatment .  it s obvious to me that the senator is receiving little co operation  and he ll hear of that .  and meanwhile  i m staying right here .   he folded his arms as though daring anyone to make mm leave .   little by little the conversation grew general .   lucky said to dr .  peverale   you know  sir  it seems to me that your face is familiar .     is it .   the astronomer smiled in a strained fashion .   i don t think i ever met you before .     well  were you ever on ceres .     ceres .   the old astronomer looked at lucky with some surprise .  he had obviously not yet recovered from the force knife episode .   the largest observatory in the solar system is on that asteroid .  i worked there as a young man  and i frequently visit it even now .     then i wonder if i didn t perhaps see you there .    lucky couldn t help thinking  as he spoke  of those exciting days when the chase was on for captain anton and the pirates who were making their lair in the asteroids .  and particularly the day when the pirate ships raided the very heart of council territory  onto the surface of ceres itself  winning out temporarily by the very daring of their undertaking .   but dr .  peverale was shaking his head in gentle good humor .   i would have been certain  sir  had i had the pleasure of seeing you there .  i am sure i did not .         too bad   said lucky .    the loss is mine  i assure you .  but then it was my season for loss .  as a result of an intestinal ailment  i missed all the excitement in connection with the pirate raid .  i knew of it only through the conversations i overheard among my nurses .    dr .  peverale looked about the table now  his good humor restored .  the dessert was being served by the mechanical tray carrier .  he said   gentlemen  there has been some discussion of project light .    he paused to smile benignly  then went on .   it isn t exactly a happy subject under the circumstances  but i have been thinking a good deal about the accidents that have disturbed so many of us .  it seems it would be a good time for me to give you all my thoughts on the matter .  after all  dr .  mindes is here .  we have had a good meal .  and  finally  i have something interesting to say .    urteil broke a long silence to ask grimly   you  dr .  peverale .    the astronomer said mildly   why not .  i have had interesting things to say many times in my life .  and i will say what s on my mind now .   there was a sudden gravity about him .   i believe i know the whole truth  the exact truth .  i know who is causing the destruction in connection with project light and why .       the direction of danger  the old astronomer s gentle face seemed pleased as he looked about the table  perhaps at having gained so absolutely the attention of all .  lucky looked about the table too .  he caught the expressions that greeted dr .  peverale s statement .  there was contempt on ur teil s broad features  a puzzled frown on dr .  gardoma s face  a sulkier one on that of mindes .  the others were held in various attitudes of curiosity and interest .   one man caught lucky s attention particularly .  it was hanley cook  dr .  peverale s second in command .  he stared at his finger ends  and there was something like weary disgust about him .  when he looked up  his expression had changed and settled into a cautious blankness .   nevertheless lucky thought   i ll have to talk to the man .    and then his attention shifted back to dr .  peverale .   dr .  peverale was saying   the saboteur can t be one of us  of course .  dr .  mindes tells me that he has investigated and is sure of that .  even without investigation  i am sure that none of us is capable of such criminal action .  yet the saboteur must be intelligent  since the destruction is too purposeful  too exclusively          directed against project light  to be the result of  chance or of anything nonintelligent .  therefore    bigman interrupted excitedly .   hey  you mean mercury has native life .  it s mercurians doing this .    there was a sudden buzz of confused comment and some laughter  at which bigman reddened .   well   said the small martian   isn t that what dr .  peverale is saying .     not quite   said dr .  peverale gently .    there is no life of any kind native to mercury   said one of the astronomers with emphasis .   that s one thing we re sure of .    lucky interposed   how sure .  has anyone looked .    the astronomer who had spoken seemed taken aback .  he said   there have been exploring parties .  certainly .    lucky smiled .  he had met intelligent beings on mars that no other man knew of .  he had discovered semi intelligent beings on venus where none had been thought to exist .  he  for one  was not ready to admit that any planet lacked life  or even intelligence .   he said   how many exploring parties .  how thorough was each exploration .  has every square mile been searched .    the astronomer did not answer .  he looked away  raising his eyebrows as though to say  what s the use .   bigman grinned  his little face wrinkling into a caricature of gnomish good humor .   dr .  peverale said   my dear starr  explorations have uncovered nothing .  while we grant that the possibility of mercurian life is not completely excluded  the probability of its existence is very low .  suppose we assume       that the only intelligent life in the galaxy is the human race .  certainly  it s the only one we know of .    with the martian mind beings in his memory  lucky did not agree with that  but he kept silent and let the old man continue .   it was urteil  little by little having recovered his self possession  who intervened .   what do you think you re getting at   he asked  and it was characteristic of the man that he could not resist adding   if anything .    dr .  peverale did not answer urteil directly .  he looked from face to face  deliberately ignoring the congressional investigator .  he said   the point is  there are humans elsewhere than on earth .  there are humans in many star systems .   a queer change came across the astronomer s face .  it pinched in  grew white  and his nostrils flared as though he were suddenly overpowered with anger .   for instance  there are humans on the planets of sirius .  what if they are the saboteurs .     why should they be .   asked lucky at once .    why not .  they have committed aggression against earth before .    so much was true .  lucky starr himself had helped  not too long before  to repel a sirian invasion flotilla that had landed on ganymede  but in that case they had left the solar system without pushing matters to a showdown .  yet  on the other hand  it was a common thing for many earthmen to blame sirians for anything that went wrong .   dr .  peverale was saying with energy   i ve been there .  i ve been to sirius only five months ago .  it took a great deal of red tape because sirius welcomes neither immigrants nor visitors  but it was a matter of an      interstellar astronomical convention  and i managed to get a visa .  i was determined to see for myself  and i must say i wasn t disappointed .    the planets of sirius are thinly populated and they are extremely decentralized .  they live in isolated individual family units  each with its own energy source and services .  each has its group of mechanical slaves    there s no other word possible   slaves in the shape of positronic robots  which do the labor .  the sirian humans maintain themselves as a fighting aristocracy .  every one of them can handle a space cruiser .  they ll never rest till they destroy the earth .    bigman shifted restlessly in his seat .   sands of mars  let them try .  let them try  is all i say .     they will when they are quite ready   said dr .  peverale   and  unless we do something quickly to meet the danger  they will win .  what have we got to oppose them .  a population in the billions  true  but how many can handle themselves in space .  we are six billion rabbits and they are one million wolves .  earth is helpless and grows more helpless every year .  we are fed by grain from mars and yeast from venus .  we get our minerals from the asteroids  and we used to get them from mercury  too  when the mines here were working .    why  starr  if project light succeeds  earth will be dependent on space stations for the manner in which it gets its very sunshine .  don t you see how vulnerable that makes us .  a sirian raiding party  by attacking the outposts of the system  could panic and starve earth without ever having to fight us directly .    and can we do anything to them in return .  no matter how many of them we kill  the remaining sirians       are always self contained and self sufficient .  any of them could continue the war .    the old man was almost breathless with passion .  there was no questioning his sincerity .  it was as though he were getting something out of himself that had been stifling him .   lucky s eye wandered back to dr .  peverale s second  hanley cook .  the man was resting his forehead on the bony knuckles of one large hand .  his face was flushed  but to lucky it did not seem like a flush of either anger or indignation .  rather  it seemed one of embarrassment .   scott mindes spoke up skeptically .   what would be  the point  dr .  peverale .  if they re getting along on  sirius  why should they come to earth .  what would  they get out of us .  even supposing they conquer earth   they would only have to support us     nonsense .   rapped out the senior astronomer .   why should they .  they would want earth s resources  not earth s population .  get that through your head .  they d let us starve .  it would be part of their policy .     oh  come   said gardoma .   that s unbelievable .     not out of cruelty   said dr .  peverale   out of policy .  they despise us .  they consider us scarcely more than animals .  the sirians themselves are very race conscious .  since earthmen first colonized sirius  they have been breeding themselves carefully until they are free of diseases and of various characteristics which they consider undesirable .    they are of uniform appearance  while earthmen are of all shapes  sizes  colors  varieties .  the sirians consider us inferior .  that s why they won t let us emi       grate to sinus .  they wouldn t let me attend the convention till the government pulled every string possible .  astronomers from other systems were all welcome but not from earth .    and human life  any kind of human life  doesn t mean much to them  anyway .  they re machine centered .  i ve watched them with their metal men .  they re more considerate of a sirian robot  almost  than of a sirian man .  they would regard a robot as worth a hundred men of earth .  they pamper those robots .  they love them .  nothing s too good for them .    lucky murmured   robots are expensive .  they have to be treated carefully .     maybe so   said dr .  peverale   but men who become accustomed to worrying about the needs of machines become callous about the needs of men .    lucky starr leaned forward  elbows on the table  dark eyes serious and the smooth vertical lines of his handsome  still subtly boyish face set gravely .  he said   dr .  peverale  if the sirians are race conscious and are breeding themselves into uniformity  they will defeat themselves in the long run .  it is variety in the human race that brings about progress .  it is earth and not sirius that is in the forefront of scientific research .  earthmen settled sirius in the first place  and it is we  not our sirian cousins  who are advancing in new directions every year .  even the positronic robots you mention were invented and developed on earth by earthmen .     yes   said the astronomer   but earthmen don t make use of the robot .  it would upset our economy  and we place the comfort and security of today above  the safety of tomorrow .  we use our scientific advance       to make ourselves weaker .  sinus uses its to make itself stronger .  that s the difference and that s the danger .    dr .  peverale threw himself back in his chair  looking grim .  the mechanical tray carrier cleared the table .   lucky pointed at it .   that s a sort of a robot  if you like   he said .   the mechanical tray carrier went quietly about its task .  it was a flat surfaced thing moving smoothly on a diamagnetic field  so that its gently curved base never actually touched the floor .  its limber tentacles removed dishes with careful delicacy  placing some on its upper surface  others within a cabinet in its side .    that s a simple automaton   snorted dr .  peverale .   it has no positronic brain .  it cannot adapt itself to any change in its task .     well  then   said lucky   are you saying that the sirians are sabotaging project light .     yes .  i am .     why should they .    dr .  peverale shrugged .   perhaps it s just part of a larger plan .  i don t know what trouble there is elsewhere in the solar system .  these may be the first random probings to prepare for ultimate invasion and conquest project light in itself means nothing  the sirian danger everything .  i wish i could rouse the council of science and the government and the people to that truth .    hanley cook coughed  then spoke for the first time .   the sirians are human like the rest of us .  if they re on the planet  where are they .    dr .  peverale said coldly   that s for an exploring expedition to find out .  a well prepared  well equipped expedition .         wait a minute   said mindes  his eyes glinting with  excitement   i ve been out on the sun side  and i ll  swear     a well prepared  well equipped expedition   repeated the old astronomer firmly .   your one man flights mean nothing  mindes .    the engineer stuttered a moment and slumped into an embarrassed silence .   lucky said suddenly   you seem to be unhappy about this  urteil .  what is your opinion of dr .  pever ale s view .    the investigator lifted his eyes and met those of lucky for a long moment in hatred and open defiance .  it was obvious he had not forgotten  nor would forget  the earlier exchange at this table .   he said   i m keeping my opinion to myself .  but i will say this  i m not fooled by anything that s going on here tonight .    his mouth clamped shut and lucky  having waited a moment for further remarks  turned to peverale and said   i wonder if we do need a complete expedition  sir .  if we suppose that the sirians are here on mercury  can we perhaps deduce where they might be .     go ahead  lucky   crowed bigman at once .   show them how .    dr .  peverale said   how do you mean .     well  what would be the best for the sirians .  if they ve been sabotaging project light at frequent intervals over a period of months  it would be most convenient for them to have a base near the project .  yet at the same time  the base must not be easily detected .  they ve certainly been successful in the second re        quirement  anyway .  now where could such a handy  but secret  base be .    let s divide up mercury into two parts  sun side and dark side .  it seems to me that they would be foolish to set up a base on sun side .  too hot  too much radiation  too inhospitable .    cook grunted .   no more inhospitable than the dark side .     no  no   said lucky at once   you re wrong there .  the sun side presents an environment which is quite unusual .  humans aren t accustomed it it at all .  the dark side is something very familiar .  it is simply ground which is exposed to space  and the conditions of space are very familiar .  the dark side is cold but no colder than space .  it is dark and airless but no darker than any portion of space not in direct sunlight and certainly no more airless .  men have learned to live comfortably in space  and they can live on the dark side .     go on   said dr .  peverale  his old eyes gleaming with interest .   go on  mr .  starr .     but establishing a base that would serve over a period of months is not a simple thing .  they must have a ship or ships to get back to sirius someday .  or if they re to be picked up by a ship from outside they must still have ample stores of food and water  as well as an energy source .  all this takes up room  and yet they must be certain they will not be detected .  it leaves only one place where they can be .     where  lucky .   asked bigman  nearly jumping up and down in his eagerness .  he  at least  had no doubts that whatever lucky said was so .   where .     well   said lucky   when i first arrived here  dr .       mindes made mention of mines on mercury which had failed .  just a few moments ago  dr .  peverale spoke of mines on mercury that were once working .  from that i gather that there must be empty mine shafts and corridors on the planet  and they must be either here or at the south pole  since the polar regions are the only places where the temperature extremes are not too great .  am i right .    cook faltered .   yes  there are mines here .  before the observatory was established  the dome was the mining center .     then we re sitting on top of a large empty hole in mercury .  if the sirians are successfully hiding a large base  where else would it be .  there is the direction of danger .    a murmur of appreciation passed around the table  but it was shattered abruptly by urteil s guttural tones .   all very pretty   he said   but what does it all come to .  what are you going to do about it .     bigman and i   said lucky   intend to enter the mines just as soon as we can get ready .  if there s anything there  we ll find it .       preparations  dr .  gardoma said sharply   do you intend to go alone .     why not .   interposed urteil .   the heroics are cheap enough .  of course they ll go alone .  there s nothing and nobody there  and they know it .     care to join us .   asked bigman .   if you leave your big mouth behind you can fit into a suit .     you wouldn t crowd one even with yours   snarled urteil .   dr .  gardoma said again   there s no point in going  alone if     a preliminary investigation   said lucky   will do no harm .  actually  urteil may be right .  there may be no one there .  at the worst  we ll keep in touch with you at the dome and hope that we can handle any sirians we meet .  bigman and i are used to handling tight situations .     besides which   added bigman  his gnomish face puckering into a grin   lucky and i like tight situations .    lucky smiled and rose to his feet .   if we may be  excused    urteil at once rose  turned  and stamped away .  lucky s eyes followed him thoughtfully .             lucky stopped hartley cook as the latter passed  mm .  he touched his elbow gently .   cook looked up  his eyes all concern .   yes .  what is  it  sir .    lucky said quietly   may i see you in our quarters  as soon as possible .     i ll be there in fifteen minutes .  is that all right .    fine .    cook was very little later than that .  he stepped into their quarters softly  wearing the look of concern that seemed a constant part of him .  he was a man in his late forties with an angular face and light brown hair that was beginning to be touched with gray .   lucky said   i had forgotten to tell you where our quarters were .  i m sorry .    cook looked surprised .   i knew where you were assigned     well  good .  thank you for coming at our request .     oh   cook paused .  then he said hurriedly   glad to .  glad to .    lucky said   there s a small matter of the insulation suits in this room .  the ones intended for use on the sun side .     the inso suits .  we didn t forget the instruction film  did we .     no  no .  i viewed that .  it s quite another thing .    cook said   something wrong .     something wrong .   crowed bigman .   look for yourself .   he spread the arms in order to display the slashes .   cook looked blank  then flushed slowly and grew       round eyed with horror .   i don t see it s impos  sible here at the dome .    lucky said   the main thing is to get it replaced .     but who would do such a thing .  we must find out .     no use disturbing dr .  peverale .     no  no   said cook  at once  as though he had not thought of it before .    we ll find out the details in due time .  meanwhile i would like to get it replaced .     certainly .  i ll attend to it promptly .  no wonder you  wanted to see me .  great space    he got to his feet  in a kind of speechlessness and made as though to go .   but lucky stopped him .   wait  this is a minor thing .  there are other things we must discuss .  by the way  before we get to that   i take it you did not agree with dr .  peverale s views on the sirians .    cook frowned .   i d rather not discuss that .     i watched you as he was speaking .  you disapproved  i think .    cook seat down again .  his bony fingers clutched one another in a tight clasp and he said   he s an old man .  he s been all mixed up about the sirians for years .  psychopathic  almost .  he sees them under his bed .  he blames them for everything .  if our plates are overexposed  he blames them .  since he s been back from skius he s worse than ever  because of what he claims he went through .     what was it he went through .     nothing terrible  i suppose .  but they quarantined him .  they assigned him a separate building .  they were too polite sometimes .  they were too rude other times .  there was no way of suiting him  i suppose .  then they      forced a positronic robot on him to take care of personal services .     did he object to that too .     he claims it was because they wouldn t come near him themselves .  that s what i mean .  he took everything as an insult .     were you with him .    cook shook his head .   sirius would only accept one man  and he s senior .  i ought to have gone .  he s too old  really   too old .    cook was talking in a brooding sort of way .  he looked up suddenly .   this is all confidential  by the way .     completely   lucky assured him .    what about your friend .   said cook uncertainly .   i mean  i know he s honorable  but he s a little  uh  hotheaded .     hey   began bigman  stiffening .   lucky s affectionate hand came down on the little fellow s head and brushed his hair down on his forehead .   he s hotheaded  all right   he said   as you saw at the banquet table .  i can t always stop him in time and sometimes  when he s riled  he uses his tongue and his fist instead of his head .  that s something i always have to keep in mind .  still  when i ask him specifically to keep quiet about something  he is quiet  and that s all there is to it .     thank you   said cook .   lucky went on .   to get back to my original question  do you agree with dr .  peverale concerning the sirians in this present case .     i don t .  how would they know about project light  and why should they care .  i don t see them sending       ships and men and risking trouble with the solar sys  tem just so they can break a few cables .  of course  i  tell you this  dr .  peverale has been feeling hurt for  quite a while now     in what way .     well  mindes and his group were established here while he was at sirius .  he came back and found them here .  he knew they were coming eventually .  it s been planned for years .  still  coming back and actually finding them here was a shock .     has he tried to get rid of mindes .     oh no  nothing like that .  he s even been friendly .  it s just that it makes him feel that someday he ll be replaced altogether  maybe someday soon  and i suppose he hates the thought .  so it s pleasant for him to take charge and start a big affair about sirians .  that s his baby  you see .    lucky nodded  then said   tell me  have you ever been on ceres .    cook looked surprised at the change in subject but said   occasionally .  why .     with dr .  peverale .  alone .     with him  usually .  he goes more frequently than i do .    lucky grinned .   were you there at the time the pirates made their raid on ceres last year .    cook smiled too .   no  but the old man was .  we ve heard the story several times .  he was very angry about it .  he s practically never sick  and this one time he was just completely out .  he missed everything .     well  that s the way it goes .   .   .   .  and  now  i think we d better get to the main business .  i didn t like to bother dr .  peverale .  as you say  he s an old man .       you re his second and quite a bit younger    lucky smiled .    yes  of course .  what can i do .     it s about the mines .  i assume that somewhere at the dome there are records  maps  charts  something which will tell us the arrangements of the main shafts and so on .  obviously  we can t wander at random .     i m sure there are   agreed cook .    and you can get them and perhaps go over them with us .     yes  of course .     now as far as you know  dr .  cook  the mines are in good shape  i hope .  i mean  there s no danger of collapse or anything like that .     oh no  i m sure there s nothing of the sort possible .  we re built right over some of the shafts  and we had to look into the engineering when the observatory was first being set up .  the shafts are well buttressed and completely safe  particularly in mercury s gravity .     how come   asked bigman   the mines were shut down  if they re in such good shape .     a good question   said cook  and a small smile broke through his expression of settled melancholy .   do you want the true explanation or the interesting one .     both   said bigman at once .   cook offered smokes to the others which were refused  then lit a cigarette after tamping it on the back of one hand in an abstracted manner .   the truth is this .  mercury is quite dense  and there were hopes that it would be a rich source of the heavy metals  lead  silver  mercury  platinum .  it was  too  not as rich as might be  perhaps  but rich enough .  unfortunately  it       was uneconomic .  supporting the mines here and transporting the ore back to earth or even the moon for processing raised the price too high .    as for the interesting explanation  that s another thing completely .  when the observatory was first set up fifty years ago  the mines were still a going concern  though they were already closing down some of the shafts .  the original astronomers heard stories from the miners and passed it on to the newcomers .  it s part of the mercurian legendry .     what are the stories .   asked bigman .    it seems miners died in the shafts .     sands of mars .   cried bigman testily .   they die anywhere .  you think anybody lives forever .     these were frozen to death .     so .     it was a mysterious free ing .  the shafts were fairly well heated in those days  and their suit power units were in operation .  the stories accumulate embroidery  you know  and  eventually miners wouldn t go into the main shafts in anything but gangs  wouldn t go into the side shafts at all  and the mines shut down .    lucky nodded .  he said   you ll get the plans for the mines .     right off .  and replacements for that inso suit too .    preparations proceeded as though for a major expedition .  a new inso suit  replacing the one that had been slashed  was brought and tested  then laid to one side .  after all  it would be ordinary space suits for the dark side .   the charts were brought and studied .  together with cook  lucky sketched out a possible route of exploration  following the main shafts .       lucky left bigman to take care of packing the adjunct units with homogenized food and with water  which could be swallowed while still in the suit   make sure of the charge of the power units and the pressure on the oxygen tanks  inspect the working efficiency of the waste disposal unit and the moisture recirculator .   he himself made a short trip to their ship  the shooting starr .  he made the trip via the surface  carrying a field pack  the contents of which he did not discuss with bigman .  he returned without it but carrying two small objects that looked like thick belt buckles  slightly curved  in dull steel finish and centered by a rectangle in glassy red .    what s that .   asked bigman .    microergometers   said lucky .   experimental .  you know  like the ergometers on board ship except that those are bolted to the floor .     what can these things detect .     nothing at a couple of hundred thousand miles like a ship s ergometer  but it can detect atomic power sources at ten miles  maybe .  look  bigman  you activate it here .  see .    lucky s thumbnail exerted pressure against a small slit in one side of the mechanism .  a sliver of metal moved in  then out  and instantly the red patch on the surface glowed brightly .  lucky turned the small ergometer in this direction and that .  in one particular position  the red patch glowed with the energy of a nova .    that   said lucky   is probably the direction of the dome s power plant .  we can adjust the mechanism to zero that out .  it s a little tricky .   he worked painstak        ingly on the adjustment of two small controls so smoothly inset as nearly to be invisible .   he smiled as he worked  his engagingly youthful face lighting with pleasure .   you know  bigman  there isn t a time i visit uncle hector but that he doesn t load me up with the council s latest gadgets .  he claims that with the chances you and i are always taking  you know the way he talks  we need them .  sometimes  though  i think he just wants us to act as field testers for the gadgets .  this one  though  may be useful .     how  lucky .     for one thing  bigman  if there are sirians in the  mines  they ll have a small atomic power plant .  they ll  have to .  they ll need power for heat  for electrolyzing  water  and so on .  this ergometer should detect that at  ample distance .  and for another thing    he fell silent  and bigman s lips compressed in chagrin .  he knew what that silence meant .  lucky had thoughts which later he would claim had been too vague to talk about   is one of the ergometers for me .   he asked .    you bet   said lucky  tossing one of the ergometers toward him .  bigman snatched it out of the air .   hanley cook was waiting for them when they stepped out of their quarters  wearing their suits but with headpieces tucked under their arms .   he said   i thought i d lead you as far as the nearest entrance to the shafts .     thank you   said lucky .   it was the tail end of the sleeping period in the dome .  human beings always established an earth like      alternation of waking and sleeping  even where there was no day and night to guide them .  lucky had chosen this time on purpose  since he did not want to enter the mines at the head of a curious procession .  in this dr .  peverale had co operated .   the corridors of the dome were empty .  the lighting was dimmed .  and as they walked  a heavy silence seemed to fall about them while the clank of their footsteps sounded even louder .   cook stopped .   this is entry two .    lucky nodded .   all right .  i hope we ll be seeing one another again soon .     right .    cook operated the lock with his usual gloomy gravity  while lucky and bigman put on their headpieces  clamping them firmly along the paramagnetic seams .  lucky took his first breath of canned air with what was almost pleasure  he was so accustomed to it .   lucky first  then bigman  stepped into the air lock .  the wall closed behind them .   lucky said   ready  bigman .     you bet  lucky .   his words rang in lucky s radio receiver  and his small form was a shadow in the extremely dim light of the lock .   then the opposing wall opened .  they could feel the puff of air escaping into vacuum  and they stepped forward through the opening once again .   a touch at the outer controls and the wall closed behind them again .  this time  light was shut off altogether .   standing in absolute darkness  they found themselves inside the silent and empty mines of mercury .      the mines of mercury  they flicked on their suit lights and the darkness was alleviated over a little space .  they lit a tunnel that stretched out before them  dimly and more dimly and ending in darkness .  the light beam had the usual sharp edge inevitable in a vacuum .  everything outside the direct beam remained completely black .   the tall man from earth and his short companion from mars faced that darkness and marched forward into the bowels of mercury .   in the radiance of their suit lights  bigman looked curiously about at the tunnel  which resembled those he had seen on the moon .  rounded out smoothly by the use of blasters and disintegrating procedures  it stretched out straight and even .  the walls were curved and merged into the rocky ceiling .  the oval cross section  slightly flattened above and quite flattened below  made for the greatest structural strength .   bigman could hear his own steps through the air in his suit .  he could sense lucky s steps only as a small shock of vibration along rock .  it was not quite sound  but to a person who had passed as much of his life in vacuum and near vacuum as had bigman it was almost as meaningful .  he could  hear  the vibration of solid          material much as ordinary earthmen could hear the vibration of air which is called  sound .    periodically they passed columns of rock which had been left unblasted and which served as buttresses for the layers of rock between the tunnel and the surface .  again this was like the mines on the moon  except that the buttresses were both thicker and more numerous here  which was reasonable  since mercury s gravity  small as it was  was two and a half times that of the moon .   tunnels branched off the main shaft along which they traveled .  lucky  who seemed in no hurry  paused at each opening in order to compare matters with the chart he carried .   to bigman  the most melancholy aspect of the mines was the vestiges of one time human occupancy  the bolts where illumo plates must once have been attached to keep the corridors blazing with the light of day  the faint markings where paramagnetic relays must once have afforded traction for ore cars  occasional side pockets where rooms or laboratories must have existed  where miners might pause to eat at field kitchens or where samples of ore might be assayed .   all dismantled now  all torn down  only bare rock left .   but bigman was not the man to brood overlong on such matters .  rather  he grew concerned at the lack of action .  he had not come out here merely for the walk .   he said   lucky  the ergometer doesn t show a thing .     i know  bigman .  cover .    he said it quietly  with no special emphasis  but       bigman knew what it meant .  he shoved his radio control to the particular notch which activated a shield for the carrier wave and scrambled the message .  it was not regulation equipment on a space suit  but it was routine for lucky and bigman .  bigman had added the scrambler to the radio controls when preparing the suits almost without giving the matter a conscious thought .   bigman s heart was beating a little faster .  when lucky called for a tight  scrambled beam between the two of them  danger was near .  nearer  at any rate .  he said   what s up  lucky .     it s time to talk .   lucky s voice had a faintly far off sound  as though it was coming indeterminately from all directions .  that was due to the inevitable lack of perfection of the part of the receiving unscrambler  which always left a small fraction of  noise .    lucky said   this is tunnel  a  according to the chart .  it leads back by a fairly simple route to one of the vertical shafts leading to the surface .  i ll be going there .    bigman said  amazed   you will .  why  lucky .     to get to the surface   and lucky laughed lightly .   why else .     what for .     in order to travel along the surface to the hangar and the shooting starr .  when i went to the ship last time  i took the new inso suit with me .    bigman chewed that over and said slowly   does that mean you ll be heading for sun side .     right .  i ll be heading for the big sun .  i can t get lost  at least  since i need only follow the coronal glow on the horizon .  it makes it very simple .         come off it  lucky  will you .  i thought it was the mines that have the sirians in them .  didn t you prove that at the banquet .     no  bigman  i didn t prove it .  i just fast talked it into sounding as though it were proven .     then why didn t you say so to me .     because we ve argued this out before  i don t want to go into it .  i can t risk your losing your temper at the wrong time .  if i had told you our coming down here was part of a deeper plan and if  for any reason  cook had irritated you  you might have blurted it right out .     i would not  lucky .  it s just that you hate to say anything at all till you re all ready .     there s that too   admitted lucky .   anyway  that s the situation .  i wanted everyone to think i was going into the mines .  i wanted everyone to think i hadn t the foggiest notion of heading for sun side .  the safest way of seeing to it was to make sure nobody  but nobody  not even you  bigman  thought any differently .     can you tell me why  lucky .  or is that still all a big secret .     i can tell you this .  i have a strong notion that someone at the dome is behind the sabotage .  i don t believe in the sirian theory .    bigman was disappointed .   you mean there s nothing down here in the mines .     i could be wrong .  but i agree with dr .  cook .  it is just too unlikely that sirius would put all the effort that would be involved in setting up a secret base on mercury just to achieve a bit of sabotage .  it would be much more likely that  if they wanted to do such a thing  they would bribe an earthman to do it .  after all  who slashed the inso suit .  that  at least  can t be blamed on       sirians .  even dr .  peverale hasn t suggested there are sirians inside the dome .     then you re looking for a traitor  lucky .     i m looking for the saboteur .  he may be a traitor in the pay of sirius  or he may be working for reasons of his own .  i hope the answer is on the sun side .  and i hope  furthermore  that my smoke screen concerning an invasion of the mines will keep the guilty person from having time to cover up or from preparing an uncomfortable reception for me .     what answer do you expect .     i ll know when i find it .     okay   said bigman .   i m sold  lucky .  on our way .  let s go .     hold on  there   cried lucky in honest perturbation .   great galaxy  boy .  i said i m going .  there s only one inso suit .  you ll stay here .    for the first time  the significance of the pronouns lucky had used sank into bigman s consciousness .  lucky had said  i    i .   not once had he said  we .   and yet bigman  with the easy confidence of long association  had assumed that  i  meant  we .     lucky .   he cried  torn between outrage and dismay .   why do i have to stay .     because i want the men at the dome to be sure that we re here .  you keep the chart and follow the route we talked about or something like it .  report back to cook every hour .  tell them where you are  what you see  tell the truth  you don t have to make anything up   except that you say i m with you .    bigman considered that .   well  what if they want to talk to you .     tell them i m busy .  yell that you think you ve just      seen a sirian .  say you ve got to cut off .  make up something  but keep them thinking i m here .  see .     all right .  sands of mars  you ll go to sun side and have all the fun  and i ll just wander around in the dark playing games on the suit radio .     cheer up  bigman  there may be something in the mines .  i m not always right .     i ll bet you are this time .  there s nothing down here .    lucky couldn t resist a joke .   there s the freezing death cook spoke about .  you could investigate that .    bigman didn t see the humor .  he said   aw  shut up .    there was a short pause .  then lucky placed his hand on the other s shoulder .   all right  that wasn t funny  bigman  and i m sorry .  now cheer up  really .  we ll be together again in no time .  you know that .    bigman pushed lucky s arm to one side .   all right .  drop the soft soap .  you say i ve got to do it  so i ll do it .  only you ll probably get sunstroke without me there keeping an eye on you  you big ox .    lucky laughed .   i ll try to be careful .   he turned down tunnel  a but had not taken two steps when bigman called out .    lucky .    lucky stopped .   what .    bigman cleared his throat .   listen .  don t take stupid chances  will you .  i mean  i m not going to be around to drag you out of trouble .    lucky said   now you sound like uncle hector .  suppose you take some of your own advice  eh .    it was as close as they ever got to expressing their       real affection for one another .  lucky waved his hand and stood glimmering for a moment in bigman s suit light .  then he turned and went off .   bigman looked after him  following his figure as it gradually melted into the surrounding shadows until it turned about a curve in the tunnel and was lost to him .   he felt the silence  and the loneliness doubled .  if he had not been john bigman jones  he might have weakened with the sense of loss  been overwhelmed at finding himself alone .   but he was john bigman jones  and he set his jaw and clamped his teeth and marched farther down the main shaft with unshaken tread .   bigman made his first call to the dome fifteen minutes later .  he was miserable .   how could he have believed that lucky seriously expected adventure in the mines .  would lucky have arranged to make radio calls for the sirians to pick up and keep tabs on .   sure  it was a tight beam  but the messages weren t scrambled  and no beam was so tight that it couldn t be tapped with patience .   he wondered why cook allowed such an arrangement  and almost at once the thought occurred to him that cook disbelieved in the sirians too .  only bigman had believed .  big brain .   at the moment  he could have chewed through a spaceship hull .   he gathered in cook and used the agreed upon signal for all clear .   cook s voice at once shot back .   all clear .         sands of mars .  yes .  lucky s up ahead twenty feet  but there s no sign of anything .  look  if i ve buzzed all clear  take my word for it next time .     let me talk to lucky starr .     what for .   bigman kept it casual with an effort .   get him next time .    cook hesitated  then said   all right .    bigman nodded to  himself grimly .  there d be no next tune .  he d buzz all clear and that would be all .   .   .   .  only how long was he supposed to wander about in the darkness before he heard from lucky .  an hour .  two .  six .  suppose six hours went by and there was no word .  how long should he stay .  how long could he stay .   and what if cook demanded specific information .  lucky had said to describe things  but what if bigman accidentally failed to keep up the act .  what if he tipped the boat and let slip the fact that lucky had gone into the sun side .  lucky would never trust him again .  with anything .   he put the thought aside .  it would do him no good to concentrate on it  if there were only something to distract him .  something besides darkness and vacuum  besides the faint vibration of his own footsteps and the sound of his own breath .   he stopped to check his position in the main shaft .  the side passages had letters and numbers ground sharply into their walls  and time had done nothing to dull their sharpness .  checking wasn t difficult .   however  the low temperature made the chart brittle and difficult to handle  and that didn t sweeten his       mood .  he turned his suit light on his chest controls in order that he might adjust the dehumidifier .  the inner surface of his face plate was beginning to mist over faintly from the moisture in his breath  probably because the temperature within rose with his temper  he told himself .   he had just completed the adjustment when he moved his head sharply to one side as though he were suddenly cocking an ear to listen .   it was exactly what he was doing .  he strained to sense the rhythm of faint vibration that he  heard  now only because his own steps had ceased .   he held his breath  remained as motionless as the rocky wall of the tunnel .    lucky .   he breathed into the transmitter .   lucky .   the fingers of his right hand had adjusted the controls .  the carrier wave was scrambled .  no one else would make sense out of that light whisper .  but lucky would  and soon his voice would come in answer .  bigman was ashamed to admit to himself how welcome that voice would be .    lucky .   he said again .   the vibration continued .  there was no answer .   bigman s breathing quickened  first with tension  then with the savage joy born of excitement that always came over him when danger was in the offing .   there was someone else in the mines of mercury with him .  someone other than lucky .   who  then .  a sirian .  had lucky been right after all though he had thought he was merely putting up a smoke screen .   maybe .       bigman drew his blaster and put out his suit light .   did they know he was there .  were they coming to get him .   the vibrations weren t the blurred nonrhythmic  sound  of many people  or even two or three .  to bigman s keen ear  the distinctly separated  thrum thrum  of vibration was the  sound  of one man s legs  rhythmically advancing .   and bigman would meet any one man  anywhere  under any conditions .   quietly  he put out his hand  touching the nearer wall .  the vibrations sharpened noticeably .  the other was in that direction then .   he moved forward quietly in the pitch dark  his hand keeping a light touch on the wall .  the vibrations being set up by the other were too intense  too careless .  either the other believed himself alone in the mines  as bigman himself had until a moment before  or  if he were following bigman  he wasn t wise in the ways of the vacuum .   bigman s own footsteps had died to a murmur as he advanced catlike  yet the other s vibrations showed no change .  again  if the other had been following bigman by sound  the sudden change in bigman s progress should have been reflected in a change in the other s .  it wasn t .  the same conclusion  then as before .   he turned right at the next side tunnel entrance and continued .  his hand on the wall at once kept him along the way and guided him toward the other .   and then there was the blinding flash of a suit light far ahead in the darkness as the motion of another s body whipped the beam across him .  bigman froze against the wall .        the light vanished .  the other had passed across the tunnel bigman was on .  he was not advancing along it .  bigman hurried forward lightly .  he would find that cross tunnel and then he would be behind the other .   they would meet then .  he  bigman  representing earth and the council of science  and the enemy representing   whom .      the enemy in the mines  bigman had calculated correctly .  the other s light was bobbing along ahead of him  as he found the opening .  its owner was unaware of him .  he must be .   bigman s blaster was ready .  he might have shot unerringly  but a blaster would not have left much behind .  dead men tell no tales and dead enemies explain no mysteries .   he pursued with catlike patience  cutting down the distance between them  following the light  trying to estimate the nature of the enemy .   his blaster always ready  bigman moved to make first contact .  first  radio .  his fingers set the controls quickly for general local transmission .  the enemy might have no equipment to receive that on the wave lengths bigman could deliver .  unlikely  but possible .  very unlikely and barely possible .   yet it didn t matter .  there was always the alternative of a light blaster bolt against the wall .  it would make his point clearly enough .  a blaster carried authority and had a plain way of speaking that was understood in any language anywhere .   he said  his tenor voice carrying all the force it could muster   stop  you .  stop where you are and don t turn around .  there s a blaster beaded in on you .            bigman flashed on his suit light  and in its glare the enemy froze .  nor did he make any effort to turn around  which was proof enough for bigman that he had received the message .   bigman said   now turn around .  slowly .    the figure turned .  bigman kept his right hand in the path of his suit light .  its metal sheath was clamped tightly about the large caliber blaster .  in the glow of the light  its outline was comfortingly clear .   bigman said   this blaster is fully charged .  i ve killed men with it before  and i m a dead shot .    the enemy obviously had radio .  he was obviously receiving  for he glanced at the blaster and made a motion as though to raise a hand to block off the blaster s force .   bigman studied what he could see of the enemy s suit .  it looked quite conventional  did the sirians use such familiar models .   .   bigman said curtly   are you keyed in for radio transmission .    there was sudden sound in his ears and he jumped .  the voice was a familiar one  even under the disguising distortion of the radio  it said   it s peewee  isn t it .    never in his life had bigman needed greater self control to keep from using his blaster .   as it was  the weapon leaped convulsively in his hand and the figure facing him leaned quickly to one side .    urteil .   yelled bigman .   his surprise turned to disappointment .  no sirian .  only urteil .   then the sharp thought  what was urteil doing here .        urteil said   it s urteil all right .  so put away the bean shooter .     that gets put away when i feel like it   said big man .   what are you doing here .     the mines of mercury are not your private property  i think .     while i have the blaster they are  you fat faced cobber .   bigman was thinking hard and  to a certain extent  futilely .  what was there to do with this poisonous skunk .  to take him back to the dome would reveal the fact that lucky was no longer in the mines .  bigman could tell them that lucky had lingered behind  but then they would become either suspicious or concerned when lucky failed to report .  and of what crime could he accuse urteil .  the mines were free to all  at that .   on the other hand  he could not remain indefinitely pointing a blaster at the man .   if lucky were here  he would know     and as though a telephathic spark had crossed the vacuum between the two men  urteil suddenly said   and where s starr  anyway .     that   said bigman   is nothing you have to worry about .   then  with sudden conviction   you were following us  weren t you .   and he shoved his blaster forward a little as though encouraging the other to talk .   in the glare of bigman s suit light  the other s glassite hidden face turned downward slightly as though to follow the blaster .  he said   what if i were .    again there was the impasse .   bigman said   you were going along a side passage .  you were going to swing in behind us .     i said  what if i were .   urteil s voice had  almost a lazy quality about it  as though its owner were      thoroughly relaxed  as though he enjoyed having a blaster pointed at him .   urteil went on .   but where s your friend .  near here .     i know where he is .  no need for you to worry .     i insist on worrying .  call him .  your radio is on local transmission or i wouldn t hear you so well .   .   .   .  do you mind if i turn on my fluid jet .  i m thirsty .   his hand moved slowly .    careful   said bigman .    just a drink .    bigman watched tensely .  he did not expect a  weapon to be activated by chest control  but the suit   light could be suddenly raised to blinding intensity   or   or well  anything .   but urteil s fingers finished their motion while bigman stood irresolute  and there was only the sound of swallowing .    scare you .   asked urteil calmly .   bigman could find nothing to say .   urteil s voice grew sharp .   well  call the man .  call starr .    under the impact of the order  bigman s hand began a movement and stopped .   urteil laughed .   you almost adjusted radio controls  didn t you .  you needed distance tranmission .  he s nowhere near here  is he .     no such thing   cried bigman hotly .  he was burning with mortification .  the large and poisonous urteil was clever .  there he stood  the target of a blaster  yet winning the battle  proving himself master of the situation  while with every passing second bigman s own       position  in which he could neither shoot nor lower his blaster  leave nor stay  grew more untenable .   wildly the thought gnawed at him  why not shoot .   but he knew he could not .  he would be able to advance no reason .  and even if he could  the violent death of senator swenson s man would make tremendous trouble for the council of science .  and for lucky .   if only lucky were here  partly because he wished that so ardently  his heart leaped as urteil s light lifted slightly and focused beyond him  and he heard urteil say   no  i m wrong after all and you re right .  here he comes .    bigman whirled .   lucky    in his right mind  bigman would have waited calmly enough for lucky to reach them  for lucky s arm to be on his shoulder  but bigman was not quite in his right mind .  his position was impossible  his deske for a way out overwhelming .   he had time only for that one cry of  lucky  before going down under the impact of a body fully twice as massive as his own .   for a few moments he retained the grip on his blaster  but another arm was tearing at his hand  strong fingers were wrenching and twisting his .  bigman s breath was knocked out of him  his brain was whirling with the suddenness of the attack  and his blaster went flying .   the weight lifted from him  and when he turned to struggle to his feet urteil was towering over him and bigman was staring into the muzzle of his own blaster .    i have one of my own   said urteil  grimly   but i      think i d rather use yours .  don t move .  stay that way .  on hands and knees .  that s right .    never in his life had bigman so hated himself .  to be  tricked and hoodwinked this way .  he almost deserved  death .  he would almost rather die than ever have to  face lucky and say   he looked behind me and said  you were coming so i turned        he said in a strangled voice   shoot  if you have the nerve for it .  shoot  and lucky will track you down and see to it that you spend the rest of your life chained to the smallest  coldest asteroid ever used as a prison .     lucky will do that .  where is he .     find him .     i will because you ll tell me where he is .  and tell me  too  why he came down to the mines in the first place .  what s he doing here .     to find sirians .  you heard him .     to find comet gas   growled urteil .   that senile fool  peverale  may talk sirians  but your friend never believed any of it .  not even if he only has the brains you do .  he came down for another reason .  you tell me .     why should i .     to save your miserable life .     that s not enough reason for me   said bigman  and he rose to his feet and took a step forward .   urteil moved backward till he was leaning against the wall of the tunnel .   one more motion and i ll blast you with pleasure .  i don t need your information very badly .  it will save time  but not much .  if i spend more than five minutes with you  it s a waste .    now let me tell you exactly what i think .  maybe it will teach you that you and your tin hero  starr  are       fooling nobody .  neither one of you is good for anything more than tricks with force knives against an unarmed man .    bigman thought gloomily  that s what s griping the cobber .  i made him look like a jackass in front of the boys  and he s waiting for me to crawl .    if you re going to do all that talking   he said  squeezing as much contempt into his voice as he could manage   you might as well shoot .  i d rather be blasted than talked to death .     don t race for it  little fellow  don t race for it .  in  the first place  senator swenson is breaking the council  of science .  you re just an item  a tiny one .  your friend  starr is just another item  and not a much bigger one .   i m the one who s going to do the breaking .  we ve got  the council where we want it .  the people of earth  know it s riddled with corruption  that its officers waste  the taxpayers  money and line their own pockets     that s a filthy lie   broke in bigman .    we ll let the people decide that .  once we puncture the phony propaganda the council puts out  we ll see what the people think .     you try that .  go ahead and try .     we intend to .  we ll succeed too .  and this will be exhibit number one  you two in the mines .  i know why you re here .  the sirians .  huh .  starr either put peverale up to telling the story  or he just took advantage of it .  i ll tell you what you two are doing down here .  you re faking the sirians .  you re setting up a sirian camp to show people .      i chased them off singlehanded   starr will say .   i  lucky starr  big hero .   the sub etherics make a big deal out of it and the council calls off its project light      on the sly .  they ve milked it for all it s worth  and  they re getting out with their skins except that they  won t be because i ll catch starr in the act and he ll be so much mud under shoe and so will the council .    bigman was sick with fury .  he longed to tear at the other with his bare hands  but somehow he managed to hold himself in leash .  he knew why urteil was talking as he was .  it was because he man didn t know as much as he pretended .  he was trying to get more out of bigman by making him blind mad .   in a low voice  bigman tried to turn the tables .   you know  you putrid cobber  if anyone ever punctured you and let out the comet gas  your peanut sized soul would show itself clear .  once they let the rot out of you  you d collapse to nothing but a loose sack of dirty skin .    urteil shouted   that s enough    but bigman shouted over him  his high pitched voice ringing .   shoot  you yellow pirate .  you showed yellow at the dinner table .  stand up to me  man to man  with bare fists and you ll show yellow again  bloated as you are .    bigman was tense now .  let urteil act in rash haste  now .  let urteil aim on impulse and bigman would  jump .  death was probable  but there would be a  chance  but urteil seemed only to stiffen and grow colder .    if you don t talk  i ll kill you .  and nothing will happen to me .  i ll claim self defense and make it stick .     not with lucky  you won t .     he ll have his own troubles .  when i m through with him  his opinions won t mean a thing .   the blaster in       urteil s hand was steady .   are you going to try to run for it .     from you .   bigman said .    it s up to you   said urteil coldly .   bigman waited  waited without saying a word while urteil s arm grew stiff and urteil s headpiece dropped slightly as though he were taking aim  though at point blank range he could not miss .   bigman counted the moments  trying to choose the one in which to make his desperate jump for life as lucky had when mindes had similarity aimed at him .  but here there was no second party to tackle urteil as bigman had tackled mindes on that occasion .  and urteil was no panicky  mind sick mindes .  he would laugh and aim again .   bigman s muscles tensed for that final jump .  he did not expect to live for more than five more seconds  perhaps .      dark and light  but with his body taut  his leg muscles almost vibrating in the first part instant of contraction  there was a sudden hoarse cry of utter surprise in bigman s ears .   they were standing there  both of them  in a gray  dark world in which their beams of light etched one another out .  outside the beams of light  nothing  so that the sudden blob of motion that flashed across the line of sight made no sense at first .   his first reaction  his first thought was  lucky .  had lucky returned .  had he somehow mastered the situation  turned the tables .   but there was motion again  and the thought of lucky faded away .   it was as though a fragment of the rocky wall of the shaft had worked itself loose and was drifting downward in the lazy fall that was characteristic of mercury s low gravity .   a rope of rock that was somehow flexible  that struck urteil s shoulder and   clung .  one such encircled his waist already .  another moved slowly  bringing itself down and around as though it were part of an unreal world of slowed motion .  but as its edge circled urteil s arm and touched the metal covering urteil s chest  arm and chest closed upon one another .  it was          as though the sluggish and seemingly brittle rock contained the irresistible strength of a boa constrictor .   if urteil s first reaction had been one of surprise  there was now nothing but complete terror in his voice .    cold   he croaked harshly .   they re cold .    bigman s whirling mind was having trouble encompassing the new situation .  a piece of that rock had encircled urteil s lower arm and wrist .  the butt of the blaster was clamped in place .   a final rope came floating down .  they were so rock like in appearance that they were invisible until one actually detached itself from the wall .   the ropes were connected one with another as a single organism  but there was no nucleus  no  body .   it was like a stony octopus consisting of nothing but tentacles .   bigman had a kind of explosion of thought .   he thought of rock developing life through the long ages of mercurian evolution .  a completely different form of life from anything earth knew .  a life that lived on scraps of heat alone .   why not .  the tentacles might crawl from place to place  seeking any bit of heat that might exist .  bigman could see them drifting toward mercury s north pole when mankind was first established there .  first the mines and then the observatory dome supplied them with unending trickles of heat .   man could be their prey too .  why not .  a human being was a source of heat .  occasionally an isolated miner might have been trapped .  paralyzed with sudden cold and terror  he would be unable to call for help .  minutes later his power unit would be too low to make       a radio call possible in any case .  still later  he would be dead  a frozen relic .   cook s mad story of the deaths in the mines made sense .   all this passed through bigman s mind almost in one flash while he remained unmoving  still struggling with a sense of stunned amazement at the sudden new turn of events .   urteil s voice was somewhere between a moan and a  harsh gasp .   i   can t  help me   help        it s  cold   cold    bigman yelled   hold on .  i m coming .    gone in a moment was any thought that this man was an enemy  that moments before he had been on the point of killing bigman in cold blood .  the little martian recognized but one thing  here was a man  helpless in the grip of something nonhuman .   since man had first left earth and ventured into the dangers and mysteries of outer space  there had grown up a stern  unwritten law .  human feuds must be forgotten when man faced the common enemy  the non human and inhuman forces of the other worlds .   it might be that not everyone adhered to that law  but bigman did .   he was at urteil s side in a bound  tearing at his arm .   urteil mumbled   help me    bigman grasped at the blaster urteil still held  trying to avoid the tentacle that encircled urteil s clutching fist .  bigman noted absently that the tentacle didn t curve smoothly like a snake would .  it bent in sections as though arranged in numerous stiff segments hinged together .       bigman s other hand  groping for purchase on ur teil s suit  made momentary contact with one of the tentacles and sprang away reflectively .  the cold was an icy shaft  penetrating and burning his hand .   whatever method the creatures had of withdrawing heat  it was like nothing he had ever heard of .   bigman yanked desperately at the blaster  heaving and wrenching .  he did not notice at first the alien touch on his back  then   iciness lay over him and did not go away .  when he tried to jump away he found he could not .  a tentacle had reached out for him and embraced him .   the two men might have grown together  so firmly were they bound .   the physical pain of the cold grew  and bigman wrenched at the blaster like a man possessed .  was it giving .   urteil s voice startled him as it murmured   no  use    urteil staggered and then  slowly  under the weak pull of mercury s gravity  he toppled over to one side  carrying bigman with him .   bigman s body was numb .  it was losing sensation .  he could scarcely tell whether he was still holding the muzzle of the blaster or not .  if he was  was it yielding to his wild  sidewise wrenches  or was it a last gasp of wishful thinking .   his suit light was dimming as his power unit drained much of its energy into the voracious power sucking ropes .   death by freezing could not be far away .   lucky  having left bigman in the mines of mercury  and having changed to an inso suit in the quiet of the       hangared shooting starr  stepped out onto the surface of mercury and turned his face toward the  white ghost of the sun .    for long minutes he stood motionless  taking in once again the milky luminescence of the sun s corona .   absently  as he watched  he flexed his smoothly muscled limbs one at a time .  the inso suit worked more smoothly than an ordinary space suit .  that  combined with its lightness  lent it an unusual sensation of not being there altogether .  in an environment obviously airless  it was disconcerting  but lucky brushed aside any feeling of uneasiness he might have had and surveyed the sky .   the stars were as numerous and brilliant as in open space  and he paid them little attention .  it was something else he wanted to see .  it was two days now  standard earth time  since he had last seen these skies .  in two days  mercury had moved one forty fourth of the way along its orbit around the sun .  that meant over eight degrees of sky had appeared in the east and over eight degrees had disappeared in the west .  that meant news stars could be seen .   new planets too .  venus and earth ought both to have risen above the horizon in the interval .   and there they were .  venus was the higher of the two  a diamond bright bit of white light  much more brilliant than it ever appeared to be on earth .  from earth  venus was seen at a disadvantage .  it was between earth and the sun  so that when venus was closest  earth could see only its dark side .  on mercury  venus could be seen at the full .   at the moment  venus was thirty three million miles from mercury .  at the closest  however  it could      approach to within almost twenty million miles  and then keen eyes could actually see it as a tiny disk .   even as it was  its light almost rivaled that of the corona  and  staring at the ground  lucky thought he could make out a double shadow extending from his feet  one cast by the corona  a fuzzy one  and one by venus  a sharp one  .  he wondered if  under ideal circumstances  there might not be a triple shadow  the third being cast by earth itself .   he found earth  too  without difficulty .  it was quite near the horizon  and  though it was brighter than any star or planet in its own skies  it was pale in comparison to the glorious venus .  it was less brightly lit by its more distant sun  it was less cloudy and therefore reflected less of the light it did give .  furthermore  it was twice as far from mercury as venus was .   yet in one respect it was incomparably more interesting .  where venus s light was a pure white  earth s light was a blue green glow .   and more than that  there was near it  just skirting the horizon  the smaller yellow light of earth s moon .  together  earth and moon made a unique sight in the skies of the other planets inside the orbit of jupiter .  a double planet  traveling majestically across the skies in each other s company  the smaller circling the larger in a motion which  against the sky  looked like a slow wobble from side to side .   lucky stared at the sight perhaps longer than he should have  yet he could not help it .  the conditions of his life took him far from his home planet on occasion  and that made it all the dearer to him .  all the quadrillions of human beings throughout the galaxy had originated on earth .  through almost all of man s history        earth had been his only home  in fact .  what man could look on earth s speck of light without emotion .   lucky tore his eyes away  shaking his head .  there was work to be done .   he set out with firm stride toward the coronal glow  skimming close to the surface as was proper in low gravity  keeping his suit light on and his gaze fixed at the ground before him in order to guard against its rough unevenness .   he had an idea of what he might find  but it was purely a notion  backed as yet by no definite fact .  lucky had a horror of discussing such notions  which were sometimes nothing more than intuitions .  he even disliked lingering on them in his own mind .  there was too great a danger of growing used to the idea  of beginning to depend upon it as truth  of closing the mind unintentionally to alternate possibilities .   he had seen this happen to the ebullient  ready to   believe  ready to act bigman .  he had watched vague  possibilities become firm convictions in bigman s mind  more than once  he smiled gently at the thought of the little bantam .  injudicious he might be  levelheaded never  but he was loyal and ablaze with fearlessness .  lucky would rather have bigman at his side than a fleet of armored space cruisers manned by giants .   he missed the gnome faced martian now  as he leaped flatly along the mercurian terrain  and it was partly to wipe out that uncomfortable sensation that lucky returned to thoughts of the problem at hand .   the trouble was that there were so many crosscurrents .   first  there was mindes himself  nervous  unstable          unsure of himself .  it had never been entirely settled  really  how far his attack on lucky had been momentary madness and how far settled calculation .  there was gardoma  who was mindes s friend .  was he a dedicated idealist caught up in the dream of project light  or was he with mindes for purely practical reasons .  if so  what were they .   urteil  himself  was a main focus of disturbance .  he was intent on ruining the council  and the object of his main attack was mindes .  yet his arrogance naturally spread hate of himself wherever he went .  mindes hated him  of course  and so did gardoma .  dr .  peverale hated him in a much more restrained fashion .  he would not even discuss the man with lucky .   at the banquet  cook had seemed to shrink from talking to urteil  never let his eyes as much as move in his direction .  was this simply because cook was anxious to avoid the sharp  flailing edge of urteil s tongue  or were there more specific reasons .   cook thought little of peverale too .  he was ashamed of the old man s preoccupation with sirius .   and there was one question that remained to be answered aside from all these things .  who had slashed lucky s inso suit .   there were too many factors .  lucky had a line of thought that threaded through them  but as yet that line was weak .  again he avoided concentrating on that line .  he must retain an open mind .   the ground was sloping upward and he had adjusted his stride to suit it automatically .  so preoccupied was he with his thoughts that the sight that caught his eyes as he topped that rise found him unprepared and struck him with amazement .         the extreme upper edge of the sun was above the broken horizon  yet not the sun itself .  only the prominences that edged the sun showed  a small segment of them .   the prominences were brilliant red in color  and one  in the very center of those visible  was made up of blazing streamers moving upward and outward with inching slowness .   sharp and bright against the rock of mercury  un dimmed by atmosphere  unhazed by dust  it was a sight of incredible beauty .  the tongue of flame seemed to be growing out of mercury s dark crust as though the planet s horizon were on fire or a volcano of more than giant size had suddenly erupted and been trapped in mid blaze .   yet those prominences were incomparably more than anything that could have appeared on mercury .  the one he watched  lucky knew  was large enough to swallow a hundred earths whole  or five thousand mercuries .  and there it burned in atomic fire  lighting up lucky and all his surroundings .   he turned off his suit light to see .   those surfaces of the rocks that faced directly toward the prominences were awash with ruddy light  all other surfaces were black as coal .  it was as though someone had painted a bottomless pit with streaks of red .  truly it was the  red ghost of the sun .    the shadow of lucky s hand on his chest made a patch of black .  the ground ahead was more treacherous  since the patches of light that caught every fragment of unevenness fooled the eye into a false estimate of the nature of the surface .   lucky turned on ms suit light once again and moved       forward toward the prominences along the curve of mercury  the sun rising six minutes of arc for every mile he went .   that meant that in less than a mile  the body of the sun would be visible and he would be on mercury s sun side .   lucky had no way of knowing then that at that moment bigman was facing death by freezing .  his thought as he faced the sun side was only this  there lies the danger and the crux of the problem  and there lies the solution too .       the sun side  more of the prominences were now visible .  their redness brightened .  the corona did not vanish  there was no atmosphere to scatter the prominence light and wash out dimmer glows   but it seemed less important now .  the stars were still out and would stay out  lucky knew  even when mercury s sun was full in the sky  but who could pay attention to them now .   lucky ran forward eagerly in the steady stride which he could maintain for hours without feeling unduly tired .  under the circumstances  he felt he could have maintained such a stride even under earth s gravity .   and then  with no warning  no premonitory glow in the sky  no hint from any atmosphere  there was the sun .   rather  there was a hairline that was the sun .  it was an unbearable line of light edging a notch of broken rock on the horizon  as though some celestial painter had outlined the gray stone in brilliant white .   lucky looked backward .  across the uneven ground that lay behind him there were the splotches of prominence red .  but now  just at his feet  there was a wash of white  catching crystal formations in glinting highlights .             .   he moved onward again  and the line of light became first a small splotch and then a larger one .   the boundary of the sun was clearly visible  lifting a bit above the horizon in its center  curving gently down on each side .  the curve was awesomely flat to one whose eyes were accustomed to the curvature of earth s sun .   nor did the sun s blaze drown out the prominences which crawled along its edge like flaming red snake hair .  the prominences were all over the sun  of course  but only at the edge could they be seen .  on the sun s face  they were lost amid the glare below .   and over all was the corona .   lucky marveled  even as he watched  at the manner in which the inso suit had been adapted to its purpose .   a glance at the edge of mercury s sun would have been blinding to unprotected eyes  blinding forever .  the visible light was bad enough in its intensity  but it was the hard ultra violet  unfiltered by atmosphere  that would have meant death to vision  .   .   .  and to life itself  eventually .   yet the glass of the inso suit s face plate was so arranged molecularly as to grow less transparent in direct proportion to the brightness of the light that fell upon it .  only a small fraction of a percent of the solar blaze penetrated the plate  and he could stare at the sun without danger  almost without discomfort .  yet at the same time  the light of the corona and the stars come through undiminished .   the inso suit protected him in other ways .  it was impregnated with lead and bismuth  not enough so as to raise its weight unduly  but enough to block out ultraviolet and x radiation from the sun .  the suit car         ried a positive charge to deflect most of the cosmic rays to one side .  mercury s magnetic field was weak  but mercury was close to the sun and the cosmic ray density was large .  still  cosmic rays are composed of positively charged protons  and like charges repel like .   and  of course  the suit protected him against the heat  not only by its insulating composition but by its mirrorlike reflecting surface  a pseudo liquid molecular layer that could be activated by a touch on the controls .   in fact  lucky reflected  when the advantages of the inso suit were considered  it seemed a pity that it was not standard protection under all conditions .  unfortunately  he realized  its structural weakness  as a result of lacking metal in real quantity  made it impractical for use except where protection against heat and radiation were paramount considerations .   lucky was a mile into the sun side now and not conscious of undue heat .   this did not surprise him .  to stay at homes who confined their knowledge of space to the sub etheric thriller shows  the sun side of any airless planet was simply a solid mass of undeviating heat .   this was an oversimplification .  it depended on how high the sun was in the sky .  from this point on mercury  for instance  with only a portion of the sun above the horizon  comparatively little heat reached the surface  and that little was spread over a lot of ground as the radiation struck almost horizontally .   the  weather  changed as one went deeper into the sun side and finally  when one reached that portion where the sun was high in the sky  it was everything the sub etherics said it was .        and besides  there were always the shadows .  in the absence of air  light and heat traveled in a straight line .  neither could reach within the shadow except for small fractions which were reflected or radiated into it from neighboring sunlit portions .  the shadows were therefore frosty cold and carbon black though the sun was ever so hot and bright .   lucky was growing more aware of these shadows .  at first  after the upper line of sun had appeared  the ground had been almost all shadow with only occasional patches of light .  now  as the sun rose higher and higher  the light spread and coalesced until the shadows were distinct things hovering behind boulders and hills .   at one time lucky deliberately plunged into the shadow of a rise of rock a hundred yards across  and it was as though for a long minute he were back on the dark side .  the heat of the sun  which he had scarcely noticed while it beat upon him  became evident by its decrease in the shadow .  all around the shadow the ground glimmered brightly in sunlight  but within the shadow his suit light was necessary to guide his steps .   he could not help noticing the difference in the surfaces that were in the shadow from those in the light .  for on the sun side  at least  mercury did have a kind of atmosphere .  not one in the earthly sense  no nitrogen  oxygen  carbon dioxide  or water vapor  nothing like that .  on the sun side  however  mercury would boil in places .  sulfur would be liquid and so would a number of volatile compounds .  traces of the vapor of such substances would cling to mercury s superheated surface .  these vapors froze out in the shadows .   this was brought forcibly to lucky s mind when his insulated fingers brushed over the dark surface of one        outcropping and came away smeared with a frozen hoar of mercury  glittering in his suit light .  it changed quickly into clinging liquid droplets as he emerged into the sun and then  more slowly  evaporated away .   slowly  the sun seemed to be getting hotter .  that did not worry lucky .  even if it grew uncomfortably hot  he could always dodge into a shadow to cool off when necessary .   short wave radiation was perhaps a more important consideration .  lucky doubted even that was serious in this short term exposure .  workers on mercury had a horror of radiation  because they were continually exposed to small amounts .  lucky recalled mindes s emphasis on the fact that the saboteur he had seen had remained standing in the sun .  it was natural that min des should be disturbed at that .  when exposure was chronic any lengthening of the time of exposure was foolish .  in lucky s own case  however  exposure would be short term   he hoped .   he ran across patches of blackish ground that stood out somberly against mercury s more general reddish gray .  the reddish gray was familiar enough .  it resembled the soil of mars  a mixture of silicates with the addition of iron oxide  which gave it that ruddy tinge .   the black was more puzzling .  wherever it was  the ground was definitely hotter  since black absorbed more of the sun s heat .   he bent as he ran and found the black areas crumbly rather than gritty .  some of it came up on the palm of his gauntlet .  he looked at it .  it might be graphite  it might be iron or copper sulfide .  it might be any of a number of things  but he would have bet on its being some variety of impure iron sulfide .        he paused in the shadow of a rock  finally  and took stock .  in an hour and a half  he estimated he had traveled some fifteen miles  judging from the fact that the sun was just about entirely above the horizon now .   at the moment  he was more interested in sipping sparingly at the suit s supply of liquid nutrient mixture than in estimating distance  however .    somewhere to the left of him were cables of mindes s project light .  somewhere to the right of him were others .  their exact location did not matter .  they covered hundreds of square miles  and to wander aimlessly among them in search of a saboteur would have been foolish .   mindes had tried it  hit or miss  and had failed .  if the object or objects he had seen had indeed been the saboteur  there might have been a warning from inside the dome .  mindes had made no secret of the fact that he was heading out to sun side .   lucky had  however .  there would be no warning  he hoped .   and he had a form of help mindes had not had .  he flipped his small ergometer out of the pouch he had placed it in .  he held it before him in cupped palm  his suit light playing full on it .   once activated  its red signal patch blazed with incredible fury when held out in the sunlight .  lucky smiled tightly and adjusted it .  there was short wave radiation from the sun .   the flame died .   patiently  then  lucky stepped out into the sunlight and scanned the horizon in every direction .  where  if anywhere  was there a source of atomic power other        than the sun .  he found an indication of the dome  of course  but the light due to that region increased as he dipped the ergometer downward .  the dome s power plant was nearly a mile underground  and a twenty degree downward dip was required for maximum power where he stood .   he turned slowly  the ergometer held gingerly between the two forefingers of each hand in order that the opaque material of the suit should not block off the telltale radiation .  around a second time and a third .   it seemed to him that in one particular direction there had been the briefest of flashes   scarcely enough to see against the sunlight  really .  perhaps no more than the product of wishful thinking .   he tried again .   no mistake now .   lucky sighted along the direction in which that glow had appeared and moved in that direction .  he did not conceal from himself the fact that he might only be tracking down a patch of radioactive ore .   he caught his first glimpse of one of mindes s cables nearly a mile farther on .   it was not a single cable at all  rather a web of cables  lying half buried in the ground .  he followed it some hundreds of yards and came upon a square metal plate  about four feet on a side and polished to a high gloss .  it reflected the stars as though it were a clear pool of water .   no doubt  thought lucky  if he placed himself in the proper position he would find himself staring into the reflection of the sun .  he became aware that the plate       was changing its angle of elevation  becoming less horizontal  more vertical .  he looked away to see if it were shifting in such a way as to catch the sun .   when he looked back he was amazed .  the clear square was no longer clear .  instead  it was a dull black  so dull that not all the light of mercury s sun seemed to be able to brighten it .   then  as he watched  that dullness trembled  broke  and fragmented .   it was bright again .   he watched it through three more cycles as the angle of elevation made it more and more vertical .  first  incredible reflection  then  complete dullness .  during the dullness  lucky realized  light would be absorbed  during the glossiness  it would be reflected .  the alternation in phase might be perfectly regular  or there might be a deliberate  irregular pattern .  he could not linger to find out and  if he did  it was doubtful whether his knowledge of hyperoptics would be enough to enable him to understand the purpose of it all .   presumably hundreds or even thousands of such squares  all connected by a network of cables and all powered from an atomic micropile inside the dome  were absorbing and reflecting light in a set way at different angles to the sun .  presumably  this  in some way  could force light energy through hyperspace in a controlled manner .   and  presumably  torn cables and smashed plates prevented the over all pattern from being properly completed .   lucky tried his ergometer again .  it was much brighter now  and again he followed in the indicated direction .         brighter  brighter .  whatever it was he was following  it was something that was changing its position .  the source of gamma rays was not a fixed point on mercury s surface .   and that meant it was not merely an outcropping of radioactive ore .  it was something portable  and to lucky that meant it was man or something belonging to man .   lucky saw the figure first as a moving speck  black against the fire lit ground .  the sight came after a long spell in the open sun  at a time when he had been about to find himself a shadow in which to let the slowly accumulating heat drain away .   instead  he accelerated his pace now .  he estimated the temperature outside his suit to be at not quite the boiling point of water .  inside  fortunately  it was considerably lower .   he thought grimly  if the sun were overhead and not at the horizon  even these suits would be of no use .   the figure paid no attention to him .  it continued on its own path  its gait showing it far from as expert in handling low gravity as was lucky .  indeed its motion might almost be described as lumbering .  yet it managed to devour space .  it covered the ground .   it wore no inso suit .  even at long distance  the surface exposed to lucky s gaze was obviously one of metal .   lucky paused briefly in the shade of a rock but forced himself into the open again before there was time for much cooling .   the figure seemed unbothered by the heat .  at least  in the time lucky watched him he made no move to         enter shadows  though  he passed within a few feet of some .   lucky nodded thoughtfully .  it all fit well .  he sped on .  the heat was beginning to feel like something he could touch and squeeze .  but it would only be a few moments now .   he had abandoned his low slung lope now .  every bit of his muscular power was being put into giant strides of up to fifteen feet each .   he shouted   you .  you there .  turn around .   he said it peremptorily  with all the authority he could produce  hoping that the other could receive ms radio signal and that he would not be reduced to sign language .   slowly the figure turned  and ducky s nostrils flared in a kind of cold satisfaction .  so far  at least  it was as he thought  for the figure was no man   nothing human at all .       saboteur .   the figure was tall  taller even than lucky .  it was nearly seven feet tall  in fact  and broad in proportion .  all of the figure that met the eye was gleaming metal  brilliant where it caught the sun s rays  black with shadow where it did not .   but underneath that metal was no flesh and blood  only more metal  gears  tubes  a micropile which powered the figure with nuclear energy and produced the gamma rays that lucky had detected with his pocket ergometer .   the limbs of the creature were monstrous and its legs were straddled far apart as it stood there facing lucky .  what passed for its eyes were two photoelectric cells that gleamed a deep red .  its mouth was a slash across the metal on the lower part of its face .   it was a mechanical man  a robot  and it took lucky no more than one glance to know that it was no robot of earth s manufacture .  earth had invented the posi tronic robot  but it had never built any model like this .   the robot s mouth opened and closed in irregular movements as though it were speaking .   lucky said   i cannot hear sound in a vacuum  robot .   he said it sternly  knowing that it was essential            to establish himself as a man and therefore a master at once .   switch to radio .    and now the robot s mouth remained motionless but a voice sounded in lucky s receiver  harsh and uneven  with the words unnaturally spaced .  it said   what is your business  sir .  why are you here .     do not question me   said lucky .   why are you here .    a robot could only be truthful .  it said   i have been instructed to destroy certain objects at intervals .     by whom .     i have been instructed not to answer that question .     are you of sirian manufacture .     i was constructed on one of the planets of the sirian confederation .    lucky frowned .  the creature s voice was quite unpleasant .  the few robots of earth manufacture that lucky had had occasion to see in experimental laboratories had been outfitted with voices boxes which  by direct sound or by radio  seemed as pleasant and natural as a well cultivated human voice .  surely the sirians would have improved on that .   lucky s mind shifted to a more immediate problem .  he said   i must find a shadowed area .  come with me .    the robot said at once   i will direct you to the nearest shade .   it set off at a trot  its metal legs moving with a certain irregularity .   lucky followed the creature .  he needed no direction to reach the shade  but he lagged behind to watch the robot s gait .   what had seemed to lucky  from a distance  to be a lumbering or a clumsy pace  turned out  at close        hand  to be a pronounced limp .  a limp and a harsh voice .  two imperfections in this robot whose outer appearance was that of a magnificent mechanical marvel .   it struck him forcibly that the robot might not be adjusted to the heat and radiation of mercury .  exposure had damaged it  probably .  lucky was scientist enough to feel a twinge of regret at that .  it was too beautiful to have to endure such damage .   he regarded the machine with admiration .  underneath that massive skull of chrome steel was a delicate ovoid of sponge platinum indium about the size of a human brain .  within it  quadrillions of quadrillions of positrons came into being and vanished in millionths of a second .  as they came into being and vanished they traced precalculated paths which duplicated  in a simplified way  the thinking cells of the human brain .   engineers had calculated out those positronic paths to suit humanity  and into them they had designed the  three laws of robotics .    the first law was that a robot could not harm a human being or let one come to harm .  nothing came ahead of that .  nothing could substitute for it .   the second law was that a robot must obey orders except those that would break the first law .   the third law allowed a robot to protect itself  provided the first and second laws weren t broken .   lucky came out of his short reverie when the robot stumbled and almost fell .  there was no unevenness in the ground that lucky could see  no trifling ridge that might have caught his toe .  if there had been  a line of black shadow would have revealed it .   the ground was table smooth at that point .  the         robot s stride had simply broken for no reason and thrown him to one side .  the robot recovered after threshing about wildly .  having done that  it resumed its stride toward the shade as though nothing had happened .   lucky thought  it s definitely in poor working order .   they entered the shadow together  and lucky turned on his suit light .   he said   you do wrong to destroy necessary equipment .  you are doing harm to men .    there was no emotion in the robot s face  there could be none .  nor was there emotion in its voice .  it said   i am obeying orders .     that is the second law   said lucky severely .   still  you may not obey orders that harm human beings .  that would be to violate the first law .     i have not seen any men .  i have harmed no one .     you have harmed men you did not see .  i tell you that .     i have harmed no man   said the robot stubbornly  and lucky frowned at the unthinking repetition .  despite its polished appearance  perhaps it was not a very advanced model .   the robot went on .   i have been instructed to avoid men .  i have been warned when men were coming  but i was not warned about you .    lucky stared out past the shadow at the glittering mercurian landscape  ruddy and gray for the most part but blotched with a large area of the crumbly black material which seemed so common in this part of mercury .  he thought of mindes spotting the robot twice  his story made sense now  and losing it when he tried        to get closer .  his own secret invasion of the sun side  combined with the use of an ergometer  had turned the trick  fortunately .   he said suddenly and forcefully   who warned you to avoid men .    lucky didn t really expect to catch the robot .  a robot s mind is machinery  he thought .  it cannot be tricked or fooled  any more than you can trick a suit light into going on by jumping at the switch and pretending to close contact .   the robot said   i have been instructed not to answer that question .   then slowly  creakily  as though the words were coming out against its will  it said   i do not wish you to ask such questions any longer .  they are disturbing .    lucky thought  to break the first law would be more disturbing still .   deliberately he stepped out of the shadow into the sunlight .   he said to the robot  who followed   what is your serial number .     rl     .     very well  rl      you understand i am a man .     yes .     i am not equipped to withstand the heat of mercury s sun .     nor am i   said the robot .    i realize that   said lucky  thinking of the robot s near fall a few minutes earlier .   nevertheless  a man is much less equipped for it than is a robot .  do you understand that .     yes .          now  then  listen .  i want you to stop your destructive activities  and i want you to tell me who ordered you to destroy equipment .     i am instructed     if you do not obey me   said lucky loudly   i will remain here in the sun until i am killed and you will have broken the first law  since you would have allowed me to be killed when you could have stopped it .    lucky waited grimly .  a robot s statement could not be accepted as evidence  of course  in any court  but it would assure him that he was on the right track if it were to say what he expected it to .   but the robot said nothing .  it swayed .  one eye blinked out suddenly  more imperfection .    then came to life .  its voice sounded in a wordless squawk  then it said in an almost drunken mumble   i will carry you to safety .     i would resist   said lucky   and you would have to harm me .  if you answer my question  i will return to the shade of my own accord  and you will have saved my life without any damage to me at all .    silence .   lucky said   will you tell me who ordered you to destroy equipment .    and suddenly the robot lunged forward  coming to within two feet of lucky before stopping .   i told you not to ask that question .    its hands moved forward as though to seize lucky but did not complete the motion .   lucky watched grimly and without concern .  a robot could not harm a human being .   but then the robot lifted one of those mighty hands        and put it to its head  for all the world as though it were a man with a headache .   headache .   a sudden thought stabbed at lucky .  great galaxy .  he d been blind  stupidly  criminally blind .   it wasn t the robot s legs that were out of order  nor its voice  nor its eyes .  how could the heat affect them .  it was   it had to be   the positronic brain itself that was affected  the delicate positronic brain subjected to the direct heat and radiation of the mercurian sun for how long .  months .   that brain must be partially broken down already .   if the robot had been human  one would say he was in one of the stages of mental breakdown .  one might say he was on the road to insanity .   a mad robot .  driven mad by heat and radiation .   how far would the three laws hold in a broken down positronic brain .   and now lucky starr stood there  threatening a robot with his own death  while that same robot  nearly mad  advanced toward him  arms outstretched .   the very dilemma in which lucky had placed the robot might be adding to that madness .   cautiously  lucky retreated .  he said   do you feel well .    the robot said nothing .  its steps quickened .   lucky thought  if it s ready to break the first law  it must be on the point of complete dissolution .  a positronic brain would have to be in pieces to be capable of that .   yet  on the other hand  the robot had endured for months .  it might endure for months more .        he talked in a desperate attempt to delay matters and allow time for more thought .  he said   does your head ache .    ache .   said the robot .   i do not understand the meaning of the word .    lucky said   i am growing warm .  we had better retire to the shadow .    no more talk of heating himself to death .  he retreated at a half run now .   the robot s voice rumbled .   i have been told to prevent any interference with the orders given me .    lucky reached for his blaster and he sighed .  it would be unfortunate if he were forced to destroy the robot .  it was a magnificent work of man  and the council could investigate its workings with profit .  and to destroy it without even having obtained the desired information was repugnant to him .  lucky said   stop where you are .   the robot s arms moved jerkily as it lunged  and lucky escaped by a hair as he floated away in a side wise twist  taking the fullest advantage of mercury s gravity .   if he could maneuver his way into the shadow  if the  robot followed him there  the coolness might calm those disordered positronic paths .  it might become tamer  more reasonable  and lucky might be spared the necessity of its destruction .  lucky dodged again  and again the robot rushed past  its metal legs kicking up spurts of black grit that settled back to mercury promptly and cleanly since there was no atmosphere to keep it in suspension .  it was an eerie chase  the tread of man and robot hushed and silent in the vacuum .         lucky s confidence grew somewhat .  the robot s movements had grown jerkier .  its control of the gears and relays that manipulated its limbs was imperfect and growing more so .   yet the robot was making an obvious attempt to head him off from the shadow .  it was definitely and beyond any doubt trying to kill him .   and still lucky could not bring himself to use the blaster .   he stopped short .  the robot stopped too .  they were face to face  five feet apart  standing on the black patch of iron sulfide .  the blackness seemed to make the heat all the greater and lucky felt a gathering faintness .  the robot stood grimly between lucky and the shade .   lucky said   out of my way .   talking was difficult .   the robot said   i have been told to prevent any interference with the orders given me .  you have been interfering .    lucky no longer had a choice .  he had miscalculated .  it had never occurred to him to doubt the validity of the three laws under all circumstances .  the truth had come to him too late  and his miscalculation had brought him to this  the danger of his own life and the necessity of destroying a robot .   he raised his blaster sadly .   and almost at once he realized that he had made a second miscalculation .  he had waited too long  and the accumulation of heat and weariness had made his body as imperfect a machine as was the robot s .  his arm lifted sluggishly  and the robot seemed to be twice life sized to his own reeling mind and sight .   the robot was a blur of motion  and this time lucky s tired body could not be driven into quick       enough movement .  the blaster was struck from lucky s hand and went flying .  lucky s arm was clamped tight in the grip of one metal hand  and ms waist was embraced by a metal arm .   under the best of circumstances  lucky could not have withstood the steel muscles of the mechanical man .  no human being could have .  now he felt all capacity for resistance vanish .  he felt only the heat .   the robot tightened its grip  bending lucky backward as though he were a rag doll .  lucky thought dizzily of the structural weakness of the inso suit .  an ordinary space suit might have protected him even against a robot s strength .  an inso suit could not .  any moment  a section of it might buckle and give .   lucky s free arm flailed helplessly  his fingers dragging into the black grit below .   one thought flicked through his mind .  desperately he tried to drive his muscles into one last attempt to fend off what seemed inevitable death at the hands of a mad robot .       prelude to a duel  lucky s predicament was a duplicate in reverse of that which had faced bigman some hours previously .  big man had been threatened not by heat but by growing cold .  he was held in the grip of the stony  ropes  as firmly as lucky in the grip of the metal robot .  in one respect  though  bigman s position held hope .  his numbing grasp held desperately on the blaster pinned in urteil s hand .   and the blaster was coming loose .  in fact  it came free so suddenly that bigman s numbed fingers nearly dropped it .    sands of mars .   he muttered  and held on .   if he had known where in the tentacles a vulnerable spot might be  if he could have blasted any part of those tentacles without killing either urteil or himself  his problem would have been simple .  as it was  there was only one gamble  not a good one either  open to him .   his thumb worked clumsily on the intensity control  pushing it down and down .  he was getting drowsy  which was a bad sign .  it had been minutes since he had heard any sign of life from urteil .   he had intensity at minimum now .  one more thing             he must reach the activator with his forefinger without dropping the blaster .   space .  he mustn t drop it .   the forefinger touched the proper spot and pushed against it .   the blaster grew warm .  he could see that in the dull red glow of the grid across the muzzle .  that was bad for the grid since a blaster was not designed to be used as a heat ray  but to deep space with that .   with what strength was left him  bigman tossed the blaster as far as he could .   it seemed to him then as though reality wavered for a moment  as though he were on the edge of unconsciousness .   then he felt the first glow of warmth  a tiny leakage of heat entering his body from the laboring power unit  and he shouted in weak joy .  that heat was enough to show that power was no longer being drained directly into the voracious bodies of the heat sucking tentacles .  he moved his arms .  he lifted a leg .  they were free .  the tentacles were gone .   his suit light had brightened  and he could see clearly the spot where the blaster had been thrown .  the spot  but not the blaster .  where the blaster should be was a sluggishly moving mass of gray  intertwining tentacles .   with shaky motions  bigman snatched at urteil s own blaster  setting it to minimum and tossing it past the position of the first .  that would hold the creature if the energy of the first gave out .   bigman said urgently   hey  urteil .  can you hear me .    there was no answer .         with what strength he could muster he pulled the space suited figure away with him .  urteil s suit light glimmered  and his power unit gauge showed itself as not quite empty .  the temperature inside his suit should return to normal quickly .   bigman called the dome .  there was no other decision possible now .  in their weakened condition  with their power supply low  another encounter with mer curian life would kill them .  and he would manage to protect lucky s position somehow .   it was remarkable how quickly men reached them .   with two cups of coffee and a hot meal inside him and the dome s light and heat all about him  bigman s resilient mind and body put the recent horror into proper perspective .  it was already only an unpleasant memory .   dr .  peverale hovered about him with an air partly like that of an anxious mother  partly like that of a nervous old man .  his iron gray hair was in disarray .   you re sure you re all right  bigman .  no ill effects .     i feel fine .  never better   insisted bigman .   the question is  doc  how s urteil .     apparently he ll be all right .   the astronomer s voice grew cold .   dr .  gardoma has examined him and reported favorably on his condition .     good   said bigman almost gloatingly .   dr .  peverale said with some surprise   are you concerned for him .     you bet  doc .  i ve plans for him .    dr .  hanley cook entered now  almost trembling with excitement .   we ve sent men into the mines to see if we can round up any of the creatures .  they re taking       heating pads with them .  like bait to a fish  you know .   he turned to bigman .   lucky you got away .    bigman s voice rose in pitch and he looked outraged   it wasn t luck  it was brains .  i figured they were after straight heat most of all .  i figured it was their favorite kind of energy .  so i gave it to them .    dr .  peverale left after that  but cook remained behind  talking of the creatures  walking back and forth  bubbling with speculation .   imagine .  the old stories about the freezing death in the mines were true .  really true .  think of it .  just rocky tentacles acting as heat sponges  absorbing energy wherever they can make contact .  you re sure of the description  bigman .     of course i m sure .  when you catch one  see for yourself .     what a discovery .     how come they were never discovered before .   asked bigman .    according to you  they blend into their environment .  protective mimicry .  then  too  they attack only isolated men .  maybe   his words grew quicker  more animated  and his long fingers intertwined and twisted with one another   there is some instinct there  some rudimentary intelligence that kept them hidden and out of sight .  i m sure of it .  it s a kind of intelligence that kept them out of our way .  they knew their only safety was in obscurity  so they attack only single  isolated men .  then for thirty years or more no men appeared in the mines .  their precious kernels of unusual heat were gone  and yet they never succumbed to the temptation to invade the dome itself .  but when men finally appeared once more in the mines  that temptation was too        great and one of the creatures attacked  even though there were two men there and not one .  for them  that was fatal .  they have been discovered .     why don t they go to the sun side if they want energy and they re all that intelligent .   demanded big man .    maybe that s too hot   said cook at once .    they took the blaster .  it was red hot .     the sun side may be too full of hard radiation .  they may not be adapted to that .  or maybe there is another breed of such creature on the sun side .  how can we know .  maybe the dark side ones live on radioactive ores and on the coronal glow .    bigman shrugged .  he found such speculation unprofitable .   and cook s line of thought seemed to change too .  he stared speculatively at bigman  one finger rubbing his chin rhythmically .   so you saved urteil s life .     that s right .     well  maybe it s a good thing .  if urteil had died  they would have blamed you .  senator swenson could have made it darned hot for you and for starr and for the council .  no matter what explanation you gave  you would have been there when urteil died  and that would have been enough for swenson .     listen   said bigman  moving about uneasily   when do i get to see urteil .     whenever dr .  gardoma says you may .     get him on the wire and tell him to say i can  then .    cook s gaze remained fastened thoughtfully on the small martian .   what s on your mind .         and because bigman had to make arrangements about the gravity  he explained some of his plan to cook .   dr .  gardoma opened the door and nodded to bigman to enter .   you can have him  bigman .    he whispered .   i don t want him .    he stepped out  and bigman and urteil were alone with one another once again .   jonathan urteil was a little pallid where stubble didn t darken his face  but that was the only sign of his ordeal .  he bared his lips to a savage grin .   i m in one piece  if that s what you ve come to see .     that s what i ve come to see .  also to ask you a question .  are you still full of that drivel about lucky starr setting up a fake sirian base in the mines .     i intend to prove it .     look  you cobber  you know it s a lie  and you re  going to fake proof if you can .  fake it .  now i m not  expecting you to get on your knees to thank me for  saving your life     wait .   slowly urteil s face flushed .   all i remember is that that thing got me first by surprise .  that was accident .  after that  i don t know what happened .  what you say means nothing to me .    bigman shrieked with outrage .   you smudge of space dust  you yelled for help .     where s your witness .  i don t remember a thing .     how do you suppose you got out .     i m not supposing anything .  maybe the thing crawled away on its own .  maybe there was no thing at all .  maybe a rockfall hit me and knocked me out .  now if you came here expecting me to cry on your shoulders        and promise to lay off your grafting friend  you re going to be disappointed .  if you have nothing else to say  good by .    bigman said   there s something you re forgetting .  you tried to kill me .     where s your witness .  now if you don t get out  i ll pucker up and blow you out  midget .    bigman remained heroically calm .   i ll make a deal with you  urteil .  you ve made every threat you can think of because you re half an inch taller than i am and half a pound heavier  but you crawled the only time i made a pass at you .     with a force knife and myself unarmed .  don t forget that .     i say you re yellow .  meet me rough and tumble  now .  no weapons .  or are you too weak .     too weak for you .  two years in the hospital and i wouldn t be too weak for you .     then fight .  before witnesses .  we can use the space in the power room .  i ve made arrangements with hanley cook .     cook must hate you .  what about peverale .     nobody asked him .  and cook doesn t hate me .     he seems anxious to get you killed .  but i don t think i ll give him the satisfaction .  why should i fight a half pint of skin and wind .     yellow .     i said  why .  you said you were making a deal .     right .  you win  i don t say a word about what happened in the mines  what really happened .  i win  you lay off the council .     some deal .  why should i worry about anything you can say about me .          you re not afraid of losing  are you .     space .   the exclamation was enough .   bigman said   well  then .     you must think i m a fool .  if i fight with you before witnesses i ll be indicted for murder .  if i lean a finger on you  you re squashed .  go find yourself another way to commit suicide .     all right .  how much do you outweigh me .     a hundred pounds   said urteil contemptuously .    a hundred pounds of fat   squeaked bigman  his gnomish face screwed into a ferocious scowl .   tell you what .  let s fight under mercurian gravity .  that makes your advantage forty pounds .  and you keep your inertia advantage .  fair enough .    urteil said   space  i d like to give you one smash  just to plaster your big mouth over your miserable little face .     you ve got your chance .  is it a deal .     by earth  it s a deal .  i ll try not to kill you  but that s as far as i ll go .  you ve asked for this  you ve begged for it .     right .  now let s go .  let s go .   and bigman was so anxious that he hopped about as he talked  sparring a little with rapid birdlike motions of his fists .  in fact  such was his eagerness for this duel that not once did he give a specific thought to lucky nor suffer any presentiment of disaster .  he had no way of telling that  some time before  lucky had fought a more deadly duel than the one bigman now proposed .   the power level had its tremendous generators and heavy equipment  but it also had its broad level space suitable for gatherings of personnel .  it was the oldest        part of the dome .  in the first days  before even a single mine shaft had been blasted into mercurian soil  the original construction engineers had slept on cots in that space between the generators .  even now it was still occasionally used for trifilm entertainment .   now it served as a ring  and cook  together with half a dozen or so technicians  remained dubiously on the side lines .    is this all .   demanded bigman .   cook said   mindes and his men are out sun side .  there are ten men in the mines looking for your ropes  and the rest are mostly at their instruments .   he looked apprehensively at urteil and said   are you sure you know what you re doing  bigman .    urteil was stripped to the waist .  he had a thick growth of hair over his chest and shoulders  and he moved his muscles with an athletic joy .   bigman looked in urteil s direction indifferently .   all set with the gravity .     we ll have it off at the signal .  i ve rigged the controls so the rest of the dome won t be affected .  has urteil agreed .     sure .   bigman smiled .   it s all right  pal .     i hope so   said cook fervently .   urteil called out   when do we get started .   then looking about the small group of spectators  he asked   anyone care to bet on the monkey .    one of the technicians looked at bigman with an uneasy grin .  bigman  now also stripped to his waist  looked surprisingly wiry  but the difference in size gave the match a grotesque appearance .    no bet here   said the technician .    are we ready .   called cook .         i am   said urteil .   cook licked his pale lips and flicked the master switch .  there was a change in the pitch of the subdued droning of the generators .   bigman swayed with the sudden loss of weight .  so did all the rest .  urteil stumbled but recovered rapidly and advanced gingerly into the middle of the clear space .  he did not bother to lift his arms but stood waiting in a posture of complete relaxation .    start something  bug   he said .       results of a duel  for his part  bigman advanced with gentle movements of his legs that translated themselves into slow and graceful steps  almost as though he were on springs .   in a way he was .  mercurian surface gravity was almost precisely equal to martian surface gravity  and it was something he was at home with thoroughly .  his cool  gray eyes  watching sharply  noticed every sway in urteil s body  every knotting of a sudden muscle as he worked to keep erect .   small misjudgments even in merely keeping one s balance were inevitable when working in a gravity to which one was unaccustomed .   bigman moved in suddenly  springing from foot to foot and side to side in a broken motion that was at once amusingly dancelike and completely confusing .    what is this .   growled urteil in exasperation .   a martian waltz .     kind of   said bigman .  his arm lunged outward  and his bare knuckles slammed into urteil s side with a resounding thwack  staggering the big fellow .   there was a gasp from the audience and one yell of  hey  boy .    bigman stood there  arms akimbo  waiting for urteil to recover his balance .             urteil did so in a matter of five seconds  but now there was an angry red splotch on his side and a similar and angrier one on each cheekbone .   his own arm shot out powerfully  his right palm half open as though a slap would be sufficient to fling this stinging insect out of his way forever .   but the blow continued  dragging urteil about .  big man had ducked  leaving a fraction of an inch to spare  with the sure judgment of a perfectly co ordinated body .  urteil s efforts to stop his follow through left him teetering wildly  back to bigman .   bigman placed his foot on the seat of urteil s pants and shoved gently .  the recoil sent him hopping easily backward on the other foot  but urteil went slowly forward on his face in grotesque slow motion .   there was sudden laughter from the side lines .   one of the spectators called out   changed my mind  urteil .  i m betting .    urteil made no gesture of hearing this .  he was facing bigman again  and from the corner of his thick lips a viscid drop of saliva made its way down the corner of his chin .    up the gravity .   he roared hoarsely .   get it to normal .     what s the matter  tubbo .   mocked bigman .   isn t forty pounds in your favor enough .     i ll kill you .  i ll kill you   urteil shouted .    go ahead .   bigman spread his arms in mock invitation .   but urteil was not entirely beyond reason .  he circled bigman  hopping a little in ungainly fashion .  he said   i ll get my gravity legs  bug  and once i grab you anywhere  that piece gets torn off you .           grab away .    but there was an uneasy silence among the men who watched now .  urteil was a stooping barrel  his arms sweeping out and wide  his legs spread .  he was keeping ms balance  catching the rhythm of the gravity .   bigman was a slender stalk in comparison .  he might be as graceful and self assured as a dancer  yet he looked pitifully small .   bigman seemed unworried .  he hopped forward with a sudden stamp of his feet that sent him shooting high in the air  and when urteil lunged at the rising figure  bigman lifted his feet and went down behind ms adversary before the other could turn around .   there was loud applause  and bigman grinned .   he performed what was almost a pirouette as he ducked under one of the great arms that threatened him  reaching out and bringing the side of ms hand sharply down against the biceps .   urteil restrained a cry and whirled again .   urteil maintained a dreadful calm to all these grandstanding provocations now .  bigman  on the other hand  tried in every way he could to taunt and sting urteil into a wild motion that would send him shooting off balance .   forward and away  quick  sharp blows  which for all their flicking qualities carried a sting .   but a new respect for urteil was growing in the small martian s mind .  the cobber was taking it .  he was maintaining his ground like a bear warding off the attack of a hunting dog .  and bigman was the hunting dog which could only hover at the outskirts  snap  snarl  and keep out of the reach of the bear s paws .   urteil even looked like a bear with ms large  hairy       body  ms small  bloodshot eyes  and his jowly  bristly face .    fight  cobber   jeered bigman .   i m the only one giving the customers a show .    urteil shook his head slowly .   come closer   he said .    sure   said bigman lightly  dashing in .  with flashing movements  he caught urteil on the side of the jaw and was under his arm and away in almost the same movement .   urteil s arm half moved  but it was too late and the motion wasn t completed .  he swayed a little .   try it again   he said .   bigman tried it again  twisting and diving under his other arm this time and finishing with a little bow to accept the roars of approval .    try it again   said urteil thickly .    sure   said bigman .  and he dashed .   this time urteil was thoroughly prepared .  he moved neither head nor arms  but his right foot shot forward .   bigman doubled  or tried to  in mid air and didn t quite make it .  his ankle was caught and pinned brutally for a moment by urteil s shoe .  bigman yelped at the pressure .   urteil s rapid movement carried him forward  and bigman  with a quick  desperate shove at the other s back  accelerated that movement .   this time urteil  more accustomed to the gravity  was not thrown forward as far and recovered more quickly  while bigman  with his ankle on fire  moved about with a frightening clumsiness .   with a wild shout urteil charged and bigman  pivoting on his good foot  was not fast enough .  his right        shoulder was caught in one hamlike fist .  his right elbow was caught in the other .  they went down together .   a groan went up almost in concert from the spectators and cook  watching ashen faced  cried out   stop the fight  in a croaking voice that went completely unheeded .   urteil got to his feet  his grip firm on bigman  lifting the martian as though he were a feather .  bigman  face twisted in pain  writhed to get a footing of his own .   urteil muttered into the little fellow s ear .   you thought you were wise  tricking me into fighting under low gravity .  do you still think so .    bigman wasted no time in thought .  he would have to get at least one foot on the floor .   .  .  .  or on urteil s kneecap  for his right foot rested momentarily on urteil s knee and that would have to do .   bigman pushed down hard and lunged his body backward .   urteil swayed forward .  that was not dangerous for urteil in itself  but his balancing muscles overshot the mark in the low gravity  and in righting himself he swayed backward  and as he did so  bigman  expecting that  shifted his weight and pushed hard forward .   urteil went down so suddenly that the spectators could not see how it was accomplished .  bigman wrenched half free .   he was on his feet like a cat  with his right arm still pinned .  bigman brought his left arm down on urteil s wrist and brought up his knee sharply against the other s elbow .   urteil howled and his grip on bigman loosened as he shifted position to keep his own arm from being broken .        bigman took his chance with the quickness of a jet s ignition .  he wrenched his pinned hand completely loose while maintaining his grip on urteil s wrist .  his freed hand came down upon urteil s arm above the elbow .  he had a two handed grip now on urteil s left arm .   urteil was scrabbling to his feet  and as he did so  bigman s body bowed and his back muscles went down hard with effort .  he lifted along the line of urteil s own motion of rising .   bigman s muscles  combined with the action of urteil s lift  carried that large body free of the ground in a slow motion  impressive display of what could be done in a low gravity field .   with his muscles near to cracking  bigman whipped urteil s torso still farther upward  then let go  watching it as it went flailing in a parabolic arc that seemed grotesquely slow by earth standards .   they all watched and were all caught in the sudden change of gravity .  earth s full gravity snapped on with the force and speed of a blaster bolt  and bigman went to his knees with a painful wrench on his twisted ankle .  the spectators also went down in a chorus of confused cries of pain and astonishment .   bigman caught only the merest glimpse of what happened to urteil .  the change in gravity had caught him almost at the high point of the parabola  snapping him downward with sharp acceleration .  his head struck a protecting stanchion of one of the generators a sharp  cracking blow .   bigman  rising painfully to his feet  tried to shake sense into his addled brains .  he staggered and was        aware of urteil sprawled limply  of cook kneeling at urteil s side .    what happened .   cried bigm an .   what happened to the gravity .    the others echoed the question .  as nearly as bigman could tell  cook was the only one on his feet  the only one who seemed to be thinking .   cook was saying   never mind the gravity .  it s urteil .     is he hurt .   cried someone .    not any more   said cook  getting up from his kneeling position .   i m pretty sure he s dead .    they made an uneasy circle about the body .   bigman said   better get dr .  gardoma .   he scarcely heard himself say it .  a great thought had come to him .    there s going to be trouble   said cook .   you killed him  bigman .     the change in gravity did that   said bigman .    that ll be hard to explain .  you threw him .    bigman said   i ll face any trouble .  don t worry .    cook licked his lips and looked away .   i ll call gardoma .    gardoma arrived five minutes later  and the shortness of his examination was proof enough that cook had been correct .   the physician rose to his feet  wiping his hands on a pocket handkerchief .  he said gravely   dead .  fractured skull .  how did it happen .    several spoke at once  but cook waved them down .   he said   a grudge fight between bigman and ur   teil     between bigman and urteil .   exploded dr .  gar        doma .   who allowed that .  are you crazy  expecting  bigman to stand up     easy there   said bigman .   i m in one piece .    cook said in angry self defense   that s right  gar doma  it s urteil that s dead .  and it was bigman who insisted on the fight .  you admit that  don t you .     i admit it all right   said bigman .   i also said it was to be under mercurian gravity .    dr .  gardoma s eyes opened wide .   mercurian gravity .  here .   he looked down at his feet as though wondering if his senses were playing him tricks and he were really lighter than he felt .    it isn t mercurian gravity any more   said bigman   because the pseudo grav field snapped to full earth gravity at a crucial time .  bam .  like that .  that s what killed urteil  not yours truly .     what made the pseudo grav snap to earth levels .   asked gardoma .   there was silence .   cook said feebly   it might have been a short     nuts   said bigman   the level is pulled up .  it didn t do that by itself .    there was a new silence and an uneasy one .   one of the technicians cleared his throat and said   maybe in the excitement of the fight someone was moving around and shoved it up with his shoulder without even realizing it .    the others agreed eagerly .  one of them said   space .  it just happened .    cook said   i ll have to report the entire incident .   bigman     well   said the small martian calmly   am i under arrest for manslaughter .           n   no   said cook uncertainly .   i won t arrest you  but i have to report  and you may be arrested in the end .     uh huh .  well  thanks for the warning .   for the first time since returning from the mines  bigman found himself thinking of lucky .  this  he thought  is a fine peck of trouble for lucky to find waiting for him when he comes back .   and yet there was an odd stir of excitement in the little martian  too  for he was sure he could get out of the trouble  .   .   .  and show lucky a thing or two in the process .   a new voice broke in .   bigman .    everyone looked up .  it was peverale  stepping down the ramp that led from the upper levels .   great space  bigman  are you down there .  and cook .   then almost pettishly   what s going on .    no one seemed to be able to say anything at all .  the old astronomer s eyes fell on the prone body of urteil  and he said with mild surprise   is he dead .    to bigman s astonishment  peverale seemed to lose interest in that .  he didn t even wait for his question to be answered before turning to bigman once more .   he said   where s lucky starr .    bigman opened his mouth but nothing came out .  finally  he managed to say weakly   why do you ask .     is he still in the mines .     well     or is he on sun side .     well     great space  man  is he on sun side .    bigman said   i want to know why you re asking .     mindes   said peverale impatiently   is out in his       flitter  patrolling the area covered by ms cables .  he does that sometimes .     so .     so he s either mad or he s correct in saying he s seen lucky starr out there .     where .   cried bigman at once .   dr .  peverale s mouth compressed in disapproval .    then he is out there .  that s plain enough .  well  your  friend lucky starr was apparently in some trouble with  a mechanical man  a robot     a robot .     and according to mindes  who has not landed but who is waiting for a party to be sent out  lucky starr is dead .        prelude to a trial  during the moment in which lucky lay bent in the inexorable grip of the robot  he expected momentary death  and when it did not come at once a weak hope flared up within him .   could it be that the robot  having the impossibility of killing a human being ingrained in its tortured mind  found itself incapable of the actual act now that it was face to face with it .   and then he thought that couldn t be  for it seemed to him the pressure of the robot s grip was increasing in smooth stages .   he cried with what force he could muster   release me .   and brought up his one free hand from where it had dragged  trailing in the black grime .  there was one last chance  one last  miserably weak chance .   he lifted his hand to the robot s head .  he could not turn his head to see  crushed as that was against the robot s chest .  his hand slipped along the smooth metal surface of the robot s skull two times  three times  four times .  he took ms hand away .   there was nothing more he could do .   then       was it his imagination  or did the robot s grip seem to loosen .  was mercury s big sun on his side at last .              robot .   he cried .   the robot made a sound  but it was only like gears scraping rustily together .   its grip was loosening .  now was the time to reinforce events by calling what might be left of the laws of robotics into play .   lucky panted   you may not hurt a human being .    the robot said   i may not   haltingly  and  without warning fell to the ground .   its grip was constant  as though rigid in death .   lucky said   robot .  let go .    jerkily  the robot loosened his hold .  not entirely  but lucky s legs came free and his head could move .   he said   who ordered you to destroy equipment .    he no longer feared the robot s wild reaction to that question .  he knew that he himself had brought that positronic mind to full disintegration .  but in the last stages before final dissolution  perhaps some ragged remnant of the second law might hold .  he repeated   who ordered you to destroy equipment .    the robot made a blurred sound .   er   er    then  maddeningly  radio contact broke off  and the robot s mouth opened and closed twice as though  in the ultimate extremity  it were trying to talk by ordinary sound .   after that  nothing .   the robot was dead .   lucky s own mind  now that the immediate emergency of near death was over  was wavering and blurred .  he lacked the strength to unwind the robot s limbs entirely from his body .  his radio controls had been smashed in the robot s hug .   he knew that he must first regain his strength .  to do        that meant he must get out of the direct radiation of mercury s big sun and quickly .  that meant reaching the shadow of the near by ridge  the shadow he had failed to reach during the duel with the robot .   painfully he doubled his feet beneath him .  painfully he inched his body toward the shadow of the ridge  dragging the robot s weight with him .  again .  again .  the process seemed to last forever and the universe shimmered about him .   again .  again .   there seemed to be no strength or feeling in his legs  and the robot seemed to weigh a thousand pounds .   even with mercury s low gravity  the task seemed beyond his weakening strength  and it was sheer will that drove him on .   his head entered the shadow first .  light blanked out .  he waited  panting  and then  with an effort that seemed to crack his thigh muscles  he pushed himself along the ground once more and even once more .   he was in the shadow .  one of the robot s legs was still in the sun  blazing reflections in all directions .  lucky looked over his shoulder and noted that dizzily .  then  almost gratefully  he let go of consciousness .   there were intervals later when sense perception crawled back .   then  much later  he lay quietly  conscious of a soft bed under him  trying to bring those intervals back to mind .  there were fragmentary pictures in his memory of people aproaching  a vague impression of motion in a jet vehicle  of bigman s voice  shrill and anxious .  then  a trifle more clearly  a physician s ministrations .   after that  a blank again  followed by a sharp mem        ory of dr .  peverale s courtly voice asking him gentle questions .  lucky remembered answering in connected fashion  so the worst of his ordeal must have been over by then .  he opened his eyes .   dr .  gardoma was looking at him . somberly  a hypodermic still in his hand .   how do you feel .   he asked .   lucky smiled .   how should i feel .     dead  i should think  after what you ve gone through .  but you have a remarkable constitution  so you ll live .    bigman  who had been hovering anxiously at the outskirts of lucky s vision  entered it full now .   no thanks to mindes for that .  why didn t that mud brain go down and get lucky out of there after he spotted the robot s leg .  what was he waiting for .  he was leaving lucky to die .    dr .  gardoma put away his hypodermic and washed his hands .  with his back to bigman  he said   scott mindes was convinced lucky was dead .  his only thought was to stay away so that no one could accuse him of being the murderer .  he knew he had tried to kill lucky once before and that others would remember that .     how could he think that this time .  the robot     mindes isn t himself under pressure these days .  he called for help  that was the best he could do .    lucky said   take it easy  bigman .  i was in no danger .  i was sleeping it off in the shade  and i m all right now .  what about the robot  gardoma .  was it salvaged .     we ve got it in the dome .  the brain is gone  though  quite impossible to study .     too bad   said lucky .         the physician raised his voice .   all right  bigman  come on .  let him sleep .     hey   began bigman indignantly .   lucky at once added   that s all right  gardoma .  as a matter of fact  i want to speak to him privately .    dr .  gardoma hesitated  then shrugged .   you need sleep  but i ll give you half an hour .  then he must go .     he ll go .    as soon as they were alone  bigman seized lucky s  shoulder and shook it violently .  he said in a strangled  kind of voice   you stupid ape .  if the heat hadn t got  that robot in time   like in the sub etherics    lucky smiled mirthlessly .   it wasn t coincidence  bigman   he said .   if i had waited for a sub etheric ending  i d be dead .  i had to gimmick the robot .     how .     its brain case was highly polished .  it reflected a large part of the sun s radiation .  that meant the temperature of the positronic brain was high enough to ruin its sanity but not high enough to stop it completely .  fortunately  a good part of mercurian soil about here is made up of a loose black substance .  i managed to smear some on its head .     what did that do .     black absorbs heat  bigman .  it doesn t reflect it .  the temperature of the robot s brain went up quickly and it died almost at once .  it was close  though .   .   .   .  still  never mind that .  what happened at this end while i was gone .  anything .     anything .  wow .  you listen .   and as bigman talked  lucky did listen  with an expression that grew continually graver as the story unfolded .   by the time it drew to a conclusion he was frowning       angrily .   why did you fight urteil  anyway .  that was foolish .     lucky   said bigman in outrage   it was strategy .   you always say i just bull right ahead and can t be  trusted to do the shrewd thing .  this was shrewd .  i  knew i could lick him at low gravity     it seems as though you almost didn t .  your ankle is taped .     i slipped .  accident .  besides  i did win .  a deal was involved .  he could do a lot of damage to the council with his lies  but if i won he d get off our backs .     could you take his word for that .     well   began bigman  troubled .   lucky drove on .   you saved his life  you said .  he must have known that  and yet that didn t persuade him to abandon his purpose .  did you think he was likely to do so as a result of a fist fight .     well   said bigman  again .    especially if he lost and would therefore be raging at the humiliation of a public beating .   .  .  .  i tell you what  bigman .  you did it because you wanted to beat him and get revenge for making fun of you .  your talk about making a deal was just an excuse to give you an opportunity for the beating .  isn t that right .     aw  lucky .  sands of mars     well  am i wrong .      i wanted to make the deal     but mainly you wanted to fight  and now look at the mess .    bigman s eyes dropped .   i m sorry .    lucky relented at once .   oh  great galaxy  bigman  i m not angry at you .  i m angry at myself  really .  i misjudged that robot and nearly got myself killed be         cause i wasn t thinking .  i could see it was out of order and never tied it up with the effect of heat on its posi tronic brain till it was nearly too late .   .   .   .  well  the past has a lesson for the future  but otherwise  let s forget it .  the question is what to do about the urteil situation .    bigman s spirits bounced back at once .   anyway   he said   the cobber is off our backs .     he is   said lucky   but what about senator swen son .    hmm .     how do we explain things .  the council of science  is being investigated  and as a result of a fight instigated  by someone close to the council  someone who s almost  a member  the investigator dies .  that won t look good .     it was an accident .  the pseudo grav field       that won t help us .  i ll have to talk to peverale  and    bigman reddened and said hastily   he s just an old guy .  he s not paying any attention to this .    lucky hitched himself to one elbow .   what do you mean  he s not paying any attention .     he isn t   said bigman vehemently .   he came in with urteil lying dead on the ground and thought nothing of it .  he said   is he dead .   and that s all .    that s all .     that s all .  then he asked about where you were and said mindes had called and said a robot had killed you .    lucky s level glance held bigman .   that s all .    that was all   said bigman uneasily .   what s happened since then .  come on  bigman .  you don t want me to talk to peverale .  why not .         bigman looked away .    come on  bigman .     well  i m being tried or something .     tried .     peverale says it s murder and it ll raise a smell back on earth .  he says we ve got to fix responsibility .     all right .  when is the trial .     aw  lucky  i didn t want to tell you .  dr .  gardoma said you weren t to be excited .     don t act like a mother hen  bigman .  when is the trial .     tomorrow at two p . m .   system standard time .  but there s nothing to worry about  lucky .    lucky said   call in gardoma .     why .     do as i say .    bigman stepped to the door  and when he returned  dr .  gardoma was with him .   lucky said   there s no reason i can t get out of bed by two p . m .  tomorrow  is there .    dr .  gardoma hesitated .   i d rather you took more time .     i don t care what you d rather .  it won t kill me  will it .     it wouldn t kill you to get out of bed right now  mr .  starr   said dr .  gardoma  offended .   but it s not advisable .     all right  then .  now you tell dr .  peverale that i ll be at the trial of bigman .  you know about that  i suppose .       .   i do .     everyone does except myself .  is that it .     you were in no condition           you tell dr .  peverale i ll be at that trial and it isn t to start without me .     i ll tell him   said gardoma   and you d better go to sleep now .  come with me  bigman .    bigman squealed .   just one second .   he stepped rapidly to the side of lucky s bed and said   look  lucky  don t get upset .  i ve got the whole situation under control .    lucky s eyebrows lifted .   bigman  almost bursting with self importance  said   i wanted to surprise you  darn it .  i can prove i had nothing to do with urteil breaking his neck .  i ve solved the case .   he pounded his chest .   i have .  me .  bigman .  i know who s responsible for everything .    lucky said   who .    but bigman cried instantly   no .  i m not saying .  i want to show you i have more on my mind than fist fights .  i ll run the show this time and you watch me  that s all .  you ll find out at the trial .    the little martian wrinkled his face into a delighted grin  executed a small dance step  and followed dr .  gardoma out of the room  wearing a look of gay triumph .       the trial  lucky strode into dr .  peverale s office shortly before   p . m .  the next day .   the others had already gathered .  dr .  peverale  sitting behind an old and crowded desk  nodded pleasantly at him  and lucky responded with a grave   good afternoon  sir .    it was much like the evening of the banquet .  cook was there  of course  looking as always  nervous and  somehow  gaunt .  he sat in a large armchair at dr .  peverale s right  and bigman s small body squirmed and was nearly lost in an equally large armchair at the left .   mindes was there  his thin face twisted glumly and his intertwining fingers separating occasionally to drum on his pants leg .  dr .  gardoma sat next to him  stolid  his heavy eyelids lifting to glance disapprovingly at lucky as he entered .  the department heads among the astronomers were there .   in fact  the only man who had been present at the banquet but was absent now was urteil .   dr .  peverale began at once in his gentle way   we can start now .  and first  a few words for mr .  starr .  i understand that bigman described this proceeding to you as a trial .  please be assured that it is nothing of            the sort .  if there is to be a trial  and i hope not  it wil take place on earth with qualified judges and legal counsel .  what we are trying to do here is merely to assemble a report for transmission to the council of science .    dr .  peverale arranged some of the helter skelter of  objects on his desk and said   let me explain why a  full report is necessary .  in the first place  as a result of  mr .  starr s daring penetration of the sun side  the  saboteur who has been upsetting dr .  mindes s project  has been stopped .  it turned out to be a robot of sirian  manufacture  which is now no longer functional .  mr .   starr     yes .   said lucky .    the importance of the matter was such that i took the liberty of questioning you when you were first brought in and when your state was one of only half consciousness .     i remember that   said lucky   quite well .     would you confirm some of the answers now  for the record .     i will .     in the first place  are there any other robots involved .     the robot did not say  but i do not believe there were others .     however  it did not say specifically that it was the only robot on mercury .     it did not .     then there might be many others .     i don t think so .     that s only your own opinion  though .  the robot didn t say there were no others .           it did not    very well  then .  how many sirians were involved .     the robot would not say .  it had been instructed not to .     did it locate the base of the sirian invaders .     it said nothing concerning that .  it made no mention of sirians at all .     but the robot was of sirian manufacture  wasn t it .     it admitted that .     ah .   dr peverale smiled humorlessly .   then it is obvious  i think  that there are sirians on mercury and that they are active against us .  the council of science must be made aware of this .  there must be an organized search of mercury and  if the sirians evade us and leave the planet  there must at least be an increased awareness of the sirian danger .    cook interposed uneasily .   there is also the ques  tion of the native mercurian life forms  dr .  peverale .   the council will have to be informed of that  too .    he turned to address the gathering at large .   one of  the creatures was captured yesterday and    the old astronomer interrupted with some annoyance .   yes  dr .  cook  the council shall assuredly be informed .  nevertheless  the sirian question is what must be kept foremost .  other matters must be sacrificed to the immediate danger .  for instance  i suggest that dr .  mindes abandon his project until mercury be made safe for earthmen .     hold on  now   cried mindes quickly .   there s a  lot of money and time and effort invested here     i said  until mercury was safe .  i do not imply permanent abandonment of project light .  and be        cause it is necessary to put the mercurian danger foremost  it is necessary to make sure that urteil s protector  senator swenson  be prevented from setting up obstructions over side issues .    lucky said   you mean you want to present the senator with a scapegoat in the form of bigman  neatly ticketed and bound hand and foot .  then while he s worrying and clawing at bigman  the chase for sirians can proceed on mercury without interference .    the astronomer lifted his white eyebrows .   a scapegoat  mr .  starr .  we just want the facts .     well  go ahead  then   said bigman  moving restlessly in his chair .   you ll get the facts .     good   said dr .  peverale .   as the central figure  do you care to begin .  tell everything that occurred between you and urteil in your own words .  tell it in your own words  but i would appreciate brevity .  and remember  these proceedings are being recorded on sound microfilm .    bigman said   do you want me to take my oath .    peverale shook his head .   this is not a formal trial .     suit yourself .   and with surprising dispassion  bigman told the story .  beginning with urteil s slurs on his height and continuing through the encounter in the mines  he ended with the duel .  he left out only urteil s threats of action against lucky starr and the council .   dr .  gardoma followed  verifying what had occurred on the occasion of the first meeting between urteil and bigman and also describing  for the record  the scene at the banquet table .  he went on to describe his treatment of urteil after the return from the mines .   he said   he recovered quickly from the hypother         mia .  i didn t ask him for details  and he didn t offer any .  however  he asked after bigman  and  from his expression when i said bigman was entirely well  i should judge that his dislike for bigman was as great as ever .  he didn t act as though bigman had saved his life .  just the same  i must say that from my observation of the man i should say urteil was not subject to attacks of gratitude .     that is only an opinion   interposed dr .  peverale hastily   and i recommend that we not confuse the record by such statements .    dr .  cook came next .  he concentrated on the duel .  he said   bigman insisted on the fight .  that s all there was to that .  it seemed to me that if i arranged one under low gravity as bigman suggested  with witnesses  no harm would be done .  we could intervene if things grew serious .  i was afraid that  if i refused  a fight between them might result without witnesses and that there might be serious results .  of course  the results could scarcely be more serious than they have turned out to be  but i never anticipated that .  i ought to have consulted you  dr .  peverale  i admit that .    dr .  peverale nodded .   you certainly ought to have .  but the fact is now that bigman insisted on the duel and insisted on low gravity  didn t he .     that s right .     and he assured you that he would kill urteil under those conditions .     his exact words were that he would  murder the cobber .   i think he was only speaking figuratively .  i m sure he didn t plan actual murder .    dr .  peverale turned to bigman .   have you any comments in that connection .          yes  i do .  and sin ce dr .  cook is on the stand  i want to cross examine .    dr .  peverale looked surprised .   this isn t a trial .     listen   said bigman heatedly .   urteil s death was no accident .  it was murder  and i want a chance to prove that .    the silence that fell at that statement lasted a moment and no more .  it was succeeded by a confused babbling .   bigman s voice rose to a piercing squeal .   i m set to cross examine dr .  hanley cook .    lucky starr said coldly   i suggest you allow bigman to go through with this  dr .  peverale .    the old astronomer was the picture of confusion .    really  i don t  bigman can t   he stam  mered himself into silence .   bigman said   first  dr .  cook  how did urteil come to know the route lucky and i were taking in the mines .    cook reddened .   i didn t know he knew the route .     he didn t follow us directly .  he took a parallel route as though he were intending to catch up and fall behind us well within the mines  after we had convinced ourselves that we were alone and unfollowed .  to do that  he would have to be certain of the route we were planning to take .  now lucky and i planned that route with you and with no one else .  lucky didn t tell urteil and neither did i .  who did .    cook looked wildly about as though for help .   i don t know .     isn t it obvious you did .      no .  maybe he overheard .     he couldn t overhear marks on a map  dr .  cook .          .   .   .  let s pass on  now .  i fought urteil  and if gravity had stayed at mercurian normal  he would still be alive .  but it didn t stay there .  it was suddenly hopped up to earth levels at just the moment where it helped to kill him .  who did that .     i don t know .     you were the first one at urteil s side .  what were you doing .  making sure he was dead .     i resent that .  dr .  peverale   cook turned a  flaming face toward his chief .   dr .  peverale said with agitation   are you accusing dr .  cook of having murdered urteil .    bigman said   look .  the sudden change in gravity pulled me to the ground .  when i got to my feet  everyone else was either getting to their feet  too  or was still on the ground .  when    to     pounds fall on your back without warning  you don t get to your feet in a hurry .  but cook had .  he was not only on his feet  he had gotten to urteil s side and was bending over him .     what does that prove .   demanded cook .    it proves you didn t go down when the gravity went up  or you couldn t have gotten there in time .  and why didn t you go down when the gravity went up .  because you expected it to go up and were braced for it .  and why did you expect it to go up .  because you tripped the lever .    cook turned to dr .  peverale .   this is persecution .  it s madness .    but dr .  peverale looked at his second in stricken horror .   bigman said   let me reconstruct the business .  cook was working with urteil .  that s the only way       urteil could have learned our route in the mines .  but he was working with urteil out of fear .  maybe urteil was blackmailing him .  anyway  the only way cook could get out from under was to kill urteil .  when i said i could murder the cobber if we fought under low gravity .  i must have put an idea into his head  and when we had the fight he stood there waiting at the lever .  that s all .     wait   cried cook urgently  almost choked   this  is all   this is all     you don t have to go by me   said bigman .   if my theory is right  and i m sure it is  then urteil must have something in writing or on recording or on film that he can hold over cook s head .  otherwise  cook wouldn t have felt trapped to the point of murder .  so search urteil s effects .  you ll find something and that will be it .     i agree with bigman   said lucky .   dr .  peverale said in bewilderment   i suppose it s  the only way of settling the matter  though how    and the air seemed to go out of dr .  hanley cook  leaving him pale  shaken  and helpless .   wait   he said weakly   i ll explain .    and all faces turned toward him .   hanley cook s lean cheeks were bathed in perspiration .  his hands as he raised them  almost in supplication  trembled badly .  he said   urteil came to me shortly after he arrived on mercury .  he said he was investigating the observatory .  he said senator swen son had evidence of inefficiency and waste .  he said it was obvious that dr .  peverale ought to be retired  that he was an old man and incapable of bearing up        under the responsibility .  he said i might make a logical replacement .    dr .  peverale  who listened to this with an air of stunned surprise  cried out .   cook .     i agreed with him   said cook sullenly .    you are too old .  i m running the place anyway while you occupy yourself with your sirius mania .   he turned again to lucky .   urteil said that if i helped him in his investigation he would see to it that i would be the next director .  i believed him  everyone knows senator swenson is a powerful man .    i gave him a great deal of information .  some of it was in writing and signed .  he said he needed it for legal proceedings afterward .    and then   and then he began holding that written information over my head .  it turned out that he was a lot more interested in project light and the council of science .  he wanted me to use my position to become a kind of personal spy for him .  he made it quite plain that he would go to dr .  peverale with evidence of what i had done if i refused .  that would have meant the end of my career  of everything .    i had to spy for him .  i had to give information concerning the route starr and bigman were to take in the mines .  i kept him up to date on everything mindes did .  every time i surrendered a bit more to him i was more helplessly in his power .  and after a while i knew that someday he would break me  no matter how much i helped him .  he was that kind of man .  i began to feel that the only way i could escape was to kill him .  if  only i knew how   then bigman came to me with his plan to fight urteil under low gravity .  he was so confident that he       could toss urteil about .  i thought then i might  the chances would be one in a hundred  maybe one in a thousand  but i thought  what was there to lose .  so i stood at the pseudo grav controls and waited my chance .  it came and urteil died .  it worked perfectly .  i thought it would go down as accident .  even if big man were in trouble  then the council could get him out of it .  no one would be hurt except urteil  and he deserved it a hundred times over .  anyway  that s it .   in the awed silence that followed  dr .  peverale said huskily   under the circumstances  cook  you will of  course consider yourself relieved of all duty and under air       hey  hold it  hold it   cried bigman .   the confession isn t complete yet .  look here  cook  that was the second time you tried to kill urteil  wasn t it .     the second time .   cook s tragic eyes lifted .    what about the gimmicked inso suit .  urteil said for us to watch out for one  so he must have had experience with it .  he made out mindes was doing it  but that urteil was a lying cobber and nothing he says has to be believed .  what i say is that you tried to kill urteil that way  but he caught the suit and forced you to transfer it to our room when we came .  then he warned us about it just to get us thinking he was on our side and make trouble for mindes .  isn t that so .     no   shouted cook .   no .  i had nothing to do with that inso suit .  nothing .     come on   began bigman .   we re not going to  believe     but now lucky starr got to his feet .   it s all right  bigman .  cook had nothing to do with the inso suit .         you can believe him .  the man responsible for the slashed inso suit is the man responsible for the robot .    bigman stared at his tall friend incredulously .   you mean the sirians  lucky .     no sirians   said lucky .   there are no sirians on mercury .  there never have been .        results of the trial  dr .  peverale s deep voice was hoarse with dismay .   no sirians .  do you know what you re saying  starr .     perfectly .   lucky starr moved up to dr .  peverale s desk  sat down on one corner of it  and faced the assemblage .   dr .  peverale will bear me out on that  i m sure  when i ve explained the reasoning .     i ll bear you out .  no fear of that  i assure you   huffed the old astronomer  his face set in an attitude of bitter disapproval .   it is scarcely worth discussing .   .  .  .  by the way  we ll have to place cook under arrest .   he half rose .   lucky urged him gently back into his seat .   it s all right  sir .  bigman will make sure that cook will remain under control .     i won t make any trouble   said the despairing cook in a muffled tone .  bigman pulled his armchair close to cook s nevertheless .   lucky said   think back  dr .  peverale  on the night of the banquet and of your own words concerning the sirian robots .   .  .  .  by the way  dr .  peverale  you ve known for a long time there was a robot on the planet  haven t you .    the astronomer said uneasily   what do you mean .     dr .  mindes came to you with stories of having            sighted moving manlike figures in what seemed like metal space suits who also seemed to endure solar radiation better than one would expect humans to .     i certainly did   interposed mindes   and i should have known i was seeing a robot .     you didn t have the experience with robots that dr .  peverale did   said lucky .  he turned to the old astronomer again .   i m sure that you suspected the existence of sirian designed robots on the planet as soon as mindes reported what he had seen .  his description fit them perfectly .    the astronomer nodded slowly .    i  myself   lucky went on   did not suspect robots when mindes told me his story any more than he himself did .  after the banquet  however  when  dr .  peverale  you discussed sirius and its robots  the thought occurred to me very forcefully that here was the explanation .  you must have thought so too .    dr .  peverale nodded slowly again .  he said   i realized that we ourselves could do nothing against a sirian incursion .  that is why i discouraged mindes .     mindes turned pale at this point and muttered savagely to himself .    lucky said   you never reported to the council of science .    dr .  peverale hesitated .   i was afraid they wouldn t believe me and that i would only succeed in getting myself replaced .  frankly  i didn t know what to do .  it was obvious that i could make no use of urteil .  he was interested only in his own plans .  when you came  starr   his voice grew deeper  more flowing   i felt i might have an ally at last  and for the first time i felt able to talk about sirius  its dangers  and its robots .           yes   said lucky   and do you remember how you described the sirian affection for their robots .  you used the word  love .   you said the sirians pampered their robots  they loved them  nothing was too good for them .  you said they would regard a robot as worth a hundred earthmen .     of course   said dr .  peverale .   that s true .     then if they loved their robots so much  would they send one of them to mercury  uninsulated  un adapted to solar radiation .  would they condemn one of their robots to a slow  torturing death by the sun .    dr .  peverale fell silent  his lower lip trembling .   lucky said   i  myself  could scarcely think of blasting the robot even though it endangered my life  and i am no sirian .  could a sirian have been so cruel to a robot  then .     the importance of the mission   began dr .   peverale .    granted   said lucky .   i don t say a sirian wouldn t send a robot to mercury for purposes of sabotage  but  great galaxy  they would have insulated its brain first .  even leaving their love for robots out of account  it s only good sense .  they could get more service out of it .    there was a murmur of approval and agreement from the assemblage .    but   stammered dr .  peverale   if not the sirians  then who     well   said lucky   let s see what leads we have .  number one .  twice mindes spotted the robot  and twice it vanished when mindes tried to draw close .  the robot later informed me that it had been instructed to avoid people .  obviously  it had been warned that       mindes was out searching for the saboteur .  obviously  too  it must have been warned by someone inside the dome .  it wasn t warned against me  because i announced that i was going into the mines .    lead number two .  as the robot lay dying  i asked once more who had given it its instructions .  it could  only say   er   er   then its radio blanked out   but its mouth moved as though it were making two syllables .    bigman shouted suddenly  his pale red hair stand  ing on end with passion   urteil .  the robot was trying  to say urteil .  that filthy cobber was the saboteur all  the time .  it fits in .  it fits     maybe   said lucky   maybe .  we ll see .  it struck me as a possibility that the robot was trying to say   earthman .      and maybe   said peverale dryly   it was only a vague sound made by a dying robot and it meant nothing at all .     maybe   agreed lucky .   but now we come to lead number three and it is instantly conclusive .  that is this  the robot was of sirian manufacture  and what human here at the dome could possibly have had a chance to gain possession of a sirian robot .  have any of us been on the sirian planets .    dr .  peverale s eyes narrowed .   i have .     exactly   said lucky starr   and no one else .  that s your answer .    mad confusion followed and lucky called for silence .  his voice was authoritative and his face stern .   as a councilman of science   he said   i declare this observatory to be in my charge from this moment on .  dr .  peverale is replaced as director .  i have been in        communication with council headquarters on earth  and a ship is on its way now .  appropriate action will be taken .     i demand to be heard   cried dr .  peverale .    you will be   said lucky   but first listen to the case against you .  you are the only man here who had the opportunity to steal a sirian robot .  dr .  cook told us that you were awarded a robot for personal service during your stay on sirius .  is that correct .     yes  but     you directed him into your own ship when you were through with him .  somehow you managed to evade the sirians .  probably they never dreamed anyone could commit so horrible a crime  to them  as robot stealing .  they took no precautions against it for that reason  perhaps .    what s more  it makes sense to suppose the robot was trying to say   earthman  when i asked him who had given it instructions .  you were the one earthman on sirius .  you would be spoken of as  earthman  when the robot was first placed in your service  probably .  it would think of you as  earthman .     finally  who would know better when anyone might be exploring the sun side .  who would better inform the robot by radio when it might be safe and when it ought to go into hiding .     i deny everything   said dr .  peverale tightly .    there s no point in denying it   said lucky .   if you insist on your innocence  the council will have to send to sirius for information .  the robot gave me its serial number as rl     .  if the sirian authorities say that the robot assigned to you during your stay on skius       was rl     and that it disappeared about the time you left sirius  that will condemn you .    furthermore  your crime of robot stealing was committed on sirius  and because we have an extradi   tion treaty with the sirian planets we may be forced to release you into their custody .  i would advise you  dr .  peverale  to confess and let earth s justice take its course  rather than to maintain innocence and risk what sirius might do for your crime of having stolen one of their beloved robots and tortured it to death .    dr .  peverale stared pitifully at the assemblage with unseeing eyes .  slowly  joint by joint  he collapsed and dropped to the floor .   dr .  gardoma rushed to his side and felt for his heart .   he s alive   he said   but i think he d better be moved to bed .    two hours later  with dr .  gardoma and lucky starr at his bedside and with council headquarters in sub etheric contact  dr .  lance peverale dictated his confession .   with mercury falling rapidly behind and the sure knowledge that council emissaries now had the situation in hand  relieving him of any feeling of responsibility  lucky still felt tension .  his expression was brooding and thoughtful .   bigman  face puckered anxiously  said   what s the matter  lucky .     i m sorry for old peverale   said lucky .   he meant well in his way .  the sirians are a danger  if not quite as immediate as he thought .     the council wouldn t have turned him over to sirius  would it .           probably not  but his fears of sirius were sufficiently great to force his confession .  it was a cruel trick  but necessary .  however patriotic his motives  he had been forced into attempted murder .  cook  too  was goaded into his crime  yet it was none the less a crime  however little we think of urteil .    bigman said   what did the old guy have against project light anyway  lucky .     peverale made that clear at the banquet   said lucky grimly .   everything was made clear that night .  you remember  he complained that earth was weakening itself by depending on imported food and resources .  he said project light would make earth dependent on space stations for the very manner in which it got its sunlight .  he wanted earth to be self sufficient so that it could better resist the sirian danger .    in his slightly unbalanced mind  he must have thought he would help that self sufficiency along by trying to sabotage project light .  perhaps he originally brought back the robot just as a dramatic demonstration of sirian power .  finding project light in progress when he returned  he turned the robot into a saboteur instead .    when urteil arrived he must have been afraid at first that urteil was going to investigate the project light affair and expose him .  so he planted a slashed inso suit in urteil s room  but urteil spotted it .  maybe urteil really believed mindes had been responsible .    bigman said   sure  come to think of it .  the first time we met the old guy he wouldn t even talk about urteil  he was so mad about him .     exactly   said lucky   and there was no obvious reason why that should be  as in mindes s case  for       instance .  i thought there might be some reason i knew nothing about .     is that what put you on to him first  lucky .    no  it was something else .  it was the slashed inso suit in our own room .  the man with the best opportunity to do that was obviously peverale himself .  he also would be in the best position to dispose of the suit after it had killed its man .  he best knew our assigned room  and he could assign an inso suit too .  what bothered me  though  was the motive .  why should he want to kill me .    my name apparently meant nothing to mm .  he asked if i were a sub temporal engineer like mindes the first time we met .  now mindes had recognized my name and tried to get me to help him .  dr .  gardoma had heard of me in connection with the poisonings on mars .  urteil knew all about me  of course .  i wondered if dr .  peverale might not have heard of me too .    there was ceres  for instance  where you and i stayed a while during the battle against the pirates .  the largest observatory in the system is there .  might not dr .  peverale have been there then .  i asked him that  and he denied having met me there .  he admitted that he visited ceres  and cook later told us the old man visited ceres frequently .  peverale went on to explain  without any prompting from me  that he had been sick in bed during the pirate raid  and cook later backed that statement .  that was the giveaway .  in his anxiety  peverale had talked too much .   the little martian stared .   i don t get that .    it s simple .  if peverale had been on ceres a number of times  how was it he felt it necessary to alibi that particular time when the pirates had attacked .         why that time and not another .  obviously  he knew on which occasion i had been on ceres and was trying to alibi that one .  obviously  again  he knew who i was .    if he knew me  why should he try to kill me  and urteil too .  both of us suffered from slashed inso suits  you know .  we were both investigators .  what was it peverale feared .    then he began to talk about sirians and robots at the banquet table  and things began to drop into place .  mindes s story suddenly made sense  and i knew at once that the only ones who could have brought a robot to mercury were either sirians or dr .  peverale .  to me it seemed that peverale was the answer  that he was talking about sirians now as a kind of insurance .  if the robot were found and the sabotage stopped  it would serve as a smoke screen to hide his own part and  furthermore  it would make good anti sirian propaganda .    i needed proof .  otherwise  senator swenson would shout we were setting up a smoke screen to cover the council s own incompetence and extravagance .  i needed good proof .  with urteil right on the ground  i dared not talk about the matter to anyone  bigman  not even to you .    bigman groaned in disgust .   when are you going to trust me  lucky .     when i can count on you to avoid tricks like rough and tumbles with men twice your size   said lucky with a smile that robbed the statement of some of its sting .   anyway  i set out to capture the robot on the sun side and use him as evidence .  that failed and i was forced to work a confession out of peverale .    lucky shook his head .        bigman said   what about swenson now .     it s a draw  i think   said lucky .   he can t do much with urteil s death  since we can use dr .  cook as a witness to show some of urteil s dirty tactics .  we can t do much against him  either  since the two top men at the mercurian observatory have had to be relieved of duty for felonies .  it s a standoff .     sands of mars .   moaned bigman   we ll have that cobber on our necks later on then .    but lucky shook his head .   no  senator swenson is not a real cause for worry .  he s ruthless and dangerous  but for that very reason he keeps the council on its toes  keeps us from getting flabby .    besides   he added thoughtfully   the council of science needs its critics  just as congress and the government do .  if ever the council began to consider itself above criticism  then the time might come when it would establish a dictatorship over the earth  and certainly i wouldn t want that to happen .     well  maybe   said bigman  unsatisfied   but i don t like that swenson .    lucky laughed and reached out to tousle the martian s hair .   nor i  but why worry about that now .  out there are the stars  and who knows where we ll be going next week  or why .    about the author  isaac asimov was born in the soviet union to his great surprise .  he moved quickly to correct the situation .  when his parents emigrated to the united states  isaac  three years old at the time  stowed away in their baggage .  he has been an american citizen since the age of eight .   brought up in brooklyn  and educated in its public schools  he eventually found his way to columbia university and  over the protests of the school administration  managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry  up to and including a ph . d .  he then infiltrated boston university and climbed the academic ladder  ignoring all cries of outrage  until he found himself professor of biochemistry .   meanwhile  at the age of nine  he found the love of his life  in the inanimate sense  when he discovered his first science fiction magazine .  by the time he was eleven  he began to write stories  and at eighteen  he actually worked up the nerve to submit one .  it was rejected .  after four long months of tribulation and suffering  he sold his first story and  thereafter  he never looked back .   in       when he was twenty one years old  he wrote the classic short story  nightfall  and his future was assured .  shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories  and shortly after that he had begun his foundation series .   what was left except quantity .  at the present time  he has published over     books  distributed through every major division of the dewey system of library classification  and shows no signs of slowing up .  he remains as youthful  as lively  and as lovable as ever  and grows more handsome with each year .  you can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious .   he is married to janet jeppson  psychiatrist and writer  has two children by a previous marriage  and lives in new york city .
