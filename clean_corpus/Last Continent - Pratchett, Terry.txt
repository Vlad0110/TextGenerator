terry pratchett      the last continent    a novel of discworld        contents      begin reading      about the author      praise      other books by terry pratchett      copyright      about the publisher      discworld is a world and a mirror of worlds .  this is not a book about australia .  no  it   s about somewhere entirely different which happens to be  here and there  a bit   australian .  still   no worries  right .       begin reading   against the stars a turtle passes  carrying four elephants on its shell .   both turtle and elephants are bigger than people might expect  but out between the stars the difference between huge and tiny is  comparatively speaking  very small .   but this turtle and these elephants are  by turtle and elephant standards  big .  they carry the discworld  with its vast lands  cloudscapes  and oceans .   people don   t live on the disc any more than  in less hand crafted parts of the multiverse  they live on balls .  oh  planets may be the place where their body eats its tea  but they live elsewhere  in worlds of their own which orbit very handily around the center of their heads .   when gods get together they tell the story of one particular planet whose inhabitants watched  with mild interest  huge continent wrecking slabs of ice slap into another world which was  in astronomical terms  right next door   and then did nothing about it because that sort of thing only happens in outer space .  an intelligent species would at least have found someone to complain to .  anyway  no one seriously believes in that story  because a race quite that stupid would never even have discovered slood .    people believe in all sorts of other things  though .  for example  there are some people who have a legend that the whole universe is carried in a leather bag by an old man .   they   re right  too .   other people say  hold on  if he   s carrying the entire universe in a sack  right  that means he   s carrying himself and the sack inside the sack  because the universe contains everything .  including him .  and the sack  of course .  which contains him and the sack already .  as it were .   to which the reply is  well .   all tribal myths are true  for a given value of    true .         it is a general test of the omnipotence of a god that they can see the fall of a tiny bird .  but only one god makes notes  and a few adjustments  so that next time it can fall faster and further .   we may find out why .   we might find out why mankind is here  although that is more complicated and begs the question    where else should we be .     it would be terrible to think that some impatient deity might part the clouds and say     damn  are you lot still here .  i thought you discovered slood ten thousand years ago .  i   ve got ten trillion tons of ice arriving on monday .      we may even find out why the duck billed platypus .       snow  thick and wet  tumbled on to the lawns and roofs of unseen university  the discworld   s premier college of magic .   it was sticky snow  which made the place look like some sort of expensive yet tasteless ornament  and it caked around the boots of mcabre  the head bledlow  as he trudged through the cold  wild night .   two other bledlows    stepped out of the lee of a buttress and fell in behind him on a solemn march towards the main gates .   it was an old custom  centuries old  and in the summer a few tourists would hang around to watch it  but the ceremony of the keys went on every night in every season .  mere ice  wind and snow had never stopped it .  bledlows in times gone past had clambered over tentacled monstrosities to do the ceremony  they   d waded through floodwater  flailed with their bowler hats at errant pigeons  harpies and dragons  and ignored mere faculty members who   d thrown open their bedroom windows and screamed imprecations on the lines of    stop that damn racket  will you .  what   s the point .     they   d never stopped  or even thought of stopping .  you couldn   t stop tradition .  you could only add to it .   the three men reached the shadows by the main gate  almost blotted out in the whirling snow .  the bledlow on duty was waiting for them .      halt .  who goes there .     he shouted .   mcabre saluted .     the archchancellor   s keys .         pass  the archchancellor   s keys .      the head bledlow took a step forward  extended both arms in front of him with his palms bent back towards him  and patted his chest at the place where some bledlow long buried had once had two breast pockets .  pat  pat .  then he extended his arms by his sides and stiffly patted the sides of his jacket .  pat  pat .      damn .  could have sworn i had them a moment ago .     he bellowed  enunciating each word with a sort of bulldog carefulness .   the gatekeeper saluted .  mcabre saluted .      have you looked in all your pockets .      mcabre saluted .  the gatekeeper saluted .  a small pyramid of snow was building up on his bowler hat .      i think i must have left them on the dresser .  it   s always the same  isn   t it .         you should remember where you put them down .         hang on  perhaps they   re in my other jacket .      the young bledlow who was this week   s keeper of the other jacket stepped forward .  each man saluted the other two .  the youngest cleared his throat and managed to say      no  i looked in   there this   morning .      mcabre gave him a slight nod to acknowledge a difficult job done well  and patted his pockets again .      hold on  stone the crows  they were in this pocket after all .  what a muggins i am .         don   t worry  i do the same myself .         is my face red .  forget my own head next .      somewhere in the darkness a window creaked up .      er  excuse me  gentlemen           here   s the keys  then .     said mcabre  raising his voice .      much obliged .         i wonder if you could       the querulous voice went on  apologizing for even thinking of complaining .      all safe and secure .     shouted the gatekeeper  handing the keys back .         perhaps keep it down a little           gods bless all present .     screamed mcabre  veins standing out on his thick crimson neck .      careful where you put them this time .  ha .  ha .  ha .         ho .  ho .  ho .     yelled mcabre  beside himself with fury .  he saluted stiffly  went about turn with an unnecessarily large amount of foot stamping and  the ancient exchange completed  marched back to the bledlows    lodge muttering under his breath .  the window of the university   s little sanatorium shut again .      that man really makes me want to swear     said the bursar .  he fumbled in his pocket and produced his little green box of dried frog pills  spilling a few as he fumbled with the lid .     i   ve sent him no end of memos .  he says it   s traditional but  i don   t know  he   s so   boisterous about it       he blew his nose .     how   s he doing .         not good     said the dean .   the librarian was very  very ill .   snow plastered itself against the closed window .   there was a heap of blankets in front of the roaring fire .  occasionally it shuddered a bit .  the wizards watched it with concern .   the lecturer in recent runes was feverishly turning over the pages of a book .      i mean  how do we know if it   s old age or not .     he said .     what   s old age for an orangutan .  and he   s a wizard .  and he spends all his time in the library .  all that magic radiation the whole time .  somehow the flu is attacking his morphic field  but it could be caused by anything .      the librarian sneezed .   and changed shape .   the wizards looked sadly at what appeared very much like a comfortable armchair which someone had  for some reason  upholstered in red fur .      what can we do for him .     said ponder stibbons  the faculty   s youngest member .      he might feel happier with some cushions     said ridcully .      slightly bad taste  archchancellor  i feel .         what .  everyone likes some comfy cushions when they   re feeling a little under the weather  don   t they .     said the man to whom sickness was a mystery .      he was a table this morning .  mahogany  i believe .  he seems to be able to retain his color  at least .      the lecturer in recent runes closed the book with a sigh .     he   s certainly lost control of his morphic function     he said .     it   s not surprising  i suppose .  once it   s been changed  it   ll change again much more easily  i   m afraid .  a well known fact .      he looked at the archchancellor   s frozen grin and sighed .  mustrum ridcully was notorious for not trying to understand things if there was anyone around to do it for him .      it   s quite hard to change the shape of a living thing but once it   s been done it   s a lot easier to do it next time     he translated .      say again .         he was a human before he was an ape  arch chancellor .  remember .         oh .  yes     said ridcully .     funny  really  the way you get used to things .  apes and humans are related  accordin    to young ponder here .      the other wizards looked blank .  ponder screwed up his face .      he   s been showing me some of the invisible writings     said ridcully .     fascinatin    stuff .      the other wizards scowled at ponder stibbons  as you would at a man who   d been caught smoking in a fireworks factory .  so now they knew who to blame .  as usual        is that entirely wise  sir .     said the dean .      well  i do happen to be the archchancellor in these parts  dean     said ridcully calmly .      a blindly obvious fact  archchancellor     said the dean .  you could have cut cheese with his tone .      must take an interest .  morale  you know     said ridcully .     my door is always open .  i see myself as a member of the team .     ponder winced again .      i don   t think i   m related to any apes     said the senior wrangler thoughtfully .     i mean  i   d know  wouldn   t i .  i   d get invited to their weddings and so on .  my parents would have said something like     don   t worry about uncle charlie  he   s supposed to smell like that     wouldn   t they .  and there   d be portraits in        the chair sneezed .  there was an unpleasant moment of morphic uncertainty  and then the librarian was sprawling in his old shape again .  the wizards watched him carefully to see what   d happen next .   it was hard to remember the time when the librarian had been a human being .  certainly no one could remember what he   d looked like  or even what his name had been .   a magical explosion  always a possibility in somewhere like the library where so many unstable books of magic are pressed dangerously together  had introduced him to unexpected apehood years before .  since then he   d never looked back  and often hadn   t looked down either .  his big hairy shape  swinging by one arm from a top shelf while he rearranged books with his feet  had become a popular one among the whole university body  his devotion to duty had been an example to everyone .   archchancellor ridcully  into whose head that last sentence had treacherously arranged itself  realized that he was unconsciously drafting an obituary .      anyone called in a doctor .     he said .      we got doughnut jimmy  here this afternoon     said the dean .     he tried to take his temperature but i   m afraid the librarian bit him .         he bit him .  with a thermometer in his mouth .         ah .  not exactly .  there  in fact  you have rather discovered the reason for his biting .      there was a moment of solemn silence .  the senior wrangler picked up a limp black leather paw and patted it vaguely .      does that book say if monkeys have pulses .     he said .     is his nose supposed to be cold  or what .      there was a little sound  such as might be made by half a dozen people all sharply drawing in their breath at once .  the other wizards began to edge away from their senior wrangler .   there was  for a few seconds  no other sound but the crackling of the fire and the howl of the wind outside .   the wizards shuffled back .   the senior wrangler  in the astonished tones of someone still possessing all known limbs  very slowly took off his pointy hat .  this was something a wizard would normally do only in the most somber of circumstances .      well  that   s it  then     he said .     poor chap   s on his way home .  back to the big desert in the sky .         er  rainforest  possibly     said ponder stibbons .      maybe mrs .  whitlow could make him some hot nourishing soup .     said the lecturer in recent runes .   archchancellor ridcully thought about the housekeeper   s hot nourishing soup .     kill or cure  i suppose     he murmured .  he patted the librarian carefully .     buck up  old chap     he said .     soon have you back on your feet and continuing to make a valued contribution .         knuckles     said the dean helpfully .      say again .         knuckles  rather than feet .         castors     said the lecturer in recent runes .      bad taste  that man     said the archchancellor .   they wandered out of the room .  from the corridor came their retreating voices      looked very pale around the antimacassar  i thought .         surely there   s some sort of a cure .         the old place won   t be the same without him .         definitely one of a kind .      when they   d gone the librarian reached up cautiously  pulled a piece of blanket over his head  cuddled his hot water bottle and sneezed .   now there were two hot water bottles  one of them a lot bigger than the other and with a teddy bear cover in red fur .      light travels slowly on the disc and is slightly heavy  with a tendency to pile up against high mountain ranges .  research wizards have speculated that there is another  much speedier type of light which allows the slower light to be seen  but since this moves too fast to see they have been unable to find a use for it .   this does mean that  despite the disc being flat  everywhere does not experience the same time at  for want of a better term  the same time .  when it was so late at night in ankh morpork that it was early in the morning  elsewhere it was        but there were no hours here .  there was dawn and dusk  morning and afternoon  and presumably there was midnight and midday  but mainly there was heat .  and redness .  something as artificial and human as an hour wouldn   t last five minutes here .  it would be dried out and shriveled up in seconds .   above all  there was silence .  it was not the chilly  bleak silence of endless space  but the burning organic silence you get when  across a thousand miles of shimmering red horizons  everything is too tired to make a sound .   but  as the ear of observation panned across the desert  it picked up something like a chant  a reedy little litany that beat against the all embracing silence like a fly bumping against the windowpane of the universe .   the rather breathless chanter was lost to view because he was standing in a hole dug in the red earth  occasionally some earth was thrown up on the heap behind him .  a stained and battered pointy hat bobbed about in time with the tuneless tune .  the word    wizzard    had  perhaps  once been embroidered on it in sequins .  they had fallen off  but the word was still there in brighter red where the hat   s original color showed through .  several dozen small flies orbited it .   the words went something like this      grubs .  that   s what we   re going to eat .  that   s why they call it grub .  and what   re we doing to get the grub .  why  we   re grubbing for it .  hooray .     another shovelful of earth arced on to the heap  and the voice said  rather more quietly     i wonder if you can eat flies .      they say the heat and the flies here can drive a man insane .  but you don   t have to believe that  and nor does that bright mauve elephant that just cycled past .   strangely enough  the madman in the hole was the only person currently on the continent who might throw any kind of light on a small drama being enacted a thousand miles away and several meters below  where the opal miner known only to his mates as strewth was about to make the most valuable yet dangerous discovery of his career .   strewth   s pick knocked aside the rock and dust of millennia  and something gleamed in the candlelight .   it was green  like frosty green fire .   carefully  his mind suddenly as frozen as the light under his fingers  he picked away at the loose rock .  the opal picked up and reflected more and more light on to his face as the debris fell away .  there seemed to be no end to the glow .   finally  he let his breath out in one go .      strewth .      if he   d found a little piece of green opal  say about the size of a bean  he   d have called his mates over and they   d have knocked off for a few beers .  a piece the size of his fist would have had him pounding the floor .  but with this   he was still standing there  brushing it gently with his fingers  when the other miners noticed the light and hurried over .   at least   they started out hurrying .  as they came closer  they slowed to a kind of reverential walk .   no one said anything for a moment .  the green light shone on their faces .   then one of the men whispered     good on yer  strewth .         there isn   t enough money in all the world  mate .         watch out  it might just be a glaze           still worth a mint .  go on  strewth   get it out .      they watched like cats as the pick pried loose more and more rock  and found an edge .  and another edge .   now strewth   s fingers began to shake .      careful  mate   there   s a side of it        the men took a step back as the last of the obscuring earth was knocked away .  the thing was oblong  although the bottom edge was a confusion of twisted opal and dirt .   strewth reversed his pick and laid the wooden handle against the glowing crystal .      strewth  it   s no good     he said .     i just gots to know        he tapped the rock .   it echoed .      can   t be hollow  can it .     said one of the miners .     never heard of that .      strewth picked up a crowbar .     right .  let   s        there was a faint plink .  a large piece of opal broke away near the bottom .  it turned out to be no thicker than a plate .   it revealed a couple of toes  which moved very slowly inside their iridescent shell .      oh  strewth     said a miner  as they backed further away .     it   s alive .         ponder knew he should never have let ridcully look at the invisible writings .  wasn   t it a basic principle never to let your employer know what it is you actually do all day .   but no matter what precautions you took  sooner or later the boss was bound to come in and poke around and say things like     is this where you work  then .     and    i thought i sent a memo out about people bringing in potted plants     and    what d   you call that thing with the keyboard .      and this had been particularly problematical for ponder  because reading the invisible writings was a delicate and meticulous job  suited to the kind of temperament that follows grand prix continental drift and keeps bonsai mountains as a hobby or even drives a volvo .  it needed painstaking care .  it needed a mind that could enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles in a dark room .  it did not need mustrum ridcully .   the hypothesis behind invisible writings was laughably complicated .  all books are tenuously connected through l space and  therefore  the content of any book ever written or yet to be written may  in the right circumstances  be deduced from a sufficiently close study of books already in existence .  future books exist in potentia  as it were  in the same way that a sufficiently detailed study of a handful of primal ooze will eventually hint at the future existence of prawn crackers .   but the primitive techniques used hitherto  based on ancient spells like weezencake   s unreliable algorithm  had meant that it took years to put together even the ghost of a page of an unwritten book .   it was ponder   s particular genius that he had found a way around this by considering the phrase     how do you know it   s not possible until you   ve tried .     and experiments with hex  the university   s thinking engine  had found that  indeed  many things are not impossible until they have been tried .   like a busy government which only passes expensive laws prohibiting some new and interesting thing when people have actually found a way of doing it  the universe relied a great deal on things not being tried at all .   when something is tried  ponder found  it often does turn out to be impossible very quickly  but it takes a little while for this to really be the case    in effect  for the overworked laws of causality to hurry to the scene and pretend it has been impossible all along .  using hex to remake the attempt in minutely different ways at very high speed had resulted in a high success rate  and he was now assembling whole paragraphs in a matter of hours .      it   s like a conjurin    trick  then     ridcully had said .     you   re pullin    the tablecloth away before all the crockery has time to remember to fall over .      and ponder had winced and said     yes  exactly like that  archchancellor .  well done .      and that had led to all the trouble with how to dynamically manage people for dynamic results in a caring empowering way in quite a short time dynamically .  ponder didn   t know when this book would be written  or even in which world it might be published  but it was obviously going to be popular because random trawls in the depths of l space often turned up fragments .  perhaps it wasn   t even just one book .   and the fragments had been on ponder   s desk when ridcully had been poking around .   unfortunately  like many people who are instinctively bad at something  the archchancellor prided himself on how good at it he was .  ridcully was to management what king herod was to the bethlehem playgroup association .   his mental approach to it could be visualized as a sort of business flowchart with  at the top  a circle entitled    me  who does the telling    and  connected below it by a line  a large circle entitled    everyone else .      until now this had worked quite well  because  although ridcully was an impossible manager  the university was impossible to manage and so everything worked seamlessly .   and it would have continued to do so if he hadn   t suddenly started to see the point in preparing career development packages and  worst of all  job descriptions .   as the lecturer in recent runes put it     he called me in and asked me what i did  exactly .  have you ever heard of such a thing .  what sort of question is that .  this is a university .         he asked me whether i had any personal worries     said the senior wrangler .     i don   t see why i have to stand for that sort of thing .         and did you see that sign on his desk .     the dean had said .      you mean the one that says     the buck starts here    .         no  the other one .  the one which says     when you   re up to your ass in alligators  today is the first day of the rest of your life .            and that means    .         i don   t think it   s supposed to mean anything .  i think it   s just supposed to be .         be what .         pro active  i think .  it   s a word he   s using a lot .         what does that mean .         well   in favor of activity  i suppose .         really .  dangerous .  in my experience  inactivity sees you through .      altogether  it was not a happy university at the moment  and mealtimes were the worst .  ponder tended to be isolated at one end of the high table as the unwilling architect of this sudden tendency on the part of the archchancellor to try to weld them into a lean mean team .  the wizards had no intention of being lean  but were getting as mean as anything .   on top of that  ridcully   s sudden interest in taking an interest meant that ponder had to explain something about his own current project  and one aspect of ridcully that had not changed was his horrible habit of  ponder suspected  deliberately misunderstanding things .   ponder had long been struck by the fact that the librarian  an ape   at least generally an ape  although this evening he seemed to have settled on being a small table set with a red furred tea service   was  well  so human shaped .  in fact  so many things were pretty much the same shape .  nearly everything you met was really a sort of complicated tube with two eyes and four arms or legs or wings .  oh  or they were fish .  or insects .  all right  spiders as well .  and a few odd things like starfish and whelks .  but still there was a remarkably unimaginative range of designs .  where were the six armed  six eyed monkeys pinwheeling through the jungle canopy .   oh  yes  octopussies too  but that was the point  they were really only a kind of underwater spider     ponder had poked around among the university   s more or less abandoned museum of quite unusual things  and noticed something rather odd .  whoever had designed the skeletons of creatures had even less imagination than whoever had done the outsides .  at least the outside designer had tried a few novelties in the spots  wool and stripes department  but the bone builder had generally just put a skull on a ribcage  shoved a pelvis in further along  stuck on some arms and legs and had the rest of the day off .  some ribcages were longer  some legs were shorter  some hands became wings  but they all seemed to be based on one design  one size stretched or shrunk to fit all .   not to his very great surprise  ponder seemed to be the only one around who found this at all interesting .  he   d point out to people that fish were amazingly fish shaped  and they   d look at him as if he   d gone mad .   paleontology and archaeology and other skulduggery were not subjects that interested wizards .  things are buried for a reason  they considered .  there   s no point in wondering what it was .  don   t go digging things up in case they won   t let you bury them again .   the most coherent theory was one he recalled from his nurse when he was small .  monkeys  she   d averred  were bad little boys who hadn   t come in when called  and seals were bad little boys who   d lazed around on the beach instead of attending to their lessons .  she hadn   t said that birds were bad little boys who   d gone too close to the cliff edge  and in any case jellyfish would be more likely  but ponder couldn   t help thinking that  harmlessly insane though the woman had been  she might have had just the glimmerings of a point     he was spending most nights now watching hex trawl the invisible writings for any hints .  in theory  because of the nature of l space  absolutely everything was available to him  but that only meant that it was more or less impossible to find whatever it was you were looking for  which is the purpose of computers .   ponder stibbons was one of those unfortunate people cursed with the belief that if only he found out enough things about the universe it would all  somehow  make sense .  the goal is the theory of everything  but ponder would settle for the theory of something and  late at night  when hex appeared to be sulking  he despaired of even a theory of anything .   and it might have surprised ponder to learn that the senior wizards had come to approve of hex  despite all the comments on the lines of    in my day we used to do our own thinking .     wizardry was traditionally competitive  and  while uu was currently going through an extended period of peace and quiet  with none of the informal murders that had once made it such a terminally exciting place  a senior wizard always distrusted a young man who was going places since traditionally his route might be via your jugular .   therefore there   s something comforting in knowing that some of the best brains in the university  who a generation ago would be coming up with some really exciting plans involving trick floorboards and exploding wallpaper  were spending all night in the high energy magic building  trying to teach hex to sing    lydia the tattooed lady     exulting at getting a machine to do after six hours    work something that any human off the street would do for tuppence  then sending out for banana and sushi pizza and falling asleep at the keyboard .  their seniors called it technomancy  and slept a little easier in their beds in the knowledge that ponder and his students weren   t sleeping in theirs .   ponder must have nodded off  because he was awakened just before two a . m .  by a scream and realized he was face down in half of his supper .  he pulled a piece of banana flavored mackerel off his cheek  left hex quietly clicking through its routine and followed the noises .   the commotion led him to the hall in front of the big doors leading to the library .  the bursar was lying on the floor  being fanned with the senior wrangler   s hat .      as far as we can gather  archchancellor     said the dean     the poor chap couldn   t sleep and came down for a book        ponder looked at the library doors .  a big strip of black and yellow tape had been stuck across them  along with a sign saying  danger  do wotte enter in any circumstances .  it was now hanging off  and the doors were ajar .  this was no surprise .  any true wizard  faced with a sign like    do not open this door .  really .  we mean it .  we   re not kidding .  opening this door will mean the end of the universe     would automatically open the door in order to see what all the fuss was about .  this made signs rather a waste of time  but at least it meant that when you handed what was left of the wizard to his grieving relatives you could say  as they grasped the jar     we told him not to .      there was silence from the darkness on the other side of the doorway .   ridcully extended a finger and pushed one door slightly .   behind it something made a fluttering noise and the doors were slammed shut .  the wizards jumped back .      don   t risk it  archchancellor .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     i tried to go in earlier and the whole section of critical essays had gone critical .      blue light flickered under the doors .   elsewhere  someone might have said     it   s just books .  books aren   t dangerous .     but even ordinary books are dangerous  and not only the ones like make gelignite the professional way .  a man sits in some museum somewhere and writes a harmless book about political economy and suddenly thousands of people who haven   t even read it are dying because the ones who did haven   t got the joke .  knowledge is dangerous  which is why governments often clamp down on people who can think thoughts above a certain caliber .   and the unseen university library was a magical library  built on a very thin patch of space time .  there were books on distant shelves that hadn   t been written yet  books that never would be written .  at least  not here .  it had a circumference of a few hundred yards  but there was no known limit to its radius .   and in a magical library the books leak  and learn from one another        they   ve started attacking anyone who goes in     moaned the dean .     no one can control them when the librarian   s not here .         but we   re a university .  we have to have a library .     said ridcully .     it adds tone .  what sort of people would we be if we didn   t go into the library .         students     said the senior wrangler morosely .      hah  i remember when i was a student     said the lecturer in recent runes .     old    bogeyboy    swallett took us on an expedition to find the lost reading room .  three weeks we were wandering around .  had to eat our own boots .         did you find it .     said the dean .      no  but we found the remains of the previous year   s expedition .         what did you do .         we ate their boots  too .      from beyond the door came a flapping  as of leather covers .      there   s some pretty vicious grimoires in there     said the senior wrangler .     they can take a man   s arm right off .         yes  but at least they don   t know about door handles     said the dean .      they do if there   s a book in there somewhere called doorknobs for beginners     said the senior wrangler .     they read each other .      the archchancellor glanced at ponder .     there likely to be a book like that in there  stibbons .         according to l space theory  it   s practically certain  sir .      as one man  the wizards backed away from the doors .      we can   t let this nonsense go on     said ridcully .     we   ve got to cure the librarian .  it   s a magical illness  so we ought to be able to cook up a magical cure  oughtn   t we .         that would be exceedingly dangerous  archchancellor     said the dean .     his whole system is a mess of conflicting magical influences .  there   s no knowing what adding more magic would do .  he   s already got a freewheeling temporal gland .   any more magic and   well  i don   t know what   ll happen .         we   ll find out     said ridcully brusquely .     we need to be able to go into the library .  we   d be doing this for the college  dean .  and unseen university is bigger than one man              ape              thank you  ape  and we must always remember that    i    is the smallest letter in the alphabet .      there was another thud from beyond the doors .      actually     said the senior wrangler     i think you   ll find that  depending on the font     c    or even    u    are  in fact  even smaller .  well  shorter  anyw           of course     ridcully went on  ignoring this as part of the university   s usual background logic     i suppose i could appoint another librarian   got to be a senior chap who knows his way around   hmm   now let me see  do any names spring to mind .  dean .         all right  all right .     said the dean .     have it your own way .  as usual .         er   we can   t do it  sir     ponder ventured .      oh .     said ridcully .     volunteering for a bit of bookshelf tidying yourself  are you .         i mean we really can   t use magic to change him  sir .  there   s a huge problem in the way .         there are no problems  mister stibbons  there are only opportunities .         yes  sir .  and the opportunity here is to find out the librarian   s name .      there was a buzz of agreement from the other wizards .      the lad   s right     said the lecturer in recent runes .     can   t magic a wizard without knowing his name .  basic rule .         well  we call him the librarian     said ridcully .     everyone calls him the librarian .  won   t that do .         that   s just a job description  sir .      ridcully looked at his wizards .     one of us must know his name  surely .  good grief  i should hope we at least know our colleagues    names .  isn   t that so       he looked at the dean  hesitated  and then said     dean .         he   s been an ape for quite a while   archchancellor     said the dean .     most of his original colleagues have   passed on .  gone to the great big dinner in the sky .  we were going through one of those periods of droit de mortis .          yes  but he   s got to be in the records somewhere .      the wizards thought about the great cliffs of stacked paper that constituted the university   s records .      the archivist has never found him     said the lecturer in recent runes .      who   s the archivist .         the librarian  archchancellor .         then at least he ought to be in the year book for the year he graduated .         it   s a very funny thing     said the dean     but a freak accident appears to have happened to every single copy of the year book for that year .      ridcully noted his wooden expression .     would it be an accident like a particular page being torn out leaving only a lingering bananary aroma .         lucky guess  archchancellor .      ridcully scratched his chin .     a pattern emerges     he said .      you see  he   s always been dead set against anyone finding out his name     said the senior wrangler .     he   s afraid we   ll try to turn him back into a human .     he looked meaningfully at the dean  who put on an offended expression .     some people have been going around saying that an ape as librarian is unsuitable .         i merely expressed the view that it is against the traditions of the university       the dean began .      which consist largely of niggling  big dinners and shouting damnfool things about keys in the middle of the night     said ridcully .     so i don   t think we        the expressions on the faces of the other wizards made him turn around .   the librarian had entered the hall .  he walked very slowly  because of the amount of clothing he   d put on  the sheer volume of coats and sweaters meant that his arms  instead of being used as extra feet  were sticking out very nearly horizontally on either side of his body .  but the most horrifying aspect of the shuffling apparition was the red woolly hat .   it was jolly .  it had a bobble on it .  it had been knitted by mrs .  whitlow  who was technically an extremely good needlewoman  but if she had a fault it lay in failing to take into account the precise dimensions of the intended recipient .  several wizards had on occasion been presented with one of her creations  which often assumed they had three ankles or a neck two meters across .  most of the things were surreptitiously given away to charitable institutions .  you can say this about ankh morpork   no matter how misshapen a garment  there will always be someone somewhere it would fit .   mrs .  whitlow   s mistake here was the assumption that the librarian  for whom she had considerable respect  would like a red bobble hat with side flaps that tied under his chin .  given that this would technically require that they be tied under his groin  he   d opted to let them flap loose .   he turned a sad face towards the wizards as he stopped outside the library door .  he reached for the handle .  he said  in a very weak voice        k     and then sneezed .   the pile of clothing settled .  when the wizards pulled it away  they found underneath a very large  thick book bound in hairy red leather .      says ook on the cover     said the senior wrangler after a while  in a rather strained voice .      does it say who it   s by .     said the dean .      bad taste  that man .         i meant that maybe it   d be his real name .         can we look inside .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     there may be an index .         any volunteers to look inside the librarian .     said ridcully .     don   t all shout .         the morphic instability responds to the environment     said ponder .     isn   t that interesting .  he   s near the library  so it turns him into a book .  sort of   protective camouflage  you could say .  it   s as if he evolves to fit in with           thank you  mister stibbons .  and is there a point to this .         well  i assume we can look inside     said ponder .     a book is meant to be opened .  there   s even a black leather bookmark  see .         oh  that   s a bookmark  is it .     said the chair of indefinite studies  who had been watching it nervously .   ponder touched the book .  it was warm .  and it opened easily enough .   every page was covered with    ook .         good dialogue  but the plot is a little dull .         dean .  i   d be obliged if you   d take this seriously  please .     said ridcully .  he tapped his foot once or twice .     anyone got any more ideas .      the wizards stared at one another and shrugged .      i suppose       said the lecturer in recent runes .      yes  runes   arnold  isn   t it .         no  archchancellor           well  out with it anyway .         i suppose   i know this sounds ridiculous  but           go on  man .  we   re almost all agog .         i suppose there   s always   rincewind .      ridcully stared at him for a moment .     skinny fella .  scruffy beard .  bloody useless wizard .  got that box on legs thingy .         that   s right  archchancellor .  well done .  er   he was the deputy librarian for a while  as i expect you remember .         not really  but do go on     he said .      in fact he was here when the librarian   became the librarian .  and i remember once  when we were watching the librarian stamping four books all at the same time  he said     amazing  really  when you think he was born in ankh morpork .     i   m sure if anyone knows the name of the librarian it   s rincewind .         well  go and fetch him  then .  i suppose you do know where he is  do you .         technically  yes  archchancellor     said ponder quickly .     but we   re not sure quite where the place where he is is  if you follow me .      ridcully gave him another stare .      you see  we think he   s on ecksecksecksecks  archchancellor     said ponder .      ecksecks              ecksecks  archchancellor .         i thought no one knew where that place was     said ridcully .      exactly  archchancellor     said ponder .  sometimes you had to turn facts in several directions until you found the right way to fit them into ridcully   s head .       what   s he doing there .         we don   t really know  archchancellor .  if you remember  we believe he ended up there after that agatean business           what did he want to go there for .         i don   t think he exactly wanted to     said ponder .     er   we sent him .  it was a trivial error in bilocational thaumaturgy that anyone could make .         but you made it  as i recall     said ridcully  whose memory could spring nasty surprises like that .      i am a member of the team  sir     said ponder  pointedly .      well  if he doesn   t want to be there  and we need him here  let   s bring him b        the rest of the sentence was drowned out not by a noise but by a sort of bloom of quietness  which rolled over the wizards and was so oppressive and soft that they couldn   t even hear their own heartbeats .  old tom  the university   s magical and tongue less bell  tolled out two a . m .  by striking the silences .      er       said ponder .     it   s not as simple as that .      ridcully blinked .     why not .     he said .     bring him back by magic .  we sent him there  we can bring him back .         er   it   d take months to set it up properly  if you want him back right here     said ponder .     if we get it wrong he   ll end up arriving in a circle fifty feet wide .         that   s not a problem  is it .  if we keep out of it he can land anywhere .         i don   t think you quite understand  sir .  the signal to noise ratio of any thaumic transfer over an uncertain distance  coupled with the disc   s own spin  will almost certainly result in a practical averaging of the arriving subject over an area of a couple of thousand square feet at least  sir .         say again .      ponder took a deep breath .     i mean he   ll end up arriving as a circle .  fifty feet wide .         ah .  so he probably wouldn   t be very good in the library after that  then .         only as a very large bookmark  sir .         all right  then  it   s down to sheer geography .  who   ve we got who knows anything about geography .         the miners emerged from the vertical shaft like ants leaving a burning nest .  there were thumps and thuds from below  and at one point strewth   s hat shot up into the air  turned over a few times and dropped back .   there was silence for a while and then  bits cracking off it like errant pieces of shell on a newly hatched chick  the thing pulled itself out of the shaft and        looked around it .   the miners  crouched behind various bushes and sheds  were quite certain of this  even though the monster had no visible eyes .   it turned  its hundreds of little legs moving rather stiffly  as if they   d spent too much time buried in the ground .   then  weaving slightly  it set off .   and far away in the shimmering red desert  the man in the pointy hat climbed carefully out of his hole .  he held in both hands a bowl made of bark .  it contained   lots of vitamins  valuable protein and essential fats .  see .  no mention of wriggling at all .   a fire was smoldering a little way away .  he put the bowl down carefully and picked up a large stick  stood quietly for a moment and then suddenly began to hop around the fire  smacking the ground with the stick and shouting     hah .     when the ground had been subdued to his apparent satisfaction he whacked at the bushes as if they had personally offended him  and bashed a couple of trees as well .   finally he advanced on a couple of flat rocks  lifted up each one in turn  averted his eyes  shouted     hah .     again and flailed blindly at the ground beneath .   the landscape having been acceptably pacified  he sat down to eat his supper before it escaped .   it tasted a little like chicken .  when you are hungry enough  practically anything can .   and eyes watched him from the nearby water hole .  they were not the tiny eyes of the swarming beetles and tadpoles that made a careful examination of every handful he drank a vital gastronomic precaution .  these were far older eyes  and currently without any physical component .   for weeks a man whose ability to find water was limited to checking if his feet were wet had survived in this oven ready country by falling into water holes .  a man who thought of spiders as harmless little creatures had experienced only a couple of nasty shocks when  by now  this approach should have left him with arms the size of beer barrels that glowed in the dark .  the man had even hit the seashore once and paddled in a little way to look at the pretty blue jellyfish  and it was all the watcher could do to see that he got a mere light sting which ceased to be agonizing after only a few days .   the waterhole bubbled and the ground trembled as if  despite the cloudless sky  there was a storm somewhere .      now it was three o   clock in the morning .  ridcully was good at doing without other people   s sleep .   unseen university was much bigger on the inside .  thousands of years as the leading establishment of practical magic in a world where dimensions were largely a matter of chance in any case had left it bulging in places where it shouldn   t have places .  there were rooms containing rooms which  if you entered them  turned out to contain the room you   d started with  which can be a problem if you are in a conga line .   and because it was so big it could afford to have an almost unlimited number of staff on the premises .  tenure was automatic or  more accurately  nonexistent .  you found an empty room  turned up for meals as usual  and generally no one noticed  although if you were unfortunate you might attract students .  and if you looked hard enough in some of the outlying regions of the university  you could find an expert on anything .   you could even find an expert on finding an expert .  the professor of recondite architecture and origami map folding had been woken up  been introduced to the archchancellor  who had never set eyes on him before  and had produced a map of the university which would probably be accurate for the next few days and looked rather like a chrysanthemum in the act of exploding .   finally  the wizards reached a door and ridcully glared at the brass plate on it as if it had just been cheeky to him .         egregious professor of cruel and unusual geography        he said .     this looks like the one .         we must have walked miles     said the dean  leaning against the wall .     i don   t recognize any of this .      ridcully glanced around .  the walls were stone but had at some time been painted in that very special institutional green that you get when an almost finished cup of coffee is left standing for a couple of weeks .  there was a board covered in balding and darker green felt on which had been optimistically thumbtacked the word    notices .     but from the looks of it there had never been any notices and never would be  ever .  there was a smell of ancient dinners .   ridcully shrugged  and knocked on the door .      i don   t remember him     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i think i do     said the dean .     not a very promising boy .  had ears .  don   t often see him around  though .  always has a suntan .  odd  that .         he   s on the staff .  if anyone knows anything about geography  he   s our man .     ridcully knocked again .      perhaps he   s out     said the dean .     that   s where you mostly get geography  outside .      ridcully pointed to a little wooden device by the door .  there was one outside every wizard   s study .  it consisted of a little sliding panel in a frame .  currently it was revealing the word    in    and  presumably  was covering the word    out     although you could never be sure with some wizards .    the dean tried to slide the panel .  it refused to budge .      he must come out sometimes     said the senior wrangler .     besides  sensible men should be in bed at three a . m .         yes  indeed     said the dean meaningfully .   ridcully thumped on the door .     i demand that you open up .     he shouted .     i am the master of this college .      the door moved under the blow  but not very much .  it was blocked by what turned out to be  after some strenuous shoving by all the wizards  an enormous pile of paperwork .  the dean picked up a yellowing piece of paper .      this is the memo saying i   ve been appointed as dean .     he said .     that was years ago .         surely he must come out somet       said the senior wrangler .     oh dear        the same thought had occurred to the other wizards  too .      remember poor old wally sluvver .     murmured the chair of indefinite studies  looking around in some trepidation .     three years of tutorials postmortem .         well  the students did say he was a bit quiet     said ridcully .  he sniffed .     doesn   t smell bad in here .  quite fresh  really .  pleasantly salty .  aha        there was bright light under a door at the other end of the crowded and dusty room  and the wizards could hear a gentle splashing .      bath night .  good man     said ridcully .     well  we don   t have to disturb him .      he peered at the titles of the books that lined the room .      bound to be a lot about ecksecksecksecks somewhere here     he added  pulling out a volume at random .     come along .  one man  one book each .         can we at least send out for some breakfast .     grumbled the dean .      far too early for breakfast     said ridcully .      well  some supper  then .         too late for supper .      the chair of indefinite studies took in the rest of the room .  a lizard scuttled across the wall and disappeared .      bit of a mess in here  isn   t there .     he said  glaring at the place where the lizard had been .     everything   s very dusty .  what   s in all those boxes .         says    rocks    on this side     said the dean .     makes sense .  if you   re going to study the outdoors  do it in the warm .         but what about all the fishing nets and coconuts .      the dean had to agree the point .  the study was a mess  even by the extremely expansive standards of wizardry .  boxes of dusty rocks occupied the little space that wasn   t covered with books and paper .  they had been variously labeled  with inscriptions like    rocks from lower down        other rocks        curious rocks    and    probably not rocks .     further boxes  to ponder   s rising interest  were marked    remarkable bones        bones    and    dull bones .         one of those people who pokes his nose where it doesn   t belong  i fancy     said the lecturer in recent runes  and sniffed .  he sniffed again  and looked down at the book he   d picked at random .      this is a pressed squid collection     he said .      oh  is it any good .  i used to collect starfish when i was a boy     said ponder .   the lecturer in recent runes shut the book and frowned at him over the top of it .     i daresay you did  young man .  and old fossils too  i expect .         i always thought that old fossils might have a lot to teach us     said ponder .     perhaps i was wrong     he added darkly .      well  i for one have never believed all that business about dead animals turning into stone     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s against all reason .  what   s in it for them .         so how do you explain fossils  then .     said ponder .      ah  you see  i don   t     said the lecturer in recent runes  with a triumphant smile .     it saves so much trouble in the long run .  how do skinless sausages hold together  mister stibbons .         what .  eh .  how should i know something like that .         really .  you don   t know that but you think you   re entirely qualified to know how the whole universe was put together  do you .  anyway  you don   t have to explain fossils .  they   re there .  why try to turn everything into a big mystery .  if you go around asking questions the whole time you   ll never get anything done .         well  what are we put here for .     said ponder .      there you go again     said the lecturer in recent runes .      says here it   s girt by sea     said the senior wrangler .   he looked up at their stares .      this continent ecksecksecksecks     he added  pointing at a page .     says here    little is known about it save that it is girt by sea .            i   m glad to see someone has their mind on the task in hand     said ridcully .     you two get on with some studyin     please .  right  then  senior wrangler   girt by sea  is it .         apparently .         well   it would be  wouldn   t it     said ridcully .     anything else .         i used to know a gert     said the bursar .  the terror of the library had sent his somewhat erratic sanity on a downward slide into the calm pink clouds again .      not   very much     said the senior wrangler  flicking through the pages .     sir roderick purdeigh spent many years looking for the alleged continent and was very emphatic that it didn   t exist .         quite a jolly gel .  gertrude plusher  i think her name was .  face like a brick .         yes  but he once got lost in his own bedroom     said the dean  thumbing through another book .     they found him in the wardrobe .         i wonder if it   s the same gert .     said the bursar .      could be  bursar     said ridcully .  he nodded at the other wizards .     no one   s to let him have any sugar or fruit .      for a while there was no sound but the splash of water behind the door  the turning of pages and the bursar   s randomized humming .      according to this note in wasport   s lives of the very dull people     said the senior wrangler  squinting at the tiny script     he met an old fisherman who said in that country the bark fell off the trees in the winter and the leaves stayed on .         yes  but they always make up that sort of thing     said ridcully .     otherwise it   s too boring .  it   s no good coming home and just saying you were shipwrecked for two years and ate winkles  is it .  you have to put in a lot of daft stuff about men who go around on one big foot and the land of giant plum puddings and nursery rubbish like that .         my word .     said the lecturer in recent runes  who had been engrossed in a volume at the other end of the table .     it says here that the people on the island of slakki wear no clothes at all and the women are of unsurpassed beauty .         that sounds quite dreadful     said the chair of indefinite studies primly .      there are several woodcuts .         i   m sure none of us wish to know that     said ridcully .  he looked around at the rest of the wizards and repeated  in a louder voice     i said i   m sure none of us wish to know that .  dean .  come right back here and pick up your chair .         there   s a mention of ecksecksecksecks in wrencher   s snakes of all nations     said the chair of indefinite studies .     it says the continent has very few poisonous snakes   oh  there   s a footnote .     his finger went down the page .     it says     most of them have been killed by the spiders .     how very odd .         oh     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it also says here that    the denizens of purdee island also existeth inne a state of nature         he struggled with the ancient handwriting         yette is in fine healthe   of good bearing   stature   is trulee a   knobbly savage              let me have a look at that     said ridcully .  the book was passed down the table .  the archchancellor scowled .      it   s written    knoble        he said .     noble savage .  means you   act like a gentleman  don   tcher know           what   go fox hunting  bow to ladies  don   t pay your tailor   that sort of thing .         shouldn   t think that chap owes his tailor very much     said ridcully  looking at the accompanying illustration .     all right  chaps  let   s see what else we can find           he   s having rather a long bath  isn   t he .     said the dean  after a while .     i mean  i like to be as well scrubbed as the next man  but we   re talking serious prunes here .         sounds like he   s sloshing about     said the senior wrangler .      sounds like the seaside     said the bursar happily .      try to keep up  will you  bursar .     said ridcully wearily .      actually       said the senior wrangler     there is a certain seagully component  now that you mention it        ridcully stood up  strode over to the bathroom door and held up his fist to knock .      i am the archchancellor     he grumbled  lowering it .     i can open any doors i damn well please .     and he turned the handle .      there     he said  as the door swung back .     see  gentlemen .  a perfectly ordinary bathroom .  stone bath  brass taps  bath cap  humorous scrubbin    brush in the shape of a duck   a perfectly ordinary bathroom .  it is not  let me make myself quite clear  some kind of tropical beach .  it doesn   t look remotely like a tropical beach .      he pointed out of the bathroom   s open window  to where waves lapped languorously against a tree fringed strand under a brilliant blue sky .  the bathroom curtains flapped on a warm breeze .      that   s a tropical beach .     he said .     see .  no similarity at all .         after his nourishing meal that contained masses of essential vitamins and minerals and unfortunately quite a lot of taste as well  the man with    wizzard    on his hat settled down for some housekeeping  or as much as was possible in the absence of a house .   it consisted of chipping away at a piece of wood with a stone axe .  he appeared to be making a very short plank  and the speed with which he was working suggested that he   d done this before .   a cockatoo settled in the tree above him to watch .  rincewind glared at it suspiciously .   when the plank had apparently been smoothed to his satisfaction he stood on it with one foot and  swaying  drew around the foot with a piece of charcoal from the fire .  he did the same with the other foot  and then settled down to hack at the wood again .   the watcher in the waterhole realized that the man was making two foot shaped boards .   rincewind took a length of twine from his pocket .  he   d found a particular creeper which  if you carefully peeled the bark off  would give you a terrible spotted rash .  what he   d actually been looking for was a creeper which  if you carefully peeled off the bark  would give you a serviceable twine  and it had taken several more goes and various different rashes to find out which one this was .   if you made a hole in the soles and fed a loop of twine through it  into which a toe could be inserted  you ended up with some ur footwear .  it made you shuffle like the ascent of man but  nevertheless  had some unexpected benefits .  first  the steady flop flop as you walked made you sound like two people to any dangerous creatures you were about to encounter  which  in rincewind   s recent experience  was any creature at all .  second  although they were impossible to run in they were easy to run out of  so that you were a smoking dot on the burning horizon while the enraged caterpillar or beetle was still looking at your shoes and wondering where the other person was .   he   d had to run away a lot .  every night he made a new pair of thonged sandals  and every day he left them somewhere in the desert .   when he   d finished them to his satisfaction he took a roll of thin bark from his pocket .  attached to it by a length of twine was a very precious small stub of pencil .  he   d decided to keep a journal in the hope that this might help .  he looked at the recent entries .       probably tuesday  hot  flies .  dinner  honey ants .  attacked by honey ants .  fell into waterhole .   wednesday  with any luck  hot  flies .  dinner  either bush raisins or kangaroo droppings .  chased by hunters  don   t know why .  fell into waterhole .   thursday  could be   hot  flies .  dinner  blue tongued lizard .  savaged by blue tongued lizard .  chased by different hunters .  fell off cliff  bounced into tree  pissed on by small gray incontinent teddy bear  landed in a waterhole .   friday  hot  flies .  dinner  some kind of roots which tasted like sick .  this saved time .   saturday  hotter than yesterday  extra flies .  v . thirsty .   sunday  hot .  delirious with thirst and flies .  nothing but nothing as far as the eye can see  with bushes in it .  decided to die  collapsed  fell down sand dune into waterhole .     he wrote very carefully and as small as possible     monday  hot  flies .  dinner  moth grubs .     he stared at the writing .  it said it all  really .   why didn   t people here like him .  he   d meet some small tribe  everything   d be friendly  he   d pick up a few tips  get to know a few names  he   d build up a vocabulary  enough to chat about ordinary everyday things like the weather   and then suddenly they   d be chasing him away .  after all  everyone talked about the weather  didn   t they .   rincewind had always been happy to think of himself as a racist .  the one hundred meters  the mile  the marathon   he   d run them all .  later  when he   d learned with some surprise what the word actually meant  he   d been equally certain he wasn   t one .  he was a person who divided the world quite simply into people who were trying to kill him and people who weren   t .  that didn   t leave much room for fine details like what color anyone was .  but he   d be sitting by the campfire  trying out a simple conversation  and suddenly people would get upset over nothing at all and drive him off .  you didn   t expect people to get nasty just because you   d said something like     my word  when did it last rain here .     did you .   rincewind sighed  picked up his stick  beat the hell out of a patch of ground  lay down and went to sleep .   occasionally he screamed under his breath and his legs made running motions  which just showed that he was dreaming .   the waterhole rippled .  it wasn   t large  a mere puddle deep in a bush filled gully between some rocks  and the liquid it contained could only be called water because geographers refuse to countenance words like    souphole .      nevertheless it rippled  as though something had dropped into the center .  and what was odd about the ripples was that they didn   t stop when they reached the edge of the water but continued outwards over the land as expanding circles of dim white light .  when they reached rincewind they broke up and flowed around him  so that now he was the center of concentric lines of white dots  like strings of pearls .   the waterhole erupted .  something climbed up into the air and sped away across the night .   it zigzagged from rock to mountain to waterhole .  and as the eye of observation rises  the traveling streak briefly illuminates other dim lines  hanging above the ground like smoke  so from above the whole land appears to have a circulatory system  or nerves     a thousand miles from the sleeping wizard the line struck ground again  emerged in a cave  and passed across the walls like a searchlight .   it hovered in front of a huge  pointed rock for a moment and then  as if reaching a decision  shot up again into the sky .   the continent rolled below it as it returned .  the light hit the waterhole without a splash but  once again  three or four ripples in something spread out across the turbid water and the surrounding sand .   night rolled in again .  but there was a distant thumping under the ground .  bushes trembled .  in the trees  birds awoke and flew away .   after a while  on a rock face near the waterhole  pale white lines began to form a picture .      rincewind had attracted the attention of at least one other watcher apart from whatever it was that dwelt in the waterhole .   death had taken to keeping rincewind   s life timer on a special shelf in his study  in much the way that a zoologist would want to keep an eye on a particularly intriguing specimen .   the lifetimers of most people were the classic shape that death thought was right and proper for the task .  they appeared to be large eggtimers  although  since the sands they measured were the living seconds of someone   s life  all the eggs were in one basket .   rincewind   s hourglass looked like something created by a glassblower who   d had the hiccups in a time machine .  according to the amount of actual sand it contained   and death was pretty good at making this kind of estimate   he should have died long ago .  but strange curves and bends and extrusions of glass had developed over the years  and quite often the sand was flowing backwards  or diagonally .  clearly  rincewind had been hit by so much magic  had been thrust reluctantly through time and space so often that he   d nearly bumped into himself coming the other way  that the precise end of his life was now as hard to find as the starting point on a roll of really sticky transparent tape .   death was familiar with the concept of the eternal  ever renewed hero  the champion with a thousand faces .  he   d refrained from commenting .  he met heroes frequently  generally surrounded by  and this was important  the dead bodies of very nearly all their enemies and saying     vot the hell shust happened .     whether there was some arrangement that allowed them to come back again afterwards was not something he would be drawn on .   but he pondered whether  if this creature did exist  it was somehow balanced by the eternal coward .  the hero with a thousand retreating backs  perhaps .  many cultures had a legend of an undying hero who would one day rise again  so perhaps the balance of nature called for one who wouldn   t .   whatever the ultimate truth of the matter  the fact now was that death did not have the slightest idea of when rincewind was going to die .  this was very vexing to a creature who prided himself on his punctuality .   death glided across the velvet emptiness of his study until he reached the model of the discworld  if indeed it was a model .   eyeless sockets looked down .   show  he said .   the precious metals and stones faded .  death saw ocean currents  deserts  forests  drifting cloudscapes like albino buffalo herds     show .   the eye of observation curved and dived into the living map  and a reddish splash grew in an expanse of turbulent sea .  ancient mountain ranges slipped past  deserts of rock and sand glided away .   show .   death watched the sleeping figure of rincewind .  occasionally its legs would jerk .   hmm .   death felt something crawling up the back of his robe  pause for a minute on his shoulder  and leap .  a small rodent skeleton in a black robe landed in the middle of the image and started flailing madly at it with his tiny scythe  squeaking excitedly .   death picked up the death of rats by his cowl and held him up for inspection .   no  we don   t do it that way .   the death of rats struggled madly .  squeak .   because it   s against the rules  said death .  nature must take its course .   he glanced down at the image again as if a thought had struck him  and lowered the death of rats to the floor .  then he went to the wall and pulled a cord .  far away  a bell tolled .   after a while an elderly man entered  carrying a tray .      sorry about that  master .  i was cleaning the bath .      i beg your pardon  albert .      i mean  that   s why i was late with your tea  sir     said albert .   that is of no consequence .  tell me  what do you know of this place .   death   s finger tapped the red continent .  his manservant looked closely .      oh  there     he said .     terror incognita    we called it when i was alive  master .  never went there myself .  it   s the currents  you know .  many a poor sailorman has washed up on them fatal shores rather than get carried right over the rim  and regretted it  i expect .  dry as a statue   s ti   very dry  master  or so they say .  and hotter   n a demon   s joc   very hot  too .  but you must   ve been there yourself .      oh  yes .  but you know how it is when you   re there on business and there   s hardly any time to see the country     death pointed to the great spiral of clouds that turned slowly around the continent  like jackals warily circling a dying lion which looked done for but which might yet be capable of one last bite .   very strange  he said .  a permanent anticyclone .  and inside  a huge  calm land  that never sees a storm .  and never has a drop of rain .      good place for a holiday  then .      come with me .   the two of them  trailed by the death of rats  walked into death   s huge library .  there were clouds here  up near the ceiling .   death held out a hand .  i want  he said  a book about the dangerous creatures of fourecks     albert looked up and dived for cover  receiving only mild bruising because he had the foresight to curl into a ball .   after a while death  his voice a little muffled  said  albert  i would be so grateful if you could give me a hand here .   albert scrambled up and pulled at some of the huge volumes  finally dislodging enough of them to allow his master to clamber free .   hmm   death picked up a book at random and read the cover .   dangerous mammals  reptiles  amphibians  birds  fish  jellyfish  insects  spiders  crustaceans  grasses  trees  mosses  and lichens of terror incognita  he read .  his gaze moved down the spine .  volume   c  he added .  oh .  part three  i see .   he glanced up at the listening shelves .  possibly it would be simpler if i asked for a list of the harmless creatures of the aforesaid continent .   they waited .   it would appear that        no  wait  master .  here it comes .      albert pointed to something white zigzagging lazily through the air .  finally death reached up and caught the single sheet of paper .   he read it carefully and then turned it over briefly just in case anything was written on the other side .      may i .     said albert .  death handed him the paper .         some of the sheep        albert read aloud .     oh  well .  maybe a week at the seaside   d be better  then .      what an intriguing place  said death .  saddle up the horse  albert .  i feel sure i   m going to be needed .   squeak  said the death of rats .   pardon .      he said     no worries     master     said albert .   i can   t imagine why .      four huge blooms of silence rolled over the city as old tom so emphatically did not strike the hour .   several servants rumbled a trolley along the corridor .  the archchancellor had given in .  an early breakfast was on the way .   ridcully lowered his tape measure .      let   s try that again  shall we .     he said .  he stepped out of the window and picked a seashell out of the sand .  it was warm from the sun .  then he pulled himself back into the bathroom and walked around to a door beside the window .   it led to a dank  moss grown light well  which allowed secondhand and grubby daylight into these dismal floors .  even the snow hadn   t managed to get more than a brushing of flakes down this far .   the window on this side glimmered in the light from the doorway like a pool of very black oil .      okay  dean     he said .     push your staff through .  now waggle it about .      the wizards looked at the gently rippling surface .  there should have been several feet of solid wood sticking out of it .      well  well  well     said the archchancellor  going back in out of the cold air .     do you know  i   ve never actually seen one of these .         anyone remember archchancellor bewdley   s boots .     said the senior wrangler  helping himself to some cold mutton from the trolley .     he made a mistake and got one of the things opened up in the left boot .  very tricky .  you can   t go walking around with one foot in another dimension .         well  no       said ridcully  staring at the tropical scene and tapping his chin thoughtfully with the seashell .      can   t see what you   re treading in  for one thing     said the senior wrangler .      one opened up in one of the cellars once  all by itself     said the dean .     just a round black hole .  anything you put in it just disappeared .  so old archchancellor weatherwax had a privy built over it .         very sensible idea     said ridcully  still looking thoughtful .      we thought so too  until we found the other one that had opened in the attic .  turned out to be the other side of the same hole .  i   m sure i don   t need to draw you a picture .         i   ve never heard of these .     said ponder stibbons .     the possibilities are amazing .         everyone says that when they first hear about them     said the senior wrangler .     but when you   ve been a wizard as long as i have  my boy  you   ll learn that as soon as you find anything that offers amazing possibilities for the improvement of the human condition it   s best to put the lid back on and pretend it never happened .         but if you could get one to open above another you could drop something through the bottom hole and it   d come out of the top hole and fall through the bottom hole again   it   d reach meteoritic speed and the amount of power you could generate would be           that   s pretty much what happened between the attic and the cellar     said the dean  taking a cold chicken leg .     thank goodness for air friction  that   s all i   ll say .      ponder waved his hand gingerly through the window and felt the sun   s heat .      and no one   s ever studied them .     he said .   the senior wrangler shrugged .     studied what .  they   re just holes .  you get a lot of magic in one place  it kind of drops through the world like a hot steel ball through pork dripping .  if it comes to the edge of something  it kind of fills it in .         stress points in the space time continuinuinuum       said ponder .     there must be hundreds of uses           hah  yes  no wonder our egregious professor is always so sun tanned     said the dean .     i feel he   s been cheating .  geography should be hard to get to .  it shouldn   t be in your windowbox  is what i   m saying .  you shouldn   t get at it just by sneaking out of the university .         well  he hasn   t  really  has he .     said the senior wrangler .     he   s really just extended his study a bit .         do you think that is ecksecksecksecks  by any chance .     said the dean .     it certainly looks foreign .         well  there is sea     said the senior wrangler .     but would you say that it looks as if it is actually girting .         it   s just   you know   sloshing .         one would somehow imagine that sea that was girting something would look more  well   defiant     said the lecturer in recent runes .     you know .  thundering waves and so on .  definitely sending a message to outsiders that it was girting this coast and they   d better be jolly respectful .         perhaps we could go right through and investigate     said ponder .      something dreadful   ll happen if we do     said the senior wrangler gloomily .      it hasn   t happened to the bursar     said ridcully .   the wizards crowded around .  there was a figure standing in the surf .  its robe was rolled up above the knees .  a few birds wheeled overhead .  palm trees waved in the background .      my word  he must have snuck out while we weren   t looking     said the senior wrangler .      bursar .     ridcully yelled .   the figure didn   t look round .      i don   t want to  you know  make trouble     said the chair of indefinite studies  looking wistfully at the sundrenched beach     but it   s freezing cold in my bedroom and last night there was frost on my eiderdown .  i don   t see any harm in a quick stroll in the warm .         we   re here to help the librarian .     snapped ridcully .  faint snores were coming from the volume entitled ook .      my point exactly .  the poor chap   d be a lot happier in those trees there .         you mean we could wedge him in the branches .     said the archchancellor .     he   s still the story of ook .         you know what i mean  mustrum .  a day at the seaside for him would be better than a   a day at the seaside  as it were .  let   s get out there  i   m freezing .         are you mad .  there could be terrible monsters .  look at the poor chap standing there in the surf .  that sea   s probably teeming with           sharks     said the senior wrangler .      right .     said ridcully .     and           barracudas     said the senior wrangler .     marlins .  swordfish .  looks like somewhere out near the rim to me .  fishermen say there   s fish there that   d take your arm off .         right     said ridcully .     right       there was a small but significant change in his tone .  everyone knew about the stuffed fish on his walls .  arch chancellor ridcully would hunt anything .  the only cockerel still crowing within two hundred yards of the university these days stood under a cart to do it .      and that jungle     said the senior wrangler  sniffing .     looks pretty damn dangerous to me .  could be anything in it .  fatal .  could be tigers and gorillas and elephants and pineapples .  i wouldn   t go near it .  i   m with you  archchancellor .  better to freeze here than look some rabid man eater in the eye .      ridcully   s own eyes were burning bright .  he stroked his beard thoughtfully .     tigers  eh .     he said .  then his expression changed .     pineapples .         deadly     said the senior wrangler firmly .     one of them got my aunt .  we couldn   t get it off her .  i told her that   s not the way you   re supposed to eat them  but would she listen .      the dean looked sidelong at his archchancellor .  it was the glance of a man who also didn   t want another night in a frigid bedroom and had suddenly worked out where the levers were .      that gets my vote  mustrum     he said .     catch me going through some hole in space on to some warm beach with a sea teeming with huge fish and a jungle full of hunting trophies .     he yawned like a bad poker player .     no  it   s me for my nice freezing bed  i don   t know about you .  archchancellor .         i think       ridcully began .      yes .         clams     said the senior wrangler  shaking his head .     looks just the beach for the devils .  you just ask my cousin .  you   ll have to find a good medium first  though .  they shouldn   t ooze green  i said .  they shouldn   t bubble  i told him .  but would he listen .      the archchancellor was currently amongst those who wouldn   t .     you think that taking him out there would be just the thing for the librarian  do you .     he said .     just the tonic for the poor old chap  an hour or two under that sun .         but i expect we ought to be ready to protect him  eh  archchancellor .     the dean said  innocently .      why  yes  i really hadn   t thought of that     said ridcully .     hmm  yes .  important point .  better get them to bring down my     pound crossbow with the armor piercing arrows and my home taxidermy outfit .  and all ten fishing rods .  and all four tackle boxes .  and the big set of scales .         good thinking  archchancellor     said the dean .     he may want to take a swim when he   s feeling better .         in that case     said ponder     i think i   ll get my thaumodalite and my notebooks .  it   s vital to work out where we are .  it could be ecksecksecksecks  i suppose .  it looks very foreign .         i suppose i   d better fetch my reptile press and my herbarium     said the chair of indefinite studies  who had got there eventually .     much may be learned from the plants here  i   ll wager .         i shall certainly endeavor to make a study of any primitive grass skirted peoples hereabouts     added the dean  with a lawnmower look in his eyes .      what about you  runes .     said ridcully .      me .  oh  er       the lecturer in recent runes looked wildly at his colleagues  who were nodding frantically at him .     er   this would be a good time to catch up on my reading  obviously .         right     said ridcully .     because we are not  and i want to make this very clear  we are not doing this in order to enjoy ourselves  is that understood .         what about the senior wrangler .     said the dean nastily .      me .  enjoy it .  there might even be prawns out there     said the senior wrangler miserably .   ridcully hesitated .  the other wizards shrugged when he glanced at them .     look  old chap     he said eventually     i think i understood about the clams  and i   ve got a sort of mental picture about your granny and the pineapple              my aunt              your aunt and the pineapple  but   what   s deadly about prawns .         hah  see how you like a crate of them dropping off the crane on to your head     said the senior wrangler .     my uncle didn   t  i can tell you .         okay  i think i understand .  important safety tip  everyone     said ridcully .     avoid all crates .  understood .  but we are not here on some kind of holiday .  do you all understand me .         absolutely     said the wizards in unison .   they all understood him .      rincewind awoke with a scream  to get it over with .   then he saw the man watching him .   he was sitting cross legged against the dawn .  he was black .  not brown  or blue black  but black as space .  this place baked people .   rincewind pulled himself up and thought about reaching for his stick .  and then he thought again .  the man had a couple of spears stuck in the ground  and people here were good at spears  because if you didn   t get efficient at hitting the things that moved fast you had to eat the things that moved slowly .  he was also holding a boomerang  and it wasn   t one of those toy ones that came back .  this was one of the big  heavy  gently curved sort that didn   t come back because it was sticking in something   s ribcage .  you could laugh at the idea of wooden weapons until you saw the kind of wood that grew here .   it had been painted with stripes of all colors  but it still looked like a business item .   rincewind tried to seem harmless .  it required little in the way of acting .   the watcher regarded him in that sucking silence that you just have to fill .  and rincewind came from a culture where  if there was nothing to say  you said something .      er       said rincewind .     me   big fella   fella   belong   damn  what   s the       he gave up  and glanced at the blue sky .     turned out nice again     he said .   the man seemed to sigh  stuck the boomerang into the strip of animal skin that was his belt and  in fact  the whole of his wardrobe  and stood up .  then he picked up a leathery sack  slung it over one shoulder  took the spears and  without a backward glance  ambled off around a rock .   this might have struck anyone else as rude  but rincewind was always happy to see any heavily armed person walking away .  he rubbed his eyes and contemplated the dismal task of subduing breakfast .      you want some grub .     the voice was almost a whisper .   rincewind looked around .  a little way off was the hole from which last night   s supper had been dug .  apart from that  there was nothing all the way to the infinite horizon but scrubby bushes and hot red rocks .      i think i dug up most of them     he said  weakly .      nah  mate .  i got to tell you the secret of findin    tucker in the bush .  there   s always a beaut feed if you know where to look  mate .         how come you   re speaking my language  mystery voice .     said rincewind .      i ain   t     said the voice .     you   re listenin    to mine .  got to feed you up proper .  gonna sing you into a real bush tucker finder  true .         lovely grub     said rincewind .      just you stand there and don   t move .      it sounded as though the unseen voice then began to chant very quietly through an unseen nose .   rincewind was  after all  a wizard .  not a good one  but he was sensitive to magic .  and the chant was doing strange things .   the hairs on the back of his hands tried to crawl up his arms  and the back of his neck began to sweat .  his ears popped and  very gently  the landscape began to spin around him .   he looked down at the ground .  there were his feet .  almost certainly his feet .  and they were standing on the red earth and not moving at all .  things were moving round him .  he wasn   t dizzy but  by the look of it  the landscape was .   the chanting stopped .  there was a sort of echo  which seemed to happen inside his head  as if the words had been merely the shadow of something more important .   rincewind shut his eyes for a while  and then opened them again .      er   fine     he said .     very   catchy .      he couldn   t see the speaker  so he spoke with that careful politeness you reserve for someone armed who is probably standing behind you .   he turned .     i expect you   er   had to go somewhere  did you .     he said  to the empty air .      er   hello .      even the insects had gone quiet .      er   you haven   t noticed a box walking around on legs  have you .  by any chance .      he tried to see if anyone could possibly be hiding behind a bush .      it   s not important  it   s just that it   s got my clean underwear in it .      the boundless silence made an eloquent statement about the universe   s views on clean underwear .      so   er   i   m going to know how to find food in the bush  right .     he ventured .  he glared at the nearest trees .  they didn   t look any more fruitful than before .  he shrugged .      what a strange person .      he edged over to a flat stone and  with a stick raised in case of resistance from anything below  pulled it up .   there was a chicken sandwich underneath .   it tasted rather like chicken .   a little way away  behind the rocks near the waterhole  a drawing faded into the stone .      this was another desert  elsewhere .  no matter where you were  this place would always be elsewhere .  it was one of those places further than any conceivable journey  but possibly as close as the far side of a mirror  or just a breath away .   there was no sun in the sky here  unless the whole sky was sun   it glowed yellow .  the desert underfoot was still red sand  but hot enough to burn .   a crude drawing of a man appeared on a rock .  gradually  layer by layer  it got more complex  as if the unseen hand was trying to draw bones and organs and a nervous system and a soul .   and he stepped on to the sand and put down his bag which  here  seemed a lot heavier .  he stretched his arms and cracked his knuckles .   at least here he could talk normally .  he daren   t raise his voice down there in the shadow world  lest he raise mountains as well .   he said a word which  on the other side of the rock  would have shaken trees and created meadows .  it meant  in the true language of things which the old man spoke  something like  trickster .  a creature like him appears in many belief systems  although the jolly name can be misleading .  tricksters have that robust sense of humor that puts a landmine under a seat cushion for a bit of a laugh .   a black and white bird appeared  and perched on his head .      you know what to do     said the old man .      him .  what a wonga     said the bird .     i   ve been lookin    at him .  he   s not even heroic .  he   s just in the right place at the right time .      the old man indicated that this was maybe the definition of a hero .      all right  but why not go and get the thing yerself .     said the bird .      you   ve gotta have heroes     said the old man .      and i suppose i   ll have to help     said the bird .  it sniffed  which is quite hard to do through a beak .      yep .  off you go .      the bird shrugged  which is easy to do if you have wings  and flew down off the old man   s head .  it didn   t land on the rock but flew into it  for a moment there was a drawing of a bird  and then it faded .   creators aren   t gods .  they make places  which is quite hard .  it   s men that make gods .  this explains a lot .   the old man sat down and waited .      confront a wizard with the concept of a bathing suit and he   ll start to get nervous .  why does it have to be so skimpy .  he   ll ask .  where can i put the gold embroidery .  how can you have any kind of costume without at least forty useful pockets .  and occult symbols made out of sequins .  there appears to be no place for them .  and where  when you get right down to it  are the lapels .   there is also the concept of acreage .  it is vitally important that as large an amount of wizard as possible is covered  so that timid people and horses are not frightened .  there may be strapping young wizards with copper colored skins and muscles as solid as a plank  but not after sixty years of uu dinners .  it gives senior wizards what they think is called gravitas but is more accurately called gravity .   also  it takes heavy machinery to part a wizard from his pointy hat .   the chair of indefinite studies looked sidelong at the dean .  they both wore a variety of garments  in which red and white stripes predominated .      last one into the water   s a man standing all by himself on the beach .     he shouted .    out on a point of rock  surf washing over his bare feet  mustrum ridcully lit his pipe and cast a line on the end of which was such a fearsome array of spinners and weights that any fish it didn   t hook it might successfully bludgeon .   the change of scenery seemed to be working on the librarian .  within a few minutes of being laid in the sunlight he   d sneezed himself back into his old shape  and he now sat on the beach with a blanket around him and a fern leaf on his head .   it was  indeed  a lovely day .  it was warm  the sea murmured beautifully  the wind whispered in the trees .  the librarian knew he ought to be feeling better  but  instead  he was beginning to feel extremely uneasy .   he stared around him .  the lecturer in recent runes had gone to sleep with his book carefully shading his eyes .  it had originally been entitled principles of thaumic propagation but  because of the action of the sunlight and some specialized high frequency vibrations from the sand granules on the beach the words on the cover now read the omega conspiracy .    in the middle distance was the window .  it hung in the air  a simple square into a shadowy room .  the archchancellor hadn   t trusted the window catch and had propped up the window with a piece of wood .  a warning label pinned to it showed that some thought had gone into the wording     do not remove this wood .  not even to see what happens .  important .      there appeared to be some forest behind the beach which rose a little way up the side of a small yet quite pointy mountain  certainly not tall enough to have snow on it .   some of the trees lining the beach looked hauntingly familiar  and spoke to the librarian of home .  this was strange  because he had been born in moon pond lane  ankh morpork  next to the saddle makers .  but they spoke to the home in his bones .  he had an urge to climb     but there was something wrong with the trees .  he looked down at the pretty shells on the beach .  there was something wrong with them  too .  creepily  worryingly wrong .   a few birds wheeled overhead  and they were wrong .  they were the right shape  as far as he knew  and they seemed to be making the right noises .  but they were still wrong .   oh  dear     he tried to stop the sneeze as it gathered nasal momentum  but this is impossible for anyone who wants to continue to go through life with their eardrums .   there was a snort  a clattering sound  and the librarian changed into something suitable for the beach .      it is often said about desert environments that there is in fact a lot of nutritious food around  if only you know what to look for .   rincewind mused on this as he pulled a plate of chocolate covered sponge cakes from their burrow .  they had dried coconut flakes on them .   he turned the plate cautiously .   well  you couldn   t argue with it .  he was finding food in the desert .  in fact  he was even finding dessert in the desert .   perhaps it was some special talent hitherto undiscovered by the kind people who had occasionally shared their food with him in the last few months .  they hadn   t eaten this sort of thing .  they   d ground up seeds and dug up skinny yams and eaten things with more eyeballs than the watch had found after that business with medley the medical kleptomaniac .   so something was going right for him .  out here in the red hot wilderness something wanted him to stay alive .  this was a worrying thought .  no one ever wanted him alive for something nice .   this was rincewind after several months  his wizardly robe was quite short now .  bits had been torn off or used as string or  after some particularly resistant hors d   oeuvres  as bandages .  it showed his knees  and wizards are nowhere near championship standard at knees .  they tend to appear  as the book might put it  a knobbly savage .   but he   d kept his hat .  he   d woven a new wide brim for it  and he   d had to restore the crown once or twice with fresh bits of robe  and most of the sequins had been replaced with bits of shell stitched on with grass  but it was still his hat  the same old hat .  a wizard without a hat was just a sad man with a suspicious taste in clothes .  a wizard without a hat wasn   t anyone .   although this particular wizard had a hat  he didn   t have keen enough eyes to see the drawing appear on a red rock half hidden in the scrub .   it started off like a bird .  then  without at any time being other than smears of ochre and charcoal that had been there for years  it began to change shape     he set off towards the distant mountains .  they   d been in view for several days .  he hadn   t the faintest idea if they represented a sensible direction but at least they were one .   the ground shivered underfoot .  it had been doing that once or twice a day for a while  and that was another odd thing  because this didn   t look like volcano country .  this was the kind of country where  if you watched a large cliff for a few hundred years  you might see a rock drop off and you   d talk about it for ages .  everything about it said that it had got over all the more energetic geological exercises a long time ago and was a nice quiet country which  in other circumstances  a man might be at home in .   he became aware after a while that a kangaroo was watching him from the top of a small rock .  he   d seen the things before  bounding away through the bushes .  they didn   t usually hang around when there were humans about .   this one was stalking him .  they were vegetarian  weren   t they .  it wasn   t as though he was wearing green .   finally it sprang out of the bushes and landed in front of him .   it brushed one ear with a paw  and gave rincewind a meaningful look .   it brushed the other ear with the other paw  and wrinkled its nose .      yes  fine  good     said rincewind .  he started to edge away  and then stopped .  after all  it was just a big   well  rabbit  with a long tail and the kind of feet you normally see associated with red noses and baggy pants .      i   m not frightened of you     he said .     why should i be frightened of you .         well     said the kangaroo     i could kick your stomach out through your neck .         ah .  you can talk .         you   re a quick one     said the kangaroo .  it rubbed an ear again .      something wrong .     said rincewind .      no  that   s the kangaroo language .  i   m trying it out .         what  one scratch for    yes     one for    no    .  that sort of thing .      the kangaroo scratched an ear  and then remembered itself .     yep     it said .  it wrinkled its nose .      and that wrinkling .     said rincewind .      oh  that means    come quick  someone   s fallen down a deep hole        said the kangaroo .      that one gets used a lot .         you   d be amazed .         and   what   s kangaroo for    you are needed for a quest of the utmost importance    .     said rincewind  with guileful innocence .      you know  it   s funny you should ask that        the sandals barely moved .  rincewind rose from them like a man leaving the starting blocks  and when he landed his feet were already making running movements in the air .   after a while the kangaroo came alongside and accompanied him in a series of easy bounds .      why are you running away without even listening to what i have to say .         i   ve had long experience of being me     panted rincewind .     i know what   s going to happen .  i   m going to be dragged into things that shouldn   t concern me .  and you   re just a hallucination caused by rich food on an empty stomach  so don   t you try to stop me .         stop you .     said the kangaroo .     when you   re heading in the right direction .      rincewind tried to slow down  but his method of running was very efficiently based on the idea that stopping was the last thing he   d do .  legs still moving  he ran out over the empty air and plunged into the void .   the kangaroo looked down and  with a certain amount of satisfaction  wrinkled its nose .         archchancellor .      ridcully awoke  and sat up .  the lecturer in recent runes was hurrying up  out of breath .      the bursar and i went for a walk along the beach     he said .     and can you guess where we ended up .         in kiddling street  quirm     said ridcully tartly  brushing an exploring beetle off his beard .     that little bit by the teashop  with the trees in it .         that   s astonishing  archchancellor .  because  you know  in fact  we didn   t .  we wound up back here .  we   re on a tiny island .  were you having a rest .         a few moments    cogitating     said ridcully .     any idea where we are yet  mister stibbons .      ponder looked up from his notebook .     i won   t be able to work that out precisely until sundown  sir .  but i think we   re pretty close to the rim .         and i think we found where the professor of cruel and unusual geography has been camping     said the lecturer in recent runes .  he rummaged in a deep pocket .     there was a camp  and a fireplace .  bamboo furniture and whatnot .  socks on a washing line .  and this .      he pulled out the remains of a small notebook .  it was standard uu issue .  ridcully would never let anyone have a new one until they   d filled up every page on both sides .      it was just lying there     said the lecturer in recent runes .     i   m afraid ants have been eating it .      ridcully flicked it open and read the first page .        some interesting observations on mono island        he said .        a most singular place .         he flicked through the rest of the book .     just a list of plants and fishes     he said .     doesn   t look all that special to me  but then i ain   t a geography man .  why   s he callin    it mono island .         it means one island     said ponder .      well  you   ve just told me it is one island     said ridcully .     anyway  i can see several more out there .  severe lack of imagination  i suggest .     he tucked the notebook into his robe .     right  then .  no sign of the chap himself .         strangely  no .         probably went swimming and was eaten by a pineapple     said ridcully .     how   s the librarian doing  mister stibbons .  comfortable  is he .         you should know  sir     said ponder .     you   ve been sitting on him for three quarters of an hour .      ridcully looked down at the deckchair .  it was covered with red fur .     this is    .         yes  sir .         i thought perhaps our geography man had brought it with him .         not  er  with the black toenails  sir .      ridcully peered further .     should i get up  do you think .         well  he is a deckchair  sir .  so being sat on is a perfectly normal activity for him  i suppose .         we must find a cure  stibbons .  this is too strange           coo ee  gentlemen .      there was activity in front of the window .  it centered around a vision in pink  although admittedly the sort of vision associated with the more erratic kind of hallucinogen .   in theory there is no dignified way for a lady of a certain age to climb through a window  but nevertheless this one was attempting it .  in fact she moved with more than dignity  which is something that is given away free with kings and bishops  what she had was respectability  which is homemade out of cast iron .  however  at some point she would have to show a bit of ankle  and she was wedged awkwardly on the sill while trying to prevent this from happening .   the senior wrangler coughed .  if he had been wearing a tie he would have straightened it .      ah     said ridcully .     the inestimable mrs .  whitlow .  someone go and give her a hand  stibbons .         i   ll help     said the senior wrangler  just a little faster than he meant .    the university   s housekeeper turned and spoke to someone unseen beyond the window and then turned back  her shouting at subordinates expression briefly visible before it was eclipsed by her much sunnier talking to wizards one .   the chair of indefinite studies had once upset the senior wrangler by saying that the housekeeper had a face full of chins  but there was a glossiness about her that put some people in mind of a candle that had been kept in the warm for too long .  there wasn   t anything approaching a straight line anywhere on mrs .  whitlow  until she found that something hadn   t been dusted properly  when you could use her lips as a ruler .   most of the faculty walked in dread of her .  she had strange powers that they couldn   t quite get a grip on  like the ability to get the beds made and the windows washed .  a wizard who could wield a staff crackling with power against dreadful monsters from some ghastly region was nevertheless quite capable of picking up a feather duster by the wrong end and seriously injuring himself with it .  at mrs .  whitlow   s whim people   s clothes got washed and socks got darned .   if anyone annoyed her  they found their study spring cleaned more often than was good for them  and since to a wizard his room is as personal an item as his trouser pockets this was a terrible vengeance .      ai just thought you gentlemen would like a morning snack     she said  as the wizards helped her down .     so ai took the liberty of getting the gels to put together a cold collation .  ai   ll just go and fetch it        the archchancellor stood up hastily .     well done  mrs .  whitlow .         er   a morning snack .     said the senior wrangler .     it looks like mid afternoon to me       his tone made it clear that if mrs .  whitlow wanted it to be the morning  he wasn   t going to cause any trouble .      speed of light crossing the disc     said ponder .     we are close to the rim  i   m sure .  i   m trying to remember how you tell the time by looking at the sun .         i should leave it for a while     said the senior wrangler  squinting under his hand .     it   s too bright to see the numbers at the moment .      ridcully nodded happily .     i   m sure we could all do with a snack     he said .     something suitable for the beach  perhaps .         cold pork and mustard     said the dean  waking up .      possibly some beer     said the senior wrangler .      and have we got any of those pies  you know  the ones with the egg inside them .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     although i must say i   ve always thought that it was rather cruel to the chicken        there was a soft little sound  very similar to the one you get  aged around seven  when you stick your finger in your mouth and flick it out again quickly and think it is incredibly funny .   ponder turned his head  dreading the sight he was about to see .   mrs .  whitlow had a tray of cutlery in one hand and was prodding ineffectually at the air with the stick that she held in the other .      ai only moved it to get things through     she said .     now ai can   t seem to quate find where the silly thing is supposed to go .      where there had been a dark rectangle opening into the geographer   s dingy study  there was now only waving palms and sunlit sand .  strictly speaking  it could be said to be an improvement .  it depended on your point of view .       rincewind surfaced  gasping for breath .  he   d fallen into a waterhole .   it was in   well  it looked as though once there had been a cave  and the roof had collapsed .  there was a big circle of blue right above him .   rocks had fallen down here  and sand had blown in  and seeds had taken root .  cool  damp and green   the place was a little oasis  tucked away from the sun and the wind .   he pulled himself out of the water and looked around while he drained off .  vines had grown among the rocks .  a few small trees had managed to take root in the crack .  there was even a little bit of a beach .  by the look of the stains on the rocks  the water had once been a lot higher .   and there   rincewind sighed .  wasn   t that just typical .  you got some quiet little beauty spot miles from anywhere  and there was always some graffiti artist ready to spoil it .  it was like that time when he was hiding out in the morpork mountains  and right in the back of one of the deepest caves some vandal had drawn loads of stupid bulls and antelopes .  rincewind had been so disgusted he   d wiped them off .  and they   d left lots of old bones and junk lying around .  some people had no idea how to behave .   here  they   d covered the rock walls with drawings in white  red and black .  animals again  rincewind noticed .  they didn   t even look particularly realistic .   he stopped  water dripping off him  in front of one .  someone had probably wanted to draw a kangaroo .  there were the ears and the tail and the clown feet .  but they looked alien  and there were so many lines and cross hatchings that the figure seemed   odd .  it looked as though the artist hadn   t just wanted to draw a kangaroo from the outside but had wanted to show the inside as well  and then had wanted to show the kangaroo last year and today and next week and also what it was thinking  all at the same time  and had set out to do the whole thing with some ochre and a stick of charcoal .   it seemed to move in his head .   he blinked  but it still hurt .  his eyes seemed to want to wander off in different directions .   rincewind hurried further along the cave  ignoring the rest of the paintings .  the piled rubble of the collapsed ceiling reached nearly to the surface  but there was space on the other side  going on into darkness .  it looked as though he was in a piece of tunnel that had collapsed .      you walked right past it     said the kangaroo .   he turned .  it was standing on the little beach .      i didn   t see you get down here     said rincewind .     how did you get down here .         come on  i   ve got to show you something .  you can call me scrappy  if you like .         why .         we   re mates  ain   t we .  i   m here to help you .         oh  dear .         can   t make it alone across this land  mate .  how d   you think you   ve survived so far .  water   s bloody hard to find out here these days .         oh  i don   t know  i just keep falling into        rincewind stopped .      yeah     said the kangaroo .     strike you as odd  does it .         i thought i was just naturally lucky     said rincewind .  he thought about what he   d just said .     i must have been crazy .      there weren   t even flies down here .  there was the occasional faint ripple on the water  and that wasn   t comforting  since there wasn   t apparently anything to stir the surface .  up above  the sun was torching the ground and the flies swarmed like  well  flies .      why isn   t there anyone else here .     he said .      come and see     said the kangaroo .   rincewind raised his hands and backed away .     are we talking teeth and stings and fangs .         just look at that painting there  mate .         what  the one of the kangaroo .         which one   s that  mate .      rincewind looked along the wall .  the kangaroo picture wasn   t where he remembered it .      i could   ve sworn           that   s the one i want you to look at  over there .      rincewind looked at the stone .  what it showed  outlined in red ochre  were dozens of hands .   he sighed .     oh  right     he said  wearily .     i see the problem .  exactly the same thing happens to me .         what   re you talking about  mister .         it   s just the same with me when i try to take snaps with an iconograph     said rincewind .     you set up a nice picture  the demon paints away  and when you look at it  whoops  you had your thumb in the way .  i must have got a dozen pictures of my thumb .  no  i can see your lad there  doing his painting  in a bit of a hurry  got his brush all ready then  splosh  he   d forgotten to take his hand off the           no .  it   s the painting underneath i   m talking about  mister .      rincewind looked closer .  there were fainter lines there  which you   d think were just flaws in the rock if you weren   t looking .  rincewind squinted .  other lines seemed to fit   yes  someone had painted figures   they were     he blew away some sand .   yes  they were        curiously familiar        yes     said scrappy  his voice apparently coming from a distance .     look a bit like you  don   t they    .         but they   re       he began .  he straightened up .     how long have these paintings been here .         well  lessee     said the kangaroo .     out of the sun and the weather  nothing to disturb    em   twenty thousand years .         that   s not right .         nah  true  prob   ly thirty thousand  in a nice sheltered spot like this .         but these are   that   s my           o    course  when i say thirty thousand years     said the kangaroo  i mean it depends how you look at it .  even them hand paintings on the top   ve been there five thousand years  see .  and those faint ones   oh  yes  got to be pretty old  tens of thousands of years  except           except what .         they weren   t here last week  mate .         you   re saying they   ve been here for ages   but not for very long .         see .  i knew you was clever .         and now you   re going to tell me what the hell you   re talking about .         right .         excuse me  i   ll just find something to eat .      rincewind lifted up a rock .  there were a couple of jam sandwiches underneath .      the wizards were civilized men of considerable education and culture .  when faced with being inadvertently marooned on a desert island they understood immediately that the first thing to do was place the blame .      it really was very clear .     shouted ridcully  waving his hand frantically in the air at the place where the window had been .     and i put a sign on it .         yes  but you   ve got a    do not disturb    sign nailed to your study door     said the senior wrangler     and you still expect mrs .  whitlow to bring you your tea in the mornings .         gentlemen  please .     said ponder stibbons .     we   ve got to sort some things out right now .         yes indeed .     roared the dean .     and it was his fault .  the sign wasn   t large enough .         i mean we have to           there are ladies present .     snapped the senior wrangler .      lady .     mrs .  whitlow uttered the word carefully and with deliberation  like a gambler putting down a winning hand .  she stood primly watching them .  her expression said  i   m not worried  because with all these wizards around nothing bad can happen .   the wizards adjusted their attitudes .      ai do apologize if ai   ve done something wrong     she said .      oh  not  not wrong     said ridcully quickly .     not exactly wrong .  as such .         anyone could have done it     said the senior wrangler .     i could hardly read the lettering myself .         and  taking the broad view  it   s certainly better to be stuck out here in the fresh air and sunshine than in that stuffy study     ridcully went on .      that   s quite a broad view  sir     said ponder doubtfully .      and we   ll be back home in two shakes of a lamb   s tail     said ridcully  beaming .      unfortunately  this doesn   t look a very agricultural sort of       ponder began .      figure of speech  mister stibbons  figure of speech .         the sun   s going down  sir     ponder persisted .     which means it   ll be night time soon .      ridcully looked nervously at mrs .  whitlow  and then at the sun .      is there a problem .     said mrs .  whitlow .      oh  good heavens  no .     said ridcully hastily .      ai notice the little hole in the wall doesn   t seem to have come back     said mrs .  whitlow .      we  er           it   s a little prank  is it .     the housekeeper went on .     ai   m sure you gentlemen will have your fun  and no mistake .         yes  that   s           but ai should be grateful if you would send me back now  archchancellor .  we   re doing the laundry this afternoon  and ai   m afraid we   re having a lot of trouble with the dean   s sheets .      the dean suddenly knew how a mosquito feels in the beam of a searchlight .      we   ll sort this out directly  never fear  mrs .  whitlow     said ridcully  not taking his eyes off the wretched dean .     in the meantime  why don   t you take a seat and enjoy the rather wonderful sheets  i mean sunshine .      there was a clack as the deckchair folded itself up .  then it sneezed .      ah  back with us again  librarian     ridcully went on  as the orangutan sprawled in the sand .     help him up  please  mister stibbons .  a word to the rest of you  please .  if you   ll excuse us a moment  mrs .  whitlow .  faculty meeting        the wizards went into a huddle .      it was tomato sauce  all right .     said the dean hurriedly .     i just happened to be having a snack in bed and you know how that stuff stains .         i   m sure we   re not at all interested in the state of your sheets  dean     said ridcully .      no  indeed     said the senior wrangler brightly .      not us     said the lecturer in recent runes  slapping the dean on the back .      we have to get back     said ridcully .     we can   t spend the night alone with mrs .  whitlow .  it wouldn   t be decent .         i don   t see why anyone should make a fuss about a bit of tomato sauce .  i at least cleaned all the beans off           well  we   re not actually alone  are we .  not as such     said the lecturer in recent runes .     i mean  there   s seven of us  not including the librarian .         yes  but we   re all alone together     said ridcully urgently .     there could be talk .         what about .     said the chair of indefinite studies  who sometimes lagged behind .      you know     said the lecturer in recent runes .     seven men and one woman   it doesn   t bear thinking about           well  i for one will certainly veto any suggestion about ordering another six women     said the chair firmly .      perhaps the hole will open again .     said the senior wrangler .      i doubt it     said ridcully .     ponder says that our coming through probably altered the thaumostatic balance .  what do you think  dean .         just tomato sauce     said the dean .     it could have happened to anyone .         i meant about our being marooned on this island     said ridcully .     any ideas  anyone .  we must tackle this as a team .         what shall we tell mrs .  whitlow .     whispered the senior wrangler .     she thinks this is a prank .         senior wrangler  we are elderly  wise and experienced wizards     said ridcully .     students are prankers .         pranksters  possibly     mumbled ponder stibbons .      whatever .  we do not indulge in pranks .         with us it   s a fully fledged gold embossed cock up or nothing     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i don   t see why people are making such a fuss about a bit of tomato sauce that hardly even shows up     muttered the dean .      no one brought any suitable spells .     said ridcully .      at four in the morning .  for the beach .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     of course not .         then we shall have to fall back on our own resources .  there   s bound to be a ship along sooner or later .  the point is  gentlemen     he added     that we are the product of a university education .  i   m quite sure primitive people have no difficulties surviving in a place like this  and think of all the things we have that our rude forefathers lacked .         mrs .  whitlow  for a start     said the chair of indefinite studies .      she wouldn   t put up with rudeness of any sort     the senior wrangler agreed .      do you know anything about boats  dean .  i believe you got a brown for rowing when you were slimmer     said ridcully .     please note that this question did not raise the matter of sheets in any way .         well  indeed  boat building is not a difficult task     said the dean  surfacing .     even primitive people can build boats  and we are civilized men  after all .         then you   re head of the boat building committee     said ridcully .     senior wrangler can help you .  the rest of you fellows had better see if there   s any fresh water .  and food .  knock down a few coconuts .  that sort of thing .         and what will you do  archchancellor .     said the senior wrangler nastily .      i shall be the protein acquisition committee     said ridcully  waving his fishing rod .      you going to stand here and fish again .  what good   s that going to do .         it might result in a fish dinner  senior wrangler .         has anyone got any tobacco .     said the dean .     i   m dying for a smoke .      the wizards went off about their tasks  complaining and blaming one another .   and just inside the forest  in the leafy debris  roots unfolded and a number of very small plants began to grow like hell           this is the last continent     said scrappy .     it was   put together last  and   differently .         looks pretty old to me     said rincewind .     ancient .  those hills look as old as the hills .         they were made thirty thousand years old     said the kangaroo .      come on .  they look millions of years old .         yep .  thirty thousand years ago they were made a million years ago .  time here is     the kangaroo shrugged     not the same .  it was   glued together differently  right .         search me     said rincewind .     i   m a man sitting here listening to a kangaroo .  i   m not arguing .         i   m trying to find words you might understand     said the kangaroo reproachfully .      good  keep going  you   ll get there .  want a jam sandwich .  it   s gooseberry .         no .  strictly herbivore  mate .  listen           unusual  gooseberry jam .  i mean  you don   t often see it .  raspberry and strawberry  yes  even blackcurrant .  i shouldn   t think more than one jar of jam in a hundred is gooseberry .  sorry  do go on .         you   re taking this seriously  are you .         am i smiling .         have you ever noticed how time goes slower in big spaces .      the sandwich stopped halfway to rincewind   s mouth .     actually  that is true .  but it only seems slower .         so .  when this place was made there wasn   t much space and time left over to work with  see .  he had to bodge them together to make them work harder .  time happens to space and space happens to time           you know  i think there could be plum in it  too .     said rincewind  with his mouth full .     and maybe some rhubarb .  you   d be amazed how often they do that sort of thing .  you know  stuff cheaper fruit in .  i met this man in an inn once  he worked for a jam maker in ankh morpork  and he said they put in any old rubbish and some red dye  and i said what about the raspberry pips  and he said they make them out of wood .  wood .  he said they   d got a machine for stamping    em out .  can you believe that .         will you stop talking about jam and be sensible for a moment .      rincewind lowered the sandwich .     good grief  i hope not     he said .     i   m sitting in a cave in a country where everything bites you and it never rains and i   m talking  no offense  to a herbivore that smells of a carpet in a house where there are a lot of excitable puppies  and i   ve suddenly got this talent for finding jam sandwiches and inexplicable fairy cakes in unexpected places  and i   ve been shown something very odd in a picture on some old cave wall  and suddenly said kangaroo tells me time and space are all wrong and wants me to be sensible .  what  when you get right down to it  is in it for me .         look  this place wasn   t finished  right .  it wasn   t fitted in   turned around       the kangaroo looked at rincewind as if reading his mind  which was the case .     you know like with a jigsaw puzzle .  the last piece is the right shape but you have to turn it round to fit .  right .  now think of the piece as a bloody big continent that   s got to be turned around through about nine dimensions and you   re home and           dry .     said rincewind .      bloody right .         er   i know this may seem like a foolish question     said rincewind  trying to dislodge a gooseberry pip from a tooth cavity     but why me .         it   s your fault .  you arrived here and suddenly things had always been wrong .      rincewind looked back towards the wall .  the earth trembled again .      can you hop that past me again .     he said .      something went wrong in the past .      the kangaroo looked at rincewind   s blank  jam smeared expression  and tried again .      your arrival caused a wrong note     it ventured .      what in .      the creature waved a paw vaguely .      all this     it said .     you could call it a bloody multidimensional knuckle of localized phase space  or maybe you could just call it the song .      rincewind shrugged .     i don   t mind putting my hand up to killing a few spiders     he said .     but it was me or them .  i mean some of those come at you at head height           you changed history .         oh  come on  a few spiders don   t make that much difference  some of them were using their webs as trampolines  it was a case of    boing    and next moment           no  not history from now on  history that   s already happened     said the kangaroo .      i   ve changed things that already happened long ago .         right .         by arriving here i changed what   s already happened .         yep .  look  time isn   t as straightforward as you think           i never thought it was     said rincewind .     and i   ve been round it few times        the kangaroo waved a paw expansively .     it   s not just that things in the future can affect things in the past     he said .     things that didn   t happen but might have happened can   affect things that really happened .  even things that happened and shouldn   t have happened and were removed still have  oh  call    em shadows in time  things left over which interfere with what   s going on .  between you and me     it went on  waggling its ears     it   s all just held together by spit now .  no one   s ever got round to tidying it up .  i   m always amazed when tomorrow follows today  and that   s the truth .         me too     said rincewind .     oh  me too .         still  no worries  eh .         i think i   ll lay off the jam     said rincewind .  he put the sandwich down .     why me .      the kangaroo scratched its nose .        s got to be someone     it said .      and what   m i supposed to do .     said rincewind .      wind it into the world .         there   s a key .         might be .  depends .      rincewind turned and looked at the rock pictures again  the pictures that hadn   t been there a few weeks ago and then suddenly had always been there .   figures holding long sticks .  figures in long robes .  the artist had done a pretty good job of drawing something quite unfamiliar .  and in case there was any doubt  you only had to look at what was on their heads .      yeah .  we call them the pointy heads     said the kangaroo .         he   s started catching fish     said the senior wrangler .     that means he   ll come over all smug and start asking what plans we   ve got for making a boat at any minute  you know what he   s like .      the dean looked at some sketches he   d made on a rock .      how hard can it be to build a boat .     he said .     people with bones in their noses build boats .  and we are the end product of thousands of years of enlightenment .  building a boat is not beyond men like us  senior wrangler .         quite  dean .         all we have to do is search this island until we find a book with a title like practical boat building for beginners .         exactly .  it   ll be plain sailing after that  dean .  ahaha .      he glanced up  and swallowed hard .  mrs .  whitlow was sitting on a log in the shade  fanning herself with a large leaf .   the sight stirred things in the senior wrangler .  he was not at all sure what they were  but little details like the way something creaked when she moved twanged bits of the senior wrangler as well .      you all right  senior wrangler .  you look as if the heat is getting to you .         just a little   warm  dean .      the dean looked past him as he loosened his collar .     well  they haven   t been long     he said .   the other wizards were walking down the beach .  one advantage of a long wizarding robe is that it can be held like an apron  and the chair of indefinite studies was bulging at the front even more than usual .      found anything to eat .     said the senior wrangler .      er   yes .         fruit and nuts  i suppose     grumbled the dean .      er   yes  and then again  no     said the lecturer in recent runes .     um   it   s rather odd        the chair of indefinite studies let his burden spill out on to the sand .  there were coconuts  other nuts of various sizes  and assorted hairy or knobbly vegetable things .      all rather primitive     said the dean .     and probably poisonous .         well  the bursar   s been eating things like there   s no tomorrow     said the lecturer in recent runes .  the bursar burped happily .      that doesn   t mean there will be     said the dean .     what   s up with you fellows .  you keep looking at one another .         er   we   ve tasted a few things too  dean     said the lecturer in recent runes .      ah  i see the gatherers have returned .     roared ridcully happily  walking towards them .  he waved three fish on a string .     anything resembling potatoes in there  chaps .         you   re not going to believe any of this     mumbled the lecturer in recent runes .     you   re going to accuse us of trickery .         what are you talking about .     said the dean .     they don   t look very tricky to me .      the chair of indefinite studies gave a sigh .     have a coconut     he said .      do they go off bang or something .         no  nothing like that at all .      the dean picked up a nut  gave it a suspicious look  and banged it on a stone .  it fell into two exact halves .   there was no milk to spill out .  inside the husk was a brown inner shell  full of soft white fibers .   ridcully picked up a bit of it and sniffed .     i don   t believe this     he said .     that   s not natural .         so .     said the dean .     it   s a coconut full of coconut .  what   s odd about that .      the archchancellor broke off a piece of the shell and handed it over .  it was soft and slightly crumbly .   the dean tasted it .     chocolate .     he said .   ridcully nodded .     dairy milk  by the taste of it .  with a creamy coconut filling .         thaf   s nod poffible     said the dean  his cheeks bulging .      spit it out  then .         i think i might perhaps try a little more     said the dean  swallowing .     in a spirit of enquiry  you understand .      the senior wrangler picked up a knobbly bluish nut about the size of a fist and tapped it experimentally .  it shattered but was held together because of the gooey contents .   the smell was very familiar .  a careful taste confirmed it .  the wizards regarded the nut   s innards in shocked silence .      it   s even got the blue veins     said the senior wrangler .      yes  we know  we tried one     said the chair of indefinite studies weakly .     and  after all  there is such a thing as a bread fruit           i   ve heard of it     said ridcully .     and i might believe there   s such a thing as a nat   rally chocolate covered coconut  because chocolate   s a kind of potato           a bean  possibly     said ponder stibbons .      whatever .  but i damn well don   t believe there   s such a thing as a mature lancre blue runny cheese nut .     he prodded the thing .      but nature does come up with some very funny coincidences  archchancellor     said the chair of indefinite studies .     why  i myself  as a child  once dug up a carrot which  ahaha  most amusingly looked just like a man with a           er       said the dean .   it was only a little sound  but it had a certain portentous quality .  they turned to look at him .   he   d been peeling away the yellowing husk from something like a small bean pod .  what he now held        hah  yes  good joke     said ridcully .     they certainly don   t grow on           i didn   t do anything .  look  it   s still got bits of pith and stuff on it .     said the dean  waving the thing wildly .   ridcully took it  sniffed it  held it up to his ear and shook it  and then said quietly     show me where you found it  will you .      the bush was in a small clearing .  dozens of the little green shoots hung down between its tiny leaves .  each was tipped by a flower  but the flowers were curling up and falling off .  the crop was ripe .   multicolored beetles zoomed away from the bush as the dean selected a pod and peeled it open  revealing a slightly damp white cylinder .  he examined it for a few seconds  then put one end in his mouth  took a box of matches from a pocket in his hat  and lit up .      quite a smooth smoke     he said .  his hand shook slightly as he took the cigarette out of his mouth and blew a smoke ring .     cork filter  too     he said .      er   well  both tobacco and cork are naturally occurring vegetable products     quavered the chair of indefinite studies .      chair .     said ridcully .      yes  archchancellor .         shut up  will you .         yes  archchancellor .      ponder stibbons broke open a cork tip .  there was a tiny ring of what well might have been        seeds     he said .     but that can   t be right  because        the dean  wreathed in blue smoke  had been staring at the nearby vines .      has it occurred to anyone else that those pods are remarkably rectangular .     he said .      go for it  dean     said ridcully .   a brown outer husk was pulled aside .      ah     said the dean .     biscuits .  just the thing with cheese .         er       said ponder .  he pointed .   just beyond the bush a couple of boots lay on the ground .      rincewind ran his fingers over the cave wall .   the ground shook again .      what   s causing that .     he said .      oh  some people say it   s an earthquake  some say it   s the country drying up  others say it   s a giant snake rushing through the ground     said scrappy .      which is it .         the wrong sort of question .      they definitely looked like wizards  thought rincewind .  they had that basic cone shape familiar to anyone who had been to unseen university .  they were holding staffs .  even with the crude materials available to them the ancient artists had managed to portray the knobs on the ends .   but uu hadn   t even existed thirty thousand years ago     then he noticed  for the first time  the drawing right at the end of the cave .  there were a lot of the ochre handprints on top of it  almost   and the thought expanded in his mind in a sneaky way   as though someone had thought that they could hold it down on to the rock  prevent it   this was a silly thought  he knew   prevent it from getting out .   he brushed away some dust .      oh  no     he mumbled .   it was an oblong box .  the artist hadn   t got the hang of conventional perspective  but there was no doubt that he   d tried to paint hundreds of little legs .      that   s my luggage .         always the same  right .     said scrappy  behind him .     you arrive okay and your luggage ends up somewhere else .         thousands of years in the past .         could be a valuable antique .         it   s got my clothes in it .         they   ll probably be back in style  then .         you don   t understand .  it   s a magical box .  it   s supposed to end up where i am .         it probably is where you are .  just not when .         what .  oh .         i told you time and space were all stirred up  didn   t i .  you wait till you   re on your journey .  there   s places where there   s several times happening at once and places where there   s hardly any time at all  and times when there   s hardly any place .  you   ve got to sort it out  right .         what  like shuffling cards .     said rincewind .  he made a mental note about    on your journey .         yep .         that   s impossible .         y   know  i   d have said so too .  but you will do it .  now  you   ll have to concentrate about this bit  right .     scrappy took a deep breath .     i know you   re going to do it because you   ve already done it .      rincewind put his head in his hands .      i told you about time and space here being mixed up     said the kangaroo .      i   ve already saved the country  have i .         yep .         oh  good .  well  that wasn   t so difficult .  i don   t want much   a medal  perhaps  the grateful thanks of the population  maybe a small pension and a ticket home       he looked up .     i   m not going to get any of that  though  am i .         no  because              i haven   t already done it yet .         exactly .  you   re getting the hang of it .  you have to go and do what we know you   re going to do because you   ve already done it .  in fact  if you hadn   t done it already i wouldn   t be here to make sure it gets done .  so you   d better do it .         facing terrible dangers .      the kangaroo waved a paw .     slightly terrible     it said .      and go for many miles over parched and trackless terrain .         well  yeah .  we haven   t got any of the other sort .      rincewind brightened up slightly .     and i   ll meet comrades whose strengths and skills will be a great help to me .         don   t bet on it .         any chance of a magic sword .         what would you do with a magic sword .         fair enough .  fair enough .  forget the magic sword .  but i   ve got to have something .  cloak of invisibility  potion of strength  something like that           that stuffs for people who know how to use them  mister .  you   ll have to rely on your native wit .         i   ve got nothing .  what sort of quest is that .  can   t you give me any hints .         you may have to drink some beer     said the kangaroo .  it cringed back for a moment  as if confident of facing a storm of objections .   rincewind said     oh .  right .  well  i know how to do that .  what direction am i supposed to go .         oh  you   ll find it .         and when i get to where i   m going  what am i supposed to do .         it   ll   be obvious  right .         and how will i know i   ve done it .         the wet will come back .         the wet what .         it   ll rain .         i thought it never rained here     said rincewind .      see .  i knew you were smart .      the sun was setting .  the rocks around the edge of the cave glowed red .  rincewind stared at them for a while  and reached a brave decision .      i   m not the man to shirk when the fate of whole countries is in the balance     he said .     i will make a start at dawn to complete this task which i have already completed  by hoki  or my name isn   t rincewand .         rincewind     said the kangaroo .      indeed .         well said  mate .  then i should get some sleep  if i were you .  could be a busy day tomorrow .         i   ve not been found wanting when duty calls     said rincewind .  he reached into a hollow log and  after some rummaging around  pulled out a plate of egg and chips .     see you at dawn  then .      ten minutes later he stretched out on the sand with the log as his pillow  and looked up at the purple sky .  already a few stars were coming out .   now  there was something   oh  yes .  the kangaroo was lying down on the other side of the water hole .   rincewind raised his head .     you said something about when    he    created this place  and you talked about    him              yep .         only   i   m pretty sure i   ve met the creator .  short bloke .  does all his own snowflakes .         yeah .  and when did you meet him .         when he was making the world  as a matter of fact .     rincewind decided to refrain from mentioning that he   d dropped a sandwich into a rockpool at the time .  people don   t like to hear that they may have evolved from somebody   s lunch .     i get around quite a lot     he added .      are you coming the raw prawn .         what .  oh  no .  certainly not .  coming a raw prawn .  not me .  that   s something i never do .  or even cooked prawns .  or crustaceans of any sort  especially in rockpools .  not me .  er   what was it that you actually meant .         well  he didn   t create this place     said scrappy  ignoring him .     this was done after .         can that happen .         why not .         well  it   s not like  you know  building on over the stables  is it .     said rincewind .     someone just wanders along when a world   s all finished and slings down an extra continent .         happens all the time  mate     said scrappy .     bloody hell  yeah .  why not  anyway .  if other creators go around leaving ruddy great empty oceans  someone   s bound to fill    em up  right .  does a world good  too  having a fresh look  new ideas  new ways .      rincewind stared up at the stars .  he had a mental vision of someone walking from world to world  sneaking in extra lands when no one was looking .      yes indeed     he said .     i for one would not have thought of making all the snakes deadly  and all the spiders deadlier than the snakes .  and putting pockets on everything .  great idea .         there you go  then     said scrappy .  he was hardly visible now  as the dark filled up the cave .      made a lot of them  has he .         yep .         why .         so   s maybe at least one of them won   t get mucked up .  always puts kangaroos on    em  too .  sort of a signature  you might say .         does this creator have a name .         nope .  he   s just the man who carries the sack that contains the whole universe .         a leather sack .         sounds like him     the kangaroo agreed .      the whole universe in one small sack .         yep .      rincewind settled back .     i   m glad i   m not religious     he said .     it must be very complicated .      after another five minutes he began to snore .  after half an hour he moved his head slightly .  the kangaroo didn   t seem to be around .   with almost super rincewind speed he was upright and scrambling up the fallen rocks  over the lip of the cave and into the dark oven of the night .   he sighted on a random star and got into his stride  ignoring the bushes that lashed at his bare legs .   hah .   he was not going to be found wanting when duty called .  he did not intend to be found at all .   in the cave the water in the pool rippled under the starlight  the expanding circles lapping against the sand .   on the wall was an ancient drawing of a kangaroo  in white and red and yellow .  the artist had tried to achieve on stone what might better have been attempted with eight dimensions and a large particle accelerator  he   d tried to include not just the kangaroo now but also the kangaroo in the past  and the kangaroo in the future and  in short  not what the kangaroo looked like but what the kangaroo was .   among other things  as it faded  it was grinning .      among the complexities that made up the intelligent biped known to the rest of the world as mrs .  whitlow was this  there was no such thing as an informal meal in mrs .  whitlow   s world .  if mrs .  whitlow made sandwiches even just for herself she would put a sprig of parsley on the top .  she placed a napkin on her lap to drink a cup of tea .  if the table could have a vase of flowers and a placemat with a tasteful view of something nice  so much the better .   it was unthinkable that she should eat a meal balanced on her knees .  in fact it was unthinkable to think of mrs .  whitlow as having knees  although the senior wrangler had to fan himself with his hat occasionally .  so the beach had been scoured to find enough bits of driftwood to make a very rough table  and some suitable rocks to use as seats .   the senior wrangler dusted one off with his hat .     there we are  mrs .  whitlow        the housekeeper frowned .     ai   m really sure it   s not done for the staff to eat with the gentlemen     she said .      be our guest  mrs .  whitlow     said ridcully .      ai really can   t .  it does not do to get ideas above one   s station     said mrs .  whitlow .     ai would never be able to look you in the face again  sir .  ai hope ai know my place .      ridcully looked blank for a moment  and then said quietly     faculty meeting  gentlemen .      the wizards went into another huddle a little way along the beach .      what are we supposed to do about that .         i think it   s very commendable of her .  her world is below stairs  after all .         yes  very well  but it   s not as if there   re any stairs on this island .         could we build some .         we can   t let the poor woman sit off by herself somewhere  that is my point .         we spent ages on that table .         and did you notice something about the driftwood  archchancellor .         looked like perfectly ordinary wood to me  stibbons .  branches  treetrunks and whatnot .         that   s the strange thing  sir  because           it   s very simple  ridcully .  i hope that  as gentlemen  we know how to treat a woman           lady .         let me just say that was unnecessarily sarcastic  dean     said ridcully .     very well .  if the prophet ossory won   t go to the mountain  the mountain must go to the prophet ossory .  as they say in klatch .      he paused .  he knew his wizards .      i believe  in fact  that it   s in omnia that       ponder began .   ridcully waved a hand .     something like that  anyway .      and that is why mrs .  whitlow dined alone at the table  while the wizards sat around the fire a little way away  except that very frequently one of them would lumber over to offer her some choice bit of nature   s bounty .   it was obvious that starvation would not be a problem on this island  although dyspepsia and gout might be .   fish was the main course .  frenzied searching had failed to locate a steak bush so far but had found  in addition to numerous more conventional fruits  a pasta bush  a sort of squash that contained something very much like custard and  to ridcully   s disgust  a pineapple like plant the fruit of which was  when the husk had been stripped away  a large plum pudding .      obviously it   s not really a plum pudding     he protested .     we just think it   s like a plum pudding because it tastes exactly like a   plum pudding       his voice trailed off .      it   s got plums and currants in it     said the senior wrangler .     pass the custard squash  will you .         my point is that we only think they look like currants and plums           no  we also think they taste like currants and plums     said the senior wrangler .     look  archchancellor  there   s no mystery .  obviously wizards have been here before .  this is the result of perfectly ordinary magic .  perhaps our lost geographer did a bit of experimenting .  or it   s sorcery  perhaps .  some of the things that got created in the old days  well  a cigarette bush is very small beer by comparison  eh .         talking of small beer       said the dean  waving his hand     pass me the rum  will you .         mrs .  whitlow doesn   t approve of strong liquor     said the senior wrangler .   the dean glanced at the housekeeper  who was daintily eating a banana  a feat which is quite hard to do .   he put down the coconut shell .     well  she   i am   i don   t see   well  damn it all  that   s all i   ve got to say .         or bad language     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i vote we take some of those bees back with us     said the chair of indefinite studies .     marvelous little creatures .  no footling around being content with making boring honey .  you just reach up and pick one of these handy little wax containers and bob   s your uncle .         she takes all the peel off slowly before she eats it .  oh  dear           are you all right  senior wrangler .  is the heat getting to you .         what .  eh .  hmm .  oh  nothing .  yes .  bees .  wonderful things .      they glanced up at a couple of the bees  who were busying themselves around a flowering bush in the last of the light .  they were leaving little black smoke trails .      shooting around like little rockets     said the archchancellor .     amazing .         i   m still worried about those boots     said the senior wrangler .     you   d think the man had been pulled right out of them .         it   s a tiny island  man     said ridcully .     all we   ve seen is birds  a few little squeaky things and a load of insects .  you don   t get big fierce animals on islands you can practically throw a stone across .  he must   ve just   felt a bit carefree .  it   s a bit hot for boots here  anyway .         so why haven   t we seen him .         hah .  he   s probably lying low     said the dean .     ashamed to face us .  keeping a nice sunny island in your study is against university rules .         is it .     said ponder .     i   ve never seen it mentioned .  how long has it been a rule .         ever since i   ve had to sleep in a freezing bedroom     said the dean  darkly .     pass the bread and butter pudding fruit  will you .         ook     said the librarian .      ah  nice to see you your old shape  old chap     said ridcully .     try and keep it up for longer this time  eh .         ook .      the librarian was sitting behind a pile of fruit .  normally he wouldn   t question such a perfect piece of positioning  but now even the bananas were bothering him .  there was the same sensation of wrongness .  there were long yellow ones  and stubby ones  and red ones  and fat brown ones     he stared at the remains of the fish .  there was a big silver one  and a fat red one  and a small gray one  and a flat one a bit like a plaice        obviously some sorcerer landed here and wanted to make the place more homely     the senior wrangler was saying  but he sounded far off .  the librarian was counting .   the plum pudding plant  the custard squash vine  the chocolate coconut   he turned his head to look at the trees .  and now he knew what he was looking for  he couldn   t see it anywhere .   the senior wrangler stopped talking as the ape scrambled to his knuckles and sped back to the high tide line .  the wizards watched in silence as he scrabbled through the heaped up seashells .  he came back with a double handful  which he dropped triumphantly in front of the archchancellor .      ook .         what   s that  old chap .         ook .         yes  very pretty  but what   s           ook .      the librarian seemed to remember what kind of intellects he was dealing with .  he held up a finger and looked at ridcully enquiringly .     ook .         still not quite with you        two fingers went up .     ook ook .         not sure i fully           ook ook ook .      ponder stibbons looked at the three fingers now raised .     i think he   s counting  sir .     the librarian handed him a banana .      ah  the old    how many fingers am i holding up .     game     said the dean .     but usually we all have to have a bit more to drink first        the librarian waved his hand at the fish  at the meal  at the shells and at the background of trees .  one finger stabbed at the sky .      ook .         it   s all one to you .     said ridcully .     it   s one big place .  it   s one to remember .      the librarian opened his mouth again  and then sneezed .   a very large red seashell lay on the sand .      oh  dear     said ponder stibbons .      that   s interesting     said the chair of indefinite studies .     he   s turned into quite a good specimen of the giant conch .  you can get a marvelous sound out of one of them if you blow in the pointy end           volunteers .     said the dean  almost under his breath .      oh  dear     said ponder again .      what   s up with you .     said the dean .      there   s only one     said ponder .     that   s what he was trying to tell us .         one what .     said ridcully .      of everything  sir .  there   s only one of everything .      it was  he thought later  a good dramatic line .  people ought to have looked at one another in growing and horrified realization and said things like     by george  you know  he   s right .     but these were wizards  capable of thinking very big thoughts in very small chunks .      don   t be daft  man     said ridcully .     there   s millions of the damn shells  for a start .         yes  sir  but look  they   re all different  sir .  all the trees we found   there was only one of each sort  sir .  lots of banana trees  but they all produce different types of bananas .  there was only one cigarette tree  wasn   t there .         lots of bees  though     said ridcully .      but only one swarm     said ponder .      millions of beetles     said the dean .      i don   t think i   ve seen two alike  sir .         well  that   s interesting     said ridcully     but i don   t see           one of anything doesn   t work  sir     said ponder .     it can   t breed .         yes  but they   re only trees  stibbons .         trees need males and females too  sir .         they do .         yes  sir .  sometimes they   re different bits of the same tree  sir .         what .  you sure .         yes  sir .  my uncle grew nuts  sir .         keep it down  boy  keep it down .  mrs .  whitlow might hear you .      ponder was taken aback .     what  sir .  but   well   she is mrs .  whitlow  sir           what   s that got to do with the price of feet .         i mean   presumably there was a mr .  whitlow  sir .      ridcully   s face went wooden for a moment and his lips moved as he tried out various responses .  finally he settled  weakly  for     that   s as maybe  but it all sounds pretty mucky to me .         i   m afraid that   s nature for you  sir .         i used to like walking through the woods on a nice spring morning  stibbons .  you mean to say the trees were at it like knives the whole time .      ponder   s horticultural knowledge found itself a little exhausted at this point .  he tried to remember what he could about his uncle  who   d spent most of his life up a ladder .      i  er  think camel hair brushes are sometimes involved       he began  but ridcully   s expression told him that this wasn   t a welcome fact  so he went on     anyway  sir  ones don   t work .  and there   s another thing  sir .  who smokes the cigarettes .  i mean  if the bush just hopes that butts are going to be dropped around the place  who does it think is going to smoke them .         what .      ponder sighed .     the point about fruit  sir  is that it   s a kind of lure .  a bird   ll eat the fruit and then  er  drop the seeds somewhere .  it   s the way the plant spreads its seeds around .  but we   ve only seen birds and a few lizards on this island  so how           ah  i see what you mean     said ridcully .     you   re thinking  what kind of bird stops flyin    around for a quick smoke .         a puffin     said the bursar .      glad to see you   re still with us  bursar     said ridcully  without looking round .      birds don   t smoke  sir .  you   ve got to ask yourself what   s in it for the bush  you see .  if there were people here  well  i suppose you might get a sort of nicotine tree eventually  because they   d smoke the cigarettes   i mean     he corrected himself  because he prided himself on his logical thought     these things that look like cigarettes  and stub them out around the place  thus spreading the seeds which are in the filter .  some seeds need heat to germinate  sir .  but if there aren   t any people  the bush doesn   t make any sense .         we   re people     said the dean .     and i like a smoke after supper .  everyone knows that .         yes  but with respect  sir  we   ve only been here a couple of hours and i doubt whether the news has spread all the way to small islands     said ponder patiently  and with  as it turned out  one hundred percent inaccuracy .     that   s probably not long enough for one to evolve .         are you tellin    me     said ridcully  like a man with something on his mind     that you think when you eat an apple you   re helping it to       he stopped .     it was bad enough about the trees .     he sniffed .     i shall stick to eating fish .  at least they make their own arrangements .  at a decent distance  i understand .  and you know what i think about evolution  mister stibbons .  if it happens  and frankly i   ve always considered it a bit of a fairy story  it has to happen fast .  look at lemmings  for one thing .         lemmings  sir .         right .  the little blighters keep chargin    over cliffs  right .  and how many have ever changed into birds on the way down  eh .  eh .         well  none  of cou           there   s my point     said ridcully triumphantly .     and it   s no good one of them on the way down thinking     hey  maybe i should waggle my claws a bit     is it .  no  what it ought to do is decide really positively about growing some real wings .         what  in a couple of seconds .  while they   re plunging towards the rocks .         best time .         but lemmings don   t just turn into birds  sir .         lucky for them if they could  though  eh .      there was a roar  far off in the little jungle .  it sounded rather like a foghorn .      are you sure there aren   t any dangerous creatures on this island .     said the dean .      i think i saw some prawns     said the senior wrangler nervously .      no  the archchancellor was right  it   s far too small     said ponder  trying to dismiss the thought of flying lemmings .     it couldn   t possibly support anything that could hurt us  sir .  after all  what would it eat .      now they could all hear something crashing through the trees .      us .     said the dean hesitantly .   a creature blundered out on to the sunset sands .  it was large and seemed to be mainly head   one huge  reptilian head that looked almost as big as the body below it .  it walked on two long hind legs .  there was a tail  but given the amount of teeth now showing at the other end the wizards weren   t inclined to take in too much additional detail .   the creature sniffed the air and roared again .      ah     said ridcully .     the solution to the mystery of the disappearing geographer  i suspect .  well done  senior wrangler .         i think i   ll just       the dean began .      stay still  sir .     hissed ponder .     a lot of reptiles can   t see you if you don   t move .         i can assure you  at the speed i intend nothing is going to see me        the monster turned its head this way and that  and began to lumber forward .      can   t see things that don   t move .     said the archchancellor .     you mean we just have to wait for it to walk into a tree .         mrs .  whitlow   s still sitting there .     said the senior wrangler .   she was in fact spreading some runny cheese on a biscuit in a ladylike fashion .      i don   t think she   s seen it .      ridcully rolled up his sleeve .     i think a round of fireballs  gentlemen     he said .      hold on     said ponder .     this may be an endangered species .         so is mrs .  whitlow .         but do we have the right to wipe out what           absolutely     said ridcully .     if its creator had meant it to survive he would have given it a fireproof skin .  that   s your evolution for you  stibbons .         but perhaps we ought to study it    .      the thing was beginning to get up speed now .  it was amazing how fast it could move  considering how big it was .      er       said ponder nervously .   ridcully raised his arm .   the creature stopped  jerked into the air  and then went flat  like a rubber ball that had been stepped on  and indeed when it sprang back into shape it was with a noise akin to the sound made when a bad conjurer is having trouble twisting the back legs on to the balloon animal .  insofar as it had an expression at all  it looked more astonished than hurt .  little flashes of lightning crackled around it .  it went flat again  rolled up into a cylinder  twisted into a range of interesting but probably painful shapes  shrank to a ball the size of a grapefruit and then  with a final and rather sad little noise that might well have been spelled prarp  dropped back on to the sand .      now that was pretty good     said ridcully .     which of you fellows did that .      the wizards looked at one another .      not us     said the dean .     it was going to be fireballs all the way .      ridcully nudged ponder .     go on  then     he said .     study it .         er       ponder looked at the bewildered creature on the sand .     er   the subject appears to have turned into a large chicken .         good  well done     said ridcully  as if to wrap things up .     shame to waste this fireball  then .      he hurled it .      it was a road .   at least  it was a long flat piece of desert with wheel ruts in it .  rincewind stared at it .   a road .  roads went somewhere .  sooner or later they went everywhere .  and when you got there  you generally found walls  buildings  harbors   boats .  and incidentally a shortage of talking kangaroos .  that was practically one of the hallmarks of civilization .   it wasn   t that he was against anyone saving the world  or whatever subset of it apparently wanted saving .  he just felt that it didn   t need saving by him .   which way to go .  he picked a direction at random and jogged along for a while  as the sun came up .   after a while there was a cloud of dust in the dawn  coming closer .  rincewind stood hopefully by the track .   what eventually appeared at the inverted apex of the cloud was cart  pulled by a string of horses .  the horses were black .  so was the cart .  and it didn   t seem to be slowing down .   rincewind waved his hat in the air  just as the horses came past .   after a while the dust settled .  he got back on to his feet and walked unsteadily through the bushes until he found the cart where it had come to rest .  the horses watched him warily .   it wasn   t a huge cart to be pulled by eight horses  but both they and the cart were covered with so much wood  leather and metal they probably didn   t have much energy to spare .  spikes and studs covered every surface .   the reins led not to the usual seat  but into holes in the front of the cart itself .  this was roofed over with more wood and ironmongery   bits of old stove  hammered out body armor  saucepan lids  and tin cans that had been stamped flat and nailed on .   above the slot where the reins went in was something like a piece of bent stovepipe  poking through the cart   s roof .  it had a watchful look .      er   hello .     said rincewind .     sorry if i scared your horses        in the absence of any reply he climbed up an armored wheel and looked at the top of the cart .  there was a round lid that had been pushed open .   rincewind didn   t even consider looking inside .  that   d mean his head would be outlined against the sky  a sure way of getting your body outlined against the dirt .   a twig cracked behind him .   he sighed  and got down slowly  taking great care not to turn around .      i surrender totally     he said  raising his hands .      that   s right     said a level voice .     this is a crossbow  mate .  let   s have a look at your ugly mug .      rincewind turned .  there was no one behind him .   then he looked down .   the crossbow was almost vertical .  if it were fired  the bolt would go right up his nose .      a dwarf .     he said .      you   ve got something against dwarfs .         who  me .  no .  some of my best friends would be dwarfs .  if i had any friends  i mean .  er .  i   m rincewind .         yeah .  well  i   m short tempered     said the dwarf .     most people call me mad .         just    mad    .  that   s an   unusual name .         it ain   t a name .      rincewind stared .  there was no doubt that his captor was a dwarf .  he didn   t have the traditional beard or iron helmet  but there were other little ways that you could tell .  there was the chin that you could break coconuts on  the fixed expression of ferocity  and the certain bullet headedness that meant its owner could go through walls face first .  and  of course  if all else failed  the fact that the top of it was about level with rincewind   s stomach was a clue .  mad wore a leather suit but  like the cart  it had metal riveted on to it wherever possible .  where there weren   t rivets there was weaponry .   the word    friend    jumped into the forefront of rincewind   s brain .  there are many reasons for being friends with someone .  the fact that he   s pointing a deadly weapon at you is among the top four .      good description     said rincewind .     easy to remember .      the dwarf cocked his head on one side and listened .      blast  they   re catching me up .     he looked back up at rincewind and said     can you fire a crossbow .     in a way that indicated that answering    no    was a good way to contract immediate sinus trouble .      absolutely     said rincewind .      get on the cart  then .  y   know  i   ve been travelin    this road for years and this is the first time anyone   s ever dared to hitch a lift .         amazing     said rincewind .   there was not much room under the hatch  and most of it was taken up by more weapons .  mad pushed rincewind aside  grasped the reins  peered into the periscope stovepipe and urged the horses into motion .   bushes scraped against the wheels and the horses dragged back on to the track and began to get up speed .      beaut  aren   t they .     said mad .     they can outrun anything  even with the armor .         this is certainly a very   original cart     said rincewind .      got a few modifications of my own     said mad .  he grinned evilly .     you a wizard  mister .         broadly speaking  yes .         any good .     mad was loading another crossbow .   rincewind hesitated .     no     he said .      lucky for you     said mad .     i   d have killed you if you were .  can   t stand wizards .  bunch of wowsers  right .      he grasped the handles of the bent stovepipe and swiveled it around .      here they come     he muttered .   rincewind peered over the top of mad   s head .  there was a piece of mirror in the bend of the pipe .  it showed the road behind  and half a dozen dots under another cloud of red dust .      road gang     said mad .     after my cargo .  steal anything  they will .  all bastards are bastards  but some bastards is bastards .     he pulled a handful of nosebags from under the seat .     right  you get up on top with a couple of crossbows  and i   ll fix the supercharger .         what .  you want me to start shooting at people .         you want me to start shooting at people .     said mad  pushing him up the ladder .   rincewind crawled out on to the top of the cart .  it was swaying and bouncing .  red dust choked him and the wind tried to blow his robe over his head .   he hated weapons  and not just because they   d so often been aimed at him .  you got into more trouble if you had a weapon .  people shot you instantly if they thought you were going to shoot them .  but if you were unarmed  they often stopped to talk .  admittedly  they tended to say things like     you   ll never guess what we   re going to do to you  pal     but that took time .  and rincewind could do a lot with a few seconds .  he could use them to live longer in .   the dots in the distance were other carts  designed for speed rather than cargo .  some had four wheels  some had two .  one had   just one  a huge one between narrow shafts  with a tiny saddle on top .  the rider looked as though he   d bought his clothes in the scrapmetal yards of three continents and  where they wouldn   t fit  had strapped on a chicken .   but not one as big as the chicken pulling his wheel .  it was bigger than rincewind and most of what wasn   t leg was neck .  it was covering the ground as fast as a horse .      what the hell   s that .     he yelled .      emu .     shouted mad  who was now hanging among the harnesses .     try and pick it off  they   re a good feed .      the cart jolted .  rincewind   s hat whirled away into the dust .      now i   ve lost my hat .         good .  bloody awful hat .      an arrow twanged off a metal plate by rincewind   s foot .      and they   re shooting at me .      a cart rattled out of the dust .  the man beside the driver whirled something around his head .  a grapnel bit into the woodwork by rincewind   s other foot and ripped off a metal plate .      and they   re       he began .      you   ve got a bow  right .     yelled mad  who was balancing on the back of one of the horses .     and find something to hold onta  they   re gonna go at any minute        the cart had been moving at the gallop  but now it suddenly shot forward and almost jolted rincewind right off .  smoke poured out of the axles .  the landscape blurred .      what the hell is that .         supercharger .     shouted mad  pulling himself on to the cart inches from the frantically pounding hooves .     secret recipe .  now hold    em off  right     cos someone   s gotta steer .      the emu emerged from the dust cloud with a few of the faster carts rattling behind it .  an arrow buried itself in the cart right between rincewind   s legs .   he flung himself flat on the swaying roof  held out the crossbow  shut his eyes and fired .   in accordance with ancient narrative practice  the shot ricocheted off someone   s helmet and brought down an innocent bird some distance away  whose only role was to expire with a suitably humorous squawk .   the man driving the emu drew alongside .  from under a familiar hat with    wizzard    dimly visible in the grime he gave rincewind a grin .  every tooth had been sharpened to a point  and the front six had    mother    engraved on them .      g   day .     he shouted cheerfully .     hand over your cargo and i promise you that you won   t be killed all in one go .         that   s my hat .  give me back my hat .         you   re a wizard  are you .     the man stood up on the saddle  balancing easily as the wheel bounced over the sand .  he waved his hands over his head .      look at me  mates .  i   m a bloody wizard .  magic  magic  magic .      a very heavy arrow  trailing a rope  smashed into the back of the cart and stuck fast .  there was a cheer from the riders .      you give me back my hat or there   ll be trouble .         oh  there   s gonna be trouble anyway     said the rider  aiming his crossbow .     tell you what  why not turn me into somethin    bad .  oh  i   m all afrai        his face went green .  he pitched backwards .  the crossbow bolt hit the driver of the cart beside him  which veered wildly into the path of another  which swerved and crashed into a camel .  that meant the carts behind were suddenly faced with a pile up which  together with the absence of brakes on any vehicle  immediately got bigger .  part of it was kicking people as well .   rincewind  hands over his head  watched until the last wheel had rolled away  and then walked unsteadily along the swaying cart to where mad was leaning on the reins .      er  i think you can slow down now  mr .  mad     he ventured .      yeah .  killed    em all  didja .         er   not all of them .  some of them just ran away .         you kiddin    me .     the dwarf looked round .     stone me  you ain   t .  here  pull that lever as hard as you can .      he waved at a long metal rod beside rincewind  who tugged it obediently .  metal screamed as the brakes locked against the wheels .      why   re they going so fast .         it   s a mixture of oats and lizard glands .     shouted mad  against the red hot squealing .     gives    em a big jolt .      the cart had to circle for a few minutes until the adrenaline wore off  and then they went back along the track to look at the wreckage .   mad swore again .     what happened .         he shouldn   t   ve stolen my hat     rincewind mumbled .   the dwarf jumped down and kicked a broken cartwheel .      you did this to people because they stole your hat .  what do you do if they spit in your eye  blow up the country .            s my hat     said rincewind sullenly .  he wasn   t at all sure what had happened .  he wasn   t any good at magic  that he knew .  the only curses of his that stood a chance of working were on the lines of    may you get rained on at some time in your life     and    may you lose some small item despite the fact that you put it there only a moment ago .     going pale green   he looked down   oh  yes  and slightly yellow in blotches  now   was not the usual effect .   mad wandered purposefully among the wreckage .  he picked up a few weapons and tossed them aside .      want the camel .     he said .  the creature was standing a little way off  eyeing him suspiciously .  it looked quite unscathed  having been the cause of considerable scathe in other people .      i   d really rather stick my foot in a bacon slicer     said rincewind .      sure .  well  hitch it onta the cart  it   ll fetch a good price in dijabringabeeralong     said mad .  he looked at a homemade repeating crossbow  grunted and tossed it aside .  then he looked at another cart and his face brightened .      ah .  now we   re cooking with charcoal .     he said .     it   s our lucky day  mate .         oh .  a bag of hay     said rincewind .      give us a hand to get it on the wagon  willya .     said mad  unbolting the rear of his own cart .      what   s so special about hay .      the cart opened .  it was full of hay .      life or death out here  mate .  there   s people   d slit yew from here to breakfast for a bale of hay .  man without hay is a man without a horse  and out here a man without a horse is a corpse .         sorry .  i went through all that for a load of hay .      mad waggled his eyebrows conspiratorially .     and two sacks of oats in the secret compartment  mate .     he slapped rincewind on the back .     an    to think i thought yew was some back stabbin    drongo i ort to toss over the rail .  turns out you   re as mad as me .      there are times when it does not pay to declare one   s sanity  and rincewind realized that he   d be mad to do so now .  anyway  he could talk to kangaroos and find cheese and chutney rolls in the desert .  there were times when you had to look wobbly facts in the face .      mental as anything     he said  with what he hoped was disarming modesty .      good bloke .  let   s load up their weapons and grub and get goin    .         what do we want their weapons for .         fetch a good price .         and what about the bodies .         nah  worthless .      while mad was nailing salvaged bits of scrap metal to his cart  rincewind sidled over to the green and yellow corpse   and  oh yes  large black areas now   and  using a stick  levered his hat from its head .   a small eight legged ball of angry black fur sprang out and locked its fangs on to the stick  which began to smolder .  he put it down very carefully  grabbed the hat and ran .      ponder sighed .      i wasn   t questioning your authority  archchancellor     he said .     i just feel that if a huge monster evolves into a chicken right in front of you  the considered response should not be to eat the chicken .      the archchancellor licked his fingers .     what would you have done  then .     he said .      well   studied it     said ponder .      so did we .  postmortem examination     said the dean .      minutely     said the chair of indefinite studies  happily .  he belched .     pardon me  mrs .  whitlow .  will you have a little more br       he caught ridcully   s steely glance  and went on        front part of the chicken  mrs .  whitlow .         and we   ve discovered that it   ll no longer be any menace to visiting wizards     said ridcully .      it   s just that i think proper research should involve more than having a look to see if you can find a sage and onion bush     said ponder .     you saw how quickly it changed  didn   t you .         well .     said the dean .      that can   t be natural .         you   re the one who says things naturally change into other things  mister stibbons .         but not that fast .         have you ever seen any of this evolution happening .         well  of course not  no one has ever           there you are  then     said ridcully  in a closing the argument voice .     that might be the normal speed .  as i said  it makes perfect sense .  there   s no point in turning into a bird a bit at a time  is there .  a feather here  a beak there   you   d see some damn stupid creatures wandering around  eh .     the other wizards laughed .     our monster probably simply thought  oh  there   s too many of them  perhaps i   d better turn into something they   d like .         enjoy     said the dean .      sensible survival strategy     said ridcully .     up to a point .      ponder rolled his eyes .  these things always sounded fine when he worked them out in his head .  he   d read some of the old books  and sit and think for ages  and a little theory would put itself together in his head in a row of little shiny blocks  and then when he let it out it   d run straight into the faculty and one of them  one of them  would always ask some bloody stupid question which he couldn   t quite answer at the moment .  how could you ever make any progress against minds like that .  if some god somewhere had said     let there be light     they   d be the ones to say things like    why .  the darkness has always been good enough for us .      old men  that was the trouble .  ponder was not totally enthusiastic about the old traditions  because he was well into his twenties and in a moderately important position and therefore  to some of the mere striplings in the university  a target .  or would have been  if they weren   t getting that boiled eyeball feeling by sitting up all night tinkering with hex .   he wasn   t interested in promotion  anyway .  he   d just be happy if people listened for five minutes  instead of saying     well done  mister stibbons  but we tried that once and it doesn   t work     or     we probably haven   t got the funding     or  worst of all     you don   t get proper fill in nouns these days   remember old    nickname    ancient wizard who died fifty years ago who ponder wouldn   t possibly be able to remember .  now there was a chap who knew his fill in nouns .      above ponder  he felt  were a lot of dead men   s shoes .  and they had living men   s feet in them  and were stamping down hard .   they never bothered to learn anything  they never bothered to remember anything apart from how much better things used to be  they bickered like a lot of children and the only one who ever said anything sensible said it in orangutan .   he prodded the fire viciously .   the wizards had made mrs .  whitlow a polite rude hut out of branches and big woven leaves .  she bade them goodnight and demurely pulled some leaves across the entrance behind her .      a very respectable lady  mrs .  whitlow     said ridcully .     i think i   ll turn in myself  too .      there were already one or two sets of snores building up around the fire .      i think someone ought to stand guard     said ponder .      good man     muttered ridcully  turning over .   ponder gritted his teeth and turned to the librarian  who was temporarily back in the land of the bipedal and was sitting gloomily wrapped in a blanket .      at least i expect this is a home from home for you  eh  sir .      the librarian shook his head .      would you be interested in hearing what else is odd about this place .     said ponder .      ook .         the driftwood .  no one listens to me  but it   s important .  we must have dragged loads of stuff for the fire  and it   s all natural timber  do you notice that .  no bits of plank  no old crates  no tatty old sandals .  just   ordinary wood .         ook .         that means we must be a long way off the normal shipping   oh  no   don   t        the librarian wrinkled his nose desperately .      quickly .  concentrate on having arms and legs .  i mean living ones .      the librarian nodded miserably  and sneezed .      awk .     he said  when his shape had settled down again .      well     said ponder sadly .     at least you   re animate .  possibly rather large for a penguin  though .  i think it   s your body   s survival strategy .  it keeps trying to find a stable shape that works .         awk .         funny it can   t seem to do anything about the red hair        the librarian glared at him  shuffled a little way along the beach  and sagged into a heap .   ponder looked around the fire .  he seemed to be the man on watch  if only because no one else intended to do it .  well  wasn   t that a surprise .   things twittered in the trees .  phosphorescence glimmered on the sea .  the stars were coming out .   he looked up at the stars .  at least you could depend     and  suddenly  he saw what else was wrong .      archchancellor .         so how long have you been mad .  no  not a good start  really   it was quite hard to know how to open the conversation .      so   i didn   t expect dwarfs here     rincewind said .      oh  the family blew in from nothingfjord when i was a kid     said mad .     meant to go down the coast a bit  storm got up  next thing we   re shipwrecked and up to our knees in parrots .  best thing that could   ve happened .  back there i   d be down some freezing cold mine picking bits of rock out of the walls but  over here  a dwarf can stand tall .         really     said rincewind  his face carefully blank .      but not too bloody tall .     mad went on .      certainly not .         so we settled down  and now my dad   s got a chain of bakeries in bugarup .         dwarf bread .     said rincewind .      too right .  that   s what kept us going across thousands of miles of shark infested ocean     said mad .     if we hadn   t had that sack of dwarf bread we   d              never have been able to club the sharks to death .     said rincewind .      ah  you   re a man who knows your breads .         big place  bugarup .  has it got a harbor .         people say so .  never been back there .  i like the outdoor life .      the ground trembled .  the trees by the track shook  even though there was no wind .      sounds like a storm     said rincewind .      what   s one of them .         you know     said rincewind .     rain .         aw  strain the flaming cows  you don   t believe all that stuff  do you .  my granddad used to go on about that when he   d been at the beer .  it   s just an old story .  water falling out of the sky .  do me a favor .         it never does that here .         course not .         happens quite a lot where i come from     said rincewind .      yeah .  how   s it get up into the sky  then .  water   s heavy .         oh  it   it   i think the sun sucks it up .  or something .         how .         i don   t know .  it just happens .         and then it drops out of the sky .         yes .         for free .         haven   t you ever seen rain .         look  everyone knows all the water   s deep underground .  that   s only sense .  it   s heavy stuff  it leaks down .  i never seen it floating around in the air  mate .         well  how do you think it got on the ground in the first place .      mad looked astonished .     how do mountains get on the ground .     he said .      what .  they   re just there .         oh  so they don   t drop out of the sky .         of course not .  they   re much heavier than air .         and water isn   t .  i   ve got a coupla drums of it under the cart and you   d sweat to lift    em .         aren   t there any rivers here .         course we   ve got rivers .  this country   s got everything  mate .         well  how do you think the water gets into them .      mad looked genuinely puzzled .     what   d we want water in the rivers for .  what   d it do .         flow out to sea           bloody waste .  that   s what you let it do where you come from  is it .         you don   t let it  it   happens   it   s what rivers do .      mad gave rincewind a long hard look .     yep .  and they call me mad     he said .   rincewind gave up .  there wasn   t a cloud in the sky .  but the ground shook again .      archchancellor ridcully glared at the sky as if it was doing this to upset him personally .      what  not one .     he said .      technically  not a single familiar constellation     said the chair of indefinite studies frantically .     we   ve counted three thousand  one hundred and ninety one constellations that could be called the triangle  for example  but the dean says some of them don   t count because they use the same stars           there   s not a single star i recognize     said the senior wrangler .   ridcully waved his hands in the air .     they change a bit all the time     he said .     the turtle swims through space and           not this fast .     said the dean .   the disheveled wizards looked up at the rapidly crowding night .   discworld constellations changed frequently as the world moved through the void  which meant that astrology was cutting edge research rather than  as elsewhere  a clever way of avoiding a proper job .  it was amazing how human traits and affairs could so reliably and continuously be guided by a succession of big balls of plasma billions of miles away  most of whom have never even heard of humanity .      we   re marooned on some other world .     moaned the senior wrangler .      er   i don   t think so     said ponder .      you   ve got a better suggestion  i suppose .         er   you see that big patch of stars over there .      the wizards looked at the large cluster twinkling near the horizon .      very pretty     said ridcully .     well .         i think it   s what we call the small boring group of faint stars .  it   s about the right shape     said ponder .     and i know what you   re going to say  sir  you   re going to say     but they   re just a blob in the sky  not a patch on the blobs we used to get     sir  but  you see  that   s what they might have looked like when great a   tuin was much closer to them  thousands of years ago .  in other words  sir     ponder drew a deep breath  in dread of everything that was to come     i think we   ve traveled backwards in time .  for thousands of years .      and that was the other side of the odd thing about wizards .  while they were quite capable of spending half an hour arguing that it could not possibly be tuesday  they   d take the outrageous in their pointy shoed stride .  the senior wrangler even looked relieved .      oh  is that it .     he said .      bound to happen eventually     said the dean .     it   s not written down anywhere that these holes connect to the same time  after all .         going to make gettin    back a bit tricky     said ridcully .      er       ponder began .     it might not be so simple as that  archchancellor .         you mean as simple as finding a way to move through time and space .         i mean there might not be any there to go back to     said ponder .  he shut his eyes .  this was going to be difficult  he knew it .      of course there is     said ridcully .     we were there only this morn   only yesterday .  that is to say  yesterday thousands of years in the future  naturally .         but if we   re not careful we might alter the future  you see     said ponder .     the mere presence of us in the past might alter the future .  we might already have altered history .  it   s vital that i tell you this .         he   s got a point  ridcully     said the dean .     was there any of that rum left  by the way .         well  there isn   t any history happening here     said ridcully .     it   s just an odd little island .         i   m afraid tiny actions anywhere in the world may have huge ramifications  sir     said ponder .      we certainly don   t want any ramifications .  well  what   s your point .  what do you advise .      it had been going so well .  they almost seemed up to speed .  this may have been what caused ponder to act like the man who  having so far fallen a hundred feet without any harm  believes that the last few inches to the ground will be a mere formality .      to use the classic metaphor  the important thing is not to kill your own grandfather     he said  and smacked into the bedrock .      what the hell would i want to do that for .     said ridcully .     i quite liked the old boy .         no  of course  i mean accidentally     said ponder .     but in any case           really .  well  as you know  i accidentally kill people every day     said ridcully .     anyway  i don   t see him around           it   s just an illustration  sir .  the problem is cause and effect  and the point is           the point  mister stibbons  is that you suddenly seem to think everyone comes over all fratricidal when they go back in time .  now  if i   d met my grandfather i   d buy him a drink and tell him not to assume that snakes won   t bite if you shout at them in a loud voice  information which he might come to thank me for in later life .         why .     said ponder .      because he would have some later life     said ridcully .      no  sir  no .  that   d be worse than shooting him .         it would .         yes  sir .         i think there may be one or two steps in your logic that i have failed to grasp  mister stibbons     said the archchancellor coldly .     i suppose you   re not intending to shoot your own grandfather  by any chance .         of course not .     snapped ponder .     i don   t even know what he looked like .  he died before i was born .         ah hah .         i didn   t mean           look  we   re a lot further back in time than that     said the dean .     thousands of years  he says .  no one   s grandfather is alive .         that   s a lucky escape for mister stibbons senior  then     said ridcully .      no  sir     said ponder .     please .  what i was trying to get across  sir  is that anything you do in the past changes the future .  the tiniest little actions can have huge consequences .  you might   tread on an ant now and it might entirely prevent someone from being born in the future .         really .     said ridcully .      yes  sir .      ridcully brightened up .     that   s not a bad wheeze .  there   s one or two people history could do without .  any idea how we can find the right ants .         no  sir .     ponder struggled to find a crack in his archchancellor   s brain into which could be inserted the crowbar of understanding  and for a few vain seconds thought he had found one .     because   the ant you tread on might be your own  sir .         you mean   i might tread on an ant and this   d affect history and i wouldn   t be born .         yes .  yes .  that   s it .  that   s right  sir .         how .     ridcully looked puzzled .     i   m not descended from ants .         because       ponder felt the sea of mutual incomprehension rising around him  but he refused to drown .     well   er   well  supposing it   bit a man   s horse  and he fell off  and he was carrying a very important message  and because he didn   t get there in time there was a terrible battle  and one of your ancestors got killed   no  sorry  i mean didn   t get killed           how did this ant get across the sea .     said ridcully .      clung to a piece of driftwood     said the dean promptly .     it   s amazing what can get even on to remote islands by clinging to driftwood .  insects  lizards  even small mammals .         and then got up the beach and all the way to this battle .     said ridcully .      bird   s leg     said the dean .     read it in a book .  even fish eggs get transported from pond to pond on a bird   s leg .         pretty determined ant  then  really     said ridcully  stroking his beard .     still  i must admit stranger things have happened .         practically every day     said the senior wrangler .   ponder beamed .  they had successfully negotiated an extended metaphor .      only one thing i don   t understand  though     ridcully added .     who   ll tread on the ant .         what .         well  it   s obvious  isn   t it .     said the archchancellor .     if i tread on this ant  then i won   t exist .  but if i don   t exist  then i can   t have done it  so i won   t  so i will .  see .     he prodded ponder with a large  good natured finger .     you   ve got some brains  mister stibbons  but sometimes i wonder if you really try to apply logical thought to the subject in hand .  things that happen stay happened .  it stands to reason .  oh  don   t look so downcast     he said  mistaking   possibly innocently   ponder   s expression of futile rage for shameful dismay .     if you get stuck with any of this compl   cated stuff  my door   s always open .   i am your archchancellor  after all .         excuse me  can we tread on ants or not .     said the senior wrangler peevishly .      if you like .     ridcully swelled with generosity .     because  in fact  history already depends on your treading on any ants that you happen to step on .  any ants you tread on  you   ve already trodden on  so if you do it again it   ll be for the first time  because you   re doing it now because you did it then .  which is also now .         really .         yes indeed .         so we should have worn bigger boots .     said the bursar .      try to keep up  bursar .      ridcully stretched and yawned .     well  that seems to be it     he said .     let   s try to get back to sleep  shall we .  it   s been rather a long day .         someone was keeping up .   after the wizards got back to sleep  a faint light  like burning marsh gas  circled over them .   he was an omnipresent god  although only in a small area .  and he was omnicognizant  but just enough to know that while he did indeed know everything it wasn   t the whole everything  just the part of it that applied to his island .   damn .  he   d told himself the cigarette tree would cause trouble .  he should have stopped it the moment it started growing .  he   d never meant it to get out of hand like this .   of course  it had been a shame about the other   pointy creature  but it hadn   t been his fault  had it .  everything had to eat .  some of the things that were turning up on the island were surprising even him .  and some of them never stayed stable for five minutes together .   even so  he allowed himself a little smirk of pride .  two hours between the one called the dean dying for a smoke and the bush evolving  growing and fruiting its first nicotine laden crop .  that was evolution in action .   trouble was  now they   d start poking around and asking questions .   the god  almost alone among gods  thought questions were a good thing .  he was in fact committed to people questioning assumptions  throwing aside old superstitions  breaking the shackles of irrational prejudice and  in short  exercising the brains their god had given them  except of course they hadn   t been given them by any god  lord knows  so what they really ought to do was exercise those brains developed over millennia in response to the external stimuli and the need to control those hands with their opposable thumbs  another damn good idea that he was very proud of .  or would have been  of course  if he existed .   however  there were limits .  freethinkers were fine people  but they shouldn   t go around thinking just anything .   the light vanished and reappeared  still circling  in the sacred cave on the mountain .  technically  he knew  it wasn   t in fact sacred  since you needed believers to make a place sacred and this god didn   t actually want believers .   usually  a god with no believers was as powerful as a feather in a hurricane  but for some reason he   d not been able to fathom he was able to function quite happily without them .  it may have been because he believed so fervently in himself .  well  obviously not in himself  because belief in gods was irrational .  but he did believe in what he did .   he considered  rather guiltily  making a few more thunder lizards in the hope that they might eat the intruders before they got too nosy  but then dismissed the thought as being unworthy of a modern  forward thinking deity .   there were racks and racks of seeds in this part of the cave .  he selected one from among the pumpkin family  and picked up his tools .   these were unique .  absolutely no one else in the world had a screwdriver that small .      a green shoot speared up from the forest litter in response to the first light of dawn  unfolded into two leaves  and went on growing .   down among the rich compost of fallen leaves  white shoots writhed like worms .  this was no time for half measures .  somewhere far down  a questing tap root found water .   after a few minutes  the bushes around the by now large and moving plant began to wilt .   the lead shoot dragged itself onwards  towards the sea .  tendrils just behind the advancing stem wound around handy branches .  larger trees were used as support  bushes were uprooted and tossed aside and a tap root sprouted to take possession of the newly vacated hole .   the god hadn   t had much time for sophistication .  the plant   s instructions had been put together from bits and pieces lying around  things he knew would work .   at last the first shoot crossed the beach and reached the sea .  roots drove into the sand  leaves unfolded  and the plant sprouted one solitary female flower .  small male ones had already opened along the stem .   the god hadn   t programmed this bit .  the whole problem with evolution  he   d told himself  was that it wouldn   t obey orders .  sometimes  matter thinks for itself .   a thin prehensile tendril bunched itself for a moment  then sprang up and lassoed a passing moth .  it curved back  dipped the terrified insect waist deep in the pollen of a male flower  then coiled back with whiplash speed and slam dunked it into the embracing petals of the female .   a few seconds later the flower dropped off and the small green ball below it began to swell  just as the horizon began to blush with the dawn .  argo nauticae uniquo was ready to produce its first  and only  fruit .      there was a huge windmill  squeaking around on top of a metal tower .  a sign attached to the tower read     dijabringabeeralong  check your weapons .         yep  still got all mine  no worries     said mad  urging the horses forward .   they crossed a wooden bridge  although rincewind couldn   t see why anyone had bothered to build it .  it seemed a lot of effort just to cross a stretch of dry sand .      sand .     said mad .     that   s the lassitude river  that is .      and  indeed  a small boat went past .  it was being towed by a camel and was making quite good time on its four wide wheels .      a boat     said rincewind .      never seen one before .         not one being pedaled  no     said rincewind  as a tiny canoe went past .      they   d hoist the sail if the wind was right .         but   this might sound a strange question   why is it a boat shape .         it   s the shape boats are .         oh  right .  i thought it   d be a good reason like that .  how did the camels get here .         they cling to driftwood  people say .  the currents wash a lot of stuff up  down on the coast .      dijabringabeeralong was coming into view .  it was just as well there had been the sign  otherwise they might have ridden through it without noticing .  the architecture was what is known professionally as    vernacular     a word used in another field to mean    swearing    and this was quite appropriate .  but then  rincewind thought  it   s as hot as hell and it never rains   all you need a house for is to mark some kind of boundary between inside and outside .      you said this was a big town     he said .      it   s got a whole street .  and a pub .         oh  that   s a street  is it .  and that logpile is a pub .         you   ll like it .  it   s run by crocodile .         why do they call him crocodile .         a night sleeping on the sand hadn   t helped the faculty very much .  and the archchancellor didn   t help even more .  he was an early morning man as well as being  most unfairly  a late night man .  sometimes he went from one to the other without sleeping in between .      wake up  you fellows .  who   s game for a brisk trot around the island .  there   ll be a small prize for the winner  eh .         oh  my gods     moaned the dean  rolling over .     he   s doing push ups .         i certainly wouldn   t want anyone to think i   m advocating a return to the bad old days     said the chair of indefinite studies  trying to dislodge some sand from his ear     but once upon a time we used to kill wizards like him .         yes  but we also used to kill wizards like us  chair     said the dean .      remember what we   d say in those days .     said the senior wrangler .        never trust a wizard over sixty five    .  whatever happened .         we got past the age of sixty five  senior wrangler .         ah  yes .  and it turned out that we were trustworthy after all .         good thing we found out in time  eh .         there   s a crab climbing that tree     said the lecturer in recent runes  who was lying on his back and staring straight upwards .     an actual crab .         yes     said the senior wrangler .     they   re called tree climbing crabs .         why .         i had this book when i was a little lad     said the chair of indefinite studies .     it was about this man who was shipwrecked on an island such as this and he thought he was all alone and then one day he found a footprint in the sand .  there was a woodcut     he added .      one footprint .     said the dean  sitting up  clutching his head .      well   yes  and when he saw it he knew that he              was alone on an island with a crazed one legged long jump champion .     said the dean .  he was feeling testy .      well  obviously he found some other footprints later on           i wish i was on a desert island all alone     said the senior wrangler gloomily  watching ridcully running on the spot .      is it just me     the dean asked     or are we marooned thousands of miles and thousands of years from home .         yes .         i thought so .  is there any breakfast .         stibbons found some soft boiled eggs .         what a useful young man he is     the dean groaned .     where did he find them .         on a tree .      bits of last night came back to the dean .      a soft boiled egg tree .         yes     said the senior wrangler .     nicely runny .  they   re quite good with breadfruit soldiers .         you   ll be telling me next he found a spoon tree           of course not .         good .         it   s a bush .     the senior wrangler held up a small wooden spoon .  it had a few small leaves still attached to it .      a bush that fruits spoons           young stibbons said it makes perfect sense  dean .  after all  he said  we   d picked them because they   re useful  and then spoons are always getting lost .  then he burst into tears .         he   s got a point  though .  honestly  this place is like big rock candy mountain .         i vote we leave it as soon as possible     said the chair of indefinite studies .     we   d better have a serious look at this boat idea today .  i don   t want to meet another of those horrible lizards .         one of everything  remember .         then probably there   s a worse one .         building some sort of boat can   t be very hard     said the chair of indefinite studies .     even quite primitive people manage it .         now look     snapped the dean     we   ve searched everywhere for a decent library on this island .  there simply isn   t one .  it   s ridiculous .  how is anyone supposed to get anything done .         i suppose   we could   try things .     said the senior wrangler .     you know   see what floats  that sort of thing .         oh  well  if you want to be crude about it        the chair of indefinite studies looked at the dean   s face and decided it was time to lighten the atmosphere .      i was  aha  just wondering     he said     as a little mental exercise   if you were marooned on a desert island  eh  dean   what kind of music would you like to listen to  eh .      the dean   s face clouded further .     i think  chair  that i would like to listen to the music in the ankh morpork opera house .         ah .  oh .  yes .  well   very   very   very direct thinking there  dean .         rincewind grinned glassily .     so   you   re a crocodile  then .         thif worrying you .     said the barman .      no .  no .  don   t they call you anything else  though .         well   there   f a nickname they gave me           oh  yes .         yeah .  crocodile crocodile .  but in here moft people call me dongo .         and   er   this stuff .  what do you call this .         we call it beer     said the crocodile .     what do you call it .      the barman wore a grubby shirt and a pair of shorts  and until he   d seen a pair of shorts tailored for someone with very short legs and a very long tail rincewind hadn   t realized what a difficult job tailoring must be .   rincewind held the beer glass up to the light .  and that was the point .  you could see light all the way through it .  clear beer .  ankh morpork beer was technically ale  that is to say  gravy made from hops .  it had texture .  it had flavor  even if you didn   t always want to know what of .  it had body .  it had dregs .  you could eat the last half inch of it with a spoon .   this stuff was thin and sparkly and looked as though someone had already drunk it .  tasted all right  though .  didn   t sit on your stomach the way the beer at home did .  weak stuff  of course  but it never did to insult someone else   s beer .      pretty good     he said .      where   d you blow in from .         er   i floated here on a piece of driftwood .         was there room with all the camels .         er   yes .         good on yer .      rincewind needed a map .  not a geographical map  although one of those would be a help  but one that showed him where his head was at .  you didn   t usually get crocodiles serving behind a bar  but everyone else in this cavern of a place seemed to think it was perfectly normal .  mind you  the people in the bar included three sheep in overalls and a couple of kangaroos playing darts .   and they weren   t exactly sheep .  they looked more like  well   human sheep .  sticking out ears  white curls  a definite sheepish look  but standing upright  with hands .  and he was pretty sure that there was no way you could get a cross between a human and a sheep .  if there was  people would definitely have found out by now  especially in the more isolated rural districts .   something similar had happened with the kangaroos .  there were the pointy ears and they definitely had snouts  but now they were leaning on the bar drinking this thin  strange beer .  one of them was wearing a stained vest with the legend    wagga hay   it   s the rye grass .     just visible under the dirt .   in short  rincewind had the feeling he wasn   t looking at animals at all .  he took another sip of the beer .   he couldn   t raise the subject with crocodile dongo .  there was a philosophical wrongness about drawing a crocodile   s attention to the fact that there were a couple of kangaroos in the bar .      youse wanta nother beer .     said dongo .      yeah  right     said rincewind .   he looked at the sign on the beer pump .  it was a picture of a grinning kangaroo .  the label said  roo beer .   he raised his eyes to a torn poster on the wall .  it also advertised roo beer .  there was the same kangaroo  holding a pint of said beer and wearing the same knowing grin .   it looked familiar  for some reason .      i can   t help nossisting       he tried again .     i can   t help noticing     he said     that some people in this barrardifferentshap from other p   ple .         well  old hollowlog joe over there   f put on a bit of weight lately     said dongo  polishing a glass .   rincewind looked down at his legs .     whose legsare dese .         you okay  mifter .         prob   ly been bitten by so   thing     said rincewind .  a sudden urgent need gripped him .      it   f out the back     said dongo .      out back in the outback     said rincewind  staggering forward .     hahahaha        he walked into an iron pillar  which picked him up in a fist and held him at arm   s length .  he looked along the arm to a large angry face and an expression that said a lot of beer was looking for a fight and the rest of the body was happy to go along with it .   rincewind was muzzily aware that in his case a lot of beer wanted to run away .  and at a time like this  it   s always the beer talking .      i bin lisnin    to you .  where   re you from  mister .     said the giant   s beer .      ankh m   pork       at a time like this  why lie .   the bar went quiet .      an    you   re gonna come here and make a lot of cracks about us all drinkin    beer and fightin    and talkin    funny  right .      some of rincewind   s beer said     no worries .      his captor pulled him so they were face to face .  rincewind had never seen such a huge nose .      an    i expect you don   t even know that we happen to produce some partic   ly fine wines  our chardonnays bein       specially worthy of attention and compet   tively priced  not to mention the rich  firmly structur   d rusted dunny valley semillons  which are a tangily refreshin    discovery for the connesewer   yew bastard .         jolly good  i   ll have a pint of chardonnay  please .         you takin    the piss .         no  i   d like to leave it here           how about you putting my mate down .     said a voice .   mad was in the doorway .  there was a general scuffle to get out of the way .      oh  you looking for a fight too  stubby .     rincewind was dropped as the huge creature turned to face the dwarf  fists clenching .      i don   t look for them .  i just walk into pubs and there they are     said mad  pulling out a knife .     now  you going to leave him alone  wally .         you call that a knife .     the giant unsheathed one that   d be called a sword if it had been held in a normal sized hand .     this is what i call a knife .      mad looked at it .  then he reached his hand around behind his back  and it came back holding something .      really .  no worries .  this     he said     is what i call a crossbow .            it   s a log     said ridcully  inspecting the boat building committee   s work to date .      rather more than a log       the dean began .      oh  you   ve made a mast and tied the bursar   s bathrobe to it  i can see that .  it   s a log  dean .  there   s roots on one end and bits of branch at the other .  you haven   t even hollowed it out .  it   s a log .         it took us all hours     said the senior wrangler .      and it does float     the dean pointed out .      i think the term is more like wallows     said ridcully .     and we   d all get on it  would we .         this is the one man version     said the dean .     we thought we   d test it out and then try it with a lot of them together           like a raft  you mean .         i suppose so     said the dean  with considerable reluctance .  he would have preferred a more dynamic name for it .     obviously these things take time .      the archchancellor nodded .  he was impressed  in a strange way .  the wizards had succeeded in recapitulating  in a mere day  a technological development that had probably taken mankind several hundred years .  they might be up to coracles by tuesday .      which of you is going to test it .     he said .      we thought perhaps the bursar could assist at this point in the development program .         volunteered  has he .         we   re sure he will .      in fact the bursar was some distance away  wandering aimlessly but happily through the beetle filled jungle .   the bursar was  as he would probably be the first to admit  not the most mentally stable of people .  he would probably be the first to admit that he was a tea strainer .   but he was  as it were  only insane on the outside .  he   d never been very interested in magic as a boy  but he had been good at numbers  and even somewhere like unseen university needed someone who could add up .  and he had indeed survived many otherwise exciting years by locking himself in a room somewhere and conscientiously adding up  while some very serious division and subtraction was going on outside .   those were still the days when magical assassination was still a preferred and legal route to high office  but he   d been quite safe because no one had wanted to be a bursar .   then mustrum ridcully had been appointed  and he   d put a stop to the whole business by being unkillable and had been  in his own strange way  a modernizer .  and the senior wizards had gone along with him because he tended to shout at them if they didn   t and it was  after some exhilarating times in the university   s history  something of a relief to enjoy your dinner without having to watch someone else eat a bit of it first or having to check your shape the moment you got out of bed .   but it was hell for the bursar .  everything about mustrum ridcully rasped across his nerves .  if people were food  the bursar would have been one of life   s lightly poached eggs  but mustrum ridcully was a rich suet pudding with garlic gravy .  he spoke as loudly as most people shouted .  he stamped instead of walking .  he roared around the place  and lost important bits of paper which he then denied he   d ever seen  and shot his crossbow at the wall when he was bored .  he was aggressively cheerful .  never sick himself  he tended to the belief that sickness in other people was caused by sloppy thinking .  and he had no sense of humor .  and he told jokes .   it was odd that this affected the bursar so much  since he did not have a sense of humor either .  he was proud of it .  he was not the kind of man to laugh .  but he did know  in a mechanical sort of way  how jokes were supposed to go .  ridcully told jokes like a bullfrog did accountancy .  they never added up .   so the bursar found it much more satisfying to live inside his own head  where he didn   t have to listen and where there were clouds and flowers .  even so  something must have filtered in from the world outside  because occasionally he   d jump up and down on an ant  just in case he was supposed to .  part of him rather hoped that one of the ants was  in some unimaginably distant way  related to mustrum ridcully .   it was while he was thus engaged in changing the future that he noticed what looked like a very thick green hosepipe on the ground .      hmm .      it was slightly transparent and seemed to be pulsating rhythmically .  when he put his ear to it he heard a sound like gloop .   mildly deranged though he was  the bursar had the true wizard   s instinct to amble aimlessly into dangerous places  so he followed the throbbing stem .      rincewind awoke  because sleep was so hard with someone kicking him in the ribs .      wzt .         you want i should pour a bucket of water on yez .      rincewind recognized the chatty tones .  his eyes unglued .     oh  not you .  you   re a figment of my imagination .         i should kick you in the ribs again  then .     said scrappy .   rincewind pulled himself upright .  it was dawn  and he was lying in some bushes out behind the pub .   memory played its silent movie across the tattered sheets of his eyelids .      there was a fight   mad shot that   that   shot him with a crossbow .         only through the foot so   s he   d stand still to be hit .  wombats can   t hold their drink  that   s their trouble .      more recollections flickered across the smoky darkness of rincewind   s brain .     that   s right  there were animals drinking in there .         yes and no     said the kangaroo .     i tried to explain           i   m all ears     said rincewind .  his eyes glazed for a moment .     no  i   m not  i   m all bladder .  back in a minute .      the buzz of flies and a sort of universal smell drew rincewind into a nearby hut .  some people would have liked to think of it as    the bathroom     although not after going inside .   he came out again  hopping up and down urgently .     er   there   s a great big spider on the toilet seat           what   re you gonna do  wait till it   s finished .  fan it with yer hat .      it was odd  rincewind thought as he shooed the spider out  that a human being would  er  use the bathroom behind a bush in the middle of a thousand miles of howling wilderness but would fight for a dunny if there was one available .      and stay out     he muttered  when he was confident the spider was out of earshot .   but the human brain often feels incapable of concentrating on the job in hand  and rincewind found his gaze wandering .  and here  as in private places everywhere  men had found the urge to draw on the walls .   perhaps it was the way the light hit the ancient woodwork  but under the usual minutiae from people who needed people  and drawings done from overheated hope rather than memory  was a deeply scored drawing of men in pointy hats .   he sidled out thoughtfully and edged away through the bushes .      no worries     said the kangaroo  so close to his ear that rincewind was quite pleased that he   d already relieved himself .      i don   t believe it .         you   ll see them everywhere .  they   re built in .  they find their way into people   s thoughts .  you can   t outrun your destiny  mate .      rincewind didn   t even bother to argue .      you   re going to have to sort this out     said scrappy .     you   re the cause .         i   m not .  things happen to me  not the other way around .         i could disembowel you with a kick  you know .  would you like to see .         er   no .         haven   t you noticed that by running away you end up in more trouble .         yes  but  you see  you can run away from that  too     said rincewind .     that   s the beauty of the system .  dead is only for once  but running away is for ever .         ah  but it is said that a coward dies a thousand deaths  while a hero dies only one .         yes  but it   s the important one .         aren   t you ashamed .         no .  i   m going home .  i   m going to find this city called bugarup  find a boat  and go home .         bugarup .         don   t tell me the place doesn   t exist .         oh  no .  it   s a big place .  and that   s where you   re going .         and don   t try to stop me .         i can see you   ve made up your mind     said scrappy .      read my lips .         your moustache is in the way .         read my beard  then .      the kangaroo shrugged .     in that case  i   ve got no choice but to carry on helping you  i suppose .      rincewind drew himself up .     i   ll find my own way     he said .      you don   t know the way .         i   ll ask someone .         what about food .  you   ll starve .         ahah  that   s where you   re wrong .     rincewind snapped .     i   ve got this amazing power .  watch .      he lifted up a nearby stone  extracted what was underneath  and flourished it .      see .  impressed  eh .         very .         ahah .      scrappy nodded .     i   ve never seen anyone do that with a scorpion before .          the god was sitting high up in a tree working on a particularly promising beetle when the bursar ambled past far below .   well  at last .  one of them had found it .   the god had spent some time watching the wizards    attempts at boat building  although he had been unable to fathom out what it was they were trying to do .  as far as he could tell  they were showing some interest in the fact that wood floated .  well  it did float  didn   t it .   he threw the beetle into the air .  it hummed into life at the top of the arc and flew away  a smear of iridescence among the tree tops .   the god drifted out of his tree and followed the bursar .   the god hadn   t made up his mind about these creatures yet  but the island was  unfortunately and against all his careful planning  throwing up all sorts of odd things .  these were obviously social creatures  with some of the individuals designed for specific tasks .  the hairy red one was designed for climbing trees  and the dreamy ant stamping one for walking into them .  possibly the reasons for this would become apparent .      ah  bursar .     said the dean heartily .     how would you like a brief trip around the lagoon .      the bursar looked at the soaking log and sought for words .  sometimes  when he really needed to  it was possible to get mr .  brain and mr .  mouth all lined up together .      i had a boat once     he said .      well done .  and here   s another one  just for           it was green .         really .  well  we can           i   ve found another green boat     said the bursar .     it   s floating in the water .         yes  yes  i   m sure you have     said ridcully kindly .     a big boat with lots of sails  i expect .  now then  dean           just one sail     said the bursar .     and a bare naked lady on the front .      hovering immanently  the god cursed .  he   d never intended the figurehead .  sometimes  he really wanted to just break down and cry .      bare naked lady .     said the dean .      settle down  dean     said the senior wrangler .     he   s probably just had too many dried frog pills .         it   s going up and down in the water     said the bursar .     up and down  up and down .      the dean looked at their own creation .  contrary to all expectations  it did not go up and down in the water .  it stayed exactly where it was and the water went up and down over it .      this is an island     he said .     i suppose someone could have sailed here  couldn   t they .  what kind of bare naked lady .  a dusky one .         really  dean .         spirit of enquiry  senior wrangler .  important bio geographical information .      the bursar waited until his brain came around again .     green     he volunteered .      that is not a natural color for a human being  clothed or not     said the senior wrangler .      she might be seasick     said the dean .  there was only the vaguest of wistful longings in his head  but he did not want to let go of it .      going up and down     said the bursar .      i suppose we could have a look     said the dean .      what about mrs .  whitlow .  she hasn   t been out of her hut yet .         she can come too if she likes     said the dean .      i don   t think we can expect mrs .  whitlow to go looking at a bare naked lady  even if this one is green     said the senior wrangler .      why not .  she must have seen at least one .  not green  of course .      the senior wrangler drew himself up .     there   s no call for that sort of imputation     he said .      what .  well  obviously she        the dean stopped .  the big leaves on mrs .  whitlow   s hut were pushed aside  and she emerged .   it was probably the flower in her hair .  that was certainly the crowning glory .  but she   d also done things to her dress .   there was  for a start  less of it .   since the word is derived from an island that did not exist on the discworld  the wizards had never heard of a bikini .  in any case  what mrs .  whitlow had sewn together out of her dress was a lot more substantial than a bikini .  it was more a newzealand   two quite large respectable halves separated by a narrow channel .  she   d also tied some of the spare cloth around her waist  sarong style .   in short  it was a very proper item of clothing .  but it looked as if it wasn   t .  it was as if mrs .  whitlow was wearing a figleaf six feet square .  it was still just a figleaf .      ai thought this might be a leetle more suitable for the heat     she said .     of course  ai wouldn   t dream of wearing it in the university  but since we appear to be here for a little while ai remembered a picture ai saw of queen zazumba of sumtri .  is there anywhere ai could have a bath  do you think .         mwaaa     said the senior wrangler .   the dean coughed .     there   s a little pool in the jungle .         with waterlilies in it     said the chair of indefinite studies .     pink ones .         mwaaa     said the senior wrangler .      and there   s a waterfall     said the dean .      mwaaa .         and a soap bush  as a matter of fact .      they watched her walk away .      up and down  up and down     said the bursar .      a fine figure of a woman     said ridcully .     she walks differently without her shoes on  doesn   t she .  are you all right  senior wrangler .         mwaa .         i think the heat   s getting to you .  you   ve gone very red .         i   m a mwaa   i   m   gosh  it is hot  isn   t it    .  i think perhaps i should have a dip too           in the lagoon     said ridcully  meaningfully .      oh  the salt   s very bad for the skin  archchancellor .         quite so .  nevertheless .  or you can go looking for the pool when mrs .  whitlow comes back .         i find it rather insulting  archchancellor  that you should appear to think that           well done     said ridcully .     now  shall we go and look at this boat .      half an hour later all the wizards were assembled on the opposite shore .   it was green .  and it bobbed up and down .  it was clearly a ship  but built perhaps by someone who   d had a very detailed book of ship building which nevertheless didn   t have any pictures in it .  there was a blurriness of the detail .  the figurehead  for example  was certainly vaguely female  although to the dean   s disappointment it had the same detail as a half sucked jellybaby .   it put the senior wrangler in mind of mrs .  whitlow  although currently rocks  trees  clouds and coconuts also reminded him of mrs .  whitlow .   and then there was the sail .  it was  without a shadow of a doubt  a leaf .  and once you realized that it was a leaf  then a certain marrow or pumpkin quality about the rest of the vessel began to creep over you .   ponder coughed .     there are some plants which rely for propagation on floating seeds     he said  in a small voice .     the common coconut  for example  has           does it have a figurehead .     said ridcully .      er  one variety of mangrove fruit has a sort of keel which           and a sail with what looks very much like rigging .     said ridcully .      er   no           and what are those flowers on the top .     ridcully demanded .  where a crow   s nest would be was a cluster of trumpet shaped flowers  like green daffodils .      who cares .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     it   s a ship  even if it is a giant pumpkin  and it looks as though there   s room for all of us .     he brightened up .     even if it is a bit of a squash     he added .      it has appeared very fortuitously     said ridcully .     i wonder why .         i said     even if it is a bit of a squash        said the chair of indefinite studies .     because  a squash  you see  is another name for           yes  i know     said ridcully  looking thoughtfully at the bobbing vessel .      i was only attempting to           thank you for sharing  chair .         actually it does look pretty roomy     said the dean  ignoring the chair   s pained expression .     i vote we load up with provisions and go .         where to .     said ridcully .      somewhere where fearsome reptiles don   t suddenly turn into birds .     the dean snapped .      you   d prefer it the other way around .     said ridcully .  he started to wade out into the water until  armpit deep  he was able to bang on the side of the hull with his staff .      i think you are being a little obtuse  mustrum     said the dean .      really .  how many types of carnivorous plants are there  mister stibbons .         dozens  sir .         and they eat prey up to    .         no upper limit in the case of the sapu tree of sumtri  sir .  the sledgehammer plant of bhang bhangduc takes the occasional human victim who doesn   t see the mallet hidden in the greenery .  there   s quite a few that can take anything up to rat size .  the pyramid strangler vine really only preys on other more stupid plants  but           i just think that there   s something very odd about a boat shaped plant turning up just when we want a boat     said ridcully .     i mean  chocolate coconuts  yes  and even filter tipped cigarettes  but a boat with a figurehead .         it   s not a proper boat without a figurehead     said the senior wrangler .      yes  but how does it know that .     said ridcully  wading ashore gain .     well  i   m not falling for it .  i want to know what   s going on here .         damn .      they all heard the voice   thin  reedy and petulant .  it came from everywhere around them .   small soft white lights appeared in the air  spun around one another with increasing speed  and then imploded .   the god blinked  and rocked back and forth as he tried to steady himself .      oh  my goodness     he said .     what do i look like .      he held up a hand in front of his face and flexed his fingers experimentally .      ah .      the hand patted his face  his bald head  and lingered for a moment on the long white beard .  he seemed puzzled .      what   s this .     he said .      er   a beard .     said ponder .   the god looked down at his long white robe .     oh .  patriarchality .  oh  well   let me see  now        he seemed to pull himself together  focused his gaze on ridcully  and his huge white eyebrows met like angry caterpillars .      begone from this place or i will smite thee .     he commanded .      why .      the god looked taken aback .     why .  you can   t ask why in this situation .         why not .      the god looked slightly panicky .     because   thou must go from this place lest i visit thee with boils .         really .  most people would bring a bottle of wine     said ridcully .   the god hesitated .     what .     he said .      or cake     said the dean .     cake is a good present if you   re visiting someone .         it depends on what kind of cake     said the senior wrangler .     sponge cake  i   ve always thought  is a bit of an insult .  something with a bit of marzipan is to be preferred .         begone from this place lest i visit you with cake .     said the god .      it   s better than boils     said ridcully .      provided it   s not sponge     said the senior wrangler .   the problem faced by the god was that  while he had never encountered wizards before  the wizards had in their student days met  more or less on a weekly basis  things that threatened them horribly as a matter of course .  boils didn   t hold much of a menace when rogue demons had wanted to rip your head off and do terrible things down the hole .      listen     said the god     i happen to be the god in these parts  do you understand .  i am  in fact  omnipotent .         i   d prefer that  what is it  you know  the cake with the pink and yellow squares       muttered the senior wrangler  because wizards tend to follow a thought all the way through .      you   re a bit small  then     said the dean .      and the sugary marzipan on the outside  marvelous stuff        the god finally realized what else had been bothering him .  scale was always tricky in these matters .  being three feet high was not adding anything to his authority .      damn .     he said again .     why am i so small .         size isn   t everything     said ridcully .     people always smirk when they say that .  i can   t think why .         you   re absolutely right .     snapped the god  as if ridcully had triggered an entirely new train of thought .     look at amoebas  except that of course you can   t because they   re so small .  adaptable  efficient and practically immortal .  wonderful things  amoebas .     his little eyes misted over .     best day   s work i ever did .         excuse me  sir  but exactly what kind of god are you .     said ponder .      and is there cake or not .     said the senior wrangler .   the god glared up at him .     i beg your pardon .     he said .      i meant  what is it that you   re the god of .     said ponder .      i said  what about this cake you   re supposed to have .     said the senior wrangler .      senior wrangler .         yes  archchancellor .         cake is not the issue here .         but he said           your comments have been taken on board  senior wrangler .  and they will be thrown over the side as soon as we leave harbor .  do continue  god  please .      for a moment the god looked in a thunderbolt mood  and then sagged .  he sat down on a rock .      all that smiting talk doesn   t really work  does it .     he said gloomily .     you don   t have to be nice about it .  i could tell .  i could give you boils  you understand  it   s just that i can   t really see the point .  they clear up after a while  anyway .  and it is rather bullying people  isn   t it .  to tell you the truth  i   m something of an atheist .         sorry .     said ridcully .     you are an atheist god .      the god looked at their expressions .     yes  i know     he said .     it   s a bit of a bottomer  isn   t it .     he stroked his long white beard .     why exactly have i got this .         you didn   t shave this morning .     said ridcully .      i mean  i simply tried to appear in front of you in a form that you recognize as godly     said the god .     a long beard and a nightshirt seem to be the thing  although the facial hair is a little puzzling .         it   s a sign of wisdom     said ridcully .      said to be     said ponder  who   d never been able to grow one .      wisdom  insight  acumen  learning     said the god thoughtfully .     ah .  the length of the hair improves the operation of the cognitive functions .  some sort of cooling arrangement  perhaps .         never really thought about it     said ridcully .      the beard gets longer as more wisdom is acquired .     said the god .      i   m not sure it   s actually a case of cause and effect     ponder ventured .      i   m afraid i don   t get about as much as i should     said the god sadly .     to be frank  i find religion rather offensive .     he heaved a big sigh and seemed to look even smaller .     honest  i really do try but there are some days when life just gets me down   oh  excuse me  liquid seems to be running out of my breathing tubes           would you like to blow your nose .     said ponder .   the god looked panicky .     where to .         i mean  you sort of hold   look  here   s my handkerchief  you just sort of put it over your nose and sort of   well  snuffle into it .         snuffle     said the god .     interesting .  and what a curiously white leaf .         no  it   s a cotton handkerchief     said ponder .     it   s   made .     he stopped there .  he knew that handkerchiefs were made  and cotton was involved  and he had some vague recollection of looms and things  but when you got right down to it you obtained handkerchiefs by going into a shop and saying     i   d like a dozen of the reinforced white ones  please  and how much do you charge for embroidering initials in the corners .         you mean   created .     said the god  suddenly very suspicious .     are you gods too .      beside his foot a small shoot pushed through the sand and began to grow rapidly .      no  no     said ponder .     er   you just take some cotton and   hammer it flat  i think   and you get handkerchiefs .         oh  then you   re tool using creatures     said the god  relaxing a little .  the shoot near his foot was already a plant now  and putting out leaves and a flowerbud .   he blew his nose loudly .   the wizards drew closer .  they were not  of course  afraid of gods  but gods tended to have uncertain tempers and a wise man kept away from them .  however  it   s hard to be frightened of someone who   s having a good blow .      you   re really the god in these parts .     said ridcully .   the god sighed .     yes     he said .     i thought it would be so easy  you know .  just one small island .  i could start all over again .  do it properly .  but it   s all going completely wrong .     beside him the little plant opened a nondescript yellow flower .      start all over again .         yes .  you know   godliness .     the god waved a hand in the direction of the hub .      i used to work over there     he said .     basic general godding .  you know  making people out of clay  old toenails  and so on .  and then sitting on mountaintops and casting thunderbolts and all the rest of it .  although     he leaned forward and lowered his voice     very few gods can actually do that  you know .         really .     said ridcully  fascinated .      very hard thing to steer  lightning .  mostly we waited until a thunderbolt happened to hit some poor soul and then spake in a voice of thunder and said it was his fault for being a sinner .  i mean  they were bound to have done something  weren   t they .     the god blew his nose again .     quite depressing  really .  anyway   i suppose the rot set in when i tried to see if it was possible to breed a more inflammable cow .      he looked at the questioning expressions .      burnt offerings  you see .  cows don   t actually burn all that well .  they   re naturally rather soggy creatures and frankly everyone was running out of wood .      they carried on staring at him .  he tried again .      i really couldn   t see the point of the whole business  to tell you the truth .  shouting  smiting  getting angry all the time   don   t think anyone was getting anything out of it  really .  but the worst part   you know the worst part .  the worst part was that if you actually stopped the smiting  people wandered off and worshipped someone else .  hard to believe  isn   t it .  they   d say things like     things were a lot better when there was more smiting     and     if there was more smiting  it   d be a lot safer to walk the streets .     especially since all that   d really happened was that some poor shepherd who just happened to be in the wrong place during a thunderstorm had caught a stray bolt .  and then the priests would say     well  we all know about shepherds  don   t we  and now the gods are angry and we could do with a much bigger temple  thank you .            typical priestly behavior     sniffed the dean .      but they often believed it .     the god almost wailed .     it was really so depressing .  i think that before we made humanity  we broke the mold .  there   d be a bad weather front  a few silly shepherds would happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time  and next thing you know it was standing room only on the sacrificial stones and you couldn   t see for the smoke .     he had another good blow on a piece of ponder   s handkerchief that had so far remained dry .     i mean  i tried .  god knows i tried  and since that   s me  i know what i   m talking about .     thou shalt lie down flat in thundery weather     i said .     thou shalt site the midden a long way from the well     i said .  i even told them     thou shalt really try to get along with one another .            did it work .         i can   t say for sure .  everyone was slaughtered by the followers of the god in the next valley who told them to kill everyone who didn   t believe in him .  ghastly fellow  i   m afraid .         and the flaming cows .     said ridcully .      the what .     said the god  sunk in misery .      the more inflammable cow     said ponder .      oh  yes .  another good idea that didn   t work .  i just thought  you know  that if you could find the bit in  say  an oak tree which says    be inflammable    and glue it into the bit of the cow which says    be soggy    it   d save a lot of trouble .  unfortunately  that produced a sort of bush that made distressing noises and squirted milk  but i could see the principle was sound .  and frankly  since my believers were all dead or living in the next valley by then i thought  to hell with it all  i   d come back here and get to grips with it and do it all more sensibly .     he brightened up a bit .     you know  it   s amazing what you get if you break even the common cow down into very small bits .         soup     said ridcully .      because  sooner or later  everything is just a set of instructions     the god went on  apparently not listening .      that   s just what i   ve always said .     said ponder .      have you .     said the god  peering at him .     well  anyway   that   s how it all began .  i thought it would be a much better idea to create creatures that could change their own instructions when they needed to  you see           oh  you mean evolution     said ponder stibbons .      do i .     the god looked thoughtful .        changing over time      yes  that   s actually quite a good word  isn   t it .  evolution .  yes  i suppose that   s what i do .  unfortunately  it doesn   t seem to be working properly .      beside him  there was a pop .  the little plant had fruited .  its pod had sprung open and there appeared to be  bunched up like a chrysanthemum  a fresh white hankie .      you see .     he said .     that   s the sort of thing i   m up against .  everything is so completely selfish about it .     he took the handkerchief in an absentminded way  blew his nose on it  crumpled it up  and dropped it on the ground .      i   m sorry about the boat     he continued .     it was a bit of a rush job  you see .  i just didn   t want anyone upsetting everything  but i really don   t believe in smiting  so i thought that since you wanted to leave here i should help you do so as soon as possible .  i think i did rather a good job  in the circumstances .  it   ll find new land automatically  i think .  so why didn   t you go .         the bare naked lady on the front was a bit of a giveaway     said ridcully .      the what .     the god peered in the direction of the boat .     these eyes are not particularly efficient   oh  dear  yes .  the figure .  morphic bloody resonance again .  will you stop doing that .      the handkerchief plant had just put forth another fruit .  the god narrowed his eyes  pointed his finger and incinerated it .   as one man the wizards stepped back .      i stop concentrating for five minutes and everything loses any sense of discipline     said the god .     everything wants to make itself damn useful .  i can   t think why .         sorry .  am i getting this right .  you   re a god of evolution .     said ponder .      er   is that wrong .     said the god anxiously .      but it   s been happening for ages  sir .         has it .  but i only started a few years ago .  do you mean someone else is doing it .         i   m afraid so  sir     said ponder .     people breed dogs for fierceness and racehorses for speed and   well  even my uncle can do amazing things with his nuts  sir           and everyone knows that you can cross a river with a bridge  ahaha     said ridcully .      can you .     said the god of evolution seriously .     i   d have thought that you simply get some very soggy wood .  oh dear .      ridcully winked at ponder stibbons .  gods were often not good at humor  and this one was even worse than ridcully .      we   re back in time  mister stibbons     he said .     it may not have happened already yet  eh .         oh .  yes     said ponder .      anyway  two gods of evolution wouldn   t be a bad thing  would they .     said ridcully .     makes it a lot more interestin    .  the one who   s best at it would win .      the god stared at him with his mouth open .  then he shut it just enough to mouth ridcully   s words to himself  snapped his fingers  and vanished in a puff of little white lights .      now you   ve done it     said the lecturer in recent runes .      no cake for you     said the bursar .      all i said was the one who   s best at it would win     said ridcully .      actually  he didn   t look upset     said ponder .     he looked as if he   d suddenly realized something .      ridcully looked up at the small mountain in the center of the island  and appeared to reach a decision .      all right  we   ll leave     he said .     the reason this island   s so odd is that some rather daft god is messing around with it .  that   s a pretty good explanation as far as i   m concerned .         but  sir       ponder began .      see that little vine just by the senior wrangler there .  it   s only been growing for the last ten minutes     said the dean .   it looked like a small cucumber vine  except that the fruits were yellow and oblong .      pass me your penknife  mister stibbons     said ridcully .   ridcully sliced the fruit in half .  it wasn   t fully ripe yet  but the pattern of pink and yellow squares was clearly visible  surrounded by a layer of something sticky and sweet .      but i only thought about that cake ten minutes ago .     said the senior wrangler .      seems perfectly logical to me     said ridcully     i mean  here we are  wizards  we move about  we want to leave the island   what will we take with us .  anyone .         food  obviously     said ponder .     but           right .  if i was a vegetable  i   d want to make myself useful in a hurry  yes .  no good hanging around for a thousand years just growing bigger seeds .  no fear .  all those other plants might come up with a better idea in the meantime .  no  you see an opportunity and you go for it .  there might not be another boat along for years .         millennia     said the dean .      even longer     ridcully agreed .     survival of the fastest  eh .  so i suggest we load up and go  gentlemen .         what  just like that .     said ponder .      certainly .  why not .         but   but   but think of the things we could learn here .     said ponder .     the possibilities are breathtaking .  at last there   s a god who   s actually got the right idea .  at last we can get some answers to all the important questions .  we could   we can   look  we can   t just go .  i mean  not go .  i mean   we   re wizards  aren   t we .     he was aware that he had their full attention  something that wizards did not often give .  usually they defined    listening    as a period in which you worked out what you were going to say next .  it was disconcerting .   then the spell broke .  the senior wrangler shook his head .     curious way of looking at things     he said  turning away .     so   i vote we take plenty of those cheese nuts  archchancellor .         good provisioning is the essence of successful exploration     said the dean .     quite a roomy vessel  too  so we needn   t stint .      ridcully pulled himself aboard via a trailing tendril  and sniffed .      smells rather like pumpkin     he said .     always liked pumpkin .  a very versatile vegetable .      ponder put a hand over his eyes .     oh  really .     he said  wearily .     a group of unseen university wizards are seriously considering putting to sea on an edible boat .         fried  boiled  a good base for a soup stock and  of course  excellent in pies     said the archchancellor happily .     also the seeds are a tasty snack .         good with butter     said the chair of indefinite studies .     i suppose there isn   t a butter plant anywhere  is there .         there will be soon     said the dean .     give us a hand up  will you  archchancellor .      ponder exploded .     i don   t believe this .     he said .     you   re turning your back on an astonishing god given opportunity           absolutely  mister stibbons     said ridcully  from above .     no offense meant  of course  but if the choice is a trip on the briny deep or staying on a small island with someone trying to create a more inflammable cow then you can call me salty sam .         is this the poop deck .     said the dean .      i hope not     said ridcully briskly .     you see  stibbons           are you sure .     said the dean .      i   m sure  dean .  you see  stibbons  when you   ve had a little more experience in these matters you   ll learn that there   s nothing more dangerous than a god with too much time on his hands           except an enraged mother bear     said the senior wrangler .      no  they   re far more dangerous .         not when they   re really close .         if it was the poop deck  how would we know .     said the dean .   ponder shook his head .  there were times when the desire to climb the thaumaturgical ladder was seriously blunted  and one of them was when you saw what was on top .      i   i just don   t know what to say     he said .     i am frankly astonished .         well done  lad .  so run along and get some bananas  will you .  green ones will keep better .  and don   t look so upset .  when it comes to gods  i have to say  you can give me one of the make    em out of clay and smite    em brigade any day of the week .  that   s the kind of god you can deal with .         the practically human sort     said the dean .      exactly .         call me overly picky     said the chair of indefinite studies     but i   d prefer not to be around a god who might suddenly decide i   d run faster with three extra legs .         exactly .  is there something wrong  stibbons .  oh  he   s gone .  oh well  no doubt he   ll be back .  and   dean .         yes  archchancellor .         i can   t help thinking you   re working up to some sort of horrible joke about a poop deck .  i   d prefer not  if it   s all the same to you .            you all right  mate .      no one in the world had ever been so pleased to see crocodile crocodile before .   rincewind let himself be pulled upright .  his hand  against all expectation  was not blue and three times its normal size .      that bloody kangaroo       he muttered  using the hand to wave away the eternal flies .      what kangaroo waf that  mate .     said the crocodile  helping him back towards the pub .   rincewind looked around .  there were just the normal components of the local scenery   dry looking bushes  red dirt and a million circling flies .      the one i was talking to just now .         i was juft fweeping up and i faw you dancing around yellin        said crocodile .     i didn   t fee no kangaroo .         it   s probably a magic kangaroo     said rincewind wearily .      oh  right  a magic kangaroo     said crocodile .     no worrieth .  i think maybe i   d better make you up the cure for drinking too much beer  mate .         what   s the cure .         more beer .         how much beer did i have last night  then .         oh  about twenty pinth .         don   t be silly  no one can even hold that much beer .         oh  you didn   t hang on to much of it at all  mate .  no worrieth .  we like a man who can   t hold hif beer .      in the fetid fleapit of rincewind   s brain the projectionist of memory put on reel two .  recollection began to flicker .  he shuddered .      was i   singing a song .     he said .      too right .  you kept pointing to the roo beer pofter and finging       crocodile   s huge jaws moved as he tried to remember     tie my kangaroo up .     bloody good fong .         and then i    .         then you loft all your money playing two up with daggy   s shearing gang .         that   s   i   there were these two coins  and the bloke   d toss them in the air  and you   had to bet on how they   d come down           right .  and you kept bettin    they wouldn   t come down at all .  faid it was bound to happen fooner or later .  you got good odds  though .         i lost all the money mad gave me .         yep .         how was i paying for my beer  then .         oh  the blokes were queueing up to buy it for you .  they faid you were better than a day at the races .         and then i   there was something about sheep       he looked horrified .     oh  no           oh  yeah .  you faid     ftrain the fraying crones  a dollar a time for giving fheep a haircut .  i could do a beaut foft job like that with my eyes fhut  too right no flaming worries by half bonza fhoot through ye gods this if good beer              oh  gods .  did anyone hit me .         nah  mate  they reckoned you were a good sport     specially when you wagered five hundred fquids that you could beat their best man at shearin    .         i couldn   t   ve done that  i   m not a betting man .         well  i am  and if you   ve been fhootin    a line i wouldn   t give tuppence for your chances  rinfo .         rinso .     said rincewind weakly .  he looked at his beerglass .     what   s in this stuff .         your mate mad faid you were this big wizard and could kill people just by pointing at    em and shoutin        said crocodile .     i wouldn   t mind feein    that .      rincewind looked up desperately and his eye caught the roo beer poster .  it showed some of the damn silly trees they had here  and the arid red earth and   nothing else .      huh .         what   s that .     said crocodile .      what happened to the kangaroo .     rincewind said hoarsely .      what kangaroo .         there was a kangaroo on that poster last night   wasn   t there .      crocodile peered at the poster .     i   m better at smell     he admitted at last .     but i got to admit  it smells like it   s gorn .         something very strange is going on here     said rincewind .     this is a very strange country .         we   ve got an opera house     crocodile volunteered .     that   s cultcher .         and ninety three words for being sick .         yeah  well  we   re a very   vocal people .         did i really bet five hundred   what was it .         squids .            squids i haven   t got .         yup .         so i   ll probably get killed if i lose  right .         no worries .         i wish people   d stop saying that        he caught sight of the poster again .     that kangaroo   s back .      crocodile turned around awkwardly  walked up to the poster and sniffed .     could be     he said cautiously .      and it   s facing the wrong way .         take it easy  mate .     said crocodile dongo  looking concerned .   rincewind shuddered .     you   re right     he said .     it   s the heat and the flies getting to me .  it must be .      dongo poured him another beer .     ah well  beer   s good for the heat     he said .     can   t do anythin    about the bloody flies  though .      rincewind started to nod  and stopped .  he removed his hat and looked at it critically .  then he waved a hand up and down in front of his face  temporarily dislodging a few flies .  finally  he looked thoughtfully at a row of bottles .      got any string .     he said .   after a few experiments  and some mild concussion  dongo advanced the opinion that it   d be better with just the corks .      the luggage was lost .  usually  it could find its way anywhere in time and space  but trying to do that now was like a man trying to keep his footing on two moving walkways heading in opposite directions  and it simply couldn   t cope .  it knew it had been stuck underground for a long time  but it also knew that it had been stuck underground for about five minutes .   the luggage had no brain as such  even though an outsider might well get the impression that it could think .  what it did do was react  in quite complex ways  to its environment .  usually this involved finding something to kick  as is the case with most sapient creatures .   currently it was ambling along a dusty track .  occasionally its lid would snap at flies  but without much enthusiasm .  its opal coating glowed in the sunlight .      oaaw .  isn   t that pretty .  fetch it here  you two .      it paid no attention to the brightly colored cart that stopped a little way along the track .  it was possibly aware at some level that people had got out and were staring at it  but it didn   t resist when they appeared to reach a decision and lifted it on to the cart .  it didn   t know where it had to go  and since it also didn   t know where this cart was going perhaps it would take it there .   it waited a decent while after it had been put down  and then took in its surroundings .  it had been stacked up by a lot of other boxes and suitcases  which was comforting .  after five minutes spent being underground for millions of years the luggage felt that it was due some quality time .   and it didn   t even resist when someone opened its lid and filled it up with shoes .  quite large shoes  the luggage noticed  and many of them with interesting heels and inventive ways with silk and sequins .  they were clearly ladies    shoes .  that was good  the luggage thought  or emoted  or reacted  .  ladies tended to lead quieter lives .   the purple cart rumbled off .  painted crudely on the back were the words  petunia  the desert princess .      rincewind looked hard at the shears that the head shearer was waving .  they looked sharp .      you know what we do to people who go back on a bet round here .     said daggy  the gang boss .      er   but i was drunk .         so were we .  so what .      rincewind looked out across the sheep pens .  he knew what sheep were  of course  and had come into contact with them on many occasions  although normally in the company of mixed vegetables .  he   d even had a toy stuffed lamb as a child .  but there is something hugely unlovable about sheep  a kind of mad  eyerolling brainlessness smelling of damp wool and panic .  many religions extol the virtues of the meek  but rincewind had never trusted them .  the meek could turn very nasty at times .   on the other hand   they were covered in wool  and the shears looked pretty keen .  how hard could it be .  his radar told him that trying and failing was probably a lot less of a crime than not trying at all .      can i have a trial run .     he said .   a sheep was dragged out of the pens and flung down in front of him .   rincewind gave daggy what he hoped was the smile of one craftsman to another  but smiling at daggy was like throwing meringues against a cliff .      er  can i have a chair and a towel and two mirrors and a comb .     he said .   daggy   s look of intense suspicion deepened .     what   s this .  what d   you want all that for .         got to do it properly  haven   t i .         away out of sight at the back of the shearing shed  on the sun bleached boards  the outline of a kangaroo began to form .  and then  the white lines drifting across the wood like wisps of cloud across a clear sky  it began to change shape        rincewind hadn   t had a proper haircut in a long time  but he knew how it was done .      so   have you had your holidays this year  then .     he said  clipping away .      mnaaarrrhh .         what about this weather  eh .     rincewind said  desperately .      mnaaarrrhh .      the sheep wasn   t even trying to struggle .  it was an old one  with fewer teeth than feet  and even in the very limited depths of its extremely shallow mind it knew that this wasn   t how shearing was supposed to go .  shearing was supposed to be a brief struggle followed by glorious cool freedom back in the paddock .  it wasn   t supposed to include searching questions about what it thought of this weather or enquiries as to whether it required something for the weekend  especially since the sheep had no concept of the connotations of the term    weekend    or  if it came to that  of the word    something    either .  people weren   t supposed to splash lavender water in its ear .   the shearers watched in silence .  there was quite a crowd of them  because they   d gone and fetched everyone else on the station .  they knew in their souls that here was something to tell their grandchildren .   rincewind stood back  looked critically at his handiwork  and then showed the sheep the back of its head in the mirror  at which point the creature cracked  managed to get its feet under it and made a run for the paddock .      hey  wait till i take the curlers out .     rincewind shouted after it .   he became aware of the shearers watching him .  finally one of them said  in a stunned voice     that   s sheep shearing where yew come from  is it .         er   what did you think .     said rincewind .      it   s a bit slow  innit .         how fast was i supposed to go .         weell  daggy here once did nearly fifty in an hour .  that   s what you   ve got to beat  see .  none of that fancy rubbish .  just short back  front  top and sides .         mind yew     said one of the shearers  wistfully     that was a beautiful lookin    sheep .      there was an outbreak of bleating from the sheep corrals .      ready to give it a real go  rinso .     said daggy .      ye gawds  what   s that .     said one of his mates .   the fence shattered .  a ram stood in the gap  shaking its head to dislodge bits of post from its horns .  steam rose from its nostrils .   most of the things rincewind had associated with sheep  apart from the gravy and mint sauce  had to do with   sheepishness .  but this was a ram  and the word association was suddenly   rampage .  it pawed the ground .  it was a lot bigger than the average sheep .  in fact  it seemed to fill rincewind   s entire future .      that   s not one of mine .     said the flock   s owner .   daggy placed his shears in rincewind   s other hand and patted him on the back .      this one   s yours  mate     he said  and backed away .     you   re here to show us how it   s done  eh  mate .      rincewind looked down at his feet .  they weren   t moving .  they remained firmly fixed to the ground .   the ram advanced  snorting and looking rincewind in the bloodshot eye .      okay     it whispered  when it was very close .     you just make with the shears and the sheep   ll do the rest .  no worries .         is that you .     said rincewind  glancing at the distant ring of watchers .      hah  good one .  ready .  they   ll do what i do .  they   re like sheep  okay .      the shearers watched as wool fell like rain .      that   s somethin    you don   t often see     said one of them .     them standin    on their heads like that           the cartwheels is good     said another shearer  lighting his pipe .     i mean  for sheep .      rincewind just hung on to the shears .  they had a life of their own .  the sheep flung themselves against the clippers as if in a real hurry to get into something more comfortable .  fleeces curled around his ankles  then around his knees  rose above his waist   and then the shears were slicing the air  and sizzling as they cooled down .   several dozen dazed sheep were watching him very suspiciously .  so were the sheep shearers .      er   have we started the competition yet .     he said .      you just sheared thirty sheep in two minutes .     roared daggy .      is that good .         good .  no one takes two minutes for thirty sheep .         well  i   m sorry  but i can   t go any faster .      the shearers went into a huddle .  rincewind looked around for the ram  but it didn   t seem to be there any more .   finally  something seemed to have been settled .  the shearers approached him in the cautious  oblique way of men trying to hang back and walk forward at the same time .   daggy stepped forward  but only comparatively  in fact  his mates had all  without discussion  taken one step backwards in the choreography of caution .      g   day .     he said nervously .   rincewind gave him a friendly wave  and it was only halfway through when he remembered that he was still holding the shears .  daggy hadn   t forgotten about them .      er   we ain   t got five hundred squids till we get paid        rincewind wasn   t certain how to deal with this .     no worries     he said .  this covered most things .         so if yew   re gonna be around           i just want to get to bugarup as soon as possible     said rincewind .   daggy kept smiling but turned around and went into another huddle with the rest of the shearers .  then he turned back .         maybe we could sell a few things           i   m not bothered about the money  actually     said rincewind loudly .     just point me in the direction of bugarup .  no worries .         yew don   t want the money .         no worries .      there was another huddle .  rincewind heard hissed comments of    get him outta here right now .      daggy turned back .     i got a horse you can have     he said .     it   s worth a squid or two .         no worries .         and then you   ll be able to ride away    .         she   ll be right .  no worries .      it was an amazing phrase .  it was practically magical all by itself .  it just   made things better .  a shark   s got your leg .  no worries .  you   ve been stung by a jellyfish .  no worries .  you   re dead .  she   ll be right .  no worries .  oddly enough  it seemed to work .      no worries     he said again .      got to be worth a squid or two  that horse     daggy said again .     practically a bloody racehorse .      there was some sniggering from the crowd .      no worries .     said rincewind .   daggy looked for a moment as if he was entertaining the suggestion that maybe the horse was worth more than five hundred squid  but rincewind was still dreamily holding on to the shears and he thought better of it .      get you to bugarup in no time  that horse     he said .      no worries .      a couple of minutes later it was obvious even to rincewind   s inexperienced eye that while you could race this horse  it wouldn   t be sensible to race it against other horses .  at least  ones that were alive .  it was brown  stubby  mostly a thatch of mane  with hooves the size of soup bowls  and it had the shortest legs rincewind had ever seen on anything with a saddle .  the only way you could fall off would be to dig a hole in the ground first .  it looked ideal .  it was rincewind   s kind of horse .      no worries     he said .     actually   one small worry .      he dropped the shears .  the shearers took a step back .   rincewind went over to the corral and looked down at the ground  which was churned from the hoofprints of the sheep .  then he looked at the back of the shearing shed .  for a moment he was sure there was the outline of a kangaroo     the shearers approached him cautiously as he banged on the sun bleached planks  shouting     i know you   re in there .         er  that   s what we call wood     said daggy .     woo od     he added  for the hard of thinking .     made into a wa all .         did you see a kangaroo walk into this wall .     rincewind demanded .      not us  boss .         it was a sheep at the time .     rincewind added .     i mean  it   s normally a kangaroo but i   ll swear it turned into that sheep .      the shearers shuffled uneasily .      you   re not going to say anything about woolly jumpers  are you .     said one  almost timorously .      what .  what   s knitwear got to do with it .         that   s a mercy  anyway     the small shearer mumbled .      you know  it   s been doing that all the time     said rincewind .     i thought there was something wrong with that beer poster .         something wrong with the beer  too .         i   m not putting up with any more kangaroo nonsense .  i   m off home     said rincewind .     where   s that horse .      it was standing where they   d left it .  he waved a finger at it .      and no talking .     he said  as he swung his leg over it .  this simply resulted in him standing over the horse .   he was sure that somewhere under the overhanging mane something sniggered .      yew got to kinda sag down     said daggy .     and then you kinda lift your legs kinda up .      rincewind did so .  it was like sitting on an armchair .      you sure this is a horse .         won it in a game of two up from a bloke from goolalah     said daggy .     got to be tough  coming from the mountains .  they breeds    em special to be sure footed .  he said it won   t fall off anything .      rincewind nodded .  his type of horse  all right .  the quiet  dependable type .      which way   s bugarup .      the men pointed .      right .  thank you .  giddyup   what   s this horse called .      daggy seemed to think for a moment and then said     snowy .         why snowy .  that   s an odd name for a horse .         i   used to have a dog called snowy .         oh  right .  that makes sense .  sense for here  anyway .  i suppose .  well   g   day  then .      the shearers watched him go  which  at snowy   s pace  took some time .      had to get rid of him     said daggy .     he could put us on the dole in a day .      one of the men said     why din   t you tell him about the drop bears over that way .         he   s a wizard  ain   t he .  he   ll find out .         yeah  but only when they bloody drop on his head .         quickest way     said daggy .      daggy .         yup .         how long did you say you   d had that horse .         ages .  won it off a bloke .         right .         right .         right           what .         only   did yew always have it ages half an hour ago .      daggy   s wide brow furrowed a little .  he took off his hat and wiped his head with his arm .  he looked at the disappearing horse  and then at the sheds  and then at the other men .  several times he started to speak  shut his mouth before he could get the first word out  and glared around him again .      yew all know i   ve had it for bloody ages  right .     he demanded .        s right .         ages .         won it off   f a bloke .         right .  yeah .  right .  you must   ve done .         mrs .  whitlow sat on a rock  combing her hair .  a bush had sprouted several twigs with rows of blunt  closely set thorns just when she needed them .   large  pink and very clean  she relaxed by the water like an amplified siren .  birds sang in the trees .  sparkling beetles hummed to and fro across the water .   if the senior wrangler had been present someone could have scraped him up and carried him away in a bucket .   mrs .  whitlow did not feel in any danger .  the wizards were around  after all .  she was mildly worried that the maids would be getting lazy since she wasn   t there  but she could look forward to making their lives a living hell when she got back .  the possibility of not getting back never entered her head .   a lot of things never entered mrs .  whitlow   s head .  she   d decided a long time ago that the world was a lot nicer that way .   she had a very straightforward view of foreign parts  or at least those more distant than her sister   s house in quirm where she spent a week   s holiday every year .  they were inhabited by people who were more to be pitied than blamed because  really  they were like children .   and they acted like savages .      on the other hand  the scenery was nice and the weather was warm and nothing smelled very bad .  she was definitely feeling the benefit  as she   d put it .   not to put too fine a point on it  mrs .  whitlow had left her corsets off .      the thing that the senior wrangler insisted on calling the    melon boat    was  even the dean admitted  very impressive .   there was a big space below deck  dark and veined and lined with curved black boards  very like giant sunflower seeds .      boat seeds     said the archchancellor .     probably make good ballast .  senior wrangler  don   t eat the wall  please .         i thought perhaps we could do with more cabin space     said the senior wrangler .      cabins possibly  staterooms no     said ridcully  heaving himself back on to the deck .      avast shipmate .     shouted the dean  throwing a bunch of bananas on to the boat and climbing up behind them .      quite so .  how do we sail this vegetable  dean .         oh  ponder stibbons knows all about that sort of thing .         and where is he .         didn   t he go off to fetch some bananas .      they looked down at the beach  where the bursar was stock piling seaweed .      he did seem a bit   upset     said ridcully .      can   t imagine why .      ridcully glanced up at the central mountain  glowing in the afternoon sun .      i suppose he wouldn   t have done anything stupid  would he .     he said .      archchancellor  ponder stibbons is a fully trained wizard .     said the dean .      thank you for that very concise and definite answer  dean     said ridcully .  he leaned down into the cabin .     senior wrangler .  we   re going to look for stibbons .  and we ought to go and fetch mrs .  whitlow  too .      there was a shriek from below .     mrs .  whitlow .  how could we have forgotten her .         in your case  only by having a cold bath  senior wrangler .         as horses went  this one went slowly .  it moved in a stolid  i can do this all day manner that clearly said the only way you get me to go faster will be to push me off a cliff .  it had a curious gait  somewhere faster than a trot but slower than a canter .  the effect was a jolting slightly out of synchronization with the moment of inertia in any known human organ  causing everything inside rincewind to bounce off everything else .  also  if he forgot for a second and lowered his legs  snowy went on without him  and this meant that he had to run ahead and stand there like a croquet hoop until he caught him up .   but snowy didn   t bite  buck  roll over or gallop insanely away  which were the traits rincewind had hitherto associated with horses .  when rincewind stopped for the night the horse wandered off a little way and ate a bush covered with leaves the thickness  smell and apparent edibility of linoleum .   he camped beside what he had heard called a    billybong     which was just an expanse of churned earth with a tiny puddle of water welling up in the middle .  little green and blue birds were clustered around it  cheeping happily in the late afternoon light .  they scattered when rincewind lay down to drink  and scolded him from the trees .   when he sat up  one of them landed on his finger .      who   s a pretty boy  then .     said rincewind .   the noise stopped .  up on the branches the birds looked at one another .  there wasn   t much room in their heads for a new idea  but one had just turned up .   the sun dropped towards the horizon .  rincewind poked very cautiously inside a hollow log and found a ham sandwich and a plate of cocktail sausages .   up in the trees the budgerigars were in a huddle .   one of them said  very quietly     wh    .      rincewind lay back .  even the flies were merely annoying .  things began to sizzle in the bushes .  snowy went and drank from the tiny pool with a noise like an inefficient suction pump trying to deal with an unlucky turtle .   it was  nevertheless  very peaceful .   rincewind sat bolt upright .  he knew what was about to happen when things were peaceful .   up in the darkening branches a bird muttered        pre   y b   y    .      he relaxed  but only a little .            sa prit    b   y    .      suddenly the birds stopped .   a branch creaked .   the drop bear   dropped .   it was a close relative of the koala  although this doesn   t mean very much .  after all  the closest relative of the common elephant is about the size and shape of a rabbit .  the drop bear   s most notable feature was its posterior  thick and heavily padded to provide the maximum shock to the victim with the minimum shock to the bear .  the initial blow rendered the prey unconscious  and then the bears could gather round to feed .  it was a magnificent method of killing  since in other respects the bears were not very well built to be serious predators  and it was therefore particularly unfortunate for this bear that it chose  on this night  to drop on a man who might well have had    victim    written all over him but also had    wizard    written on his hat  and that this hat  most significantly  came to a point .   rincewind lumbered to his feet and ran into a few trees while he tried  with both hands on the brim  to lift his hat off his head .  he managed it at last  stared in horror at the bear and its peculiarly confused expression  and shook it off and into the bushes .  there were thumps around him as more bears  disoriented by this turn of events  hit the ground and bounced wildly .   in the trees the budgerigars woke up and  the simple message by now having had time to work its way into their brain cells  shrieked     who   s a pri   y boy  den .     a madly tumbling bear whirled past rincewind   s face .   rincewind turned and ran towards snowy  landing astride the horse   s back  or where its back would have been had it been taller .  snowy obediently broke into his arrhythmical trot and headed into the darkness .   rincewind looked down  swore and ran after his horse .   he held on tight as snowy ran on like some small engine  leaving the bouncing bears behind  and didn   t slow down until he was well away along the track and among bushes that were shorter than he was .  then he slid off .   what a bloody country .   there was a flurry of wings in the night and suddenly the bush was full of little birds .      wh   sa pri    boyden .      rincewind waved his hat at them and screamed a little  just to relieve his feelings .  it didn   t work .  the budgerigars thought this was some sort of entertainment .      bug   roff .     they twittered .   rincewind gave up  stamped on the ground a few times  and tried to sleep .   when he awoke  it was to a sound very much like a donkey being sawn in half .  it was a kind of rhythmic scream of pain  anguished and forlorn  setting the teeth of the world on edge .   rincewind raised his head cautiously over the scrub .   a windmill was spinning in the breeze  turning this way and that as stray gusts batted its tail fin .   rincewind was seeing more of these  dotted across the landscape  and thought  if all the water   s underground  that   s a good idea     there was a mob of sheep hanging around the base of this one .  they didn   t back off  but watched him carefully as he approached .  he saw why .  the trough below the pump was empty .  the fan was spinning  grinding out its mournful squeak  but no water was coming out of the pipe .   the thirsty sheep looked up at him .      er   don   t look at me     he mumbled .     i   m a wizard .  we   re not supposed to be good at machinery .      no  but we are supposed to be good at magic  said an accusing voice in his head .      maybe i can see if something   s come loose  though .  or something     he muttered .   impelled by the vaguely accusing woolly stares  he clambered up the rickety tower and tried to look efficient .  there didn   t seem to be anything wrong  except that the metallic groaning was getting louder .      can   t see any        something that had finally been tortured beyond endurance broke  somewhere down in the tower .  it shook  and the windmill spun free  dragging a broken rod which smashed heavily on the windmill   s casing with every revolution .   rincewind half fell  half slid back down to the ground .      seems to be a bit of a technical fault     he mumbled .  a lump of cast iron smashed into the sand by his feet .     probably needs to be seen to by a qualified artificer .  probably invalidates the warranty if i mess around        a cracking noise from overhead made him dive for cover  which in this case was a rather surprised sheep .  when the racket had died away the windmill   s fan was bowling over through the scrub .  as for the rest of it  if there had ever been any user serviceable parts inside they very clearly weren   t in there any more .   rincewind took off his hat to mop his brow  but he wasn   t quick enough .  a pink tongue rasped across his forehead like damp sandpaper .      ow .  good grief .  you lot really are thirsty  aren   t you    .     he pulled the hat back on  right down to his ears just to be on the safe side .     i could do with a drink myself  to tell the truth        he managed  after pushing a few sheep aside  to find a piece of broken windmill .   wading with some difficulty through the press of silent bodies  he made his way to an area that was a little lower than the surrounding scrub  and contained a couple of trees whose leaves looked slightly fresher than the rest .      ow .  g   d gr   f .     chattered the birds around him .   two or three feet should do it  he thought as he shoveled the red soil aside .  amazing  really  all this water underground when it never rained at all .  the whole place must be floating on water .   at three feet down the soil was barely damp .  he sighed  and kept going .   he was more than chest deep before a trickle oozed out between his toes .  the sheep fought for the damp soil as he threw it up to the surface .  as he watched  the puddle sank into the ground .      hey  come back .         h   y  c   m bik .     screamed the birds in the bushes .      shut up .         sh   tup .  wh   spr   boyden .      he flailed at the ground with his makeshift shovel in an effort to catch up  and overtook the descending water after another few inches .  he splashed on until he was knee deep  dragged his hat through the muddy liquid  pulled himself out of the hole and ran  water dribbling over his feet  until he could tip it into the trough .   the sheep clustered around it  struggling silently to get at the film of moisture .   rincewind got two more hatfuls before the water sank out of sight .   he wrenched the ladder off the stricken windmill  threw it down the hole and jumped in after it .  damp soil fountained out as he dug  and each dripping lump attracted a mass of flies and small birds as soon as it hit the ground .   he managed another dozen or so hatfuls before the hole was deeper than the ladder .  by now some cattle had lumbered up to the trough as well  and it was impossible to see the water for heads .  the sound was that of a straw investigating the suds of the biggest milkshake in the world .   rincewind took a final look down the hole  and as he did so the last drop of water winked out of sight .      weird country     he muttered .   he wandered over to where snowy was standing patiently in the sparse shade of a bush .      you   re not thirsty .     he said .   snowy snorted and shook his mane .      oh  well .  maybe you   ve got a bit of camel in you .  you certainly can   t be all horse  i know that .      snowy moved aimlessly sideways and trod on rincewind   s foot .   by noon the track crossed another one  which was much wider .  hoofprints and wheel ruts suggested that it got a lot of traffic .  rincewind brightened up  and followed it through thickening trees  glad of the shade .   he passed another groaning windmill surrounded by a cluster of patiently waiting cattle .   there were more bushes and the land was rising into ancient  crumbling hills of orange rock .  at least it gets the wind up here  he thought .  ye gods  is a drop of rain too much to ask .  you can   t never have any rain .  everywhere gets rained on sometimes .  it has to drop out of the sky in order to get underground in the first place  doesn   t it .   he stopped when he heard the sound of many hoof beats on the track behind him .   a mob of riderless horses appeared round the bend at full gallop .  as they swept past rincewind he saw one horse out in front of the others  built on the sleekest lines he   d ever seen  a horse that moved as though it had a special arrangement with gravity .  the pack divided and flowed around rincewind as if he were a rock in a stream .  then they were just a disappearing noise in a cloud of red dust .   snowy   s nostrils flared  and the jolting increased as he speeded up .      oh  yes .     said rincewind .     not a chance  mate .  you can   t play with the big boys .  no worries .      the cloud of dust had barely settled before there were more hoof beats and a bunch of horsemen came around the curve .  they galloped past without taking any notice of rincewind  but a rider at the rear slowed down .      you seen a mob of horses go by  mate .         yes  mate .  no worries  no worries  no worries .         a big brown colt leadin       em .         yes  mate .  no worries  no worries .         old remorse says he   ll give a hundred squids to the man who catches him .  no chance of that  it   s canyon country ahead .         no worries .         what   s that you   re riding  an ironing board .         er  excuse me     rincewind began  as the man set off in pursuit     but is this the right road to bugar    .      the dust swirled across the road .      what happened to the well known ecksian reputation for good hearted friendliness  eh .     shouted rincewind to empty air .   he heard shouts and the cracking of whips from the trees on the high slopes as he wound into the hills .  at one point the wild horses burst out on to the track again  not even noticing him in their flight  and this time snowy ambled off the track and followed the trail of broken bushes .   rincewind had learned that hauling on the reins only had the effect of making his arms ache .  the only way to stop the little horse when he didn   t want to be stopped was probably to get off  run ahead  and dig a trench in front of him .   once again the riders came up behind rincewind and thudded past  foam streaming from the horses    mouths .      excuse me .  am i on the right road for    .      and they were gone .   he caught up with them ten minutes later in a thicket of mountain ash  milling around uncertainly while their leader shouted at them .      i say  can anyone tell me       he ventured .   then he saw why they had stopped .  they   d run out of forwards .  the ground fell away into a canyon  a few patches of grass and a handful of bushes clinging to the very nearly sheer drop .   snowy   s nostrils flared and  without even pausing  he continued down the slope .   he should have skidded  rincewind saw .  in fact he should have dropped .  the slope was almost vertical .  even mountain goats would only try it roped together .  stones bounced around him and a few of the larger ones managed to hit him on the back of the neck  but snowy trotted downward at the same deceptive speed that he used on the flat .  rincewind settled for hanging on and screaming .   halfway down  he saw the wild herd gallop along the canyon  skid around a rock and disappear between the cliffs .   snowy reached the bottom in a shower of pebbles and paused for a moment .   rincewind risked opening an eye .  the little horse   s nostrils flared again as it looked down the narrow canyon .  it stamped a hoof uncertainly .  then it looked at the vertiginous far wall  only a few meters away .      oh  no     moaned rincewind .     please  no       he tried to untangle his legs but they had met right under the horse   s stomach and twisted their ankles together .   he must be able to do something to gravity  he told himself  as snowy trotted up the cliff as though it wasn   t a wall but merely a sort of vertical floor .  the corks on his hat brim banged against his nose .   and ahead   above   was an overhang        no  please  no  please don   t        he shut his eyes .  he felt snowy draw to a halt  and breathed a sigh of relief .  he risked a look down  and the huge hooves were indeed standing on solid  flat rock .   there were no corks hanging in front of rincewind   s hat .   in dread and slowly mounting terror  he turned his eyes to what they   d always thought of as upwards .   there was solid rock above him  as well .  only it was a long way up  or down .  and the corks were all hanging upwards  or downwards .   snowy was standing on the underside of the overhang  apparently enjoying the view .  he flared his nostrils again  and shook his mane .   he   ll fall off  rincewind thought .  any minute now he   ll realize he   s upside down and he   ll fall off and from this height a horse   ll splat .  on top of me .   snowy appeared to reach a decision  and set off again  around the curve of the overhang .   the corks swung back and hit rincewind in the face but  hey  all the trees had the green bits pointing up  except that they were the gray bits .   rincewind looked across the chasm at the horsemen .      g   day .     he said  waving his hat in the air as snowy set off again .     i think i   m about to have a technicolor snake .     he added  and threw up .         ere  mistah .     someone shouted back .      yes .         that was a chunder .         right .  no worries .      it turned out that this piece of land was only a narrow spur between canyons .  another sheer drop loomed up  or down .  but to rincewind   s relief the horse turned aside at the brink and trotted along the edge .      oh  no  please        a tree had fallen down and bridged the gulf .  it was very narrow  but snowy wheeled on to it without slowing .   both ends of the tree drummed up and down on the lip of the cliff .  pebbles began to fall away .  snowy bounced across the gap like a small ball and stepped off on the far side just before the tree trunk teetered and dropped on to the rocks .      please  no        there wasn   t a cliff here  just a long slope of loose rocks .  snowy landed among them  and flared his nostrils as the entire slope of scree began to move .   rincewind saw the herd gallop past in the narrow canyon bottom  far below .   large rocks bounded alongside him as the horse continued down in his own personal landslide .  one or two jumped and bounced ahead  smashing on to the canyon floor just behind the last of the herd .   numb with fear and the shaking  rincewind looked further along the canyon .  it was blind .  the end was another cliff     stone piled into stone  building a rough wall across the canyon floor .  as the last boulder slammed into place snowy landed on top of it  almost daintily .   he looked down at the penned herd  milling in confusion  and flared his nostrils .  rincewind was pretty sure horses couldn   t snigger  but this one radiated an air of sniggerruity .   it was ten minutes later that the horsemen rode up .  by then the herd was almost docile .   they looked at the horses .  they looked at rincewind  who grinned horribly and said     no worries .      very slowly  he didn   t fall off snowy .  he simply swiveled sideways  with his feet still twisted together  until his head banged gently on the ground .      that was bloody great riding  mate .         could someone separate my ankles  please .  i fear they may have fused together .      a couple of the riders dismounted and  after some effort  pulled him free .   the leader looked down at him .     name your price for that little battler  mate .     said remorse .      er   three   er   squids .     said rincewind  muzzily .      what .  for a wiry little devil like that .  he   s got to be worth a coupla hundred at least .         three squids is all i   ve got           i reckon a few of them rocks hit him on the head     said one of the stock men who were holding rincewind up .      i mean i   ll buy him off   f you  mister     said remorse  patiently .     tell you what   two hundred squids  a bag of tucker and we   ll set you right on the road to   where was it he wanted to go  clancy .         bugarup     murmured rincewind .      oh  you don   t wanna go to bugarup     said remorse .     nothing in bugarup but a bunch of wowsers and pooftahs .            s okay  i like parrots     mumbled rincewind  who was just hoping that they would let him go so that he could hold on to the ground again .     er   what   s ecksian for going mad with terrified fatigue and collapsing in a boneless heap .      the men looked at one another .      isn   t that    snagged as a wombat   s tonker    .         no  no  no  that   s when you chuck a twister  isn   t it .     said clancy .      what .  strewth  no .  chucking a twister   s when   when you   yeah  it   s when you   yeah  it   s when your nose   hang on  that   s    bend a smartie              er       said rincewind  clutching his head .      what .     bend a smartie    is when your ears get blocked underwater .     clancy looked uncertain  and then seemed to reach a decision .     yeah  that   s right .         nah  that   s    gonging like a possum   s armpit     mate .         excuse me       said rincewind .      that ain   t right .     gonging like a possum   s armpit    is when you crack a crusty .  when your ears are stuffed like a mudjee   s kettle after a week of fridays  that   s    stuck up like morgan   s mule .            no  you   re referrin    to    happier than morgan   s mule in a choccy patch              you mean    as fast as morgan   s mule after it ate ma   s crow pie .            how fast was that .  exactly .     said rincewind .   they all stared at him .      faster   n a eel in a snake pit  mate .     said clancy .     don   t you understand plain language .         yeah     said one of the men     he might be a fancy rider but i reckon he   s dumber than a           don   t anyone say anything .     shouted rincewind .     i   m feeling a lot better  all right .  just   all right  all right .     he straightened his ragged robe and adjusted his hat .     now  if you could just set me on the right road to bugarup  i will not trespass further on your time .  you may keep snowy .  he can bed down on a ceiling somewhere .         oh  no  mister     said remorse .  he reached into a shirt pocket  pulled out a bundle of notes and licked his thumb to count off twenty .     i always pays me debts .  you want to stay with us a while first .  we could use another rider and it   s tough going on the road by yourself .  there   s bush rangers about .      rincewind rubbed his head again .  now that his various bodily organs had wobbled their way back into their approximate positions he could get back to general low key generalized dread .      they won   t have to worry about me     he mumbled .     i promise not to light fires or feed the animals .  well  i say promise   most of the time they   re trying to feed off me .      remorse shrugged .      just so long as there   s no more of those damn dropping bears     said rincewind .   the men laughed .      drop bears .  who   s been feedin    you a line about drop bears .         what do you mean .         there   s no such thing as drop bears .  someone must   ve seen you coming  mate .         huh .  they   ve got   they went     rincewind waved his arm     boing   all over the place   great big teeth           i reckon he madder   n morgan   s mule  mate .     said clancy .   the group went silent .      how mad is that  then .     said rincewind .   clancy leaned on his saddle and looked nervously at the other men .  he licked his lips .     well  it   s           yes .         well  it   s   it   s       his face twisted up .     it   s           ver       .     rincewind hinted .      ver          clancy mumbled  clutching the syllable like a lifeline .      hmm .         ver   ry           keep going  keep going           ver   ry   mad .     said clancy .      well done .  see .  so much easier     said rincewind .     someone mentioned something about food .      remorse nodded to one of the men  who handed rincewind a sack .      there   s beer and veggies and stuff and     cos you   re a good sport  we   re giving you a tin of jam  too .         gooseberry .         yep .         and i   m wondering about your hat     said remorse .     why   s there all corks round it .         knocks the flies out     said rincewind .      that works  does it .            course not     said clancy .     if   n it does  someone   d have thought of it by now .         yes .  me     said rincewind .     no worries .         makes you look a bit of a drongo  mate     said clancy .      oh  good     said rincewind .     which way   s bugarup .         just turn left at the bottom of the canyon  mate .         that   s all .         you can ask again when you meet the bush rangers .         they   ve got some sort of cabin or station  have they .         they   ve   well  just remember they   ll find you if you get lost .         really .  oh  well  i suppose that   s part of their job .  good day to you .         g   day .         no worries .      the men watched rincewind until he was out of sight .      didn   t seem very bothered  did he .         he   s a bit gujeroo  if you ask me .         clancy .         yes  boss .         you made that one up  didn   t you    .         well           you bloody did  clancy .      clancy looked embarrassed  but then rallied .     all right  then     he said hotly .     what about that one you used yesterday     as busy as a one armed carpenter in smackaroo    .         what about it .         i looked it up in the atlas and there   s no such place  boss .         there damn well is .         there isn   t .  anyway  no one   d employ a one armed carpenter  would they .  so he wouldn   t be busy  would he .         listen  clancy           he   d go fishing or something  wouldn   t he .         clancy  we   re supposed to be carving a new language out of the wilderness here           probably   d need someone to help him bait the line  but           clancy  will you shut up and go and get the horses .      it took twenty minutes to roll enough of the rocks away  and five minutes after that clancy reported back .      can   t find the little bastard  boss .  and we looked underneath all the others .         it couldn   t have got past us .         yes it could  boss .  you saw it goin    up those cliffs .  probably miles away by now .  you want i should go after that bloke .      remorse thought about it  and spat .     no  we got the colt back .  that   s worth the money .     he stared reflectively down the canyon .      you all right  boss .         clancy  after we get back to the station  go on into town and call in at the pastoral hotel and bring back as many corks as they   ve got  willya .         think it   ll work  boss .  he was as weird as       clancy was pulled up by the look in his boss   s eye .     he was pretty weird     he said .      weird  yeah .  but smart  too .  no flies on him .      behind them  in the jumble of rocks and bushes at the end of the canyon  a drawing of a small horse became a drawing of a kangaroo and then faded into the stone .      the worst thing about losing your temper with mustrum ridcully was that he never noticed when you did .   wizards  when faced with danger  would immediately stop and argue amongst themselves about exactly what kind of danger it was .  by the time everyone in the party understood  either it had become the sort of danger where your options are so very  very clear that you instantly take one of them or die  or it had got bored and gone away .  even danger has its pride .   when he was a boy  ponder stibbons had imagined that wizards would be powerful demi gods able to change the whole world at the flick of a finger  and then he   d grown up and found that they were tiresome old men who worried about the state of their feet and  in harm   s way  would even bicker about the origin of the phrase    in harm   s way .      it had never struck him that evolution works in all kinds of ways .  there were still quite deep scars in old buildings that showed what happened when you had the other kind of wizard .   his footsteps took him  almost without his being aware  along the gently winding path up the mountain .  strange creatures peered at him from the undergrowth on either side .  some of them looked like     wizards think in terms of books  and  now  one crept out from the shelves of ponder   s memory .  it had been given to him when he was small .  in fact  he   d still got it somewhere  filed away in a cardboard box .    it had consisted of lots of small pages on a central spiral .  each one showed the head  body or tail of some bird  fish or animal .  it was possible for the sufficiently bored to shuffle and turn them so that you got  say  a creature with the head of a horse  the body of a beetle and the tail of a fish .  the cover promised    hours of fun    although  after the first three minutes  you couldn   t help wondering what kind of person could make that kind of fun last for hours  and whether suffocating him as kindly as possible now would save the serial crimes squad a lot of trouble in years to come .  ponder  however  had hours of fun .   some of the creat   things in the undergrowth looked like the pages of that book .  there were birds with beaks as long as their bodies .  there were spiders the size of hands .  here and there the air shimmered like water .  it resisted very gently as ponder tried to walk through it  and then let him pass  but the birds and insects didn   t seem inclined to follow him .   there were beetles everywhere .   eventually  by easy stages  the winding path reached the top of the mountain .  there was a tiny valley there  just below the peak .  at the far end was a large cave mouth  lit by a blue glow within .   a large beetle sang past ponder   s ear .   the cave mouth opened into a cavern  filled with misty blue fog .  there was a suggestion of complex shadows .  and there were sounds   whistles  little zipping noises  the occasional thud or clang that suggested work going on somewhere in the mist .   ponder brushed aside a beetle that had landed on his cheek and stared at the shape right in front of him .   it was the front half of an elephant .   the other half of the elephant  balancing against all probability on the two legs at the rear end  stood a few yards away .  in between was   the rest of the elephant .   ponder stibbons told himself that if you cut an elephant in half and scooped out the middle  what you would get would be   well  mess .  there wasn   t much mess here .  pink and purple tubes had uncoiled neatly on to a workbench .  a small step ladder led up into another complexity of tubes and bulky organs .  there was a general feel of methodical work in progress .  this wasn   t the horror of an elephant in an explosive death .  this was an elephant under construction .   little clouds of white light spiraled in from all corners of the cavern  spun for a moment  and became the god of evolution  who was standing on the stepladder .   he blinked at ponder .     oh  it   s you     he said .     one of the pointy creatures .  can you tell me what happens when i do this .      he reached inside the echoing depths of the front half .  the elephant   s ears flapped .      the ears flapped     squeaked ponder .   the god emerged  beaming .     it   s amazing how difficult that is to achieve     he said .     anyway   what do you think of it .      ponder swallowed .     it   s   very good     he managed .  he took a step back  bumped into something  and turned and looked into the gaping maw of a very large shark .  it was in the middle of another   well  he had to think of it as a sort of biological scaffolding .  it rolled an eye at him .  behind it  a much bigger whale was being assembled .      it is  isn   t it .     said the god .   ponder tried to concentrate on the elephant .     although       he said .      yes .         are you sure about the wheels .      the god looked concerned .     you think they   re too small .  not quite suitable for the veldt .         er  probably not           it   s very hard to design an organic wheel  you know     said the god reproachfully .     they   re little masterpieces .         you don   t think just  you know  moving the legs about would be simpler .         oh  we   d never get anywhere if i just copied earlier ideas     said the god .     diversify and fill all niches  that   s the ticket .         but is lying on your side in a mud hole with your wheels spinning a very important niche .     said ponder .   the god looked at him  and then stared glumly at the half completed elephant .      perhaps if i made the tires bigger .     he said  hopefully yet in a hopeless voice .      i don   t think so     said ponder .      oh  you   re probably right .     the little god   s hands twitched .     i don   t know  i do try to diversify  but sometimes it   s so difficult        suddenly he ran across the crowded cave towards a huge pair of doors at the far end  and flung them open .      i   m sorry  but i just have to do one     said the god .     they calm me down  you know .      ponder caught up .  the cave beyond the doors was bigger than this one  and brilliantly lit .  the air was full of small  bright things  hovering in their millions like beads on invisible strings .      beetles .     said ponder .      there   s nothing like a beetle when you   re feeling depressed .     said the god .  he   d stopped by a large metal desk and was feverishly opening drawers and pulling out boxes .     can you pass me that box of antennae .  it   s just on the shelf there .  oh yes  you can   t beat a beetle when you   re feeling down .  sometimes i think it   s what it   s all about  you know .         what all .     said ponder .   the god swept an arm in an expansive gesture .     everything     he said cheerfully .     the whole thing .  trees  grass  flowers   what did you think it was all for .         well  i didn   t think it was for beetles     said ponder .     what about  well  what about the elephant  for a start .      the god already had a half finished beetle in one hand .  it was green .      dung     he said triumphantly .  no head  when screwed on to a body  ought to make a sound like a cork being pushed into a bottle  but the beetle   s did in the hands of the god .      what .     said ponder .     that   s rather a lot of trouble to go to just for dung  isn   t it .         that   s ecology for you  i   m afraid     said the god .      no  no  that can   t be right  surely .     said ponder .     what about the higher life forms .         higher .     said the god .     you mean like   birds .         no  i mean like       ponder hesitated .  the god had seemed remarkably incurious about the wizards  possibly because of their lack of resemblance to beetles  but he could see a certain amount of theological unpleasantness ahead .      like   apes     he said .      apes .  oh  very amusing  certainly  and obviously the beetles have to have something to entertain them  but       the god looked at him  and a celestial penny seemed to drop .     oh dear  you don   t think they   re the purpose of the whole business  do you .         i   d rather assumed           dear me  the purpose of the whole business  you see  is in fact to be the whole business .  although     he sniffed     if we can do it all with beetles i shan   t complain .         but surely the purpose of   i mean  wouldn   t it be nice if you ended up with some creature that started to think about the universe    .         good gravy  i don   t want anything poking around .     said the god testily .     there   s enough patches and stitches in it as it is without some clever devil trying to find more  i can assure you .  no  the gods on the mainland have got that right at least .  intelligence is like legs   too many and you trip yourself up .  six is about the right number  in my view .         but surely  ultimately  one creature might        the god let go of his latest creation .  it whirred up and along the rows and rows of beetles and slotted itself in between two that were almost  but not exactly  quite like it .      worked that one out  have you .     he said .     well  of course you   re right .  i can see you have quite an efficient brain   damn .      there was a little sparkle in the air and a bird appeared alongside the god .  it was clearly alive but entirely stationary  hanging in frozen flight .  a flickering blue glow hovered around it .   the god sighed  reached into a pocket and pulled out the most complex looking tool ponder had ever seen .  the bits that you could see suggested that there were other  even stranger bits that you couldn   t and that this was probably just as well .      however     he said  slicing the bird   s beak off  the blue glow simply closing over the hole     if i   m going to get any serious work done i   m really going to have to find some way of organizing the whole business .  all i   m faced with these days is bills .         yes  it must be quite expens           big bills  short bills  bills for winkling insects out of bark  bills for cracking nuts  bills for eating fruit     the god went on .     they   re supposed to do their own evolving .  i mean  that   s the whole point .  i shouldn   t have to be running around all the time .     the god waved his hand in the air and a sort of display stand of beaks appeared beside him .  he selected one that  to ponder  hardly looked any different from the one he   d removed  and used the tool to attach it to the hanging bird .  the blue glow covered it for a moment  and then the bird vanished .  in the moment that it disappeared  ponder thought he saw its wings begin to move .   and in that moment he knew that  despite the apparent beetle fixation  here was where he   d always wanted to be  at the cutting edge of the envelope in the fast lane of the state of the art .   he   d become a wizard because he   d thought that wizards knew how the universe worked  and unseen university had turned out to be stifling .   take that business with the tame lightning .  it had demonstrably worked .  he made the bursar   s hair stand on end and sparks crackle out of his fingers  and that was by using only one cat and a couple of amber rods .  his perfectly reasonable plan to use several thousand cats tied to a huge wheel that would rotate against hundreds of rods had been vetoed on the ridiculous grounds that it would be too noisy .  his carefully worked out scheme to split the thaum  and thus provide endless supplies of cheap clean magic  had been quite unfairly sat upon because it was felt that it might make the place untidy .  and that was even after he had presented figures to prove that the chances of the process completely destroying the entire world were no greater than being knocked down while crossing the street  and it wasn   t his fault he said this just before the six cart pile up outside the university .   here was a chance to do something that made sense .  besides  he thought he could see where the god was going wrong .      excuse me     he said     but do you need an assistant .         frankly  the whole thing is getting out of hand     said the god  who was a wizard class non listener .     it   s really getting to the point where i need an           i say  this is a pretty amazing place .      ponder rolled his eyes .  you could say that for wizards .  when they walked into a place that was pretty amazing  they   d tell you .  loudly .      ah     said the god  turning around     this is the rest of your   swarm  isn   t it .         i   d better go and stop them     said ponder as the wizards fanned out like small boys in an amusement arcade  ready to press anything in case there was a free game left .     they poke things and then say     what does this do .            don   t they ask what things do before they poke them .         no  they say you   ll never find out if you don   t give them a poke     said ponder darkly .      then why do they ask .         they just do .  and they bite things and then say     i wonder if this is poisonous     with their mouths full .  and you know the really annoying thing .  it never is .         how odd .  laughing in the face of danger is not a survival strategy     said the god .      oh  they don   t laugh     said ponder gloomily .     they say things like     you call that dangerous .  it   s not a patch on the kind of danger you used to get when we were lads  eh  senior wrangler  what what .  remember when old    windows    mcplunder          he shrugged .      when old    windows    mcplunder what .     said the god .      i don   t know .  sometimes i think they make up the names .  dean  i really don   t think you should do that .      the dean turned away from the shark  whose teeth he   d been examining .      why not  stibbons .     he said .  behind him  the jaw snapped shut .   only the archchancellor   s legs were visible in the exploded elephant .  there were muffled noises from inside the whale  they sounded very much like the lecturer in recent runes saying     look at what happens when i twist this bit   see  that purple bit wobbles .         amazin    piece of work     said ridcully  emerging from the elephant .     very good wheels .  you paint these bits before assembly  do you .         it   s not a kit  sir     said ponder  taking a kidney out of his hands and wedging it back in .     it   s a real elephant under construction .         oh .         being made  sir     said ponder  since ridcully didn   t seem to have got the message .     which is not usual .         ah .  how are they normally made  then .         by other elephants  sir .         oh  yes           really .  are they .     said the god .     how .  those trunks are pretty nimble  even if i say so myself  but not really very good for delicate work .         oh  not made like that  sir  obviously .  by   you know   sex       said ponder  feeling a blush start .      sex .      then ponder thought  mono island .  oh dear        er   males and females       he ventured .      what are they  then .     said the god .  the wizards paused .      do go on  mister stibbons     said the archchancellor .     we   re all ears .  especially the elephant .         well       ponder knew he was going red .     er   well  how do you get flowers and things at the moment .         i make them     said the god .     and then i keep an eye on them and see how they function and then when they wear out i make an improved version based on experimental results .     he frowned .     although the plants seem to be acting very oddly these days .  what   s the point of these seeds they keep making .  i try to discourage it but they don   t seem to listen .         i think   er   they   re trying to invent sex  sir     said ponder .     er   sex is how you can   they can   creatures can   they can make the next   creatures .         you mean   elephants can make more elephants .         yes  sir .         my word .  really .         oh  yes .         how do they go about that .  calibrating the ear waggling is particularly time consuming .  do they use special tools .      ponder saw that the dean was staring straight up at the ceiling  while the other wizards were also finding something apparently fascinating to look at that meant they could avoid one another   s gaze .      um  in a way     said ponder .  he knew that a sticky patch lay ahead and decided to give up .     but really i don   t know much about           and workshops  presumably     said the god .  he took a book from his pocket and a pencil from behind his ear .     do you mind if i make notes .         they   er   the female       ponder tried .      female     said the god obediently  writing this down .      well  she   one popular way   she   sort of makes the next one   inside her .      the god stopped writing .     now i know that   s not right     he said .     you can   t make an elephant inside an elephant           er   a smaller version           ah  once again i have to point out the flaw .  after a few such constructions you   d end up with an elephant the size of a rabbit .         er  it gets bigger later           really .  how .         it sort of   builds itself   er   from the inside           and the other one  the one that is not the  uh  female .  what is its part in all this .  is your colleague ill .      the senior wrangler hammered the dean hard on the back .      it   s all right     squeaked the dean        often have   these   coughing fits        the god scribbled industriously for a few seconds  and then stopped and chewed the end of his pencil thoughtfully .      and all this  er  this sex is done by unskilled labor .     he said .      oh  yes .         no quality control of any description .         er  no .         how does your species go about it .     said the god .  he looked questioningly at ponder .      it   er   we   er       ponder stuttered .      we avoid it     said ridcully .     nasty cough you   ve got there  dean .         really .     said the god .     that   s very interesting .  what do you do instead .  split down the middle .  that works beautifully for amoebas  but giraffes find it extremely difficult  i do know that .         what .  no  we concentrate on higher things     said ridcully .     and take cold baths  healthy morning runs  that sort of thing .         my goodness  i   d better make a note of that     said the god  patting his robe .     how does the process work  exactly .  do the females accompany you .  these higher things   how high  precisely .  this is a very interesting concept .  presumably extra orifices are required .         what .  pardon .     said ponder .      getting creatures to make themselves  eh .  i thought this whole seed business was just high spirits but  yes  i can see that it would save a lot of work  a lot of work .  of course  there   d have to be some extra effort at the design stage  certainly  but afterwards i suppose it   d practically run itself       the god   s hand blurred as he wrote  and he went on     hmm  drives and imperatives  they   re going to be vital   er   how does it work with  say  trees .         you just need ponder   s uncle and a paintbrush     said the senior wrangler .      sir .     said ponder hotly .   the god gave them both a look of intelligent bewilderment  like a man who had just heard a joke told in a completely foreign language and isn   t sure if the speaker has got to the punch line yet .  then he shrugged .      the only thing i think i don   t quite understand     he said     is why any creature would want to spend time on all this       he peered at his notes     this sex  when they could be enjoying themselves   oh dear  your associate seems to be choking this time  i   m afraid           dean .     shouted ridcully .      i can   t help noticing     said the god     that when sex is being discussed your faces redden and you tend to shift uneasily from one foot to the other .  is this some sort of signal .         erm           if you could just tell me how it all works        embarrassment filled the air  huge and pink .  if it were rock  you could have carved great hidden rose red cities in it .   ridcully smiled a petrified smile .     excuse us     he said .     faculty meeting  gentlemen .      ponder watched the wizards go into a huddle .  he could hear a few phrases above the susurration .         my father said  but of course i didn   t believe   never raised its ugly head   dean  will you shut up .  we can   t very well   cold showers  really        ridcully turned back and flashed the stony smile again .     sex is  er  not something we talk about     he said .      much     said the dean .      oh  i see     said the god .     well  a practical demonstration would be so much more comprehendible .         er  we weren   t  er   planning a           coo eee .  there you are  gentlemen .      mrs .  whitlow entered the cave .  the wizards went suddenly quiet  sensing in their wizardly minds that the introduction of mrs .  whitlow at this point was an electric fire in the swimming pool of life .      oh  another one of you     said the god brightly .  he focused .     or a different species  perhaps .      ponder felt that he had to say something .  mrs .  whitlow was giving him a look .      mrs .   er  whitlow is  er  a lady     he said .      ah  i shall make a note of it     said the god .     and what sort of thing do they do .         they   re  um  the same species as  er  us     said ponder  miserably .  um   the   um           weaker sex     ridcully supplied .      sorry  you   ve lost me there     said the god .      er   she   s  um  er  a   of the female persuasion     said ponder .   the god smiled happily .     oh  how very convenient     he said .      excuse me    said mrs .  whitlow  in as sharp a tone as she cared to use around the wizards     but will someone introduce this gentleman to me .         oh  yes  of course     said ridcully .     do excuse me .  god  this is mrs .  whitlow .  mrs .  whitlow  this is god .  a god .  god of this island  in fact .  uh           charmed  ai   m sure     said mrs .  whitlow .  in mrs .  whitlow   s book  gods were socially very acceptable  at least if they had proper human heads and wore clothes  they rated above high priests and occupied the same level as dukes .      should ai kneel .     she said .      mwaaa     whimpered the senior wrangler .      genuflection of any sort is not required     said the god .      he means no     said ponder .      oh  as you wish     said mrs .  whitlow .  she extended a hand .   the god grasped it and waggled her thumb backwards and forward .      very practical     he said .     opposable  i see .  i think i should make a note of this .  do you brachiate .  are you bipedal by habit .  oh  i notice your eyebrows go up  too .  is this a signal of some sort .  i also note that you are a different shape from the others and don   t have a beard .  i assume that means you are less wise .      ponder saw mrs .  whitlow   s eyes narrow and her nostrils flare .      is there some sort of problem  sirs .     she said .     ai followed your footprints to that funny boat  and this was the only other path  so           we were discussing sex     said the god enthusiastically .     it sounds very exciting  don   t you think .      the wizards held their breath .  this was going to make the dean   s sheets look very minor .      it   s not a subject on which ai would venture an opinion     said mrs .  whitlow carefully .      mwaa     squeaked the senior wrangler .      no one seems to want to tell me     said the god irritably .  a spark leapt from his fingers and blew a very small crater in the floor  and that seemed to shock him as much as it did the wizards .      oh dear  what can you think of me .  i   m so sorry .     he said .     i   m afraid it   s a sort of natural reaction if i get a bit  you know   testy .      everyone looked at the crater .  the rock bubbled gently by ponder   s feet .  he didn   t dare move his sandal  just in case he fainted .      that was just   testy  was it .     said ridcully .      well  it may have been more   vexed  i suppose     said the god .     i can   t really help it  it   s a god given reflex .  i   m afraid as a   well  species  we   re not good with  you know  defiance .  i   m so sorry .  so sorry .     he blew his nose  and sat down on a half finished panda .     oh  dear .  there i go again       a tiny bolt of lightning flashed off his thumb and exploded .     i hope it   s not going to be the city of quint all over again .  of course  you know what happened there           i   ve never heard of the city of quint     said ponder .      yes  i suppose you wouldn   t have     said the god .     that   s the whole point  really .  it wasn   t much of a city .  it was mostly made of mud .  well  i say mud .  afterwards  of course  it was mainly ceramics .     he turned a wretched face to them .     you know those days you get when you just snap at everyone .      out of the corner of his eye ponder had noticed that the wizards  in a rare show of unanimity  were shuffling sideways  very slowly  towards the door .   a much bigger thunderbolt blew a hole in the floor near the cave entrance .      oh dear  where can i put my face .     said the god .     it   s all subconscious  i   m afraid .         could you get treatment for premature incineration .         dean .  this is not the time .         sorry  archchancellor .         if only they hadn   t turned up their noses at my inflammable cows     said the god  sparks fizzing off his beard .     all right  i would agree that on hot days  in certain rare circumstances  they would spontaneously combust and burn down the village  but is that any excuse for ingratitude .      mrs .  whitlow had been giving the god a long  cool stare .     what exactly is it you wish to know .     she said .      huh .     said ridcully .      well  ai mean no offense  but ai for one would like to get out of here without mai hair on fire     said the housekeeper .   the god looked up .     this male and female concept seems really rather promising     he said  sniffing .     but no one seems to want to go into detail           oh  that     said mrs .  whitlow .  she glanced at the wizards  and then gently pulled the god to his feet .     if you will excuse me for one moment  gentlemen        the wizards watched them in even more shock than had attended the lightning display  and then the chair of indefinite studies pulled his hat over his eyes .      i daren   t look     he said  and added     what are they doing .         er   just talking       said ponder .      talking .         and she   s   sort of   waving her hands about .         mwaa .     said the senior wrangler .      quick  someone  give him some air     said ridcully .     now she   s laughing  isn   t she .      both the housekeeper and the god looked around at the wizards .  mrs .  whitlow nodded her head as if to reassure him that what she   d just told him was true  and they both laughed .      that looked more like a snigger     said the dean severely .      i   m not sure i actually approve of this     said ridcully  haughtily .     gods and mortal women  you know .  you hear stories .         gods turning themselves into bulls     said the dean .      swans  too     said the chair of indefinite studies .      showers of gold     said the dean .      yes     said the chair .  he paused for a second .     you know  i   ve often wondered about that one           what   s she describing now .         i think i   d rather not know  quite frankly .         oh  look  someone please do something for the senior wrangler  will you .     said ridcully .     loosen his clothing or something .      they heard the god shout     it what .     mrs .  whitlow glanced around at the wizards and appeared to lower her voice .      did anyone ever meet mr .  whitlow .     said the archchancellor .      well   no     said the dean .     not that i remember .  i suppose we   ve all assumed that he   s dead .         anyone know what he died of .     ridcully went on .     ah  quieten down   they   re coming back        the god nodded cheerfully at them as he approached .      well  that   s all sorted out     he said  rubbing his hands together .     i can   t wait to see how it works in practice .  you know  if i   d sat here for a hundred years i   d never have   well  really  no one could serious believe   i mean       he started to chuckle at their frozen faces .     that bit where he   and then she   really  i   m amazed that anyone stops laughing long enough to   still  i can see how it could work  and it certainly opens the door to some very interesting possibilities indeed        mrs .  whitlow was looking intently at the ceiling .  there was perhaps just a hint in her stance and the way her rather expressive bosom moved that she was trying not to laugh .  it was disconcerting .  mrs .  whitlow never usually laughed at anything .      ah .  oh .     said ridcully  edging towards the door .     really .  well done  then .  so  i expect you don   t need us any more  eh .  only we   ve got a boat to catch           yes  certainly  don   t let me hold you up     said the god  waving a hand vaguely .     you know  the more i think about it  the more i can see that    sex    will solve practically all my problems .         not everyone can say that     said ridcully gravely .     are you  er   joining us  mrs .   er  whitlow .         certainly  archchancellor .         er   jolly good .  well done .  ahem .  and you  of course  mister stibbons        the god had wandered over to a workbench and was rummaging in boxes .  the air glittered .  ponder looked up at the whale .  it was clearly alive but   not at the moment .  his gaze swept across the elephant under construction and past mysteriously organic looking gantries  where shimmering blue light surrounded shapes as yet unrecognized  although one did appear to contain half a cow .   he carefully removed an exploring beetle from his ear .  the point was  if he left now he   d always wonder        i think i   d like to stay     he said .      good   er       said the god  without looking around .      man     said ponder .      good man     said the god .      are you sure .     said ridcully .      i don   t think i   ve ever had a holiday     said ponder .     i   d like to apply for time off to do research  sir .         but we   re lost in the past  man .         basic research  then     said ponder firmly .     there   s just so much to learn here  sir .         really .         you   ve only got to look around  sir .         well  i suppose i can   t stop you if your mind   s made up     said the archchancellor .     we   ll have to dock your pay  of course .         i don   t think i   ve ever been paid  sir     said ponder .   the dean nudged ridcully and whispered in his ear .      and we need to know how the boat works     ridcully went on .      what .  oh  it shouldn   t be a problem     said the god  looking up from his bench .     it   ll find somewhere with a different biogeographical signature  you see .  it   s all automatic .  no sense in coming back to where you started from .     he waved a beetle leg in the air .     there   s a new continent going up turn wise of here .  the boat   ll probably head straight for a landmass that size .         new .     said ridcully .      oh  yes .  i   ve never been interested in that sort of thing myself  but you can hear the construction noises all night .  it   s certainly causing a mess .         stibbons  are you sure you want to stay .     the dean demanded .      er  yes           i   m sure mister stibbons will uphold the fine traditions of the university .     said ridcully heartily .   ponder  who knew all about the traditions of the university  nodded very slightly .  his heart was pounding .  he hadn   t even felt like this when he   d first worked out how to program hex .   at last he   d found his proper place in the world .  the future beckoned .      dawn was breaking when the wizards ambled back down the mountain .      not a bad god  i thought     said the senior wrangler .     as gods go .         that was good coffee he made us     said the chair of indefinite studies .      and didn   t he grow the bush fast  once we explained what coffee was     said the lecturer in recent runes .   they strolled on .  mrs .  whitlow was walking some way ahead  humming to herself .  the wizards took care to remain at a respectful distance .  they were aware that in some kind of obscure way she   d won  although they hadn   t a clue what the game was .      funny of young ponder to want to stay     said the senior wrangler  desperately trying to think of anything except a vision in pink .      the god seemed happy about it     said the lecturer in recent runes .     he did say that designing sex was going to involve redesigning practically everything else .         i used to make snakes out of clay when i was a little boy     said the bursar happily .      well done  bursar .         doing the feet was the hard part .         i can   t help thinking  though  that we may have   tinkered with the past  archchancellor     said the senior wrangler .      i don   t see how     said ridcully .     after all  the past happened before we got here .         ye  but now we   re here  we   ve changed it .         then we changed it before .      and that  they felt  pretty well summed it up .  it is very easy to get ridiculously confused about the tenses of time travel  but most things can be resolved by a sufficiently large ego .      it   s jolly impressive to think that a university man will be helping to create a whole new approach to designing lifeforms     said the chair of indefinite studies .      indeed  yes     said the dean .     who says education is a bad thing  eh .         i can   t imagine     said ridcully .     who .         well  if they did  we could point to ponder stibbons and say  look at him  worked hard at his studies  paid attention to his tutors  and now he   s sitting on the right hand of a god .         won   t that make it rather difficult for       the lecturer in recent runes began  but the dean got there first .      that means on the right hand side of the god  runes     he said .     which  i suspect  makes him an angel .  technically .         surely not .  he   s scared of heights .  anyway  he   s made of flesh and blood  and i   m sure angels have to be made of   light or something .  he could be a saint  though  i suppose .         can he do miracles  then .         i   m not sure .  when we left they were talking about redesigning male baboons    behinds to make them more attractive .      the wizards thought about this for a while .      that   d be a miracle in my book  certainly     said ridcully .      can   t say that   s how i   d choose to spend an afternoon  though     said the senior wrangler  in a thoughtful voice .      according to the god it   s all to do with making creatures want to have   to engage in   to get to grips with making a new generation  when they could otherwise be spending their time in more   profitable activity .  apparently  a lot of animals will need a complete rebuild .         from the bottom up .  ahaha .         thank you for your contribution  dean .         so exactly how does it work  then .     said the senior wrangler .     a female baboon sees a male baboon and says     my word  that   s a very colorful bottom and no mistake  let us engage in   nuptial activity    .         i must say i   ve often wondered about that sort of thing myself     said the lecturer in recent runes .     take frogs .  now  if i was a lady frog looking for a husband  i   d want to know about  well  size of legs  competence at catching flies           length of tongue     said ridcully .     dean  will you please take something for that cough .         quite so     said the lecturer in recent runes .     has he got a good pond  and so on .  i can   t say i   d base my choice on his ability to inflate his throat to the same size as his stomach and go rabbit  rabbit .         i believe it   s ribbit  ribbit  runes .         are you sure .         i believe so  yes .         which ones go rabbit  rabbit  then .         rabbits  i believe .         oh .  yes .  constantly  as i recall .         i   ve always thought sex was really a rather tasteless way of ensuring the continuity of the species     said the chair of indefinite studies  as they reached the beach .     i   m sure there could be something better .  it   s all very   old fashioned  to my mind .  and far too energetic .         well  i   m generally in agreement  but what would you suggest instead .     said ridcully .      bridge     said the chair of indefinite studies firmly .      really .  bridge .         you mean the game with cards .     said the dean .      i don   t see why not .  it can be extremely exciting  very sociable  and requires no special equipment .         but you do need four people     ridcully pointed out .      ah  yes .  i had not considered that .  yes  i can see that there could be problems .  all right  then .  how about   croquet .  you can do that with two .  indeed  i   ve often enjoyed a quiet knock about all by myself .      ridcully let a little more space come between him and the chair of indefinite studies .      i fail to see how it could be utilized for the purpose of procreation     he said carefully .     recreation  yes  i   ll grant you that .  but not procreation .  i mean  how would it work .         he   s the god     sniffed the chair of indefinite studies .     he   s supposed to sort out the details  isn   t he .         but you think women would really decide to spend their life with a man just because he can swing a big mallet .     said the dean .      i suppose  when you come to think about it  that   s no more ridic       ridcully began  and then stopped .     i think we should leave this subject     he said .      i played croquet with him only last week     hissed the dean to ridcully  as the chair wandered off .     i shan   t be happy now until i   ve had a good bath .         we   ll lock up his mallets when we get back  depend upon it     ridcully whispered .      he   s got books and books about croquet in his room  did you know that .  some of them have got colored illustrations .         what of .         famous croquet strokes     said the dean .     i think we ought to take his mallet away .         close to what i was thinking  dean .  close     said ridcully .      once a moderately jolly wizard camped by a dried up waterhole under the shade of a tree that he was completely unable to identify .  and he swore as he hacked and hacked at a can of beer  saying     what kind of idiots put beer in tins .      by the time he managed to make a hole with a sharp stone the beer came out as high speed froth  but he fielded as much as he could .   apart from the beer  though  things were looking up .  he   d checked the trees for drop bears and  best of all  there was no sign of scrappy .   he managed to pierce another tin  more carefully this time  and sucked thoughtfully at the contents .   what a country .  nothing was exactly what it turned out to be  even the sparrows talked  or at least tried to say     who   s a pretty boy  then .     and it never ever rained .  and all the water hid underground  so they had to pump it out with windmills .   he   d passed another one as he left the canyon country .  this one was still managing a trickle of water  but it had dried up to an occasional drip even as he watched it .   damn .  he should   ve picked up some water to take away while he was there .   he looked at the food in the sack .  there was a loaf of bread the size and weight of a cannonball  and some vegetables .  but at least they were recognizable vegetables .  there was even a potato .   he held it up against the sunset .   rincewind had eaten in many countries on the disc  and sometimes he   d been able to complete an entire meal before having to run away .  and they   d always lacked something .  oh  people did great things with spices and olives and yams and rice and whatnot  but what he   d come to crave was the humble potato .   time was when a plate of mash or chips would have been his for the asking .  all he   d needed to do was wander down to the kitchens and ask .  food was always available for the asking at unseen university  you could say that for the place  even if you said it with your mouth full .  and  ridiculous though it sounded now  he   d hardly ever done that .  the dish of potatoes   d come past at mealtimes and he   d probably have a spoonful but  sometimes  he wouldn   t .  he   d   let   the   dish   go   by .  he   d have rice instead .  rice .  all very nutritious in its way  but basically only grown where potatoes would   ve floated to the surface .   he   d remember those times  sometimes  usually in his sleep  and wake up shouting     will you pass the potatoes  please .      sometimes he remembered the melted butter .  those were the bad days .   he placed the potato reverentially on the ground and tipped out the rest of the bag .  there was an onion and some carrots .  a tin of   tea  by the smell of it  and a little box of salt .   a flash of inspiration struck him with all the force and brilliance that ideas have when they   re traveling through beer .   soup .  nutritious and simple .  you just boiled everything up .  and  yes  he could use one of the empty beer tins  and make a fire  and chop up the vegetables  and the damp patch over there suggested there was water     he walked unsteadily over to have a look .  there was a circular depression in the ground that looked as though it might have been some sort of pond once  and there was the usual cluster of slightly healthier than usual trees which you got in such places  but there was no sign of any water and he was too tired to dig .   then another insight struck him at the speed of beer .  beer .  it was only water  really  with stuff in it .  wasn   t it .  and most of what was in it was yeast  which was practically a medicine and definitely a food .  in fact  when you thought about it  beer was only a kind of runny bread  in fact  it   d be better to use some of the beer in the soup .  beer soup .  a few brain cells registered their doubt  but the rest of them grabbed them by the collar and said hoarsely  people cooked chicken in wine  didn   t they .   it took him some time to hack one end off a tin  but eventually he had it standing in the fire with the chopped up vegetables floating in the froth .  a few more doubts assailed him at this point  but they were elbowed aside  especially when the smell that floated up made his mouth water and he   d opened another tin of beer as a pre prandial appetizer .   after a while he poked the vegetables with a stick .  they were still pretty hard  even though a lot of the beer seemed to have boiled away .  was there something else he hadn   t done .   salt .  yes  that was it .  salt  marvelous stuff .  he   d read where you went totally up the pole if you didn   t have any salt for a couple of weeks .  that was probably why he was feeling so odd at the moment .  he fumbled for the salt box and dropped a pinch in the tin .   it was a medicinal herb  salt .  good for wounds  wasn   t it .  and back in the really old days  hadn   t soldiers been paid in salt .  wasn   t that where the word salary came from .  must   ve been good  then .  you went on a forced march all week  building your road as you went  then you fought the maddened blue painted tribesmen of the vexatii  and you force marched all the way back home  and on friday the centurion would turn up with a big sack and say     well done  lads .  here   s some salt .      it was amazing how well his mind was working .   he peered at the salt box again  shrugged  and tipped it all in .  when you thought about it like that  salt must really be an amazing food .  and he hadn   t had any for weeks  so that was probably why his eyesight was acting up and he couldn   t feel his legs .   he topped up the beer  too .   he lay back with his head on a rock .  keep out of trouble and don   t get involved  that was the important thing .  look at those stars up there  with nothing to do all the time but sit there and shine .  no one ever told them what to do  the lucky bastards     he woke up shivering .  something horrible had crawled into his mouth  and it was no great relief to find out that it was his tongue .  it was chilly  and the horizon suggested dawn .   there was also a pathetic sucking noise .   some sheep had invaded his camp during the night .  one of them was trying to get its mouth around an empty beer tin .  it stopped when it saw that he had woken up  and backed away a bit  but not too far  while fixing him with the penetrating gaze of a domesticated animal reminding its domesticator that they had a deal .   his head ached .   there had to be some water somewhere .  he lurched to his feet and blinked at the horizon .  there were   windmills and things  weren   t there .  he remembered the stricken windmills from yesterday .  well  there was bound to be some water around  no matter what anyone said .  ye gods  he was thirsty .   his gummed up gaze fell upon last night   s magnificent experiment in cookery .  yeasty vegetable soup  what a wonderful idea .  exactly the sort of idea that sounds really good around one o   clock in the morning when you   ve had too much to drink .   now he remembered  with a shudder  some of the great wheezes he   d had on similar occasions .  spaghetti and custard  that   d been a good one .  deep fried peas  that   d been another triumph .  and then there   d been the time when it had seemed a really good idea to eat some flour and yeast and then drink some warm water  because he   d run out of bread and after all that was what the stomach saw  wasn   t it .  the thing about late night cookery was that it made sense at the time .  it always had some logic behind it .  it just wasn   t the kind of logic you   d use around midday .   still  he   d have to eat something and the dark brown goo that half filled the tin was the only available food in this vicinity that didn   t have at least six legs .  he didn   t even think about eating mutton .  you couldn   t  when it was looking at you so pathetically .   he poked the goo with the stick .  it gripped the wood like glue .      gerroff .      a blob eventually came loose .  rincewind tasted it  gingerly .  it was just possible that if you mixed yeasty beer and vegetables together you   d get     no  what you got was salty tasting beery brown gunk .   odd  though   it was kind of horrible  but nevertheless rincewind found himself having another taste .   oh  gods .  now he was really thirsty .   he picked up the tin and staggered off towards some trees .  that   s where you found water   you looked at where the trees were and  tired or not  you dug down .   it took him half an hour to squash an empty beer tin and use it to dig a hole waist deep .  his toes felt damp .   another half an hour took him to shoulder depth and a pair of wet ankles .   say what you like   that brown muck was good stuff .  it was the runny equivalent of dwarf bread .  you didn   t really believe what your mouth said you   d just tasted  so you had some more .  probably full of nourishing vitamins and minerals .  most things you couldn   t believe the taste of generally were     by the time he raised his head he was surrounded by sheep  eyeing him cautiously in between longing glances into the damp depths .      it   s no good you lot looking at me like that     he said .  they paid no attention .  they carried on looking at him .      it   s not my fault     rincewind muttered .     i don   t care what any kangaroo says .  i just arrived here .  i   m not responsible for the weather  for heaven   s sake .      they went on looking .  he cracked .  practically anyone will crack before a sheep cracks .  a sheep hasn   t got much that   s crackable .      oh  hell  maybe i can rig up some kind of bucket and pulley arrangement     he said .     it   s not as though i   ve got any appointments today .      he was digging a bit further  in the hope of getting deep enough before the water ran away completely  when he heard someone whistling .   he looked up  through the legs of the sheep .  a man was creeping down across the dried up water hole  whistling tunelessly between his teeth .  he   d failed to notice rincewind because his gaze was fixed so intently on the milling sheep .  he dropped the pack he   d been carrying  pulled out a sack  sidled towards a sheep all by itself  and leapt .  it barely had time to bleat .   as he was stuffing it into the sack a voice said     that probably belongs to someone  you know .      the man looked around hurriedly .  the voice was coming from a group of sheep .      i reckon you could get into serious trouble  stealing sheep .  you   ll regret it later on  i   m sure .  probably someone really cares about that sheep .  come on  let it go .      the man stared around wildly .      i mean  think about it     the voice went on .     you   ve got this nice country here  parrots and everything  and you   re going to spoil it all by stealing someone   s sheep that they   ve worked so hard to grow .  i bet you wouldn   t like to be remembered as a sheep stealer   oh .      the man had dropped the sack and was running away very fast .      well  you didn   t have to waltz off like that  i was only trying to appeal to your better nature .     said rincewind  pulling himself up out of the hole .   he cupped his hands .     and you   ve forgotten your camping stuff .     he shouted  after the disappearing dust .   the sack baa ed .   rincewind picked it up  and a noise behind him made him look round .  there was another man watching him from the back of a horse .  he was glaring .   behind him were three men wearing identical helmets and jerkins and humorless expressions that had    watchman    written all over them in slow handwriting .  and all three were pointing crossbows at him .   that bottomless feeling that he had once again wandered into something that didn   t concern him and was going to find it hard to wander out again grew within rincewind .   he tried to smile .      g   day .     he said .     no worries  eh .  i must say i   m really glad to see you drongos and no two ways about it .         ponder stibbons cleared his throat .      where would you like me to start .     he said .     i could probably finish off the elephant           how are you at slime .      ponder hadn   t considered a future as a slime designer  but everyone had to start somewhere .      fine     he said .     fine .         of course  slime just splits down the middle     said the god  as they walked along rows of glowing  life filled cubes while beetles sizzled overhead .     not a lot of future in that  really .  it works all right for lower lifeforms but  frankly  it   s a bit embarrassing for the more complicated creatures and positively lethal for horses .  no  sex is going to be very  very useful  ponder .  it   ll keep everything on its toes .  and that will give us time to work on the big project .      ponder sighed .  ah   he knew there had to be a big project .  the big project .  a god wasn   t going to do all this sort of thing just to make life better for inflammable cows .      could i help with that .     he said .     i   m sure i could make a contribution .         really .  i thought perhaps animals and birds would be more up your   up your       the god waved his hands vaguely .     up whatever you walk on .  where you live .         well  yes  but they   re a bit limited  aren   t they .     said ponder .   the god beamed .  there   s nothing like being near a happy god .  it   s like giving your brain a hot bath .      exactly .     he said .     limited .  the very word .  each one stuck in some desert or jungle or mountain  relying on one or two foods  at the mercy of every vagary of the universe and wiped out by the merest change of climate .  what a terrible waste .         that   s right .     said ponder .     what you need is a creature that is resourceful and adaptable  am i right .         oh  very well put  ponder .  i can see you   ve turned up at just the right time .     a pair of huge doors swung open in front of them  revealing a circular room with a shallow pyramid of steps in the center .  at the summit was another cloud of blue mist  in which occasional lights flared and died .   the future unrolled in front of ponder stibbons .  his eyes were so bright that his glasses steamed  that he could probably scorch holes in thin paper .  oh  right   what more could any natural philosopher dream of .  he   d got the theories  now he could do the practice .   and this time it   d be done properly .  to hell with messing up the future .  that   s what the future was for .  oh  he   d been against it  that was true  but it   d been   well  when someone else was thinking of doing it .  but now he   d got the ear of a god  and maybe some intelligence could be applied to the task of creating intelligence .   for a start  it ought to be possible to put together the human brain so that long beards weren   t associated with wisdom  which would instead be seen to reside in those who were young and skinny and required glasses for close work .      and   you   ve finished this .     he said  as they climbed the steps .      broadly  yes     said the god .     my greatest achievement .  frankly  it makes the elephants look very flimsy by comparison .  but there   s plenty of fine detail left to do  if you think you   re up to it .         it   d be an honor     said ponder .   the blue mist was right in front of him .  by the look of the sparks  something very important was happening in there .      do you give them any instructions before you let them out .     he said  his breathing shallow .      a few simple ones     said the god .  he waved a wrinkled hand  and the glowing ball began to contract .     mostly they work things out themselves .         of course  of course     said ponder .     and i suppose if they go wrong we could always put them right with a few commandments .         not really necessary     said the god  as the blue ball vanished and revealed the pinnacle of creation .     i find very simple instructions are quite sufficient .  you know      head for dark places     that sort of thing .  there .  isn   t it perfect .  what a piece of work .  the sun will burn out  the seas will dry up  but this chap will be there  you mark my   hello .  ponder .         the dean wet a finger and held it up .     we have the wind on our starboard beam     he said .      that   s good  is it .     said the senior wrangler .      could be  could be .  let   s hope it can take us to this continent he mentioned .  i   m getting nervous of islands .      ridcully finished hacking through the stem of the boat and threw it overboard .   at the top of the green mast the trumpet like blooms appeared to tremble in the wind .  the leaf sail creaked slowly into a different position .      i   d say this was a miracle of nature     said the dean     if we hadn   t just met the person who did it .  rather spoils it  that .      while wizards were not generally adventurous  they did understand that a vital part of any great undertaking is the securing of adequate provisions  which is why the boat was noticeably heavier in the water .   the dean selected a natural cigar  lit it  and made a face .     not the best     he said .     rather green .         we   ll just have to rough it     said ridcully .     what are you doing  senior wrangler .         just preparing a little tray for mrs .  whitlow .  a few choice things .      the wizards glanced towards the crude awning they   d erected towards the prow .  it wasn   t that she   d actually asked for it .  it was simply that she   d made some remark about how hot the sun was  as anyone might  and suddenly wizards were getting in each other   s way as they vied with one another to cut poles and weave palm leaves .  perhaps never has so much intellectual effort gone into building a sunshade  which might have accounted for the wobble .      i thought it was my turn to do that     said the dean  coldly .      no  dean  you took her the fruit drink  if you remember     said the senior wrangler  cutting a cheese nut into dainty segments .      that was just one small drink .     the dean snapped .     you   re doing a whole tray .  look  you   ve even done a flower arrangement in a coconut shell .         mrs .  whitlow likes that sort of thing     said the senior wrangler calmly .     but she did say it was still a bit warm  so possibly you can fan her with a palm leaf while i peel these grapes for her .         once again it is left to me to point out the elementary unfairness     said the dean .     merely waving a leaf is a very menial activity compared to removing grape skins  and i happen to outrank you  senior wrangler .         indeed  dean .  and exactly how do you work that out .         it   s not my opinion  man  it   s written into the faculty structure .         of where  precisely .         have you gone totally bursar .  unseen university  of course .         and where is that  exactly .     said the senior wrangler  carefully arranging some lilies in a pleasing design .      ye gods  man  it   s   it   s       the dean flapped a hand in the direction of the horizon  and his voice trailed off as certain facts of time and space bore in on him .      i   ll leave you to work it out  shall i .     said the senior wrangler  getting off his knees and raising the tray reverentially .      i   ll help .     shouted the dean  lumbering to his feet .      it   s very light  i assure you           no  no  i can   t let you do it all by yourself .      each holding the tray with one hand  and trying to push the other man away with the spare hand  they lurched forward  leaving a trail of spilt coconut milk and petals .   ridcully rolled his eyes .  it must be the heat  he thought .  he turned to the chair of indefinite studies  who was trying to tie a short log to a long stick with a piece of creeper .      i was just thinking     he said     that everyone   s gone a little bit mad except me and you   er  what are you doing there .         i was just wondering whether mrs .  whitlow might like a game of croquet     said the chair .  he waggled his eyebrows conspiratorially .   the archchancellor sighed and wandered off along the deck .  the librarian had gone back to being a deckchair as a suitable mode for shipboard life  and the bursar had gone to sleep on him .   the big leaf moved slightly .  ridcully got the feeling that the green trumpets on the mast were sniffing .   the wizards were already a little way from shore  but he saw the column of dust come down the track .  it stopped at the beach and became a dot  which plunged into the sea .   the sail creaked again  and flapped as the wind grew .      ahoy there .     shouted ridcully .   the distant figure waved for a moment and then continued swimming .   ridcully filled his pipe and watched with interest as ponder stibbons caught up with the boat .      very well swum  if i may say so     he said .      permission to come aboard  sir .     said ponder  treading water .     could you throw down a creeper .         why  certainly .      the archchancellor puffed his pipe as the wizard climbed aboard .     possibly a record time over that distance  mister stibbons .         thank you  sir     said ponder  dripping water on the deck .      and may i congratulate you on being properly dressed .  you are wearing your pointy hat  which is the sine qua non of a wizard in public .         thank you  sir .         it is a good hat .         thank you  sir .         they say a wizard without his hat is undressed  mister stibbons .         so i have heard  sir .         but in your case  i must point out  you are with your hat but you are still  in a very real sense  undressed .         i thought the robe would slow me down  sir .         and  while it is good to see you  stibbons  albeit rather more of you than i would usually care to contemplate  i am moved to ask why you are  in fact  here .         i suddenly felt it would be unfair to deprive the university of my services  sir .         really .  a sudden rush of nostalgia for the old alma mater  eh .         you could say that  sir .      ridcully   s eyes twinkled behind the smoke and  not for the first time  ponder suspected that the man was sometimes rather cleverer than he appeared .  it would not be hard .   the archchancellor shrugged  removed his pipe  and poked around inside it to remove a particularly obstructive clinker .      the senior wrangler   s bathing costume is around somewhere     he said .     i should put it on  if i were you .  i suspect that offending mrs .  whitlow at the moment will get you hanged .  all right .  and if there is anything you want to talk about  my door is always open .         thank you  sir .         right now  of course  i don   t have a door .         thank you  sir .         imagine it as being open  nevertheless .         thank you  sir .      after all  ponder thought as he slipped gratefully away  the wizards of uu were merely crazy .  not even the bursar was insane .   even now  if he closed his eyes  he could still see the god of evolution beaming so happily as the cockroach stirred .      rincewind rattled the bars .     don   t i get a trial .     he shouted .   after a while a warder wandered along the corridor .     wha   d   yew want a trial for  mister .         what .  well  call me mister silly  but it might just prove that i wasn   t trying to steal the damn sheep  mightn   t it .     said rincewind .     i was in fact rescuing it .  if only you people would track down the thief  he   d tell you .      the warder leaned against the wall and stuck his hands in his belt .      yeah  well  it   s a funny thing     he said     but  y   know  we searched and searched and put up notices and everything but  funny thing  yew   ll never believe this  the bastard hasn   t had the decency to come forward .  makes yew despair of human nature  eh .         so what   s going to happen to me .      the warder scratched his nose .     gonna hang you by the neck until you   re dead  mate .  tomorrow morno .         you couldn   t perhaps just hang me by the neck until i   m sorry .         no  mate .  got to be dead .         good grief  it was only a sheep when all   s said and done .      the warder grinned widely .     ah  a lot of men have gone to the gallows sayin    that in the past     he said .     s   matterofact  you   re the first sheep stealer we   ve had here for years .  all our big heroes have been sheep stealers .  you   re gonna get a big crowd .         baah .         maybe a flock  too     said the warder .      that   s another thing     said rincewind .     why   s this sheep in my cell .         evidence  mate .      rincewind looked down at the sheep .     oh .  well  no worries  then .      the warder wandered off .  rincewind sat down on the bunk .   well  he could look on the bright side  couldn   t he .  this was civilization .  he hadn   t seen much of it  what with being tied across the back of a horse and everything  but what he   d been able to see was full of ruts and hoofprints and smelled pretty bad  which civilization often does .  they were going to hang him in the morning .  this building was the first one made of stone he   d seen in this country .  they had watchmen  even .  they were going to hang him in the morning .  there were the sounds of carts and people filtering in through the high window .  they were going to hang him in the morning .   he gazed around the cell .  it looked as though whoever   d built it had unaccountably forgotten to include any useful trapdoors .   trapdoors   now there was a word he shouldn   t think about .   he   d been in nastier places than this .  much  much nastier .  and that made it worse  because he   d been up against nasty  weird and magical things which suddenly seemed a lot easier to contemplate than the fact that he was held in some stone box and in the morning some perfectly nice people who he might quite like if he met them in a bar were going to march him out and make him stand on a really unsafe floor in a very tight collar .      baah .         shut up .         baah .         couldn   t you have had a bath  or a dip or something .  it   s a bit agricultural in here .      the wall  now his eyes had become accustomed to the gloom  was covered with scrawls  and in particular those little wicket gate tallies drawn by prisoners who were counting the days .  they were going to hang him in the morning  so that was one chore he wouldn   t have to   shut up  shut up .   now he came to look closer  most of the counts went up to one .   he lay back with his eyes closed .  of course he   d get rescued  he   d always got rescued .  although  come to think of it  always in circumstances that put him in such a lot more danger than a prison cell usually held .   well  he   d been in enough cells .  there were ways to handle these things .  the important thing was to be direct .  he got up and banged on the bars until the warder sauntered along the corridor .      yes  mate .         i just want to get things sorted out     said rincewind .     it   s not as though i   ve got time to waste  okay .         yep .         is there any chance that you   re going to fall asleep in a chair opposite this cell with your keys fully exposed on a table in front of you .      they looked at the empty corridor .      i   d have to get someone to help me bring a table down here     said the warder doubtfully .     can   t see it happening  mister .  sorry .         right .  okay .     rincewind thought for a moment .     all right   is my dinner likely to be brought in by a young lady carrying  and this is important  carrying a tray covered with a cloth .         no     cos i do the cooking .         right .         bread and water is what i   m good at .         right  just checking .            ere  that sticky brown stuff they brought in with you is top stuff on bread  mister .         be my guest .         i can feel the vitamins and minerals doing me a power of good .         no worries .  now   ah  yes .  laundry .  are there any big laundry baskets around  which will happily get tipped down a chute to the outside world .         sorry  mister .  there   s an old washerwoman comes in to collect it .         really .     rincewind brightened .     ah  a washerwoman .  big lady  bulky dress  possibly wears a hood which can be pulled down to cover a lot of her face .         yep  pretty much .         well then  is she due in    .         she   s my mum     said the warder .      right  fine        they looked at one another .      i reckon that about covers it  then     said rincewind .     i hope you didn   t mind me asking .         bless yew  no .  no worries .  happy to help .  worked out what yew   re gonna say on the gallows  have yer .  only some of the ballad writers want to know  if yew wouldn   t mind .         ballads .         oh  yeah .  there   s three so far and i reckon there   ll be ten by tomorra .      rincewind rolled his eyes .     how many of them have put    too ra la  too ra la addity    in the chorus .     he asked .      all of them .         oh  gods           and yew wouldn   t mind changin    your name  would yew .  only they   re sayin       rincewind    is a bit tricky to turn a line on .  concernin    of a bush ranger  rincewind was his name          s got the wrong sort of sound           well  i   m sorry .  perhaps you   d better let me go  then .         ha  nice one .  now  if you want my advice  you   ll keep it short when yew   re up on the gallows     said the warder .     the best famous last words are the shortest .  something simple gen   rally works best .  go easy on the swearin    .         look  all i did was steal a sheep .  and i didn   t even do that .  what   s everyone so excited about .     said rincewind desperately .      oh  very notorious crime  sheep stealing     said the warder cheerfully .     strikes a chord .  little man battlin    against the forces of brutal authority .  people like that .  you   ll be remembered in song    n    story     specially if yew come up with some good last words  like i said .     the warder hitched up his belt .     to tell you the truth  a lot of people these days haven   t even seen a bloody sheep  but hearing that someone   s stolen one makes    em feel proper ecksians .  it even does me good to have a proper criminal in the cells for once  instead of all these bloody politicians .      rincewind sat down on the bunk again  with his head in his hands .      o    course  a famous escape is nearly as good as gettin    hanged     said the warder  in the manner of someone trying to keep up someone else   s spirits .      really     said rincewind .      yew ain   t asked if the little grille in the floor there leads into the sewers     the warder prompted .   rincewind peered between his fingers .     does it .         we ain   t got any sewers .         thank you .  you   ve been very helpful .      the warden strolled off again  whistling .   rincewind lay back on the bunk and closed his eyes again .      baah .         shut up .            scuse me  mister        rincewind groaned and sat up again .  this time the voice was coming from the high  small  barred window .      yes  what is it .         yew know when you was caught .         well .  what about it .         er   what kind of a tree were you under .      rincewind looked up at the narrow square of blue the prisoner calls the sky .     what kind of question is that to ask me .         it   s for the ballad  see .  only it   d help if it was a name with three syllables           how do i know .  i didn   t stop for a bit of botany .         all right  all right  fair enough     said the hidden speaker .     but would you mind telling me what you was doing just before you stole the sheep .         i didn   t steal the sheep .         right  right  okay   what was you doing just before you didn   t steal the sheep    .         i don   t know  i can   t remember .         were you boiling your billy  by any chance .         i   m not admitting to that .  the way you people talk  that could mean anything .         means cookin    something up in a tin .         oh .  well  yes  i had been doing that  as it happens .         good on yer .     rincewind thought he heard the sound of scribbling .     shame you didn   t die at the end  but you   re gonna get hung so that   s all right .  got a beaut tune for this one  you just can   t stop whistling it   well  of course you will  no worries .         thank you for that .         reckon you might be as famous as tinhead ned  mate .         really .     rincewind went and lay down on his bunk again .      yeah .  they used to lock him up in that very cell you   re in now  in fact .  and he always escaped .  no one knows how     cos that   s a bloody good lock and he didn   t bend any bars .  he said they   d never build a jail that could hold him .         thin fellow  was he .         nope .         so he had a key or something .         nope .  got to go now  mate .  oh  yeah  i remember .  er  do you think your ghost will be heard if people pass by the billybong  or not .         what .         it   d be helpful if it did .  makes a good last verse .  top stuff .         i don   t know .         we ell  i   ll say it will  shall i .  no one   s gonna go back and check .         don   t let me stand in your way  then .         bonza .  i   ll get these songsheets printed up in time for the hanging  don   t you worry about that .         i won   t .      rincewind lay back .  tinhead ned again .  that was just a joke  he could spot it .  it was some kind of torture  telling him that anyone had ever escaped from a cell like this .  they wanted him to run around rattling bars and things  but even he could see they were well set in and very heavy and the lock was bigger than his head .   he was just lying back on the bunk again when the warder turned up .   there were a couple of men with him .  rincewind was pretty sure there weren   t any trolls here  because it was probably too hot for them and anyway there wouldn   t be enough room for them on the driftwood  what with all those camels  but these men definitely had the heavy set look of men who occupy the kind of job where the entrance examination is    what is your name .     and they scrape through on the third try .   the warder was wearing a big grin and carrying a tray .     got some dinnah for you     he said .      i won   t tell you anything  no matter how much you feed me     rincewind warned .      you   ll like this     the warder urged  pushing the tray forward .  there was a covered bowl on it .     i done it special for you .  it   s a regional specialty  mate .         i thought you said bread and water   s what you   re good at .         well  yeah   but i had a bash at this anyway        rincewind watched gloomily as the warder lifted the cover .    it looked fairly inoffensive  but they often did .  it looked  in fact  like        pea soup .     he said .      yep .         the leguminous vegetable .  comes in pods .         yep .         i thought i   d better check that point .         no worries .      rincewind looked down at the knobbly green surface .  was it just possible that someone had invented a regional specialty you could eat .   and then something rose out of the depths .  for a moment rincewind thought it was a very small shark .  it bobbed to the surface and then settled back down  while the soup slopped over it .      what was that .         meat pie floater     said the warder .     meat pie floating in pea soup .  best bloody supper on earth  mate .         ah  supper     said rincewind  as realization dawned .     this is another one of those late night  after the pub foods  right .  and what kind of meat is in it .  no  forget i asked  it   s a stupid question .  i know this sort of food .  if you have to ask    what kind of meat is in it .     you   re too sober .  ever tried spaghetti and custard .         can you sprinkle coconut on top of it .         probably .         thanks  mate  i   ll surely give it a go     said the warder .     got some other good news for you  too .         you   re letting me out .         oh  you wouldn   t want that  a hard bitten larrikin like yourself .  nah  greg and vince here will be coming back later to put you in irons .      he stepped aside .  the wall shaped men were holding a length of chain  several shackles and a small but very  very heavy looking ball .   rincewind sighed .  one door closes  he thought  and another door slams shut .     this is good  is it .     he said .      oh  yew   ll get an extra verse for that  for sure     said the warder .     no one   s been hung in irons since tinhead ned .         i thought there wasn   t a prison cell that could hold him     said rincewind .      oh  he could get out of    em     said the warder .     he just couldn   t run very far .      rincewind eyed the metal ball .     oh  gods           vince says how much do you weigh     cos he has to add the chains to your weight to get the drop right     said the warder .      does that matter .     said rincewind in a hollow voice .     i mean  i die anyway  don   t i .         yeah  no worries there  but if he gets it wrong  see  you either end up with a neck six feet long or  you   ll laugh about this  your head flies off like a perishin    cork .         oh  good .         with larrikin larry we had to search the roof all arvo .         marvelous .  all arvo  eh .     said rincewind .     well  you won   t have that problem with me .  i shall be elsewhere when i   m being hanged .         that   s what we like to hear .     said the warder  punching him jovially in the elbow .     a battler to the end  eh .      there was a rumbling from mt .  vince .      and vince says he   ll be very privileged if you   d care to spit in his eye when he puts the rope aroun    your neck     the warder went on .     that   ll be something to show his grandchildren           will you all please go away .     rincewind shouted .      ah  you   ll be wanting some time to plot your getaway     said the warder knowingly .     no worries .  we   ll be leavin    you alone  then .         thank you .         until about five a . m .         good     said rincewind gloomily .      got any requests for your last breakfast .         something that takes a really really long time to prepare .     said rincewind .      that   s the spirit .         go away .         no worries .      the men walked off  but the warder strolled back after a while as if he had something on his mind .      there is something that you ought to know about the hanging  though     he said .     might brighten up your night .         yes .         we   ve got a special humanitarian tradition if the trapdoor sticks three times .         yes .         sounds a bit odd  but it   s happened once or twice  believe it or not .      a tiny green shoot rose from the blackened branches of hope .      and what   s the tradition .     said rincewind .      it   s on account of it being heartless to have a man standing there more than three times  knowing that at any second his           yes  yes              and then all his           yes              and the worst part to my mind is where your           yes  i understand .  and so   after the third time    .         he   s allowed back into his cell while we get a carpenter in to repair the trapdoor     said the warder .     we even give him his dinner  if it   s gone on a long time .         and .         well  when the carpenter   s given it a good test  then we take him out again and hang him .     he saw rincewind   s expression .     no need to look like that .     s better than having to stand around in the cold all morning  isn   t it .  that wouldn   t be nice .      when he   d gone  rincewind sat and stared at the wall .      baa .         shut up .      so it was down to this  then .  one brief night left  and then  if these clowns had anything to do with it  happy people would be wandering the streets to see where his head had come down .  there was no justice .   g   day  mate .      oh  no .  please .      i just thought i should enter into the spirit of the thing .  a very convivial people  aren   t they .  said death .  he was sitting beside rincewind .      you just can   t wait  can you .     said rincewind bitterly .   no worries .      so this is really it  then .  i was supposed to have saved this country  you know .  and i   m going to really die .      oh  yes .  this is certain  i   m afraid .      it   s the stupidity of it that gets me .  i mean  think of all the times i   ve nearly died in the past .  i could   ve been flamed by dragons  right .  or eaten by huge things with tentacles .  or even had every single particle of my body fly off in a different direction .      you have certainly had an interesting life .      is it true that your life passes before your eyes before you die .      yes .      ghastly thought  really .     rincewind shuddered .     oh  gods  i   ve just had another one .  suppose i am just about to die and this is my whole life passing in front of my eyes .      i think perhaps you do not understand .  people   s whole lives do pass in front of their eyes before they die .  the process is called    living .     would you like a prawn .   rincewind looked down at the bucket on death   s lap .      no  thank you .  i really don   t think so .  they can be pretty deadly .  and i must say it   s a bit much of you to come here and gloat and eat prawns at me .      i beg your pardon .      just because i   m being hanged in the morning  i mean .      are you .  then i shall look forward to hearing how you escaped .  i   m due to meet a man in   in   death   s eyesockets glowed as he interrogated his memory .  ah  yes   inside a crocodile .  several hundred miles away  i believe .      what .  then why are you here .      oh  i thought you might like to see a friendly face .  and now i think i had better be going .  death stood up .  very pleasant city in many respects .  try to see the opera house while you   re here .      hang on   i mean  hold on  you told me i was certainly going to die .      everyone is .  eventually .   the wall opened and closed around death as if it wasn   t there  which was  from his lengthy perspective  quite true .      but how .  i can   t walk through       rincewind began .   he sat down again .  the sheep cowered in the corner .   rincewind looked at the untouched meat pie floater and gave the pie a prod .  it sank slowly beneath the vivid green soup .   the sounds of the city filtered in .   after a while the pie rose again like a forgotten continent  sending a very small wave slopping against the edge of the bowl .   rincewind lay back on the thin blanket and stared at the ceiling .  someone had even been writing on that  too .  in fact        gdy mat .  look at the hinjis .  ned .      slowly  as if being raised by invisible strings  rincewind turned and looked at the door .   the hinges were massive .  they weren   t screwed into the doorframe so that some clever prisoner might unscrew them .  they were huge iron hooks  hammered into the stone itself  so that two heavy rings welded on to the door could drop right down on them .  what was the man talking about .   he walked over and examined the lock closely .  it drove a huge metal rod into the frame on its side and looked quite unpickable .   rincewind stared at the door for some time .  then he rubbed his hands together and  gritting his teeth  tried to lift the door on the hinge side .  yes  there was just enough play     it was possible to lift the rings off the spikes .   then  if you pulled slightly and took a knee wobbling step this way  you could yank the lock   s rod out of its hole and the entire door into the cell .   and then a man could walk through and carefully rehang the door again and quietly wander away .   and that  rincewind thought as he carefully maneuvered the door back on to the hinges  was exactly what a stupid person would do .   at moments like this cowardice was an exact science .  there were times that called for mindless  terror filled panic  and times that called for measured  considered  thoughtful panic .  right now he was in a place of safety .  it was  admittedly  the death cell  but the point was that it was perhaps the one place in this country where nothing bad was going to happen for a little while .  the ecksians didn   t look like the kind of people who went in for torture  although it was always possible they might make him eat some more of their food .  so  for the moment  he had time .  time to plan ahead  to consider his next move  to apply his intellect to the problem at hand .   he stared at the wall for a moment  and then stood up and gripped the bars .   right .  that seemed to be about long enough .  now to run like hell .      the green deck of the melon boat had been divided into a male and female section  for the sake of decency .  this meant that most of the deck was occupied by mrs .  whitlow  who spent a lot of the time sunbathing behind a screen .  her privacy was assured by the wizards themselves  since at least three of them would probably kill any of the others who ventured within ten feet of the palm leaves .   there was definitely what ponder   s aunt  who   d raised him  would have called an atmosphere .      i still think i ought to climb the mast     he protested .      ah .  a peeping torn  eh .     snarled the senior wrangler .      no  i just think it would be a good idea to see where the boat is going     said ponder .     there   re some big black clouds ahead .         good  we could do with the rain     snapped the chair of indefinite studies .      in which case  i shall be honored to make mrs .  whitlow a suitable shelter     said the dean .   ponder walked back to the stern  where the archchancellor was gloomily fishing .      honestly  you   d think mrs .  whitlow was the only woman in the world     he said .      do you think she might be .     said ridcully .   ponder   s mind raced  and hit some horrible speed bumps in his imagination .     surely not  sir .     he said .      we don   t know  ponder .  still  look on the bright side .  we may all be drowned .         er   sir .  have you looked at the horizon .         the everlasting storm was seven thousand miles long but only a mile wide  a great turning  boiling mass of enraged air circling the last continent like a family of foxes circling a henhouse .   the clouds were mounded up all the way to the edge of the atmosphere   and they were ancient clouds now  clouds that had rolled around their tortured circuit for years  building up personality and hatred and  above all  voltage .   it was not a storm  it was a battle .  mere gales  a few hundred miles long  fought amongst themselves within the cloud wall .  lightning forked from thunderhead to thunderhead  rain fell and flashed into steam half a mile from the ground .   the air glowed .   and below  emerging from the ocean of potentiality in a rainstorm so thunderous that it was no more than a descending sea  rose the last continent .      on the wall of the deserted cell in bugarup gaol  among the scratches and stick drawings and tallies of a man   s last few days  a drawing of a sheep became a drawing of a kangaroo and then faded completely into the stone .         so .     said the dean .     we   re in for a bit of a blow .      the gray line filled the immediate future like a dental appointment .      i think it might be a lot worse     said ponder .      well  let   s steer somewhere else  then .         there   s no rudder  sir .  and we don   t know where anywhere else is .  and we   re low on water anyway .         don   t they say that a big bank of cloud means there   s land ahead .     said the dean .      bloody big land  then .  ecksecksecksecks  do you think .         i hope so  sir .     above ponder  the sail flapped and billowed .     wind   s freshening  sir .  i think the storm   s sucking the air towards it .  and   there   s something else  i think .  i wish i hadn   t left my thaumometer on the beach  sir  because i think here   s a very high level of background magic in this area .         what makes you say this  boy .     said the dean .      well  for one thing everyone seems to be getting a bit tense  and wizards tend to get stro   to get touchy in the presence of large amounts of magic     said ponder .     but my suspicions were first aroused when the bursar developed planets .      there were two of them  orbiting his head at a height of a few inches .  as was so often the case with magical phenomena  they possessed virtual unreality and passed unscathed through him and one another .  they were slightly transparent .      oh dear  mugroop   s syndrome     said ridcully .     cerebral manifestation .  better than a canary down a coalmine  a sign like that .      a little sub routine in ponder   s head began a short countdown .      remember old    dicky    bird .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     he           three .  no  i don   t  as a matter of fact .  do tell .     ponder heard himself bark  louder than he would have done even if he had meant to vocalize his thoughts .      indeed i shall  mister stibbons     said the chair calmly .     he was very susceptible to high magical fields  and if his mind wandered  as it might do when he was dozing off  sometimes around his head there   d be  hehehe  there   d be these little           yes  certainly     said ponder  quickly .     we   ll have to be very careful to keep an eye open for unusual behavior .         among wizards .     said ridcully .     mister stibbons  unusual behavior is perfectly ordinary for wizards .         people acting out of character  then .     ponder shouted .     talking sense for two minutes together  perhaps .  acting like normal civilized people instead of a herd of self regarding village idiots .         stibbons  it   s not like you to take that tone     said ridcully .      that   s what i mean .         now then  mustrum  go easy on him  we   re all under a lot of stress     said the dean .      now he   s doing it .     ponder yelled  pointing a shaking finger .     the dean is normally never nice .  now he   s being aggressively reasonable .      historians have pointed out that it is in times of plenty that people feel like going to war .  in times of famine they   re simply trying to find enough to eat .  when they   ve just enough to go round they tend to be polite .  but when a banquet is spread before them  it   s time to argue over the place settings .    and unseen university  as even wizards realized at somewhere just below the top level of their minds  existed not to further magic but  in a very creative way  to suppress it .  the world had seen what happened when wizards got their hands on enormous amounts of magical power .  it had happened a long time ago and there were still some areas where you didn   t go  if you wanted to walk out on the same kind of feet that you   d had when you went in .   once upon a time the plural of    wizard    was    war .      but the great  open ingenious purpose of uu was to be the weight on the arm of magic  causing it to swing with grave majesty like a pendulum rather than spin with deadly purpose like a morningstar .  instead of hurling fireballs at one another from fortified towers the wizards learned to snipe at their colleagues over the interpretation of faculty council minutes  and long ago were amazed to find that they got just as much vicious fun out of it .  they consumed big dinners  and after a really good meal and a fine cigar even the most rabid dark lord is inclined to put his feet up and feel amicable towards the world  especially if it   s offering him another brandy .  and slowly  and by degrees  they absorbed the most important magical power of all  which is the one that persuades you to stop using all the others .   the trouble is that it   s easy to abstain from sweets when you   re not standing knee deep in treacle and it   s raining sugar .      there does indeed seem to be a certain   tang in the air     said the lecturer in recent runes .  magic tastes like tin .      hold on a moment     said ridcully .  he reached up  pulled open one of the many drawers in his wizarding hat  and removed a cube of greenish glass .      here we are     he said  handing it to ponder .   ponder took the thaumometer and peered into it .      never used it myself     ridcully said .     wetting a finger and holding it up has always been good enough for me .         it   s not working .     said ponder  tapping the thaumometer as the ship rocked under them .     the needle   s   oow .      he dropped the cube  which was molten by the time it hit the deck .      that   s impossible .     he said .     these things are good up to a million thaums .      ridcully licked his finger and held it up .  it sprouted a halo of purple and octarine .      yep  that   s about right     he said .      there   s not that much magic anywhere any more .     shouted ponder .   there was a gale behind the boat now .  ahead  the wall of storm was widening and seemed to be a lot blacker .      how much magic does it take to create a continent .     said ridcully .   they looked up at the clouds .  and further up .      we   d better batten down the hatches     said the dean .      we don   t have any hatches .         batten down mrs .  whitlow at least .  get the bursar and the librarian somewhere safe        they hit the storm .      rincewind dropped into an alley and reflected that he   d been in far worse prisons .  the ecksians were a friendly lot  when not drunk or trying to kill you or both .  what rincewind looked for in a good gaol were guards who  instead of ruining everyone   s night by prowling around the corridors  got together in one room with a few tins and a pack of cards and relaxed .  it made it so much more   friendly .  and  of course  easier to walk past .   he turned   and there was the kangaroo  huge and bright and outlined against the sky .  rincewind shrank back for a moment and then realized that it was nothing but an advertising sign on the roof of a building some way off and further down the hill .  someone had rigged up lamps and mirrors below it .   it had a hat on  with some stupid holes for its ears to stick out  and it wore a vest as well  but it was certainly the kangaroo .  no other kangaroo could possibly smirk like that .  and it was holding a tin of beer .      where did you drift in from  curly .     said a voice behind him .   it was a very familiar voice .  it had a sort of complaining wheedle in it .  it was a voice that kept looking out of the corners of its eyes and was always ready to dodge .  it was a voice you could have used to open a bottle of whine .   he turned .  and the figure in front of him  except for a few details  was as familiar as the voice .      you can   t be called dibbler     said rincewind .      why not .         because   well  how did you get here .         what .  i just came up berk street     said the figure .  it had a large hat  and large shorts  and large boots  but in every other respect it was the double of the man who  in ankh morpork  was always there after the pubs shut to sell you one of his very special meat pies .  rincewind had a theory that there was a dibbler everywhere .   suspended from the neck of this one was a tray .  on the front of the tray was written    dibbler   s caf   de feet .         i reckoned i   d better get up to the gaol early for a good pitch     said dibbler .     always gives the crowd an appetite  a good hanging .  can i interest you in anything  mate .      rincewind looked at the end of the alley .  the streets were quite busy .  as he watched  a couple of guards strolled by .      such as what .     he said suspiciously  drawing back into the shadows .      got some good broadsheet ballads about the notorious outlaw they   re gonna top    .         no  thank you .         souvenir piece of the rope they   re gonna hang him with .  authentic .      rincewind looked at the short length of thick string being dangled hopefully in front of him .     some people might say that had a hint of clothesline about it     he said .   dibbler gave the string a look of extreme interest .     obviously we had to unravel it a bit  mate     he said .      and some people might pick holes in the suggestion that you could  philosophically speaking  sell lengths of the rope before the hanging .      dibbler paused  his smile not moving .  then he said     it   s the rope  right .  three quarter inch hemp  the usual stuff .  authentic .  probably even from the same ropemaker .  come on  all i   m looking for here is a fair go .  probably it   s a pure fluke this ain   t the actual bit that   s gonna go round his neck           that   s only half an inch thick .  look  i can see the label  it says hill   s clothesline co .            does it .      once again dibbler appeared to be looking at his product for the first time .  but the traditions of the dibbler clan would never let a mere disastrous fact get in the way of a spiel .      it   s still rope     he averred .     authentic rope .  no .  no worries .  how about some authentic native art .      he rummaged in his crowded tray and held up a square of cardboard .  rincewind gave it an appraising look .   he   d seen something like this out in the red country  although he   d not been certain that it was art in the way ankh morpork understood it .  it was more like a map  a history book and a menu all rolled together .  back home  people tied a knot in their handkerchief to remind them of things .  out in the hot country there weren   t any handkerchiefs  so people tied a knot in their thoughts .   they didn   t paint very many pictures of a string of sausages .         s called sausage and chips dreaming     said dibbler .      i don   t think i   ve seen one like that     said rincewind .     not with the sauce bottle in it as well .         so what .     said dibbler .     still native .  genuine picture of traditional city tucker  done by a native .  a fair go  that   s all i ask .         ah  suddenly i think i understand .  the native in this case  perhaps  being you .     said rincewind .      yep .  authentic .  you arguing .         oh  come on .         what .  i was born over there in treacle street  bludgeree  and so was my dad .  and my granddad .  and his dad .  i didn   t just step off the driftwood like some people i might mention .     his ratty little face darkened .     coming over here  taking our jobs   what about the little man  eh .  all i   m askin    for is a fair go .      for a moment rincewind contemplated handing himself over to the watch .      nice to hear someone siding with the rights of the indigenous population     he muttered  checking the street again .      indigenous .  what do they know about a day   s work .  nah  they can go back where they came from too     said dibbler .     they don   t want to work .         good thing for you  though  i can see that     said rincewind .     otherwise they   d be taking your job  right .         the way i see it  i   m more indigenous than them     said fair go  pointing an indignant thumb at himself .     i earned my indigenuity  i did .      rincewind sighed .  logic could take you only so far  then you had to get out and hop .     a fair go  that   s what you want     he said .     am i right .         yep .         so   is there anyone who you don   t want to go back where they came from .      fair go dibbler gave this some deep consideration .     well  me  obviously     he said .     and my mate duncan     cos duncan   s me mate .  and mrs .  dibbler  of course .  and some of the blokes down at the fish and chip shop .  lots of people  really .         well  i   ll tell you what     said rincewind .     i definitely want to go back where i came from .         good on yer .         your socio political analysis is certainly working on me .         beaut .         and maybe you can show me how .  like  where the docks are .         well  i would     said dibbler  obviously torn .     only there   s going to be this hanging in a few hours and i want to get the meat pies warmed up .         as a matter of fact  i heard the hanging had been canceled     said rincewind  conspiratorially .     the bloke escaped .         never .         he certainly did .     said rincewind .     i   m not pulling your raw prawn .         did he have any last words .            goodbye     i think .         you mean he wasn   t in a famous last stand shoot out with the watch .         apparently not .         what kind of escape is that .     said fair go .     that   s no way to behave .  i didn   t have to come up here  i gave up a good spot at the galah for this     s not a good hanging without a meat pie .     he leaned closer and gave a furtive look both ways before continuing     say what you like  the galah   s good for business .  their money   s the same as anyone else   s  that   s what i say .         well   yes .  obviously .  otherwise it   d be   different money     said rincewind .     so  since your night   s ruined  why not just show me where the docks are .      there was still some uncertainty in dibbler   s stance .  rincewind swallowed .  he   d faced spiders  angry men with spears and bears that dropped on you out of trees  but now the continent was presenting him with its most dangerous challenge .      tell you what     he said     i   ll   i   ll even   buy   something off you .         the rope .         not the rope .  not the rope .  um   i know this may seem a somewhat esoteric question  but what   s in the meat pies .         meat .         and what kind of meat .         ah  you want one of the gourmet meat pies  then .         oh  i see .  that   s where you say what   s in them .         yup .         before or after the customers have bitten into them .         are you suggesting that my pies ain   t right .         let us say i   m inching my way to the possibility that they might be  shall we .  all right  i   ll try a gourmet pie .         good on yer .     dibbler removed a pie from the little heated section of his tray .      now   what   s the meat .  cat .         do you mind .  mutton   s cheaper   n cat     said dibbler  upending the pie into a dish .      well  that   s       rincewind   s face screwed up .     oh  no  you   re pouring pea soup all over it too .  why does everyone always pour pea soup over it .         no worries  mate .  puts a lining on your stomach     said dibbler  producing a red bottle .      and what   s that .         the cut de grass  mate .         you   re tipping a meat pie into a dish of pea soup and now you want me to eat it with   with tomato sauce on it .         pretty colors  ain   t they .     said fair go  handing rincewind a spoon .   rincewind prodded the pie .  it rebounded gently off the side of the dish .   well  now   he   d eaten cut me own throat dibbler   s sausages in a bun  and disembowel meself honourably dibhala   s funny colored antique eggs .  and he   d survived  although there had been a few minutes when he   d hoped he wouldn   t .  he   d eaten al jiblah   s highly suspicious couscous  drunk the terrible yak butter tea made by may i never achieve enlightenment dhiblang  forced down the topless  bottomless smorgasbord of dib diblossonson and tried not to chew the lumps of unmentionable blubber purveyed by may i be kicked in my own ice hole dibooki  his stomach heaved at the memory of that   after all  it was one thing to butcher dead beached whales and quite another just to leave them there until they exploded into bite sized chunks of their own accord  .  as for the green beer made by swallow me own blowdart dlang dlang     he   d drunk and eaten all these things .  everywhere in the world  someone turned up out of some strange primal mold to sell him a really dreadful regional delicacy .  and this was just a pie  after all .  how bad could it be .  no  put it another way   how much worse could it be .   he swallowed a mouthful .      good  eh .     said fair go .      my gods     said rincewind .      they   re not just any mushy peas     said fair go  slightly disconcerted by the fact that rincewind was staring wildly at nothing .     they   re mushed by a champion pea musher .         good grief       said rincewind .      are you all right  mister .         it   s   everything i expected       said rincewind .      now  mister  it ain   t that bad           you   re certainly a dibbler .         what kind of thing is that to say .         you put pies upside down in runny peas and then put sauce on them .  someone actually sat down one day  after midnight if i   m any judge  and thought that would be a good idea .  no one will ever believe this one .     rincewind looked at the submerged pie .     that   s going to make the story about the land of the giant walking plum puddings look very tame  i don   t mind telling you .  no wonder you people drink so much beer         he stepped out into the flickering lamplight of the street  shaking his head .      you actually eat the pies here     he said mournfully  and looked up into the face of the warder .  there were several watchmen behind him .      that   s him .      rincewind nodded cheerfully .     g   day .     he said .   two little thuds were his homemade sandals bouncing on the street .       the sea steamed and crackling balls of lightning zipped across its surface like drops of water on a hotplate .   the waves were too big to be waves  but about the right size for mountains .  ponder looked up from the deck only once  just as the boat began to slide down a trough that gaped like a canyon .   next to him  and gripping his leg  the dean groaned .      you know about this sort of thing  ponder     he growled  as they hit the trough and then began the stomach twisting climb to the next crest .     are we going to die .         i   don   t think so  dean           pity           rincewind heard whistles blowing behind him by the time he reached the corner  but he never let that sort of thing worry him .   this was a city .  cities were so much easier .  he was a creature of cities .  there were so many places to     whistles started blowing up ahead as well .   the crowds were thicker here  and most people were heading in the same direction .  but rincewind liked crowds to run through .  as the pursued  he had novelty on his side and could shoulder his way past the unsuspecting  who then turned around and milled about and complained and were definitely not in the right frame of mind to greet the people following him .  rincewind could run through a crowd like a ball on a bagatelle board  and always got an extra go .   downhill was best .  that   s where they generally put docks  so as to have them close to the water .   dodging and ducking across the streets brought him  suddenly  to the waterside .  there were a few boats there .  they were on the small side for a stowaway  but     there were running footsteps in the dark .   these watchmen were too good .   this wasn   t how it was supposed to go .   they weren   t supposed to double back .  they weren   t supposed to think .   he ran in the only direction left  along the waterfront .   there was a building there .  at least  it   well  it had to be a building .  no one could have left an open box of tissues that big .   rincewind felt that a building should be a box with a pointed lid on it  basically  and it should be the approximate color of whatever the local mud was .  on the other hand  as the philosopher ly tin wheedle once remarked  it is never wise to object to the decor of a hidey hole .   he bounded up the steps and circled around the strange white building .  it seemed to be some kind of music hall .  opera  by the sound of it  although it was a damn funny place to sing opera  you couldn   t imagine ladies with horns in a building that looked about to set sail  but no time to wonder about that  there was a door with some rubbish bins outside it and here was the door open        you from the agency  mate .      rincewind peered into the steam .      an    i hope you can do puddings     cos cheffy   s banging his head on the wall     went on a figure emerging from the wisps .  it was wearing a tall white hat .      no worries     said rincewind  hopefully .     ah  this is a kitchen  is it .         you pullin    my leg .         only i thought it was some kind of opera house or something           best bloody opera house in the world  mate .  come on  this way        it wasn   t a very big kitchen and  like most of the ones rincewind had been in  it was full of men working very hard at cross purposes .      the boss upstairs only decided to throw a big dinner for the prima donna     said the cook  forcing his way through the throng .     and all of a sudden charley sees the pudding staring him in the face .         ah  right     said rincewind  on the basis that sooner or later he   d be given a clue .      boss says  you can do the pudding for her  charley .         just like that  eh .         he sez  it ought to be the best one yet  charley .         no worries .         he sez  the great nunco invented the strawberry sackville for dame wendy sackville  and the famous chef imposo created the apple glazier for dame margyreen glazier  and your own father  charley  honored dame janeen ormulu with the orange ormulu and tonight  charley  it   s your big chance .     the cook shook his head as he reached a table where a small man in a white uniform was sobbing uncontrollably into his hands .  there was a stack of empty beer cans in front of him .     poor bastard   s been on the beer ever since  and we thought we   d better get someone in .  i   m a steak and prawns man  myself .         so  you want me to make a pudding .  named after an opera singer .     said rincewind .     that   s the tradition  is it .         yeah  and you   d better not let charley down  mate .  it   s not his fault .         oh  well       rincewind thought about puddings .  basically it was just fruit and cream and custard  wasn   t it .  and cakes and stuff .  he couldn   t see where the problem lay .      no worries     he said .     i think i can knock up something right away .      the kitchen became silent as the scurrying cooks stopped to watch him .      first     said rincewind     what fruit have we got .         peaches was all we could find at this time of night .         no worries .  and we   ve got some cream .         yep .  of course .         fine  fine .  then all i need to know is the name of the lady in question        he felt the silence open up .      she   s a beaut singer  mind you     said a cook  in a defensive tone of voice .      good .  and her name .     said rincewind .      er   that   s the trouble  see     said another cook .      why .         ponder opened his eyes .  the water was calm  or at least calmer than it had been .  there were even patches of blue sky above  although cloud banks were crisscrossing the air as if each were in possession of its own bag of wind .   his mouth tasted as though he   d been sucking a tin spoon .   around him  some of the wizards managed to push themselves to their knees .  the dean frowned  removed his hat  and pulled out a small crab .         s a good boat     he murmured .   the green mast stem still stood  although the leaf sail looked ragged .  nevertheless  the boat was tacking nicely against the wind off        the continent .  it was a red wall  glowing under the thunder light .   ridcully got uncertainly to his feet and pointed to it .     not far now .     he said .   the dean actually growled .     i   ve just about had enough of that insufferable cheerfulness     he said .     so just shut up  will you .         enough of that .  i am your archchancellor  dean     said ridcully .      well  let   s just talk about that  shall we .     said the dean  and ponder saw the nasty gleam in his eye .      this is hardly the time  dean .         exactly on what basis are you giving orders  ridcully .  you   re the archchancellor of what  precisely .  unseen university doesn   t even exist .  tell him  senior wrangler .         i don   t have to if i don   t want to     sniffed the senior wrangler .      what .  what .     snapped the dean .      i don   t believe i have to take orders from you  dean .      when the bursar climbed up on deck a minute later the boat was already rocking .  it was hard to say how many factions there were  since a wizard is capable of being a faction all by himself  but there were broadly two sides  both liaisons being as stable as an egg on a seesaw .   what amazed ponder stibbons  when he thought about it later  was that no one had yet resorted to using magic .  the wizards had spent a lot of time in an atmosphere where a cutting remark did more damage than a magic sword and  for sheer malign pleasure  a well structured memo could do more real damage than a fireball every time .  besides  no one had their staff  and no one had any spells handy  and in those circumstances it   s easier to hit someone  although in the case of wizards non magical fighting usually means flailing ineffectually at the opponent while trying to keep out of his way .   the bursar   s fixed smile faded a little .      i got three percent more than you in my finals .         oh  and how do you know that  dean .         i looked up the paper when you were appointed archchancellor .         what .  after forty years .         an examination is an examination .         er       the bursar began .      ye gods  that   s petty .  that   s just the sort of thing i   d expect from a student who even had a separate pen for red ink .         hah .  at least i didn   t spend all my time drinking and betting and staying out at all hours .         hah .  i bloody well did  yes  and i learned the ways of the world and i still got nearly as many marks as you in spite of a prize winning hangover  you puffed up barrel of lard .         oh .  oh .  it   s personal remarks now  is it .         absolutely  two chairs .  let   s have some personal remarks .  we always said that walking behind you made people seasick .         i wonder if at this point       said the bursar .   the air crackled around the wizards .  a wizard in a foul temper attracts magic like overripe fruit gets flies .      you think i   d make a better archchancellor  don   t you  bursar .     said the dean .   the bursar blinked his watery eyes .     i  er  the two of you   er   many good points   er   perhaps this is the time to  er  make a common cause        they spent just a moment considering this .      well said     said the dean .      got a point     said ridcully .      because  you know  i   ve never liked the lecturer in recent runes very much           smirks all the time     ridcully agreed .     not a member of the team .         oh  really .     the lecturer in recent runes put on a particularly evil smirk .     at least i got higher marks than you and am noticeably thinner than the dean .  although a great many things are .  tell them  stibbons .         that   s mister stibbons  fatman .     ponder heard the voice .  he knew it was his .  he felt as though he was hypnotized .  he could stop any time he liked  it was just that he didn   t quite feel like it .      could i just  er  say       the bursar tried .      shut up  bursar .     roared ridcully .      sorry  sorry .  sorry        ridcully waved a finger at the dean .     now you listen to me        a crimson spark leapt off his hand  left a trail of smoke past the dean   s ear  and hit the mast  which exploded .   the dean took a deep breath  and when the dean took a deep breath appreciably less air was left in the atmosphere .  it was let out with a roar .      you dare fire magic at me .      ridcully was staring at his hand .     but i   i        ponder finally managed to force the words out between teeth that were trying to clamp together .      er agic   s egecting ug .         what .  what are you gurgling about  man .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i   ll show you magic  you pompous clown .     screamed the dean  raising both hands .      it   s the magic talking .     ponder managed  grabbing one arm .     you don   t want to blow the archchancellor to little pieces  dean .         yes  i damn well do .         excuse me  ai don   t wish to intrude       mrs .  whitlow   s head appeared at the hatchway .      what is it  mrs .  whitlow .     yelled ponder  as a blast from the dean   s hand sizzled over his head .      ai know you are engaged on university business  but should there be all these cracks .  the water is coming in .      ponder looked down .  the deck creaked under his feet .      we   re sinking       he said .     you stupid old       he bit down on the words .     the boat is cracking up as fast as we are .  look  it   s going yellow .      the green was leaching from the deck like sunlight from a stormy sky .      it   s his fault .     the dean screamed .   ponder raced to the side .  there were crackling noises all around him .   the important thing was to settle his mind and be calm and  possibly  think of nice things like blue skies and kittens .  preferably ones which weren   t about to drown .      listen     he said     if we don   t sink our differences they   ll sink us  understand .  the boat   s   ripening or something .  and we   re a long way from land  do you understand .  and there could be sharks down there .      he looked down .  he looked up .      there   s sharks down there .     he shouted .   the boat tilted as the wizards joined him .      are they sharks  do you think .     said ridcully .      could be tuna     said the dean .  behind them the remains of the sail fell away .      how can you reliably tell the difference .     said the senior wrangler .      you could count their teeth on the way down     sighed ponder .  but at least no one was throwing magic around any more .  you could take the wizards out of unseen university  but you couldn   t take the university out of the wizards .   the boat listed still further as mrs .  whitlow looked over the side .      what happens if we fall in the water .     she said .      we must devise a plan     said ridcully .     dean  form a working party to consider our survival in unknown  shark infested waters  will you .         should we swim for the shore .     said mrs .  whitlow .     ai was good at swimming as a gel .      ridcully gave her a warm smile .     all in good time  mrs .  whitlow     he said .     but your suggestion has been taken aboard .         it   s going to be the only thing that is  in a minute     said ponder .      and what exactly will your role be  archchancellor .     the dean snarled .      i have defined your objectives     said ridcully .     it is up to you to consider the options .         in that case     said the dean     i move that we abandon ship .         what for .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     the sharks .         that is a secondary problem     said the dean .      that   s right     said ponder     we can always vote to abandon shark .      the ship lurched suddenly .  the senior wrangler struck a heroic pose .      i will save you  mrs .  whitlow .     he cried  and swept her off her feet .  or  at least  made the effort .  but the senior wrangler was lightly built for a wizard and mrs .  whitlow was a fine figure of a woman and  furthermore  the wizard   s grip was limited by the fact that there were very few areas of mrs .  whitlow that he dared actually touch .  he did his best with some outlying regions and managed to lift her slightly .  all this did was transfer the entire weight of wizard and housekeeper to the senior wrangler   s quite small feet  which went through the deck like a steel bar .   the boat  dry as tinder now  soft as wood punk  fell apart very gently .   the water was extremely cold .  spray filled the air as they struggled .  a piece of wreckage hit ponder on the head and pushed him under  into a blue world where his ears went gloing gloing .   when he struggled to the surface again this noise turned out to be an argument .  once again  the sheer magic of unseen university triumphed .  when treading water in a circle of sharks  a wizard will always consider other wizards to be the most immediate danger .      don   t blame me .  he was   well  i think he was asleep .         you think .         he was a mattress .  a red one .         he   s the only librarian we   ve got .  how could you be so thoughtless .     shouted ridcully .  he took a deep breath  and dived .      abandon sea .     shouted the bursar cheerfully .   ponder shuddered as something big and black and streamlined rose out of the water in front of him .  it sank back into the foam and flopped over .   other shapes were bobbing to the surface all around the frantically treading wizards .  the dean tapped one .      well  these sharks don   t seem anything like as dangerous as i expected     he said .      they   re the seeds out of the boat .     said ponder .     get on top of them  quickly .      he was sure that something had brushed his leg .  in those circumstances  a man finds unexpected agility .  even the dean managed to get aboard a board  after a revolving  foamy period when man and seed fought for supremacy .   ridcully surfaced in a shower of spray .     it   s no good .     he spluttered .     i went down as far as i could .  there   s no sign of him .         try and get on a seed  archchancellor  do     said the senior wrangler .   ridcully flailed at a passing shark .     they won   t attack you if you make a lot of noise and splash around     he said .      i thought that   s when they will attack you  sir     ponder called out .      ah  an interesting practical experiment     said the dean  craning to watch .   ridcully hauled himself on to one of the seeds .     what a mess .  i suppose we can float to land  though     he said .     er   where   s mrs .  whitlow  gentlemen .      they looked around .      oh  no       the senior wrangler moaned .     she   s swimming for the shore        they followed his gaze  and could just see a hairdo moving jerkily yet determinedly towards the shore in what ridcully would probably have referred to as a chest stroke .      i don   t call that very practical     said the dean .      what about the sharks .         well  they   re swimming around under us  in fact     said the senior wrangler  as the seeds rocked .   ponder looked down .     they appear to be leaving now that we   re not dangling our legs in the water     he said .     they   re heading   for the shore  too .         well  she knew the risks when she got the job     said the dean .      what .     said the senior wrangler .     are you saying that before you apply for the job of housekeeper of a university you should seriously consider being eaten by sharks on the shores of some mysterious continent thousands of years before you are born .         she didn   t ask many questions at the interview  i know that .         actually  we are worrying unduly     said the chair of indefinite studies .     sharks have a very undeserved reputation as man eaters .  there is not a single authenticated case of a shark attacking anyone  despite what you may have heard .  they are sophisticated and peaceful creatures with a rich family life and  far from being ominous harbingers of doom  have reputedly even befriended the occasional lost traveler .  as hunters they are of course very efficient  and a full grown shark can bring down even a moose with   er        he looked at their faces .      er   i think i might perhaps have got them confused with wolves     he mumbled .     i have  haven   t i .      they nodded  in unison .      er   sharks are the other ones  aren   t they .     he went on .     the vicious and merciless killers of the sea that don   t even stop to chew .      they nodded again .      oh dear .  where can i put my face    .         some distance from a shark     said ridcully briskly .     come on  gentlemen .  that   s our housekeeper .  do you wish to make your own beds in future .  fireballs again  i think .         she   s gone too far away        a red shape rocketed out of the sea beside ridcully  curled through the air and slid below the surface again like a razorblade cutting into silk .      what was that .  who of you did that .     he said .   a bow wave ripped its way to the cluster of triangular fins like a bowling ball heading down an alley .  then the water erupted .      ye gods  look at the way it   s going at those sharks .         is it a monster .         it   s a dolphin  surely           with red hair .         surely it   s not        a stricken shark barreled past the senior wrangler .  behind it the water exploded again into the big red grin of the only dolphin ever to have a leathery face and orange hair all over its body .      eek .     said the librarian .      well done  old chap .     shouted ridcully across the water .     i said you wouldn   t let us down .         no  actually you didn   t  sir  you said you thought       ponder began .      good choice of shape  too     ridcully continued loudly .     now  if you can sort of nudge us all together  then perhaps you could push us towards the shore .  are we all still here .  where   s the bursar .      the bursar was a small dot away on the right  paddling dreamily along .      well  he   ll get there     said ridcully .     come on  let   s get on to dry land .         that sea     said the senior wrangler nervously  staring ahead as the seeds were jockeyed towards the shore like a string of overloaded barges     that sea   does it look as though it   s girting to you .         certainly a very big sea     said the lecturer in recent runes .     you know  i don   t think it   s just the rain that   s making the roaring .  there may be a spot of surf .         a few waves won   t do us any harm     said ridcully .     at least water is soft .      ponder felt the board underneath him rise and fall as a long swell passed .  an odd shape for a seed  he had to admit .  of course  nature paid a lot of attention to seeds  equipping them with little wings and sails and flotation chambers and other devices necessary to give them an edge over all the other seeds .  these were just flattish versions of the librarian   s current shape  which was obviously intended for moving through water very fast .      er       he said  to the universe in general .  it meant  i wonder if we   ve really thought about this .      can   t see any rocks ahead     the dean observed .      girting     mused the senior wrangler  as if the word was nagging at him .     that   s a very definite sort of word  isn   t it .  has a certain martial sort of sound .      it occurred to ponder that water is not exactly soft .  he   d never been much of a one for sports when he was a boy  but he remembered playing with the other local lads and joining in all their games  such as push poncy stibbons into the nettles or tie up stibbo and go home for tea  and there had been the time at the old swimming hole when they   d thrown him in off the top of the cliff .  and it had hurt .   the flotilla gradually caught up with mrs .  whitlow  who was holding on to a floating tree and treading water .  the tree already had its fair share of occupants   birds  lizards and  for some reason  a small camel trying to make itself comfortable in the branches .   the swell was heavier now .  there was a deep  continuous booming underlying the noise of the rain .      ah  mrs .  whitlow     said the senior wrangler .     and what a nice tree .  even got leaves on  look .         we   ve come to save you     said the dean  in the face of the evidence .      i think it might be a good idea if mrs .  whitlow hung on to a seed     said ponder .     i really think that really might be a really good idea .  i think the waves might be   slightly big           girting     said the senior wrangler  morosely .   he looked towards the beach  and it wasn   t ahead of them any more .   it was down there .  it was at the bottom of a green hill .  and the green was made of water .  and  for some reason  it was getting taller .         look     said rincewind .     why can   t you tell me her name .  presumably lots of people know it .  i mean  it must be put on the posters and so on .  it   s only a name  isn   t it .  i don   t see the problem .      the cooks looked at one another .  then one coughed and said     she   s   her name   s   dame nellie   butt .         but what .         her name is butt .      rincewind   s lips moved silently .     oh     he said .   the cooks nodded .      has charley drunk all the beer  do you think .     rincewind said  sitting down .      maybe we can find some bananas  ron     said another cook .   rincewind   s eyes unfocused and his lips moved again .     did you tell charley that .     he said at last .      yep .  just before he broke down .      there was the sound of running feet outside .  one of the cooks looked out of the window .      it   s just the watch .  probably after some poor bastard        rincewind moved back slightly so that he was not obvious from the window .   ron shuffled his feet .     i reckon if we went and saw idle ahmed and got him to open up his shop we might get some           strawberries .     said rincewind .  the cooks shuddered .  there was another sob from charley .      all his life he   s been waiting for this     said a cook .     i call it bloody unfair .  remember when that little soprano left to marry that drover .  he was miserable all week .         yeah .  lisa delight     said ron .     a bit wobbly in mid range but definitely showin    promise .         he was really pinning his hopes on her .  he said a name like that   d even work with rhubarb .      charley howled .      i think       said rincewind  slowly and thoughtfully .      yes .         i think i can see a way .         you can .     even charley raised his head .      well  you know how it is  the outsider sees most of the game   let   s go with the peaches  the cream  a bit of ice cream if you can make it  maybe a dash of brandy   let   s see  now           coconut flakes .     said charley  looking up .      yes  why not .         er   some tomato sauce  maybe .         i think not .         you   d better get a move on  they   re halfway through the last act     said ron .      she   ll be right     said rincewind .     okay   halve the peaches  put them in a bowl with the other things  and then add the brandy and voil   .         that some kind of foreign stuff .     said charley .     i don   t think we   ve got any of that wollah .         just add twice as much brandy  then     said rincewind .     and there it is .         yeah  but what   s it called .     said ron .      i   m coming to that     said rincewind .     bowl  please  charley .  thank you .     he held it aloft .     gentlemen   i give you   the peach nellie .      a saucepan bubbled on a stove .  apart from that insistent little noise  and the distant strains of the opera  the room fell silent .      what do you think .     said rincewind brightly .      it   s   different       said charley .     i   ll grant you that .         but it   s not exactly commemorative  is it .     said ron .     the world is full of nellies .         on the other hand  would you prefer it if everyone remembered the alternative .     said rincewind .     do you want to be associated in any way with the peach bu        there was a howl as charley burst into tears again .      put like that  it doesn   t sound too bad     said ron .     peach nellie   yeah .         you could use bananas     said rincewind .   ron   s lips moved silently .     nah     he said .     let   s go with the peaches .      rincewind brushed himself off .     glad to be of service     he said .     tell me .  how many ways are there out of here .         busy night for everyone  what with the galah and everything     said ron .     not my taste  of course  but it does bring in the visitors .         yeah  and the hanging in the morning     said charley .      i was planning to miss that     said rincewind .     now  if you   ll just           i for one hope he escapes     said charley .      i   m with you on that     said rincewind .  heavy boots walked past the door and stopped .  he could hear distant voices .      they say he fought a dozen policemen     said ron .      three     said rincewind .     it was three .  i heard .  someone told me .  not a dozen .  three .         oh  gotta be more than three  gotta be a lot more than three for a bold bush ranger like that one .  rinso  they call him .         i heard where this bloke arrived from dijabringabeeralong and said rinso sheared a hundred sheep in five minutes .         i don   t believe that     said rincewind .      they say he   s a wizard but that can   t be true    cos you never catch one of them doin    a proper job of work .         well  in fact           all right  but a bloke who works up at the gaol says he   d got this strange brown stuff which gives him enormous strength .         it was only beer soup .     shouted rincewind .     i mean     he added     that   s what i heard .      ron gave him a lopsided look .     you look a bit like a wizard     he said .   someone knocked heavily on the door .      you   re wearing those dresses they wear     ron went on  without taking his eyes off rincewind .     go and open the door  sid .      rincewind backed away  reached behind him to a table laden with knives  and found his fingers closing on a handle .   yes  he hated the idea of weapons .  they always  always  upped the ante .  but they did impress people .   the door opened .  several men peered in  and one of them was the gaoler .      that   s him .         i warn you  i   m a desperate man     rincewind said  bringing his hand around .  most of the cooks dived for cover .      that   s a ladle  mate     said a watchman  kindly .     but bloody plucky  all the same .  good on yer .  what do you think  charley .         i reckon it   s never going to be said that a bold larrikin like him was run to earth in a kitchen of mine     said charley .  he picked up a cleaver in one hand and the dish of peach nellie in the other .     you nip out the other door  rinso  and we   ll talk to these policemen .         suits us     said the watchman .        s not a proper last stand  just having a punch up in a kitchen   we   ll give you a count to ten  all right .      once again rincewind felt that he hadn   t been given the same script as everyone else .      you mean you   ve got me cornered and you aren   t going to arrest me .     he said .      we ell  it wouldn   t look good in the ballad  would it .     said the guard .     you   ve got to think about these things .     he leaned on the doorway .     now  there   s the old post office in grurt street .  i reckon a man could hold out for two  maybe three days there  no worries .  then you could run out  we shoot you full of arrows  you utter some famous last words   kids   ll be learnin    about you in school in a hundred years    time  i   ll bet .  and look at yourself  willya .     he stepped forward  ignoring the deadly ladle  and prodded rincewind   s robe .     how many arrows is that going to stop  eh .         you   re all mad .      charley shook his head .     everyone likes a battler  mister .  that   s the ecksian way .  go down fighting  that   s the ticket .         we heard about you takin    on that road gang     said the guard .     bloody good job .  man who   d do a job like that ain   t gonna be hanged  he gonna want to make a famous last stand .      the men had all entered the kitchen now .  the doorway was clear .      has anyone ever had a famous last run .     said rincewind .      no .  what   s one of them .         g   day .      as he sped away along the darkened waterfront he heard the shout behind him .      that   s the ticket .  we   ll count to ten .      he glanced up as he ran and saw that the big sign over the brewery seemed to be dark .  and then he realized that something was hopping along just behind him .      oh  no .  not you .         g   day     said scrappy  drawing level .      look at the mess you   ve got me into .         mess .  you were gonna be hanged .  now you   re enjoying the healthy fresh air in a god   s own country .         and i   m going to be shot full of arrows .         so .  you can dodge arrows .  this place needs a hero .  champion shearer  road warrior  bush ranger  sheep stealer  horse rider   all you need now is to be good at some damn silly bat and ball game that no one   s invented yet and maybe build a few tall buildings with borrowed money and you   d have a full house .  they ain   t gonna kill you in a hurry .         that   s not much comfort .  anyway  i didn   t do any of that stuff   well  i mean i did  but           it   s what people think that matters .  now they believe you waltzed out of a locked cell .         all i did was           doesn   t matter .  the number of gaolers who want to shake you by the hand  well  i reckon they wouldn   t get around to hanging you by lunchtime .         listen  you giant jumping rat  i   ve made it to the docks  okay .  i can outrun them .  i can lie low .  i know how to stow away  throw up  get discovered  be thrown over the side  stay afloat for two days by clinging on to an old barrel and eating plankton sieved through my beard  carefully negotiate the treacherous coral reef surrounding an atoll and survive by eating yams .         that   s a very special talent you got there     said the kangaroo  bounding over a ship   s hawser .     how many ecksian ships have you ever seen in ankh morpork .  busiest port in the world  ain   t it .      rincewind slowed .     well           it   s the currents  mate .  get more   n ten miles off   f the coast here and there ain   t one captain in a hundred who can stop his ship going right over the rim .  they stick very close inshore .      rincewind stopped .     you mean this whole place is a prison .         yep .  but the ecksians say this is the best bloody place in the world  so there   s no point in going anywhere else anyway .      there were shouts behind him .  the guards here didn   t take so long counting to ten as most guards did .      what   re you going to do now .     said rincewind .   the kangaroo had gone .   he ducked down a side street and found his way completely blocked .  carts filled the street from edge to edge .  gaily decorated carts .   rincewind paused .  he had always been the foremost exponent of the from rather than the to of running .  he could have written    the from of running .     but just occasionally a certain subtle sense told him that the to was important .   for one thing  a lot of the people standing and chatting around the carts were wearing leather .   you could make a lot of arguments in favor of leather .  it was long lasting  practical and hard wearing .  people like cohen the barbarian found it so hard wearing and long lasting that their old loincloths had to be removed by a blacksmith .  but the people here didn   t look as if these were the qualities that they   d been looking for in the boutique .  they   d asked questions like  how many studs has it got .  how shiny is it .  has it got holes cut out in unusual places .   but still  one of the most basic rules for survival on any planet is never to upset someone wearing black leather .   rincewind sidled politely past them  giving them a friendly nod and a wave whenever he saw one looking in his direction .  for some reason  this caused more of them to take an interest in him .   there were groups of ladies  too  and there was no doubt that if ecksecksecksecks was where a man could stand tall  so could a woman .  some of them were nevertheless very pretty  in an overstated kind of way  although the occasional moustache looked out of place  but rincewind had been to foreign parts and knew that things could be a bit lush in the more rural regions .   there were more sequins than you usually saw .  more feathers  too .   then it dawned on him in a great rush of relief .      oh  this is a carnival  right .     he said aloud .     this is the galah they keep talking about .         pardon you .     said a lady in a spangly blue dress  who was changing the wheel on a large purple cart .      these are carnival floats  aren   t they .     said rincewind .   the woman gritted her teeth  rammed the new wheel into place and then released the axle .  the cart bounced down on to the cobbles .      damn  i think i broke a nail on that     she said .  she glanced at rincewind .     yeah  this is the carnival .  that dress has seen better days  hasn   t it .  nice moustache  shame about the beard .  it   d look good with a tint .      rincewind glanced back down the street .  the floats and the press of people were hiding him from view  but this wouldn   t last long .      er   could you help me  madam .     he said .     er   the watch are after me .         they can be so tiresome like that .         there was a misunderstanding over a sheep .         there so often is  mate .     she looked rincewind up and down .     you don   t look like a country boy  i must say .         me .  i get nervous when i see a blade of grass  miss .      she stared at him .     you   haven   t been here very long  have you  mister    .         rincewind  ma   am .         well  get on the cart  mister rincewind .  my name   s letitia .     she held out a rather large hand .  he shook it  and then tried surreptitiously to massage some blood back into his fingers as he scrambled up .   the purple cart had been decorated with huge swathes of pink and lavender  and what looked like roses made out of paper .  boxes  also covered in cloth  had been set up in the center to give a sort of raised dais .      what d   you think .     said letitia .     the girls worked all arvo .      the scheme was a bit too feminine for rincewind   s taste  but he   d been brought up to be polite .  he snuggled down  as far out of view as possible .      very nice     he said .     very gay .         glad you think so .      up ahead somewhere a band started to play .  there was a stirring as people got on to the floats or formed up to march .  a couple of women climbed up into the purple cart  all sequins and long gloves  and stared at rincewind .      what the       one began .      darleen   we have to talk     said letitia  from the front of the cart .   rincewind watched them go into a huddle .  occasionally one of them would raise her head and give him an odd look  as if she was reassuring herself that he was here .   fine big girls they had here  though .  he wondered where they got their shoes from .   rincewind was not intensively familiar with women .  quite a lot of his life that hadn   t been spent at high speed had been passed within the walls of unseen university  where women were broadly put in the same category as wallpaper or musical instruments   interesting in their way  and no doubt a small but important part of the proper structure of civilization but not  when you got right down to it  essential .   on those occasions when he had spent some time in the intimate company of a woman  it was generally when she was trying to either cut his head off or persuade him to a course of action that would probably get someone else to do it .  when it came to women he was not  as it were  capable of much fine tuning .  a few neglected instincts were telling him that something was out of place  but he couldn   t work out what it was .   the one addressed as darleen strode down the cart with a decisive and rather aggressive air .  rincewind pulled his hat off respectfully .      are you coming the raw prawn .     she demanded .      me .  certainly not  miss .  no prawns at all .  if i can just lie low until we   re a few streets away  that   s all i ask           you know what this is  don   t you .         yes  miss .  the carnival .     rincewind swallowed .     no worries there .  everyone likes dressing up  don   t they .         but are you tellin    me you really think   i mean we   what are you staring at my hair for .         er   i was wondering how you get it so sparkly .  are you on the stage at all .         we   re moving  girls     letitia called back .     remember   pretty smiles .  leave him alone  darleen  you don   t know where he   s been .      the third woman  the one the others had called neilette  was watching him curiously  and rincewind felt that there was something not right about her .  her hair wasn   t drab  but it certainly appeared to be when compared with that of her colleagues .  she didn   t seem to have enough make up .  she seemed  in short  slightly out of place .   the he caught sight of a watchman ahead  and flung himself below the edge of the cart .  a gap in the boards gave him a view  as the cart turned the corner  of the waiting crowds .   he   d been to quite a number of carnivals  although not usually on purpose .  he   d even attended fat lunchtime in genua  generally regarded as the biggest in the world  although he vaguely recalled that he   d been hanging upside down under one of the floats in order to escape pursuers  but right now he couldn   t quite remember why he   d been chased and it was never wise to stop and ask .  although rincewind had covered quite a lot of the disc in his life  most of his recollections were like that   a blur .  not through forgetfulness  but because of speed .   this looked like the usual audience .  a real carnival procession should only take place after the pubs have been open for a good long time .  it adds to the spontaneity .  there were cheers  whistles  jeers and catcalls .  up ahead  people were blowing horns .  dancers whirled past rincewind   s peephole .   he sat back and pulled a swathe of taffeta over his head .  this sort of thing always took up a lot of watch time  what with pickpockets and so on .  he   d wait until they were in whatever bit of wasteground these things always ended up in  and drop quietly out of sight .   he glanced down .   these ladies were certainly into shoes in a big way .  they had hundreds .   hundreds of shoes  all lined up  peeking out from under a heap of women   s clothing .  rincewind looked away .  there was probably something morally wrong about staring at women   s clothes without women in them .   his head turned back and looked at the shoes again .  he was sure that several of them had moved     a bottle shattered near his head .  glass showered around him .  up above  darleen uttered a word he   d never have expected on the lips of a lady .   rincewind raised his head cautiously and another bottle bounced off his hat .      some hoonies having a bit of fun     said darleen  through gritted teeth .     there   s always some joker   oh really .         give us a kiss  mister .     said a young man who   d leapt on to the edge of the cart  waving a beer can happily .   rincewind had seen some serious fighters in action  but no one had ever swung a punch like darleen .  her eyes narrowed  her fist seemed to travel in a complete circle  it met the man   s chin about halfway round and when he disappeared from the wizard   s view he was still rising .      will you look at that .     darleen demanded  waving her hand at rincewind .     ripped .  these evening gloves cost a fortune  the bastard .     a beer can sailed past her ear .     didja see who threw that .  didja .  i saw yer  yer mazza .  i   ll stick my hand down yer throat and pull yer trousers up .      the crowd roared their appreciation and derision at the same time .  rincewind caught sight of watchmen   s helmets heading purposefully towards them .      er       he said .      hey  that   s him .  that   s rinso the bush ranger .     someone yelled  pointing .      it wasn   t bushes  it was just a sheep .      rincewind wondered who   d said that  and realized it was him .  and there was no escape .  and the watchmen were looking up at him .  and there was really no escape .  the street was packed .  there was another fight further up the procession .  there were no nearby alleyways  the fugitive   s friend .  and the watchmen were fighting their way through the throng  with great difficulty .  and the crowd were having the time of their lives .  and the huge kangaroo beer sign gleamed overhead .   this was it  then .  time for a famous last stand .      what .     he said aloud .     it   s never time for a famous last stand .      he turned to letitia .     i should just like to thank you for trying to help me     he said .     it   s a pleasure to meet some real ladies for once .      they looked at one another .      the pleasure   s all ours     said letitia .     such a change to meet a real gentleman  isn   t it  girls .      darleen kicked a fishnet leg at a man trying to climb on the cart  causing with a stiletto heel what bromide in your tea is reputed to take several weeks to achieve .      too bloody true     she said .   rincewind leapt from the cart  landed on someone   s shoulder  jumped again very briefly on to someone   s head .  it worked .  provided you kept moving  it really worked .  a few hands grabbed at him and one or two cans were thrown  but there were also plenty of cries of    good on yer .     and    that   s the way .      at last there was an alley .  he jumped down from the last obliging shoulder and changed leg gear  and then found that the best way to describe the alley was as a cul de sac .  the worst way was as an alley with three or four watchmen in it  who   d ducked in for a smoke .   they gave him that look of harassed policemen everywhere which said that  as an unwelcome intruder into their brief smoko  he was definitely going to be guilty of something .  and then light dawned in the face of their sergeant .      that   s him .      out in the street people started yelling and screaming .  these were not the beery shouts of the carnival .  people were in real pain out there .  they were also pressing in so tightly that there was no way out .      i can explain everything     said rincewind  half aware of the growing noise .     well   most things .  some things  certainly .  a few things .  look  about this sheep        something brilliant passed over his head and landed on the cobbles between him and the guards .   it looked rather like a table wearing an evening dress  and it had hundreds of little feet .   they were wearing high heels .   rincewind rolled into a ball and put his hands over his head  trying to block his ears until the noise had died away .      at the very edge of the sea  the surf bubbled and sucked at the sand .  as the wavelet drew back it flowed around the splintered bulk of a tree .   the drifting wood   s cargo of crabs and sand fleas waited for their moment and slid off cautiously  scuttling ashore ahead of the next wave .   the rain banged into the beach  running in miniature canyons of crumbling sand on its way to the sea .  the crabs surged across these like a homesteaders    stampede  rushing to mark out territory on the endless  virgin beach .   they followed the salty tideline of weed and shells  scrambling over one another in their search for a space where a crab can proudly stand sideways and start a new life and eat the heady sand of freedom .   a few of them investigated a gray  sodden pointy hat that was tangled in seaweed  and then ran on to a more promising heap of soaked cloth which offered even more interesting holes and crevices .   one of them tried to climb into ponder stibbons    nose  and was snorted out again .   ponder opened an eye .  when he moved his head  the water filling his ears made a ringing noise .   the history of the last few minutes was complicated .  he could remember rushing along a tube of green water  if such a thing were possible  and there had been several periods where the air and the sea and ponder himself had been very closely entwined .  now he felt as though someone had  with great precision  hit every part of his body with a hammer .      get off  will you .      ponder reached up and pulled another crab out of his ear  and realized that he had lost his glasses .  they were probably rolling at the bottom of the sea by now  frightening lobsters .  so here he was  on an alien shore  and he   d be able to see everything really clearly provided everything was meant to be a blur .      am i dead this time .     it was the dean   s voice  from a little further away along the beach .      no  you   re still alive  sir     said ponder .      damn .  are you sure .      there were other groans as bits of tidal debris turned out to be wizards mixed with seaweed .      are we all here .     said ridcully  trying to get to his feet .      i   m sure i   m not     moaned the dean .      i don   t see   mrs .  whitlow     said ridcully .     or the bursar        ponder sat up .      there   s   oh  dear   well  there   s the bursar        out at sea a huge wave was building up .  it towered higher and higher .  and the bursar was on top of it .      bursar .     ridcully screamed .   the distant figure stood up on the seed and waved .      he   s standing up     said ridcully .     is he supposed to stand up on those things .  he   s not supposed to stand up  is he .  i   m sure he shouldn   t be standing up .  you   re not supposed to stand up  bursaaar .  how   that   s not supposed to happen  is it .      the wave curled  but the bursar seemed to be skimming down the side of it  skidding along the huge green wet wall like a man on one ski .   ridcully turned to the other wizards .     he can   t do that  can he .  he   s walking up and down on it .  can he do that .  the wave   s curling over and he   s just sliding gently along the   oh  no        the foaming crest curled over the speeding wizard .      that   s it  then     said ridcully .      er   no       said ponder .   the bursar reappeared further along the beach  expelled from the collapsing tube of water like an arrow from a bow .  the wave crashed over behind him  striking the shore as if it had just offended it .   the seed changed direction  cruised gently over the backwash and crunched to a halt on the sand .   the bursar stepped off .     hooray     he said .     my feet are wet .  what a nice forest .  time for tea .      he picked up the seed and rammed it point first in the sand .  then he wandered away up the beach .      how did he do that .     said ridcully .     i mean  the man   s crazier than a ferret .  damn good bursar  of course .         possibly the lack of mental balance means there   s nothing to impede physical stability .     said ponder wearily .      you think so .         not really  sir .  i just said it for something to say .     ponder tried to massage some life back into his legs  and started to count under his breath .      is there anything to eat here .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      four     said ponder .      i beg your pardon .         what .  oh  it was just some counting i was doing  sir .  no  sir .  there   s probably fish and lobsters in the sea  but the land looks pretty bare to me .      it did .  reddish sand stretched away through the grayish drizzle to bluish mountains .  the only greenishness was the dean   s face and  suddenly  the shoots winding out of the bursar   s surfing seed .  leaves unfolded in the rain  tiny flowers opened with little plopping noises .      well  at least we   ll have another boat     said the senior wrangler .      i doubt it  sir     said ponder .     the god wasn   t very good at breeding things .     and  indeed  the swelling fruit was not looking very boat shaped .      you know  i still think it would help if we thought of all this as a valuable opportunity     said ridcully .      that   s true     said the dean  sitting up .     it   s not many times in your life you get the chance to die of hunger on some bleak continent thousands of years before you   re born .  we should make the most of it .         i meant that pitting ourselves against the elements will bring out the best in us and forge us into a go getting and hard hitting team     said ridcully .  this view got no takers .      i   m sure there must be something to eat     mumbled the chair of indefinite studies  looking around aimlessly .     there usually is .         after all  nothing is beyond men like us     said ridcully .      that   s true     said ponder .     oh gods  yes .  that   s true .         and at least a wizard can always make a decent fire .      ponder   s eyes opened wide .  he rose in one movement aimed at ridcully  but was still airborne when the archchancellor tossed a small fireball at a heap of driftwood .  by the time the glowing ball was halfway to the wood ponder had hit ridcully in the back  so that both of them were sprawled on the wet sand when the world went whooph .   when they looked up the heap of driftwood was a blackened crater .      well  thank you     said the dean  behind them .     i feel lovely and dry now  and i never did like my eyebrows all that much .         high thaumic field  sir     ponder panted .     i did say .      ridcully stared at his hands .     i was going to light my pipe with one       he muttered .  he held the hand away from him .     it was only a number ten     he said .   the dean stood up  brushing away some tufts of burnt beard .      i   m not sure i believe what i just saw     he said  and pointed a finger at a nearby rock .      no  sir  i don   t think you        most of the rock was lifted off the ground and landed a hundred yards away .  the rest of it sizzled in a red hot puddle .      can i have a go .     said the senior wrangler .      sir  i really think           oh  well done  senior wrangler     said the dean  as another rock fractured into fragments .      ye gods  you were right  stibbons     said ridcully .     the magic field here is huge .         yes  sir  but i really don   t think we should be using it  sir .     ponder shrieked .      we   re wizards  young man .  using magic is what wizarding is all about .         no  sir .  not using magic is what wizarding is all about .      ridcully hesitated .      this is fossil magic  sir .     said ponder  speaking fast .     it   s what   s being used to create this place .  we could do untold damage if we   re not careful .         all right  all right  no one do anything for a moment     said ridcully .     now   what are you talking about  mister stibbons .         i don   t think the place is properly  well  finished  sir .  i mean  there   re no plants or animals  are there .         nonsense .  i saw a camel a little while ago .         yes  sir  but that came with us .  and there   s seaweed and crabs on the beach and they got washed up too .  but where are the trees and bushes and grasses .         interesting     said ridcully .     place is as bald as a baby   s bottom .         still under construction  sir .  the god did say it was being built .         unbelievable  really     said ridcully .     a whole continent being created out of nothing .         exactly  sir .         gazillions of thaums of magic pouring into the world .         you   ve got it  sir .         whole mountains and cliffs and beaches where once there was nothing  style of thing .         that   s right  sir .         bit of a miracle  you could say .         i certainly would  sir .         unimaginably vast amounts of magic doing their stuff .         astonishing  sir .         so i expect no one will miss a little bit  eh .         no .  that   s not how it works  sir .  if we use it  it   s like   like treading on ants  sir .  this isn   t like   finding an old staff in a cupboard and using up the magic that   s left .  this is the real primal energy .  anything we do might well have an effect .      the dean tapped him on the shoulder .     then here we are  young stibbons  stuck on this forsaken shore .  what do you suggest .  we   re thousands of years from home .  perhaps we should just sit and wait .  that rincewind fellow   s bound to be along in a few millennia .         er  dean       said the senior wrangler .      yes .         are you standing behind stibbons there  or are you sitting on this rock over here .      the dean looked at himself  sitting on the rock .      oh  blast     he muttered .     temporal discontinuity again .         again .     said ponder .      we had a patch of it in room  b once     said the senior wrangler .     ridiculous .  you had to cough before you went in  in case you were already there .  anyway  you shouldn   t be surprised  young man .  enough magic distorts all physical la        the senior wrangler vanished  leaving only a pile of clothes .      took a while to take hold     said ridcully .     i remember when        his voice suddenly rose in pitch .  ponder spun around and saw a small heap of clothing with a pointed hat on top of it .   he raised the hat gingerly .  a pink face under a mop of curls looked up at him .      bugger .     squeaked ridcully .     how old am i  mister .         er   you look about six  sir     said ponder .  his back twinged .   the small worried face crinkled up .     i want my mum .     the little nose sniffed .     was that me who just said that .         er  yes           you can keep on top of it if you concentrate     the archchancellor squeaked .     it resets the tempor   i wanna sweetie .    it resets the temporal gl   i wanna sweetie  oh  you wait till i get me home  i   ll give me such a smack   it resets the body   s clo   where   s mr .  pootle .    it resets the body   s clock   wanna wanna mr .  pootle .    don   t worry  i think i   ve got the hang of it        the wail behind ponder made him turn around .  there were more piles of clothing where the wizards had been .  he pulled aside the dean   s hat just as a faint bloop suggested that mustrum ridcully had managed to regain full possession of his years again .      that the dean  stibbons .         could be  sir .  er   some of them have gone  sir .      ridcully looked unflustered .     temporal gland acting up in the high field     he said .     probably decided that since it   s thousands of years ago they   re not here .  don   t worry  they   ll come back when it works it out        ponder suddenly felt breathless .     and   hwee   think this one   s the lecturer in recent runes   hwee   of course   hwee   all babies look the   hwee   same .      there was another wail from under the senior wrangler   s hat .      bit of a   hwee   kindergarten here  sir     ponder wheezed .  his back creaked when he tried to stand upright .      oh  they   ll probably come back if they don   t get fed     said ridcully .     it   s you that   ll be the problem  lad .  i mean  sir .      ponder held his hands up in front of him .  he could see the veins through the pale skin .  he could nearly see the bones .   around him the piles of clothing rose again as the wizards clambered back to their proper age .      how   old   hwee   i   ha   look .     he panted .     like someone who shouldn   t   hwee   start reading a long book .         a long sentence     said ridcully cheerfully  holding him up .     how old do you feel .  in yourself .         i   hwee   ought to feel   hwee   about twenty four  sir     ponder groaned .     i actually   hwee   feel like a twenty four year old who has been hit by eighty years traveling at   hwee   high speed .         hold on to that thought .  your temporal gland knows how old you are .      ponder tried to concentrate  but it was hard .  part of him wanted to go to sleep .  part of him wanted to say     hah  you call this a temporal disturbance .  you should   ve seen the temporal disturbances we will have been used to be going to get in my day .     a pressing part of him was threatening that if he didn   t find a toilet it would make its own arrangements .      you   ve kept your hair     said the senior wrangler  encouragingly .   ponder heard himself say     remember old    cruddy    trusset .  now there was a wizard who had   good   hair       he tried to get a grip .     he   s still alive  isn   t he .     he wheezed .     he   s the same age as me .  oh  no   now i   m remembering only yesterday as if it was   hwee   seventy years ago .         you can get over it     said ridcully .     you   ve got to make it clear you   re not accepting it  you see .  the important thing is not to panic .         i am panicking     squeaked ponder .     i   m just doing it very slowly .  why   ve i got this horrible feeling that i   m   hwee   falling forward all the   hwee   time .         oh  that   s just apprehensions of mortality     said ridcully .     everyone gets that .         and   hwee   now i think my memory   s going           what makes you think that .         think what .  speak up  you   hwee   man        something exploded somewhere behind ponder   s eyeballs and lifted him off the ground .  for a moment he felt he had jumped into icy water .   the blood flowed back to his hands .      well done  lad     said ridcully .     your hair   s going brown again  too .         ow       ponder slumped to his knees .     it was like wearing a lead suit .  i never want to go through that again .         suicide   s your best bet  then     said ridcully .      is this going to happen again .         probably .  at least once  anyway .      ponder got to his feet with a steely look in his eyes .     then let   s find whoever   s building this place and ask them to send us home     he growled .      they might not want to listen     said ridcully .     deities can be touchy .      ponder shook his sleeves to leave his hands free .  for a wizard  this was equivalent to checking the functioning of a pump action shotgun .      then we   ll insist     he said .      really  stibbons .  what about protection of the magical ecology .      ponder turned on him a look that would have opened a strong room .  ridcully was in his seventies and spry even for wizards  who tended to live well into their second century if they survived their first fifty years .  ponder wasn   t sure how old he   d been  but he   d definitely thought he could hear a blade being sharpened .  it was one thing to know you were on a journey  and quite  quite another to see your destination on the horizon .      it can get stuffed     he said .       well thought out  mister stibbons .  i can see we   ll make a wizard of you yet .  ah  the dean   s   oh        the dean   s clothes billowed up but did not  as it were  inflate to their old size .  the hat in particular was big enough to rock on the dean   s ears  which were redder and stuck out more than ponder remembered .   ridcully raised the hat .      push off  granddad     said the dean .      ah     said the archchancellor .     thirteen years old  i   d say .  which explains a lot .  well  dean  help us with the others  will you .         why should i .     the adolescent dean cracked his knuckles .     hah .  i   m young again and soon you   ll be dead .  i   ve got my whole life ahead of me .         firstly  you   ll spend it here  and secondly  dean  you think it   s going to be jolly good fun being the dean in a thirteen year old body  don   t you  but within a minute or two you   ll start forgetting it all  you see .  the old temporal gland can   t allow you to remember being fourteen when you   re not even thirteen yet  you follow me .  you   d know this stuff  dean  if you weren   t forgetting .  you   ll have to go through it all over again  dean   ah        the brain has far less control over the body than the body does over the brain .  and adolescence is not a good time .  nor is old age  for that matter  but at least the spots have cleared up  some of the more troublesome glands have settled down and you   re allowed to take a nap in the afternoons and twinkle at young women .  in any case  the dean   s body hadn   t experienced too much old age yet  whereas every junior spot  ache and twinge was firmly embossed on the morphic memory .  once  it decided  was enough .   the dean expanded .  ponder noticed that his head in particular swelled up to fit his ears .   the dean rubbed his spot free face .     five minutes wouldn   t have been bad     he complained .     what was that all about .         temporal uncertainty     said ridcully .     you   ve seen it before  didn   t you realize .  what were you thinking of .         sex .         oh  yes  of course   silly of me  really .     ridcully looked along the deserted beach .     mister stibbons thinks we can       he began .     ye gods .  there are people here .      a young woman was walking towards them .  swaying  anyway .      my word     said the dean .     i suppose this isn   t slakki  by any chance .         i thought they wore grass skirts       said ridcully .     what   s she wearing  stibbons .         a sarong .         looks right enough to me  haha     said the dean .      certainly makes a man wish he was fifty years younger     said the chair of indefinite studies .      five minutes younger would do for me     said the dean .     incidentally  did any of you notice that rather clever inadvertent joke just then .  stibbons said it was    a sarong    and i           what   s that she   s carrying .     said ridcully .         no  listen  you see  i misheard him  in fact  and i           looks like   coconuts       said ponder  shading his eyes .      this is a bit more like it     said the senior wrangler .         because actually i thought he said     it   s wrong     you see           certainly a coconut     said ridcully .     i   m not complaining  of course  but aren   t these sultry maids generally black haired .  red doesn   t seem very typical .            so i said           i suppose you   d get coconuts here .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     they float  don   t they .            and  listen  when stibbons said    sarong     i thought he           something familiar about her     ridcully mused .      did you see that nut in the museum of quite unusual things .     said the senior wrangler .     called the coco de mer and       he permitted himself       ha  very curious shape  you know  you   ll never guess who it used to put me in mind of           it can   t be mrs .  whitlow  can it .     said ponder .      as a matter of fact  i must admit that it           well  i thought it was mildly amusing  anyway     said the dean .      it is mrs .  whitlow     said ridcully .      more of a nut  really  but        it dawned on the senior wrangler that the sky was a different color on his personal planet .  he turned around  looked  said     mwaaa       and fell gently to the sand .      ai don   t quate know what   s happened to mister librarian     said mrs .  whitlow  in a voice that made the senior wrangler twitch even in his swoon .   the coconut opened its eyes .  it looked as if it had just seen something truly horrific  but this is a normal expression for baby orangutans and in any case it was looking at the dean .      eek .     it said .   ridcully coughed .     well  at least he   s the right shape     he said .     and  er  you  mrs .  whitlow .  how do you feel .         mwaa       said the senior wrangler .      very well indeed  thank you     said mrs .  whitlow .     this country agrees with me .  i don   t know whether it was the swim  but ai haven   t felt quate so buoyant in years .  but ai looked around and there was this dear little ape just sitting there .         ponder  would you mind just throwing the senior wrangler in the sea for a moment .     said ridcully .     nowhere too deep .  don   t worry if it steams .     he took mrs .  whitlow   s spare hand .      i don   t want to worry you  dear mrs .  whitlow     he said     but i think something is shortly going to come as a big shock to you .  first of all  and please don   t misunderstand me  it might be a good idea to loosen your clothing .     he swallowed .     slightly .         the bursar had experienced some changes of age as he wandered through the wet but barren land  but to a man capable of being a vase of flowers for an entire afternoon this was barely a mild distraction .   what had caught his eye was a fire .  it was burning bits of driftwood  and the flames were edged with blue from the salt .   close to it was a sack made of some sort of animal skins .   the damp earth beside the bursar stirred and a tree erupted  growing so fast that the rain steamed off the unfolding leaves .  this did not surprise him .  few things did .  besides  he   d never seen a tree growing before  so he did not know how fast it was supposed to go .   then several more trees exploded around him .  one grew so fast that it went all the way from sapling to half rotten trunk in a few seconds .   and it seemed to the bursar that there were other people here .  he couldn   t see them or hear them  but something in his bones sensed them .  however  the bursar was also quite accustomed to the presence of people who couldn   t be seen or heard by anyone else  and had spent many a pleasant hour in conversation with historical figures and  sometimes  the wall .   all in all the bursar was  depending on your outlook  the most or least suitable person to encounter deity on a first hand basis .   an old man walked around a rock and was halfway to the fire before he noticed the wizard .   like rincewind  the bursar had no room in his head for racism .  as a skin color black came as quite a relief compared to some of the colors he   d seen  although he   d never seen anyone quite so black as the man now staring at him .  at least  the bursar assumed he was staring .  the eyes were so deep set that he couldn   t be sure .   the bursar  who had been properly brought up  said     hooray  there   s a rosebush .      the old man gave him a rather puzzled nod .  he walked over to the dead tree and pulled off a branch  which he pushed into the fire .  then he sat down and watched it as though watching wood char was the most engrossing thing in the world .   the bursar sat down on a rock and waited .  if the game was patience  then two could play at it .   the old man kept glancing up at him .  the bursar kept smiling .  once or twice he gave the man a little wave .   finally the burning branch was pulled out of the fire .  the old man picked up the leather sack in his other hand and walked off among the rocks .  the bursar followed him .   there was an overhang here under a small cliff  shielding a stretch of vertical rock from the rain .  it was the kind of tempting surface that would  in ankh morpork  have already been covered so thickly with so many posters  signs and graffiti that if you   d removed the wall the general accretion would still have stood up .   someone had drawn a tree .  it was the simplest drawing of a tree the bursar had ever seen since he   d been old enough to read books that weren   t mainly pictures  but it was also in some strange way the most accurate .  it was simple because something complex had been rolled up small  as if someone had drawn trees  and started with the normal green cloud on a stick  and refined it  and refined it some more  and looked for the little twists in a line that said tree and refined those until there was just one line that said tree .   and now when you looked at it you could hear the wind in the branches .   the old man reached down beside him and took up a flat stone with some white paste on it .  he drew another line on the rock  slightly like a flattened v  and smeared it with mud .   the bursar burst out laughing as the wings emerged from the painting and whirred past him .   and again he was aware of a strange effect in the air .  it reminded him of   yes   old    rubber    houser  that was his name  dead now  of course  but remembered by many of his contemporaries as the inventor of the graphical device .   the bursar had joined the university when likely wizards started their training early  somewhere after the point where they learned to walk but before they started to push over girls in the playground .  the writing of lines in detention class was a familiar punishment and the bursar  like everyone else  toyed with the usual practice of tying several pens to a ruler in a group attempt to write lines in threes .  but houser  a reflective sort of boy  had scrounged some bits of wood and stripped a mattress of its springs and devised the four   sixteen and eventually the thirty two line writing machine .  it had got so popular that boys were actually breaking rules in order to have a go on it  at threepence a time to use it and a penny to help wind it up .  of course  more time was spent setting it up than was ever saved by using it  but this is the case in many similar fields and is a sign of progress .  the experiments tragically came to an end when someone opened a door at the wrong moment and the entire pent up force of houser   s experimental prototype     line machine propelled him backwards out of a fourth floor window .   except for the absence of screams  the hand tracing its infinitely simple lines on the rock brought back memories of houser .  there was a sense of something small being done that was making something happen that was huge .   he sat and watched .  it was  he remembered later whenever he was in a state to remember anything  one of the happiest times of his life .      when rincewind lifted his head a watchman   s helmet was spinning gently on the ground .   to his amazement the men themselves were still there  although they were lying around in various attitudes of unconsciousness or at least  if they had sense  feigned unconsciousness .  the luggage had a cat   s tendency to lose interest in things that didn   t fight back even after you   d kicked them a few times .   shoes littered the ground  too .  the luggage was limping around in a circle .   rincewind sighed  and stood up .     take the shoes off .  they don   t suit you     he said .   the luggage stood still for a moment  and then the rest of the shoes clattered against the wall .      and the dress .  what would those nice ladies think if they saw you dressing up like this .      the luggage shrugged off the few sequined tatters that remained .      turn around  i want to see your handles .  no  i said turn around .  turn around properly  please .  ah  i thought so   i said turn around .  those earrings   they don   t do anything for you at all  you know .     he leaned closer .     is that a stud .  have you had your lid pierced .      the luggage backed away .  its manner indicated very clearly that while it might give in on the shoes  the dress and even the earrings  the battle over the stud would go to the finish .      well   all right .  now give me my clean underwear  you could make shelves out of the stuff i   m wearing .      the luggage opened its lid .      good  now i   is that my underwear .  would i be seen dead in something like that .  yes  as a matter of fact i suspect i would .  my underwear  please .  it   s got my name inside  although i must admit i can   t quite remember why i thought that was necessary .      the lid shut .  the lid opened .      thank you .      it was no use wondering how it was done  or for that matter why the laundry returned freshly ironed .   the watchmen were still very wisely remaining unconscious  but out of habit rincewind went behind a stack of old boxes to change .  he was the sort of person who   d go behind a tree to change if he was on a desert island all alone .      you noticed something odd about this alley .     he said  over the top of the boxes .     there   re no drainpipes .  there   re no gutters .  they   ve never heard of rain here .  i suppose you are the luggage  aren   t you  and not some kangaroo in disguise .  why am i asking .  ye gods  these feel good .  right  let   s go        the luggage opened its lid again  and a young woman looked up at rincewind .      who are    .  oh  you   re the blind man     she said .      i beg your pardon .         sorry   darleen said you must be blind .  well  actually she said you must be bloody blind .  can you give me a hand out .      it dawned on rincewind that the girl clambering out of the luggage was neilette  the third member of letitia   s crew and the one who   d seemed quite plain compared to the others and certainly a lot less   well  noisy wasn   t quite the word .  probably the word was    expansive .     they filled the space around them to capacity .  take darleen  a lady he   d last seen holding a man daintily by the collar so that she could punch him in the face .  when she walked into a room  there   d be no one in it unaware that she had done so .   neilette was just   ordinary .  she brushed some dirt off her dress  and sighed .      i could see there was going to be another fight so i hid in trunkie     she said .      trunkie  eh .     said rincewind .  the luggage had the decency to look embarrassed .      sooner or later there   s always a fight where darleen goes     said neilette .     you   d be amazed the things she can do with a stiletto heel .         i think i   ve seen one of them     said rincewind .     don   t tell me the others .  um  can i help you .  only me and trunkie here      he gave the luggage a kick      were heading off  weren   t we  trunkie .         oh  don   t kick her  she   s been so useful     said neilette .      really .     said rincewind .  the luggage turned around slowly so that he couldn   t see the expression on its lock .      oh  yes .  i reckon the miners in cangoolie would   ve   been very unpleasant to letitia if trunkie hadn   t stepped in .         stepped on  i expect .         how did you know that .         oh  the l   trunkie is mine .  we got separated .      neilette tried to arrange her hair .     it   s all right for the others     she said .     they just have to change wigs .  beer might be a good shampoo  but not when it   s still in the tinnie .     she sighed .     oh  well .  i suppose i   ll have to find a way home  now .         where do you live .         worralorrasurfa .  it   s rimwards .     she sighed again .     back to life in the banana bending factory .  so much for showbusiness .      then she burst into tears and sat down heavily on the luggage .   rincewind didn   t know whether he should go into the    pat  pat  there  there    routine .  if she was like darleen  he might lose an arm .  he made what he hoped was a soothing yet non aggressive mumble .      i mean  i know i can   t sing very well and i can   t dance but  frankly  neither can letitia and darleen .  when darleen sings    prancing queen    you could slice bread with it .  not that they   ve been unkind     she added quickly  polite even in the throes of woe     but really there   s got to be more to life than getting beer thrown at you every night and being chased out of town .      rincewind felt confident enough to venture a    there  there .     he didn   t risk a    pat  pat .         really i only did it because of noelene dropping out     neilette sobbed .     and i   m about the same height and letitia couldn   t find anyone else in time and i needed the money and she said it would be okay provided people didn   t notice my hands were so small           noelene being    .         my brother .  i told him  trying for the surf championship is fine  and ballgowns are fine  but both together .  i don   t think so .  did you know what a nasty rash you can get from being rolled across coral .  and next morning letitia had this tour organized and  well  it seemed a good idea at the time .         noelene       rincewind mused .     that   s an unusual name for a           darleen said you wouldn   t understand .     neilette stared into the middle distance .     i think my brother worked in the factory too long     she mused .     he always was very impressionable .  anyway  i           oh  i get it  he   s a female impersonator    said rincewind .     oh  i know about those .  old pantomime tradition .  a couple of balloons  straw wig and a few grubby jokes .  why  when i was a student  at hogswatch parties old farter carter and really pants would put on a turn where        he was aware that she was giving him one of those long  slow looks .      tell me     she said .     do you get about much .         you   d be amazed     said rincewind .      and you meet all kinds of people .         generally the nastier kind  i have to admit .         well  some men       neilette stopped .     really pants .  that was someone   s name .         not exactly .  he was called ronald pants  so of course when anyone heard that they said           oh  is that all .     said neilette .  she stood up and blew her nose .     i told the others i   d leave when we got to the galah  so they   ll understand .  being a   female impersonator is no job for a woman  which is what i am  incidentally .  i   d hoped it was obvious  but in your case i thought i   d better mention it .  can you get us out of here  trunkie .      the luggage wandered over to the wall at the end of the alley and kicked it until there was a decent sized hole .  on the way back it clogged a watchman who was unwise enough to stir .      er  i call him the luggage     said rincewind helplessly .      really .  we call her trunkie .      the wall opened up into a dark room .  crates were packed against the walls  covered with cobwebs .      oh  we   re in the old brewery     said neilette .     well  the new one  really .  let   s find a door .         good idea     said rincewind  eyeing the spider webs .     new brewery .  looks pretty old to me        neilette rattled a door .     locked     she said .     come on  we   ll find another one .  look  it   s the new brewery because we built it to replace the one over the river .  but it never worked .  the beer went flat  or something .  they all said it was haunted .  everyone knows that  don   t they .  we went back to the old brewery .  my dad lost nearly all his money .         why .         he owned it .  just about broke his heart  that did .  he left it to me     she tried another door     because  well  he never got on with noelene  what with the  well  you know  or rather  obviously you don   t   but it ruined the business  really .  and roo beer used to be the best there was .         can   t you sell it .  the site  i mean .         here .  a place where beer goes flat within five seconds .  can   t give it away .      rincewind peered up at the big metal vats .     perhaps it was built on some old religious site     he said .     that sort of thing can happen  you know .  back home there was this fish restaurant that got built on a        neilette rattled another unbudging door .     that   s what everyone thought     she said .     but apparently dad asked all the local tribes and they said it wasn   t .  they said it wasn   t any kind of sacred site .  they said it was an unsacred site .  some chief went to prison to see the prime minister and said     mate  your mob can dig it all up and drop it over the edge of the world  no worries .            why did he have to go to prison .         we put all our politicians in prison as soon as they   re elected .  don   t you .         why .         it saves time .     she tried an unrelenting handle .     damn .  and the windows are too high        the ground trembled .  metal jangled  somewhere in the darkness .  dust moved in strange little waves across the floor .      oh  not again     said neilette .   now not only the dust moved .  tiny shapes scuttled across it  flowed around rincewind   s feet and sped under the locked door .      the spiders are leaving .     said neilette .      fine by me .     said rincewind .   this time the tremor made the wall creak .      it   s never been this bad     neilette muttered .     find a ladder  we   ll give the windows a go .      above them a ladder parted company from the wall and folded itself into a metal puzzle on the floor .      this may not seem a good time to ask     said rincewind     but are you a kangaroo  by any chance .      far above them metal creaked and went on creaking  in a long drawn wail of inorganic pain .  rincewind looked up  and saw the dome of the brewery gently dissolve into a hundred falling pieces of glass .   and  dropping through the middle of it  some of its lamps still burning  the grinning shape of the roo beer kangaroo .      trunkie .  open up .     neilette yelled .      no       rincewind began  but she grabbed him and dragged him and in front of him was an opening lid     the world went dark .   there was wood underneath him .  he tapped it  very carefully .  and wood in front of him .  and w        excuse me        we   re inside the luggage .         why not .  that   s how we got out of cangoolie last week .  y   know  i think it may be a magic box .         do you know some of the things that have been inside it .         letitia kept her gin in it  i know that .      rincewind felt upwards  gingerly .   maybe the luggage had more than one inside .  he   d suspected as much .  maybe it was like one of those conjurer   s boxes where  after you   d put a penny in  the drawer miraculously slid around and it had gone .  rincewind had been given one of those as a toy when he was a kid .  he   d lost almost two dollars before he gave up and threw the thing away     his fingers touched what might have been a lid  and he pushed upwards .   they were still in the brewery .  this came as some relief  considering where you might end up if you got into the luggage .  there was still the bowel disturbing rumble  punctuated by clangs and tinkles as bits of rusted metal crashed down with lethal intent .   the big kangaroo sign was well alight .   in the smoke that rose from it were some pointy hats .   that is  the curls swirling and billowing around holes in the air looked very much like the three dimensional silhouettes of a group of wizards .   rincewind stepped out of the luggage .     oh  no  no  no     he mumbled .     i only got here a couple of months ago .  it   s not my fault .         they look like ghosts     said neilette .     do you know them .         no .  but they   re all mixed up with these earthquakes .  and something called the wet  whatever that was .         that   s just some old story  isn   t it .  anyway  mister wizard  it might have escaped your notice that the place is filling up with smoke .  which way did we come in .      rincewind looked around desperately .  smoke obscured everything .      has this place got cellars .     he said .      yeah .  i used to play mothers and mothers with noelene in them when we were kids .  look for hatches in the floor .      and it was three minutes later that the ancient wooden hatchcover in the alley finally gave way under the luggage   s insistent pounding .  several rats poured out  followed by rincewind and neilette .   no one paid them any attention .  a column of smoke was rising over the city .  watchmen and citizens were already forming a bucket chain and men with a battering ram were trying to break open the brewery   s main doors .      we   re well out of that     rincewind observed .     oh  boy  yes .         hey  what   s going on .  where   s the bloody water gone .      the cry came from a man working the handle of a pump out on the street  just as the pump gave a groan and the handle went limp .  a watchman grabbed his arm .      there   s another one in the yard over there .  get a wiggle on  mate .      a couple of men tried the other pump .  it made a choking noise  spat out a few drops of water and some damp rust  and gave up .   rincewind swallowed .     i think the water   s gone     he said  flatly .      what do you mean  gone .     said neilette .     there   s always water .  huge great seas of it underground .         yes  but   it doesn   t get filled up much  does it .  it doesn   t rain here .         there you go aga       she stopped .     what   s it you know .  you   re looking shifty  mister wizard .      rincewind stared glumly up at the tower of smoke .  there were twirling  tumbling sparks in it  rising in the heat and showering down over the city .  everything will be bone dry  he thought .  it doesn   t rain here .  it   hang on        how do you know i   m a wizard .     he said .      it   s written on your hat     she said .     badly .         you know what a wizard is .  this is a serious question .  i   m not pushing a prawn .         everyone knows what a wizard is .  we   ve got a university full of the useless mongrels .         and you can show me where this is  can you .         find it yourself .     she tried to stride off through the milling crowd .  he ran after her .      please don   t go .  i need someone like you .  as an interpreter .         what do you mean .  we speak the same language .         really .  stubbies here are really short shorts or small beer bottles .  how often do newcomers confuse the two .      neilette actually smiled .     not more than once .         just take me to this university of yours  will you .     said rincewind .     i think i can feel a famous last stand coming on .      there was a brief scream of metal overhead and a windmill fan crashed down into the street .      and we   d better be quick     he added .     otherwise all there   ll be to drink is beer .         the bursar laughed again as a series of little charcoal dots extended their legs  formed up and marched down the stone and across the sand in front of him .  behind him the trees were already loud with birdsong     and then  sadly  with wizards as well .   he could hear the voices in the distance and  while wizards are always questioning the universe  they mainly direct the questions at other wizards and don   t bother to listen to the answers .         certainly saw no trees when we arrived .         probably we didn   t see them because of the rain  and the senior wrangler didn   t see them because of mrs .  whitlow .  and get a grip on yourself  will you  dean .  i   m sure you   re getting young again .  no one   s impressed .         i think i must just be naturally youthful  archchancellor .         nothing to be proud of there .  and please  someone  stop the senior wrangler getting a grip on hims   oh  looks like someone   s had a picnic        the painter seemed engrossed in his work  and paid them no attention at all .      i   m sure the bursar went this way        a little red mud colored a complex curve and there  as if it had always been there  was a creature with the body of a giant rabbit  the expression of a camel and a tail that a lizard would be proud of .  the wizards appeared around the rock just in time to see it scratch its ears .      ye gods  what   s that .         some sort of rat .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      hey  look  bursar   s found one of the locals       the dean ambled across to the painter  who was watching the wizards with his mouth open .     good morning  fellow .  what   s that thing called .      the painter followed the pointing finger .     kangaroo .     he said .  the voice was a whisper  on the very cusp of hearing  but the ground trembled .      kangaroo  eh .         that might not be what it   s called  sir     said ponder .     he might just be saying     i don   t know .            can   t see why not .  he looks the sort of chap you find in this sort of place     said the dean .     deep tan .  shortage of trousers .  the sort of fellow who   d know what the wildlife is called  certainly .         he just drew it     said the bursar .      oh  did he .  very good artists  some of these chaps .         he   s not rincewind  is he .     said ridcully  who seldom bothered to remember faces .     i know he   s a bit on the dark side  but a few months in the sun   d bake anyone .      the other wizards drew together and looked around for any nearby sign of mobile rectangularity .      no hat     said ponder  and that was that .   the dean peered at the rock wall .     quite good drawings for native art     he said .     interesting   lines .      the bursar nodded .  as far as he could see  the drawings were simply alive .  they might be colored earth on rock  but they were as alive as the kangaroo that   d just hopped away .   the old man was drawing a snake now .  one wiggly line .      i remember seeing some of those palaces the tezumen built in the jungle     said the dean  watching him .     not an ounce of mortar in the whole place and the stones fit together so well you couldn   t stick a knife between them .  hah  they were about the only things the tezumen didn   t stick a knife between     he added .     odd people  really .  very big on wholesale human sacrifice and cocoa .  not an obvious combination  to my mind .  kill fifty thousand people and then relax with a nice cup of hot chocolate .  excuse me  i used to be quite good at this .      to the horror even of ridcully the dean took the piece of frayed twig out of the painter   s hand and dabbed it gently on the rock .      see .  a dot for the eye     said the dean  handing it back .   the painter gave him a sort of smile .  that is  he showed his teeth .  like many other beings on astral planes of all kinds  he was puzzled by the wizards .  they were people with the family sized self confidence that seems to be able to get away with anything .  they generated an unconscious field which said that of course they should be there  but no one was to worry or fuss around tidying up the place on their account and just get on with what they were doing .  the more impressionable victims were left with the feeling that they had clipboards and were awarding marks .   behind the dean a snake wriggled away .      anyone feel anything odd .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     my fingers tingled .  did any of you do any magic just then .      the dean picked up a burnt twig .  the painter   s mouth dropped open as the wizard drew a scratching line on the stone .      i think you might be offending him     said ponder .      nonsense .  a good artist is always prepared to learn     said the dean .     interesting thing  these fellows never seem to get the idea of perspective        the bursar thought  or received the thought  that   s because perspective is a lie .  if i know a pond is round then why should i draw it oval .  i will draw it round because round is true .  why should my brush lie to you just because my eye lies to me .   it sounded like quite an angry thought .      what   s that you   re drawing  dean .     said the senior wrangler .      what does it look like .  a bird  of course .      the voice in the bursar   s head thought  but a bird must fly .  where are the wings .      this one   s standing on the ground .  you don   t see the wings     said the dean  and then looked puzzled at having answered a question no one had asked .     blast .  you know  it   s harder than it looks  drawing on a rock        i always see the wings  thought the voice in the bursar   s head .  the bursar fumbled for his dried frog pill bottle .  the voices were never usually this precise .      very flat bird     said ridcully .     come on  dean  our friend here isn   t very happy .  let   s go and work out a really good boat spell           looks more like a weasel to me     said the senior wrangler .     you   ve got the tail wrong .         the stick slipped .         a duck   s fatter than that     said the chair of indefinite studies .     you shouldn   t try to show off  dean .  when was the last time you saw a duck that didn   t have peas round it .         last week  actually .         yes  we had crispy duck .  with plum sauce  i now recall .  here  let me have a go           now you   ve given it three legs .         i did ask for the stick .  you snatched it away .         now look     said ridcully .     i   m a man who knows his ducks  and what you   ve got there is laughable .  give me that   thank you .  you do a beak like this           that   s on the wrong end and it   s too big .         you think that   s a beak .         look  all three of you are barking up the wrong tree here .  give me that stick           ah  but  you see  ducks don   t bark .  hah .  there   s no need to snatch like that           unseen university was built of stone   so built out of stone that in fact there were many places where it was hard to tell where wild rock ended and domesticated stone began .   it was hard to imagine what else you could build a university out of .  if rincewind had set out to list possible materials he wouldn   t have included corrugated iron sheets .   in response to some sort of wizardly ancestral memory  though  the sheets around the gates had been quite expertly bent and hammered into the shape of a stone arch .  over it  burned into the thin metal  were the words  nullus anxietas .      i shouldn   t be surprised  should i .     he said .     no worries .      the gates  which were also made of corrugated iron nailed to bits of wood by a man using secondhand nails  were firmly shut .  a crowd of people were hammering on them .      looks like a lot of other people have the same idea     said neilette .      there   ll be another way in     said rincewind  walking away .     there   ll be an alley   ah  there it is .  now  these aren   t stone walls  so there won   t be removable bricks  which means       he prodded at the tin sheets  and one of them wobbled .     ah  yes .  a loose sheet which swings aside so you can get back in after hours .         how did you know that .         this is a university  isn   t it .  come on .      a message had been chalked beside the loose sheet .         nulli sheilae sanguineae        rincewind read aloud .     but your name   s not sheila  so we   re probably okay .         if it means what i think it means  it means they don   t allow women     said neilette .     you should   ve brought darleen .         sorry .         forget i mentioned it .      somewhat to rincewind   s surprise there was a short  pleasant lawn on the other side of the fence  illuminated by the light from a large low building .  all the buildings were low but had big wide roofs  giving the effect you might get if someone stepped on a lot of square mushrooms .  if they had been painted  it had been an historical event  probably coming somewhere between fire and the invention of the wheel .   there was a tower .  it was about twenty feet high .      i don   t call this much of a university     said rincewind .  he allowed himself a touch of smugness .     twenty feet high .  i could pi   i could spit from the top of it .  oh well        he made for the doorway  just as the light grew a lot brighter and was tinted with octarine  the eighth color that was intimately associated with magic .  the doors themselves were shut fast .   he banged on them  making them rattle .     fraternal greetings  brothers .     he shouted .     i bring you   good grie        the world simply changed .  one moment he was standing in front of a rusting door and the next he was in a circle with half a dozen wizards watching him .   he caught his balance .      well  full marks for effort     he managed .     where i come from  and you can call me mister boring if you like  we just open the door .         stone the crows  but we   re getting good at this     said a wizard .   and they were wizards .  rincewind was in no doubt of it .  they had proper pointy hats  although the brims were larger than anything he   d seen without flying buttresses .  their robes weren   t much more than waist length  and below them they wore shorts  long gray socks  and big leather sandals .  a lot of this was not the typical wizarding outfit as he   d grown up to understand it  but they were still wizards .  they had that unmistakable hot air balloon about to take off look .   the apparent leader of the group nodded at rincewind .      good evening  mister boring .  i must say you got here a lot quicker than we expected .      rincewind felt intuitively that saying    i was just outside the door    was not a good idea .      er  i had an assisted passage     he said .      he doesn   t look very demonic     said a wizard .     remember that last one we called up .  six eyes and three           the really good ones can disguise themselves  dean .         then this one must be a bloody genius  arch chancellor .         thank you very much     said rincewind .   the archchancellor nodded at him .  he was  of course  elderly  with a face that looked as though it had been screwed up and then smoothed out  and a short  graying beard .  there was something oddly familiar that rincewind couldn   t quite place .      we   ve called you up  boring     said the man     because we want to know what   s happened to the water .         it   s all gone  has it .     said rincewind .     thought so .         it can   t go     said the dean .     it   s water .  there   s always water  if you go down deep enough .         but if we go any deeper we   re going to give an elephant a bloody nasty shock     said the archchancellor .     so we        there was a clang as the doors hit the floor .  the wizards backed away .      what the hell   s that .     said one of them .      oh  that   s my luggage     said rincewind .     it   s made out of           not the box on legs .  isn   t that a woman .         don   t ask him  he   s not very quick at that sort of thing     said neilette  stepping in behind the luggage .     sorry  but trunkie got impatient .         we can   t have women in the university .     shouted the dean .     they   ll want to drink sherry .         no worries     said the archchancellor  waving a hand irritably .     what   s happened to the water  boring .         it   s all been used up  i suppose     said rincewind .      so how can we get some more .         why does everyone ask me .  don   t you have some rainmaking spells or something .         there   s that word again     said the dean .     water sprinkling out of the sky  eh .  i   ll believe that when i see it .         we tried making one of these   what were they called .  big white bags of water .  the things some of the sailors say they see in the sky .         clouds .         right .  they don   t stay up  boring .  we threw one off the tower last week and it hit the dean .         i   ve never believed those old stories     said the dean .     and i reckon you mongrels waited till i was walking past .         you don   t have to make them  they just happen     said rincewind .     look  i don   t know how to make it rain .  i thought any halfway decent wizard knew how to do a rainmaking spell     he added  as someone who wouldn   t know where to start .      really .     said the archchancellor  with dangerous brightness .      no offense meant     said rincewind hurriedly .     i   m sure this is a very good university  considering .  obviously it   s not a real one  but it   s amazingly good in the circumstances .         what   s wrong with it .     said the archchancellor .      well   your tower   s a little bit on the small side  isn   t it .  i mean  even compared to the buildings around here .  not that there   s           i think we ought to show mister boring our tower     said the archchancellor .     i don   t think he   s taking us seriously .         i   ve seen it     said rincewind .      from the top .         no  obviously not from the top           we haven   t got time for this  archchancellor     said a small wizard .     let   s send this wozza back to hell and find something better .         excuse me .     said rincewind .     by    hell    do you mean some hot red place .         yes .         really .  how do ecksians know when they   ve got there .  the beer   s warmer .         no more arguing .  this one turned up very fast when we did the summoning  so this is the one we need     said the archchancellor .     come along  boring .  this won   t take a minute .         ponder shook his head and wandered over to the fire .  mrs .  whitlow was sitting demurely on a rock .  in front of her  getting as close to the fire as possible  was the librarian .  he was still extremely small .  maybe his temporal gland had to take longer to work itself out  ponder thought .      what are the gentlemen doing .     said mrs .  whitlow .  she had to raise her voice above the argument  but mrs .  whitlow would still have said     is there some difficulty .     if she saw the wizards out on the lawn throwing fireballs at the monsters from the dungeon dimensions .  she liked to be told these things .      they   ve found a man drawing the most alive looking pictures i   ve ever seen     said ponder .     so now they   re trying to teach him art .  by committee .         the gentlemen always take an interest     said mrs .  whitlow .      they always interfere     said ponder .     i don   t know what it is about wizards  they can   t just watch .  so far they   re arguing about how to draw a duck and frankly i don   t think a duck has four legs  which is what it   s got so far .  honestly  mrs .  whitlow  they   re like kittens in a feather plucking shed   what   s that .      the librarian had tipped up the leather bag lying by the fire and was testing the contents for taste  in the way of young mammals everywhere .   he picked up a flat  bent piece of wood  painted in lines of many colors   far more pigments than the old man had been using to paint  and ponder wondered why .  he tested it for palatability  banged it on the ground in a vaguely hopeful way  and threw it away .  then he pulled out a flat oval of wood on a piece of string  and tried chewing the string .      is that a yo yo .     said mrs .  whitlow .      we used to call them bullroarers when i was a kid     said ponder .     you whirl it around over your head to make a funny noise .     he waved his hand vaguely in the air .      eeek .         ooh  isn   t that sweet .  he   s trying to do what you do .      the librarian tried to whirl the string  wrapped it round his face and hit himself on the back of the head .      oh  the poor little thing .  take it off him  mister stibbons  do .      the librarian bared some small fangs as ponder unwound the string .      i hope he   s going to grow up soon     he said .     otherwise the library will be filled up with cardboard books about bunnies           it really was a very stubby tower .  the base was stonework  but about halfway the builders had got fed up and resorted to rusted tin sheets nailed on to a wooden framework .  one rickety ladder led up .      very impressive     sighed rincewind .      the view   s even better from the top .  go on up .      the ladder shook under rincewind   s weight until he pulled himself up on to the planks  where he lay down and panted .  must be the beer and the excitement  he told himself .  one short ladder shouldn   t do this to me .      bracing air up here  isn   t it .     said the archchancellor  walking to the edge and waving a hand towards the city .      oh  certainly     said rincewind  tottering towards the corrugated battlements .     why  i expect you can see all the way to the gr   aaargh .      the archchancellor grabbed him and pulled him back .      that   s   it   s       rincewind gasped .      want to go back down again .      rincewind glared at the wizard and inched his way carefully back to the stairs .  he looked down  ready at an instant   s notice to draw his head back  and carefully counted the steps .   then he walked back gingerly to the parapet and risked looking over the edge .   there was the fiery speck of the burning brewery .  there was bugarup  and its harbor     rincewind raised his gaze .   there was the red desert  glittering under the moonlight .      how high is this .     he croaked .      on the outside .  about half a mile  we think     said the archchancellor .      and on the inside .         you climbed it .  two stories .         you   re trying to tell me you   ve got a tower that   s taller at the top than it is at the bottom .         good  isn   t it .     said the archchancellor happily .      that   s   very clever     said rincewind .      we   re a clever country           rincewind .      the voice came from below .  rincewind looked very carefully down the steps .  it was one of the wizards .      yes .     he said .      not you     snapped the wizard .     i want the archchancellor .         i   m rincewind     said rincewind .   the archchancellor tapped him on the shoulder .     that   s a coincidence     he said .     so am i .         ponder very carefully handed the bullroarer back to the little librarian .      there  you can have it     he said .     i   m giving it to you and  in return  perhaps you can take your teeth out of my leg .      from the other side of the rock came the voice of reason     there   s no need to fight  gentlemen .  let   s vote on it  now  all those who think a duck has webbed feet  raise your hands        the librarian swung the thing a few more times .      doesn   t seem to be a very good one     said ponder .     not much of a noise   honestly  how much longer are they going to be .         whum        eek .         yes  yes  very good           whum   whum   whuummmmm     ponder looked up as yellow light spread across the plain .   there was a circle of blue sky opening above .  the rain was stopping .      eek .      it occurred to ponder to wonder what a little old man was doing painting pictures in a bare landscape on a whole new continent     and then there was darkness .   the old man smiled with something like satisfaction  and turned away from the drawing he   d just completed .  it had a lot of pointy hats in it  and it had faded right into the rock .   and he was as happy as anything  and had drawn all the spiders and several possums before he found out what was missing .   he never even knew about the very strange and unhappy duck billed creature that slid silently into the river a little way off .         got to be at least some kind of cousins     said the archchancellor .     it   s not a common name .  have another beer .         i had a look through the unseen records once     said rincewind morosely .     they never had a rincewind before .     he upended the can of beer and finished the dregs .     never had a relative before  come to that .  never ever .     he pulled the top off another can .     no one to do all those little things relatives are s   posed to do  like   like   like send you some horrible cardigan at hogswatch  stuff like that .         you got a first name .  mine   s bill .            s a good name  bill rincewind .  dunno if i   ve even got a first name .         what do people usually call you  mate .         well  they usually say     stop him .        said rincewind  and took a deep draught of beer .     of course  that   s just a nickname .  when they want to be formal they shout    don   t let him get away .         he squinted at the can .        s much better than that other stuff     he said .     what   s this say .  funnelweb    .     s a funny name for a beer .         you   re reading the list of ingredients     said bill .      really .     mumbled rincewind .     where was i .         pointy hats .  water running out .  talking kangaroos .  pictures coming alive .         that   s right     said the dean .     if that   s what you   re like sober  we want to see what effect the beer has .         y   see  when the sun   s up     said archchancellor bill     i   ve got to go down to the prison and see the prime minister and explain why we don   t know what   s happened to the water .  anything you can do to assist would be very useful .  give him another tinnie  dean .  people   re already banging on the gates .  once the beer runs out  we   re in strife .      rincewind felt that he was in a warm amber haze .  he was among wizards .  you could tell by the way they bickered all the time .  and  somehow  the beer made it easier to think .   a wizard leaned over his shoulder and put an open book in front of him .      this is a copy of a cave painting from cangoolie     he said .     we   ve often wondered what the blobs are above the figures           that   s rain     said rincewind  after a glance .      you mentioned this before     said bill .     little drops of water flying through the air  right .         dropping     rincewind corrected him .      and it doesn   t hurt .         nope .         water   s heavy .  can   t say the idea of big white bags of the stuff floating around over our heads appeals .      rincewind had never studied meteorology  although he had been an end user all his life .   he waved his hands vaguely .     they   re like   steam     he said  and hiccuped .        s right .  lovely fluffy steam .         they   re boiling .         no  no .  nono .  ver    cold  clouds .  sometimes they come down ver    low  they even touch the ground .      the wizards looked at one another .      y   know  we   re making some bloody good beer these days     said bill .      clouds sound bloody dangerous to me     said the dean .     we don   t want them knocking over trees and buildings  do we .         ah  but .  but .  they   re soft  see .  like smoke .         but you said they weren   t hot .      rincewind suddenly saw the perfect explanation .      have you ever huffed on a cold mirror .     he said  beaming .      not on a regular basis  but i know what you mean .         well  basically  that   s clouds .  can i have another beer .  it   s amazing  it doesn   t feem to have any essect on me  no matter how much i dnirk .  helps me think clearerer .      archchancellor rincewind drummed his fingers on the table .     you and this rain stuff   you   ve got to be connected  yes .  we   ve run out of water and you turn up        rincewind burped .     got to put something right  too     he said .     pointy hats  all floating in the air           where did you last see them .         in the brewery with no beer in it .  said it   s haunted  haha .  pointy hat haunting  hahah        bill stared at him .     right     he said .  he looked at the forlorn figure of his distant cousin  now very close up .     let   s get down there .     he glanced at rincewind again and seemed to think for a moment .      and we   ll take some beer     he added .      ponder stibbons tried to think  but his thoughts seemed to be going very slowly .  everything was dark and he couldn   t move but  somehow  it wasn   t too bad .  it felt like those treasured moments in bed when you   re just awake enough to know that you   re still nicely asleep .   it   s amazing how time passes .      there was a huge bucket chain now  stretching all the way from the harbor to the brewery .  despite the tangily refreshing oak spiciness of their chardonnays  the ecksians weren   t the kind of people to let a brewery burn .  it didn   t matter that there was no beer in it .  there was a principle at stake .   the wizards marched through the crowd to a chorus of mutters and the occasional jeer from someone safely tucked away at the back .   smoke and steam came out of the main doorway  which had been burst open by the battering ram .   archchancellor rincewind stepped inside  dragging his happily smiling relative with him .   the smoldering roo beer sign  reduced to a metal skeleton  still lay in the middle of the floor .      he kept waving at it and going on about pointy hats     neilette volunteered .      test it for magic  dean     said archchancellor rincewind .   the dean waved a hand .  sparks flew up .     nothing there     he said .     i said we        for a moment some pointed shapes hung in the air  and then vanished .      that   s not magic     said one of the wizards .     that   s ghosts .         everyone knows this place is haunted .  evil spirits  they say .         should   ve stuck to beer     said archchancellor rincewind .   neilette pointed to the trapdoor .     but it doesn   t go anywhere     she said .     there   s a hatch to the outside and some storerooms and that   s about it .      the wizards looked down .   below was utter darkness .  something small skittered away on what sounded very much like more than four legs .  there was the smell of very old  very stale beer .      no worries     said rincewind  waving a tin expansively .     i   ll go down first  shall i .      this was fun .   there was a rusted ladder bolted to the wall below him .  it creaked under his weight  and gave way when he was a few feet from the cellar floor  dropping him on to the stones .  the wizards heard him laugh .   then he called up     do any of you know someone called dibbler .         what   old fair go .     said bill .         s right .  he   ll be outside selling stuff to the crowd  right .         very likely .         can someone go and get me one of his floating meat pies with extra tomato sauce .  i could really do with one .      the dean looked at archchancellor rincewind .     how much beer did he drink .         three or four tinnies .  he must be allergic  poor bastard .         i reckon i could even eat two .     rincewind called up .      two .         no worries .  anyone got a torch .  it   s dark down here .         do you want the gourmet pies or the ordinary .     said the dean .      oh  the ordinary will do me .  no swank  eh .         poor bastard     said bill  and sorted through his small change .   it was indeed dark in the cellars  but enough dim light filtered through the trapdoor for rincewind to make out huge pipes in the gloom .   it was obvious that some time after the brewery had been closed  but before people had got around to securely locking every entrance  the cellars had been employed by young people as such places are when you live with your parents  the house is too small  and no one has got around to inventing the motorcar .   in short  they   d written on the walls .  rincewind could make out careful inscriptions telling posterity that  for example  b .  smoth is a pozza .  while he didn   t know what a pozza was  he was quite  quite sure that b .  smoth didn   t want to be called one .  it was amazing how slang seemed to radiate its meaning even in another language .   there was a thump behind him as the luggage landed on the stone floor .      me old mate trunkie     said rincewind .     no worries .      another ladder was eased down and the wizards  with some care  joined him .  archchancellor rincewind was holding a staff with a glowing end .      found anything .     he said .      well  yes .  i wouldn   t shake hands with anyone called b .  smoth     said rincewind .      oh  the dean   s not a bad bloke when you get to know him   what   s up .      rincewind pointed to the far end of the room .   there  on a door  someone had drawn some pointy hats  in red .  they glistened in the light .      my word .  blood     said rincewind .   his cousin ran a finger over it .     it   s ochre     he said .     clay        the door led to another cellar .  there were a few empty barrels  some broken crates  and nothing else except musty darkness .   dust whirled up on the floor from the draught of their movement  in a series of tiny  inverted whirlwinds .  pointy hats again .      hmm  solid walls all round     said bill .     better pick a direction  mate .      rincewind had a drink  shut his eyes and pointed a finger at random .      that way .      the luggage plunged forward and struck the brickwork  which fell away to reveal a dark space beyond .   rincewind stuck his head through .  all the builders had done was wall up and square off a part of a cave .  from the feel of the air  it was quite a large one .   neilette and the wizards climbed through behind him .      i   m sure this place wasn   t here when the brewery was built .     said neilette .      it   s big     said the dean .     how   d it get made .         water     said rincewind .      you what .  water makes great big holes in rock .         yes .  don   t ask me why   what was that .         what .         did you hear something .         you said     what was that .         rincewind sighed .  the cold air was sobering him up .      you really are wizards  aren   t you .     he said .     real honest to goodness wizards .  you   ve got hats that   re more brim than point  the whole university   s made of tin  you   ve got a tiny tower which is  i must admit  good grief  a lot taller on the outside  but you   re wizards all right  and will you now  please  shut up .      in the silence there was  very faintly  a plink .   rincewind stared into the depths of the cave .  the light from the staffs only made them worse .  it cast shadows .  darkness was just darkness  but anything could be hiding in shadows .      these caves must   ve been explored     he said .  it was a hope rather than a statement .  history here was rather a rubbery thing .      never heard of    em     said the dean .      points again  look     said bill  as they advanced .      just stalactites and stalagmites     said rincewind .     i don   t know how it works  but water drips on stuff and leaves piles of stuff .  takes thousands of years .  perfectly ordinary .         is this the same kind of water that floats through the sky and gouges out big caves in rocks .     said the dean .      er   yes   er  obviously     said rincewind .      it   s good luck for us we only have the drinking and washing sort  then .         had     said rincewind .   there were hurrying feet behind them and a junior wizard ran up  holding a plate covered with a lid .      got the last one .     he said .     it   s a gourmet pie  too .      he lifted the lid .  rincewind stared  and swallowed .     oh dear           what   s up .         have you got some more of that beer .  i think i might be losing   concentration        his cousin stepped forward  ripping the top off a can of funnelweb .      cartwright  you cover that pie up and keep it warm .  rincewind  you drink this .      they watched him drain the tin .      right  mate     said the archchancellor .     how about a nice meat pie upside down in a big bowl of mushy green peas covered with tomato sauce .      he looked at the color change on rincewind   s face  and nodded .      you need another tin     he said firmly .   they watched him drink this .      okay     said the archchancellor after a while .     now  rincewind  how about a nice one of fair go   s pie floaters  eh .  meat pie in pea soup and tomato sauce .      rincewind   s face twitched a bit as amber blessings shut down vital protective systems .      sounds   good     he said .     maybe with some coconut on the top .      the wizards relaxed .      so now we know     said archchancellor rincewind .     we   ve got to keep you just drunk enough so that dibbler   s pies sound tasty  but not so drunk that it causes lasting brain damage .         that   s a very narrow window we   ve got there     said the dean .   bill looked up at the roof  where the shadows danced among the stalactites  unless they were stalagmites .      this is right under the city     he said .     how come we   ve never heard of it .         good question     said the dean .     the men who built the cellar must   ve seen it .      rincewind tried to think .     it wasn   t here then     he said .      you said these stalag things took thousands of           they probably weren   t here last month but now they   ve been here for thousands of years     said rincewind .  he hiccuped .     it   s like your tower     he said .     taller onna outside .         huh .         prob   ly only works here     said rincewind .     the more geography you   ve got  the less hist   ry  ever notice that .  more space  less time .  i bet it only took a second or two for this place to be here for thousands of years  see .  shorter on the outside .  makes serfect pense .         i don   t think i   ve drunk enough beer to understand that     said the dean .   something nudged him in the back of the legs .  he looked down at the luggage .  it was one of its habits to come up so close behind people that  when they looked down  they felt seriously over feeted .      or this     he added .   the wizards grew quieter as rincewind led them onward .  he wasn   t sure who was leading him .  still  no worries .   contrary to the usual procedures it began to grow lighter  although the proliferation of luminous fungi or iridescent crystals in deep caves where the torchlessly improvident hero needs to see is one of the most obvious intrusions of narrative causality into the physical universe .  in this case  the rocks were glowing  not from some mysterious inner light but simply as though the sun were shining on them  just after dawn .   there are other imperatives that operate on the human brain .  one says  the bigger the space  the softer the voice  and refers to the natural tendency to speak very  very quietly when stepping into somewhere huge .  so when archchancellor rincewind stepped out into the big cave he said     strewth  it   s bloody big .     in a low whisper .   the dean  however  shouted     coo eee .     because there   s always one .   stalactites crowded the cave here  too  and in the very center a gigantic stalactite had almost touched its mirror image stalagmite .  the air was chokingly hot .      this isn   t right       said rincewind .   plink .   they spotted the source of the noise eventually .  a tiny trickle was making its way down the side of the stalactite and forming droplets that fell a few feet to the stalagmite .   another drop formed while they watched  and hung there .   one of the wizards clambered up the dry slope and peered at it .      it   s not moving     he said .     the trickle   s drying up .  i think   it   s evaporating .      the archchancellor turned to rincewind .     well  we   ve followed you this far  mate     he said .     what now .         i think i could do with another b           there   s none left  mate .      rincewind looked desperately around the cave  and then at the huge translucent mass of limestone in front of him .   it was definitely pointy .  it was also in the center of the cave .  it had a certain inevitability about it .   odd  really  that something like this would form down here  shining away like a pearl in an oyster .  the ground trembled again .  up there  people would already be getting thirsty  cursing the windmills as only an ecksian could curse .  the water was gone and that was very bad  and when the beer ran out people would really get angry     the wizards were all waiting for him to do something .   all right  start with the rock .  what did he know about rocks and caves in these parts .   there was a curious freedom at a time like this .  he was going to be in real trouble whatever he did  so he might as well give this a try        i need some paint     he said .      what for .         for what i need     said rincewind .      there   s young salid     said the dean .     he   s a bit of an arty blager .  let   s go and kick his door down .         and bring some more beer .     rincewind called after them .   neilette patted rincewind on the shoulder .     are you going to do some magic .     she said .      i don   t know if it counts as magic here     said rincewind .     if it doesn   t work  stand well back .         is it going to be dangerous  then .         no  i might have to start running without looking where i   m going .  but   this rock   s warm .  have you noticed .      she touched it .     i see what you mean           i was just thinking   supposing someone was in a country who shouldn   t be there .  what would it do .         oh  the watch would catch him  i expect .         no  no  not the people .  what would the land do .  i think i need another drink  it made more sense then           okay  here we are  we couldn   t find much  but there   s some whitewash and some red paint and a tin of stuff which might be black paint or it could be tar oil .     the wizards hurried up .     not much in the way of brushes  though .      rincewind picked up a brush that looked as though it had once been used to whitewash a very rough wall and then to clean the teeth of some large creature  possibly a crocodile .   he   d never been any good at art  and this is a distinction quite hard to achieve in many education systems .  basic artistic skills and a familiarity with occult calligraphy are part of a wizard   s early training  yet in rincewind   s fingers chalk broke and pencils shattered .  it was probably due to a deep distrust of getting things down on paper when they were doing all right where they were .   neilette handed him a tin of funnelweb .  rincewind drank deeply and then dipped the brush in what might have been black paint and essayed a few upturned vs on the rock  and some circles under the lines  with three dots in a v and a friendly little curve in each one .   he took another deep draught of the beer and saw what he was doing wrong .  it was no good trying to be strictly true to life here  what he had to go for was an impression .   he sloshed wildly at the stone  humming madly under his breath .      anyone guess what it is yet .     he said  over his shoulder .      looks a bit modern to me     said the dean .   but rincewind was into the swing of it now .  any fool could just copy what he saw  except possibly rincewind  but surely the whole point was to try to paint a picture that moved  that definitely expressed the  the  the     definitely expressed it  anyway .  you went the way the paint and the color wanted you to go .      you know     said neilette     the way the light falls on it and everything   it could be a group of wizards        rincewind half closed his eyes .  perhaps it was the way that the shadows moved  but he had to admit he   d done a really good job .  he slapped some more paint on .      looks like they   re almost coming out of the stone     said someone behind him  but the voice sounded muffled .   he felt as though he was falling into a hole .  he   d had the sensation before  although usually it was when he was falling into a hole .  the walls were fuzzy  as though they were streaking past him at a tremendous rate .  the ground shook .      are we moving .     he said .      feels like it  doesn   t it .     said archchancellor rincewind .     but we   re standing still .         moving while standing still     muttered rincewind  and giggled .  that   s a good one .     he squinted happily at the beer can .     y   know     he said     i can   t stomach more than a pint or two of the ale we have at home but this stuff is like drinking lemonade .  has anyone got that meat pie        as loudly as a thunderstorm under the bed but as softly as two souffl  s colliding  past and present ran into one another .   they contained a lot of people .      what   s this .         dean .         yes .         you   re not the dean .         how dare you say that .  who are you .         ook .         stone the cows  there   s a monkey in here .         no .  no .  i didn   t say that .  he said that .         archchancellor .         yes .         yes .         what .  how many of you are there .      the darkness became a deep purple  shading to violet .      will you all stop shouting and listen to me .      to rincewind   s amazement  they did .      look  the walls are getting closer .  this place is trying not to exist .      and  having done his duty to the community  he turned and ran over the shaking rock floor .   after a couple of seconds the luggage passed him  which was always a bad sign .   he heard the voices behind him .  wizards had a hard job accepting the term    clear and present danger .     they liked the kind you could argue about .  but there is something about a rapidly descending ceiling that intrudes into the awareness of even the most quarrelsome .      i   ll save you  mrs .  whitlow .         up the tunnel .         how fast are those walls closing in  would you say .         shut up and run .      now rincewind was passed by a large red  furry kangaroo .  the librarian   s erratic morphism  having briefly turned him into a red stalactite as an obviously successful shape for surviving in caves  had finally taken on board the fact that it would make for a terminally lengthy survival in a cave that was rapidly getting smaller  and had flipped into a local morphic field built for speed .   man  luggage and kangaroo piled through the hole into the cellar and ended in a heap against the opposite side .   there was a rumbling behind them and wizards and women were fired out into the cellar with some speed  several of them landing on rincewind .  behind the wall  the rock groaned and creaked  expelling these alien things in what  rincewind thought  was a geological chunder .   something flew out of the hole and hit him on the ear  but this was only a minor problem compared to the meat pie  which came out trailing mushy peas and tomato sauce and hit him in the mouth .   it wasn   t  actually  all that bad .      the ability to ask questions like    where am i and who is the    i    that is asking .     is one of the things that distinguishes mankind from  say  cuttlefish .    the wizards from unseen university  being perhaps the intellectual cream or certainly the cerebral yogurt of their generation  passed through this stage within minutes .  wizards are very adept at certain ideas .  one minute you   re arguing over the shape of a duck   s head and the next there are people telling you you   ve been inside a rock for thousands of years because time goes slower on the inside .  this presents no great problem for a man who has found his way to the lavatory at unseen university .      there were more important questions as they sat round the table in bu .      is there anything to eat .     said ridcully .      it   s the middle of the night  sir .         you mean we missed dinner .         thousands of years of dinners  archchancellor .         really .  better start catching up  then  mister stibbons .  still   nice little place you   ve got here   archchancellor .      ridcully pronounced the word very carefully in order to accentuate the lower case    a .      archchancellor rincewind gave him a fraternal nod .     thank you .         for a colony  of course .  i daresay you do your best .         why  thank you  mustrum .  i   d be happy to show you our tower later on .         it does look rather small .         so people say .         rincewind  rincewind   name rings a faint bell       said ridcully .      we came looking for rincewind  archchancellor     said ponder  patiently .      is he .  done well for himself  then .  fresh air made a man of him  i see .         no  sir .  ours is the skinny one with the bad beard and the floppy hat  sir .  you remember .  the one sitting over there .      rincewind raised a hand diffidently .     er .  me     he said .   ridcully sniffed .     fair enough .  what   s that thing you   re playing with  man .      rincewind held up the bullroarer .     it came with you out of the cave     he said .     what were you doing with it .         oh  some toy the librarian found     said ponder .      all sorted out  then     said ridcully .     i say  this beer   s good  isn   t it .  very drinkable .  yes  i   m sure there   s a lot we can learn from one another  archchancellor .  you from us rather more than us from you  of course .  perhaps we could set up a student exchange  that sort of thing .         good idea .         you can have six of mine in exchange for a decent lawnmower .  ours has broken .         the arch   the archchancellor is trying to say that getting back might be rather hard  sir     said ponder .     apparently things ought to have changed now we   re here .  but they haven   t .         your rincewind seemed to think that bringing you blokes here would make it rain     said bill .     but it hasn   t .         whumm        oh  do stop playing with that thing  rincewind     said ridcully .     well   bill  it   s obvious  isn   t it .  as more experienced wizards than you  we naturally know plenty of ways of making it rain .  no problem there .         whumm        look  lad  take that thing outside  will you .         the librarian was sitting at the top of the tin tower  with a leaf over his head .      something odd  see .     said rincewind  dangling the bullroarer from its string .     i   ve only got to wiggle my hand a bit and it swings right round .            ook        the librarian sneezed .         awk           er   now you   re some sort of large bird       said rincewind .     you are in a bad way  aren   t you .  still  once i tell them your name        the librarian changed shape and moved fast .  there was a very short period of time in which a lot happened .      ah     said rincewind calmly when it seemed to be over .     well  let us start with what we know .  i can   t see .  the reason i can   t see is that my robe is hanging over my eyes .  from this i can deduce that i am upside down .  you are gripping my ankles .  correction  one ankle  so obviously you are holding me upside down .  we are at the top of the tower .  this means        he fell silent .      all right  let   s start again     he said .     let   s start by me not telling anyone your name .      the librarian let go .   rincewind dropped a few inches on to the planks of the tower .      you know  that was a really mean trick you just did     he said .      ook .         we   ll say no more about it  shall we .      rincewind looked up at the big  empty sky .  it ought to be raining .  he   d done everything he was supposed to do  hadn   t he .  and all that had happened was that the faculty of uu was down there being condescending about everything .  it wasn   t even as if they could do a rainmaking spell .  for one of those to work you needed some rain around to start with .  in fact  it was prudent to make sure that some heavy looking clouds were being blown in your direction .   and if it wasn   t raining then probably those terrible currents they talked about were still around  too .   it wasn   t a bad country .  they were big on hats .  they were big on big hats .  he could save up and buy a farm on the never never and watch sheep .  after all  they fed themselves and they made more sheep .  all you had to do was pick the wool off occasionally .  the luggage   d probably settle down to being a sheepdog .   except   that there wasn   t any more water .  no more sheep  no more farms .  mad  and crocodile crocodile  the lovely ladies darleen and letitia  remorse and his horses  all those people who   d shown him how to find the things you could eat without throwing up too often   all drying up  and blowing away     him  too .   g   day .      ook .         oh  no       rincewind moaned .   throat a bit parched .      look  you   re not supposed to        it   s all right  i have an appointment down in the city .  there   s been a fight over the last bottle of beer .  however  let me assure you of my personal attention at all times .      well  thank you .  when it   s time to stop living  i will certainly make death my number one choice .      death faded .      the cheek of him  turning up like that .  we   re not dead yet     shouted rincewind to the burning sky .     there   s lots we could do .  if we could get to the hub we could cut loose a big iceberg and tow it here and that   d give us plenty of water   if we could get to the hub .  where there   s hope there   s life  i   ll have you know .  i   ll find a way .  somewhere there   s a way of making rain .      death had gone .   rincewind swung the bullroarer menacingly .     and don   t come back .         ook .      the librarian gripped rincewind   s arm  and sniffed the air .   then rincewind caught the smell too .   rincewind spoke a fairly primitive language  and it had no word for    that smell you get after rain    other than    that smell you get after rain .     anyone trying to describe the smell would have to flounder among words like moisture  heat  vapor and  with a following wind  exhalation .   nevertheless  there was the smell you get after rain .  in this burning land  it was like a brief jewel in the air .   rincewind whirled the piece of wood again .  it made noise out of all proportion to the movement  and there was that smell again .   he turned it over .  it was still just a wooden oval .  there weren   t any markings on it .   he gripped the end of the string and whirled the thing experimentally a few more times .      did you notice that when it did this       he began .   it wouldn   t stop .  he couldn   t lower his arm .      er   i think it wants to be spun     he said .      ook .         you think i should .         ook .         that   s very helpful .  oooh        the librarian ducked .   rincewind spun .  he couldn   t see the wood now because the string was getting longer with each turn .  a blur curved through the air some way from the tower  getting further away with each spin .   the sound of it was a long drawn out drone .   when it was well out over the city it exploded in a thunderclap .  but something still whirled on the end of the line  like a tight silver cloud  throwing out a trail of white particles that made a spiral that sped out wider and wider .   the librarian was flat on his face with his hands over his head .   air roared up the side of the tower  carrying dust  wind  heat and budgerigars .  rincewind   s robe flapped around his chin .   letting go was unthinkable .  he wasn   t even sure if he could  until it wanted him to .   thin as smoke now  the spiral drifted out into the heat haze .       and out over the red desert and the unheeding kangaroos  and as the tail of it flew out over the coast and into the wall of storms the warring airs melted peacefully together   the clouds stopped their stately spin around the last continent  boiled up in confusion and thunderheads  reversed their direction and began to fall inwards      and the string whipped out of rincewind   s hand  stinging his fingers .  the bullroarer flew away  and he didn   t see it fall .   this may have been because he was still pirouetting  but at last gravity overcame momentum and he fell full length on the boards .      i think my feet have caught fire     he muttered .      the dead heat hung on the land like a shroud .  clancy the stockman wiped the sweat off his brow very thoroughly  and wrung out the rag into an empty jam tin .  the way things were going  he   d be glad of it .  then  carrying the tin with care  he climbed back down the windmill   s ladder .      the bore   s fine  boss  there   s just no bloody water     he said .   remorse shook his head .     look at them horses     he said .     look at the way they   re lying down  willya .  that   s not good .  this is it  clancy .  we   ve battled through thick and thin  and this is too thick altogether by half .  we may as well cut their poor bloody throats for the meat that   s on    em        a gust of wind took his hat off for him  and blew a lash of scent across the wilted mulga bushes .  a horse raised his head .   clouds were pouring across the sky  rolling and boiling across each other like waves on a beach  so black that in the middle they were blue  lit by occasional flashes .      what the hell   s that .     said clancy .   the horse stood up awkwardly and stumbled to the rusted trough under the windmill .   under the clouds  dragging across the land  the air shimmered silver .   something hit remorse   s head .   he looked down .  something went    plut    in the red dust by his boot  leaving a little crater .      that is water  clancy     he said .     it   s bloody water dropping out of the bloody sky .      they stared at one another with their mouths open as  around them  the storm hit and the animals stirred and the red dust turned into mud which spattered them up to their waists .   this was no ordinary rainstorm .  this was the wet .   as clancy said later  the second best bloody thing that happened that day was that they were near high ground .   the best bloody thing was that  with all the corks on their hats  they were able to find the bloody things later on .      there   d been debate about having this year   s regatta in dijabringabeeralong  given the drought .  but it was a tradition .  a lot of people came into town for it .  besides  the organizers had discussed it long and hard all the previous evening in the bar of the pastoral hotel and had concluded that  no worries  she   ll be right .   there were classes for boats pulled by camels  boats optimistically propelled by sails and  a high spot of the event  skiffs propelled by the simple expedient of the crew cutting the bottoms out  gripping the sides and running like hell .  it always got a good laugh .   it was while two teams were trotting upriver in the semi final that the spectators noticed the black cloud pouring over semaphore hill like boiling jam .      bushfire     said someone .      bushfire   d be white .  come on        that was the thing about fire .  if you saw one  everyone went to put it out .  fire spread like wildfire .   but as they turned away there was a scream from the riverbed .   the teams rounded the bend neck and neck  carrying their boats at a record breaking speed .  they reached the slipway  collided in their efforts to get up it  made it to the top locked together  and collapsed in splinters and screams .      stop the regatta .     panted one of the coxes .     the river   the river        but by then everyone could see it .  around the bend  traveling slowly because it was pushing in front of it a huge logjam of bushes  carts  rocks and trees  was the flood .   it thundered past and the mobile dam slid on  scything the river bottom free of all obstruction .  behind it foaming water filled the river from bank to bank .   they canceled the regatta .  a river full of water made a mockery of the whole idea .      the university   s gates had burst open and now the angry mob was in the grounds and hammering on the walls .   above the din  the wizards searched feverishly through the books .      well  have you got something like maxwell   s impressive separator .     said ridcully .      what   s that do .     said archchancellor rincewind .      unmixes two things  like   sugar and sand  for example .  uses nanny   s demons .         nano demons  possibly     murmured ponder wearily .      oh  like bonza charlie   s beaut sieve .  yeah  we   ve got that .         ah  parallel evolution .  fine .  dig it out  man .      archchancellor rincewind nodded at one of the wizards  and then broke into a grin .      are you thinking about it working on salt .     he said .      exactly .  one spell  one bucket of seawater  no more problem           er  that   s not exactly true     said ponder stibbons .      sounds perfect to me  man .         it takes a great deal of magic  sir .  and the demons take about a fortnight per pint  sir .         ah .  a significant point  mister stibbons .         yes  sir .         however  just because it wouldn   t work does not mean it was a bad idea   i wish they   d stop that shouting .      the shouting outside stopped .      perhaps they heard you  sir     said ponder .   pang .  pang  pang        are they throwing stuff on to the roof .     said archchancellor rincewind .      no  that   s probably just rain     said ridcully .     now  i suppose you   ve tried evaporating        he realized that no one was listening .  everyone was looking up .   now the individual thuds had merged into a steady hammering and from outside came the sound of wild cheering .   the wizards struggled in the doorway and finally fought their way outside  where water was pouring off the roof in a solid sheet and cutting a channel in the lawn .   archchancellor rincewind stopped abruptly and reached out to the water like a man not sure if the stove is hot .      out of the sky .     he said .  he pushed his way out through the liquid curtain .  then he took off his hat and held it upside down to catch the rain .   the crowd had filled the university grounds and spilled out into the surrounding streets .  every face was turned upwards .      and those dark things .     archchancellor rincewind called out .      they are the clouds  archchancellor .         there   s a hell of a lot of them .      there were .  they piled up over the tower in an enormous  spreading black thunderhead .   a couple of people looked down long enough to see the group of soaked wizards  and there were some cheers .  and suddenly they were the new center of attention  and being picked up and carried shoulder high .      they think we did it .     shouted archchancellor rincewind  as he was borne aloft .      who   s to say we didn   t .     shouted ridcully  tapping the side of his nose conspiratorially .      er       someone began .   ridcully didn   t even look round .     shut up  mister stibbons     he said .      shutting up  sir .         can you hear that thunder .     said ridcully  as a rumble rolled across the city .     we   d better take cover        the clouds above the tower were rising like water against a dam .  ponder said afterwards the fact that the bu tower was very short and extremely tall at the same time might have been the problem  since the storm was trying to go around it  over it and through it  all at the same time .   from the ground the clouds seemed to open up slowly  leaving a glowing  spreading chimney filled with the blue haze of electrical discharges        and pounced .  one solid blue bolt hit the tower at every height all at once  which is technically impossible .  pieces of wood and corrugated iron roared into the air and rained down across the city .   then there was just a sizzling  and the rushing of the rain .   the crowd stood up again  cautiously  but the fireworks were over .      and that   s what we call lightning     said ridcully .   archchancellor rincewind got up and tried to brush mud off his robe  then found out why you cannot do this .      it   s not usually as big as that  though     ridcully went on .      oh .  good .      there was a clank from the steaming debris where the tower had stood  and a sheet of metal was pushed aside .  slowly  with much mutual aid and many false starts  two blackened figures emerged .  one of them was still wearing a hat  which was on fire although the rain was putting out the flames .   leaning against one another  weaving from side to side  they approached the wizards .   one of them said     ook     very quietly and fell backwards .   the other one looked blearily at the two arch chancellors  and saluted .  this caused a spark to leap from its fingers and burn its ear .      er  rincewind     it said .      and what have you been up to while we   ve been doing all this hard work  pray .     said ridcully .   rincewind looked around  very slowly .  occasional little blue streaks crackled in his beard .      well  that all seemed to go pretty well  really .  all things considered     he said  and fell full length into a puddle .      it rained .  after that  it rained .  then it rained some more .  the clouds were stacked like impatient charter flights over the coast  low on fuel  jockeying for position  and raining .  above all  raining .   floodwater roared down the rocks and scoured out the ancient muddy waterholes .  a species of tiny shrimps whose world for thousands of years had been one small hole under a stone were picked up and carried wholesale into a lake that was spreading faster than a man could run .  there had been fewer than a thousand of them .  there were a lot more next day .  even if the shrimps had been able to count how many  they were far too busy to bother .   in the new estuaries  rich in sudden silt and unexpected food  a few fish began the experiment of a salt free diet .  the mangroves started their stop motion conquests of the new mudbanks .   it went on raining .   then it rained some more .   after that  it rained .      it was some days later .   the ship rose and fell gently by the dock .  the water around it was red with suspended silt in which a few leaves and twigs floated .      a week or two to nothingfjord and we   re practically home     said ridcully .      practically on the same continent  anyway     said the dean .      quite an int   resting long vacation  really     said the lecturer in recent runes .      probably the longest ever     said ponder .     did mrs .  whitlow like her stateroom .         i for one will quite enjoy bunking down in the hold     said the senior wrangler loyally .      the bilges  actually     said ponder .     the hold   s full .  of opals  beer  sheep  wool and bananas .         where   s the librarian .     said ridcully .      in the hold  sir .         yes  i suppose it was silly of me to ask .  still  nice to see him his old self again .         i think it may have been the lightning  sir .  he   s certainly very lively now .      and rincewind sat on the luggage  down on the dock .   somehow  he felt  something should be happening .  the worst time in your life was when nothing much was going on  because that meant that something bad was about to hit you .  for some strange reason .   he could be back in the university library in a month or so  and then ho .  for a life of stacking books .  one dull day after another  with occasional periods of boredom .  he could hardly wait .  every minute not being a minute wasted was  well  a minute wasted .  excitement .  that could happen to other people .   he   d watched the merchants loading the ship .  it was pretty low in the water  because there would be so many ecksian things the rest of the world wanted .  of course  it   d come back light  because it was hard to think of any bloody thing it could bloody import that was better than any bloody thing in ecksecksecksecks .   there were even a few more passengers willing to see the world  and most of them were young .      hey  aren   t you one of the foreign wizards .      the speaker was a young man carrying a very large knapsack topped by a bedroll .  he seemed to be the impromptu leader of a small group of similarly overloaded people  with wide  open faces and slightly worried expressions .      you can tell  can   t you .     said rincewind .     er   you wanted something .         d   yew think we can buy a cart in this place nothingfjord .         yes  i should think so .         only me and clive and shirl and gerleen were thinkin    of picking one up and driving to       he looked around .      ankh morpork     said shirl .      right  and then selling it  and gettin    a job for a while  having a look round  y   know   for a while .  that   d be right .      rincewind glanced at the others trooping up the gangplank .  since the invention of the dung beetle  which had in fact happened not too far away  it was probable that no creature had ever carried so much weight .      i can see it catching on     he said .      no worries .         but   er           yes  mate .         do you mind not humming that tune .  it was only a sheep  and i didn   t even steal it        someone tapped him on the shoulder .  it was neilette .  letitia and darleen were standing behind her  grinning .  it was ten in the morning .  they were wearing sequined evening gowns .      budge up     she said  and settled down beside him .     we just thought   well  we   ve come to say  you know  thanks and everything .  letitia and darleen are coming in with me and we   re going to open up the brewery again .      rincewind glanced up at the ladies .      i   ve had enough beer thrown at me  i ought to know something about it     said letitia .     although i do think we could make it a more attractive color .  it   s so       she waved a large  be ringed hand irritably        aggressively masculine .         pink would be nice     said rincewind .     and you could put in a pickled onion on a stick  perhaps .         bloody good suggestion .     said darleen  slapping him so hard on the back that his hat fell over his eyes .      you wouldn   t like to stay .     said neilette .     you look like someone with ideas .      rincewind considered this attractive proposition  and then shook his head .      it   s a nice offer  but i think i ought to stick to what i do best     he said .      but everyone says you   re no good at magic .     said neilette .      er   yes  well  being no good at magic is what i do best     said rincewind .     thanks all the same .         at least let me give you a big wet sloppy kiss     said darleen  grabbing his shoulders .  out of the corner of his eye rincewind saw neilette   s foot stamp down .      all right  all right .     said darleen  letting go and hopping away .     it wasn   t as if i was going to bite him  miss .      neilette gave rincewind a peck on the cheek .      well  drop in whenever you   re passing     she said .      certainly will .     said rincewind .     i   ll look for the pubs with the mauve umbrellas outside  shall i .      neilette gave him a wave and darleen made an amusing gesture as they walked away  almost bumping into a group of men in white .  one of them shouted     hey  there he is   sorry  ladies           oh  hello  charley   ron       said rincewind  as the chefs bore down on him .      heard you wuzzas was leavin        said ron .     wouldn   t be fair to let you go without shaking you by the hand  charley said .         the peach nellie went down a treat     said charley  beaming broadly .      glad to hear it     said rincewind .     good to see you looking so cheerful .         it gets better .     said ron .     there   s a new soprano just been taken on and she   s a winner if i   m any judge and   no  charley  you tell him her name           germaine trifle     said charley .  a wider grin would have resulted in the top of his head slipping off .      i   m very happy for you     said rincewind .     start whipping that cream right now  y   hear .      ron patted him on the shoulder .     we could always do with another hand in the kitchens     he said .     just say the word  mate .         well  it   s very kind of you  and when i pull another tissue out of a box i   ll always remember you blokes at the opera house  but           there he is .      the gaoler and the captain of the guard were jogging along the quay .  the gaoler was waving encouragingly at him .      nah  nah  it   s all right  you don   t have to run .     he shouted .     we   ve got a pardon for you .         pardon .     said rincewind .      that   s right .     the gaoler reached him  and fought for breath .     signed   by   the prime minister     he managed .     says you   re a   good bloke and we   re not to   hang you       he straightened up .     mind you  we wouldn   t do that anyway  not now .  best bloody escape we   ve ever bloody had since tinhead ned .      rincewind looked down at the writing on the official lined prison notepaper .      oh .  good     he said weakly .     at least someone thinks i didn   t steal the damn thing .         oh  everyone knows you stole it     said the gaoler happily .     but after that escape  we ell   and that chase  eh .  bluey here says he   s never seen anyone run like you  and that   s a fact .      the guard punched rincewind playfully on the arm .     good on yer  mate     he said  grinning .     but we   ll catch yer next time .      rincewind looked blankly at the pardon .     you mean i   m getting this for being a good sport .         no worries .     said the gaoler .     and there   s a queue of farmers sayin    if you want to steal one of their sheep next time that   d be bonza  just so long as they get a verse in the ballad .      rincewind gave up .     what can i say .     he said .     you keep one of the best condemned cells i   ve ever stayed in  and i   ve been in a few .     he looked at the glow of admiration in their faces and decided that  since fortune had been kind  it was time to give something back .     er   i   d take it kindly  though  if you   d never ever redecorate that cell .         no worries .  here  i thought we ought to give you this     said the gaoler  handing him a little giftwrapped package .     got no use for it now  eh .      rincewind unwrapped the hempen rope .      i   m lost for words     he said .     how thoughtful .  i   m bound to find lots of uses for it .  and what   s this   sandwiches .         y   know that sticky brown stuff you made .  well  all the lads tried it and they all went    yukk    and then they all wanted some more  so we tried cooking up a batch     said the gaoler .     i was thinking of going into business .  you don   t mind  do you .         no worries .  be my guest .         good on yer .      someone else wandered up as he watched them hurry away .      i heard you were going back     said bill rincewind .     want to stay on here .  i had a word with your dean .  he gave you a bloody good reference .         did he .  what did he say .         he said if i could get you to do any work for me i   d be lucky     said bill .   rincewind looked around at the city  glistening under the rain .      it   s a nice offer     he said .     but   oh  i dunno   all this sun  sea  surf and sand wouldn   t be good for me .  thanks all the same .         you sure .         yes .      bill rincewind held out his hand .     no worries     he said .     i   ll send you a card at hogswatch  and some bit of clothing that doesn   t fit properly .  i   d better get back to the university now  i   ve got all the staff up on the roof mending the leaks        and that was it .   rincewind sat for a while watching the last of the passengers get aboard  and took a final look around the rain soaked harbor .  then he stood up .      come on  then     he said .   the luggage followed him up the gangplank  and they went home .      it rained .   the flood gurgled along ancient creek beds and overflowed  spreading out in a lacework of gullies and rivulets .   further rain ensued .   near the center of the last continent  where waterfalls streamed down the flanks of a great red rock that steamed with the heat of a ten thousand year summer  a small naked boy sat in the branches of a tree along with three bears  several possums  innumerable parrots and a camel .   apart from the rock  the world was a sea .   and someone was wading through it .  he was an old man  carrying a leather bag on his back .   he stopped  waist deep in swirling water  and looked up at the rain .   something was coming .  the clouds were twisting  spinning  leaving a silvery hole all the way up to the blue sky  and there was a sound that you might get if you took a roll of thunder and stretched it out thin .   a dot appeared  growing bigger .  the man raised a skinny arm and  suddenly  it was holding an oval of wood that trailed a cord  which hit his hand with a slap .   the rain stopped .   the last few drops hammered out a little rhythm that said  now we know where you are  we   ll be coming back     the boy laughed .   the old man looked up  caught sight of him  and grinned .  he tucked the bullroarer into the string around his waist and took up a boomerang painted in more colors than the boy had ever seen in one place together .   the man tossed it up and caught it a couple of times and then  glancing sideways to make sure his audience was watching him  he hurled it .   it rose into the sky and went on climbing  long past the point where any normal thing should have started to fall back .  it grew bigger  too .  the clouds parted to let it through .  and then it stopped  as if suddenly nailed to the sky .   like sheep which  having been driven to a pasture  can now spread out at their leisure  the clouds began to drift .  afternoon sunlight sliced through into the still waters .  the boomerang hung in the sky  and the boy thought he would have to find a new word for the way the colors glowed .   in the meantime  he looked down at the water and tried out the word he   d been taught by his grandfather  who   d been taught it by his grandfather  and which had been kept for thousands of years for when it would be needed .   it meant the smell after rain .   it had  he thought  been well worth waiting for .      much easier to discover than fire  and only slightly harder to discover than water .      not why is it anything .  just why it is .        a cross between a porter and a proctor .  a bledlow is not chosen for his imagination  because he usually doesn   t have any .      ankh morpork   s leading vet  generally called in by people faced with ailments too serious to be trusted to the general medical profession .  doughnut   s one blindspot was his tendency to assume that every patient was  to a greater or lesser extent  a racehorse .      in the case of cold fusion  this was longer than usual .      wizards are certain of the existence of the temporal gland  although not even the most invasive alchemist has ever found where it is located and current theory is that it has a non corporeal existence  like a sort of ethereal appendix .  it keeps track of how old your body is  and is so susceptible to the influence of a high magical field that it might even work in reverse  absorbing the body   s normal supplies of chrononine .  the alchemists say it is the key to immortality  but they say that about orange juice  crusty bread and drinking your own urine .  an alchemist would cut his own head off if he thought it   d make him live longer .      broadly speaking  the acceleration of a wizard through the ranks of wizardry by killing off more senior wizards .  it is a practice currently in abeyance  since a few enthusiastic attempts to remove mustrum ridcully resulted in one wizard being unable to hear properly for two weeks .  ridcully felt that there was indeed room at the top  and he was occupying all of it .      sometimes ponder thought his skill with hex was because hex was very clever and very stupid at the same time .  if you wanted it to understand something  you had to break the idea down into bite sized pieces and make absolutely sure there was no room for any misunderstanding .  the quiet hours with hex were often a picnic after five minutes with the senior wizards .      the lecturer in creative uncertainty  for example  held rather smugly that he was in a state of both in ness and out ness until such time as anyone knocked on his door and collapsed the field  and that it was impossible to be categorical before that event .  logic is a wonderful thing but doesn   t always beat actual thought .      wizards also enjoy a bit of fun but never have much of a chance to develop the appropriate vocabulary .      this isn   t magic .  it is a simple universal law .  people always expect to use a holiday in the sun as an opportunity to read those books they   ve always meant to read  but an alchemical combination of sun  quartz crystals and coconut oil will somehow metamorphose any improving book into a rather thicker one with a name containing at least one greek word or letter  the gamma imperative  the delta season  the alpha project and  in the more extreme cases  even the mu kau pi caper  .  sometimes a hammer and sickle turn up on the cover .  this is probably caused by sunspot activity  since they are invariably the wrong way round .  it   s just as well for the librarian that he sneezed when he did  or he might have ended up a thousand pages thick and crammed with weapons specifications .      the senior wrangler had once walked past mrs .  whitlow   s rooms when the door was open  and he   d caught sight of the bare  headless  armless dressmaker   s dummy that she used to make all her own clothes .  he   d had to go and lie down quietly after that and  ever since  had thought about mrs .  whitlow in a special way .      wizards lack the hw chromosome in their genes .  feminist researchers have isolated this as the one which allows people to see the washing up in the sinks before the life forms growing there have actually invented the wheel .  or discovered slood .      there   s a certain type of manager who is known by his call of    my door is always open    and it is probably a good idea to beat yourself to death with your own cv rather than work for him .  in ridcully   s case  however  he meant     my door is always open because then  when i   m bored  i can fire my crossbow right across the hall and into the target just above the bursar   s desk .         that is to say  she secretly considered them to be vicious  selfish and untrustworthy .        again  when people like mrs .  whitlow use this term they are not  for some inexplicable reason  trying to suggest that the subjects have a rich oral tradition  a complex system of tribal rights and a deep respect for the spirits of their ancestors .  they are implying the kind of behavior more generally associated  oddly enough  with people wearing a full suit of clothes  often with the same sort of insignia .      ponder had been that kind of child .  he still had all the pieces for every game he   d ever been given .  ponder had been the kind of boy who carefully reads the label on every hogswatch present before opening it and notes down in a small book who it is from  and has all the thank you letters written by teatime .  his parents had been impressed even then  realizing that they had given birth to a child who would achieve great things or  perhaps  be hunted down by a righteous citizenry by the time he was ten .      any seasoned traveler soon learns to avoid anything wished on them as a    regional specialty     because all the term means is that the dish is so unpleasant the people living everywhere else will bite off their own legs rather than eat it .  but hosts still press it upon distant guests anyway     go on  have the dog   s head stuffed with macerated cabbage and pork noses   it   s a regional specialty .         in fact it   s the view of the more thoughtful historians  particularly those who have spent time in the same bar as the theoretical physicists  that the entirety of human history can be considered as a sort of blooper reel .  all those wars  all those famines caused by malign stupidity  all that determined  mindless repetition of the same old errors  are in the great cosmic scheme of things only equivalent to mr .  spock   s ears falling off .      there is such a thing as an edible  nay delicious  meat pie floater  its mushy peas of just the right consistency  its tomato sauce piquant in its cheekiness  its pie filling tending even towards named parts of the animal .  there are platonic burgers made of beef instead of cow lips and hooves .  there are fish    n    chips where the fish is more than just a white goo lurking at the bottom of a batter casing and you can   t use the chips to shave with .  there are hot dog fillings which have more in common with meat than mere pinkness  whose lucky consumers don   t apply mustard because that would spoil the taste .  it   s just that people can be trained to prefer the other sort  and seek it out .  it   s as if machiavelli had written a cookery book .   even so  there is no excuse for putting pineapple on pizza .      this is why protesters against the wearing of animal skins by humans unaccountably fail to throw their paint over hell   s angels .      it would be nice to say that this experience taught ponder a valuable lesson and that he was a lot more considerate towards old people afterwards  and this was true for about five minutes .      although of course it   s not the most obvious thing and there are  in fact  some beguiling similarities  particularly the tendency to try to hide behind a big cloud of ink in difficult situations .        the one on the first floor  with the curious gravitational anomaly .       praise  the last continent      amusing   enjoyable   very clever   what pratchett seems to be doing  frequently  is commenting on the essential
