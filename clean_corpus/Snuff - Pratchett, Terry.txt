about the book   it is a truth universally acknowledged that a policeman taking a holiday would barely have had time to open his suitcase before he finds his first corpse .   and commander sam vimes of the ankh morpork city watch is on holiday in the pleasant and innocent countryside  but not for him a mere body in the wardrobe .  there are many  many bodies and an ancient crime more terrible than murder .   he is out of his jurisdiction  out of his depth  out of bacon sandwiches  and occasionally snookered and out of his mind  but never out of guile .  where there is a crime there must be a finding  there must be a chase and there must be a punishment .   they say that in the end all sins are forgiven .   but not quite all          contents   cover  about the book  title page  dedication  snuff  footnotes  epilogue  about the author  also by terry pratchett  copyright      for rob     for in between his days off .    for emma     for helping me understand goblins .    and for lyn     for always .       the goblin experience of the world is the cult or perhaps religion of unggue .  in short  it is a remarkably complex resurrection based religion founded on the sanctity of bodily secretions .  its central tenet runs as follows  everything that is expelled from a goblin   s body was clearly once part of them and should  therefore  be treated with reverence and stored properly so that it can be entombed with its owner in the fullness of time .  in the meantime the material is stored in unggue pots  remarkable creations of which i shall speak later .   a moment   s distasteful thought will tell us that this could not be achieved by any creature  unless in possession of great wealth  considerable storage space and compliant neighbours .   therefore  in reality  most goblins observe the unggue had     what one might term the common and lax form of unggue     which encompasses earwax  finger and toenail clippings  and snot .  water  generally speaking  is reckoned as not unggue  but something which goes through the body without ever being part of it  they reason that there is no apparent difference in the water before and after  as it were  which sadly shines a light on the freshness of the water they encounter in their underground lairs  .  similarly  faeces are considered to be food that has merely undergone a change of state .  surprisingly  teeth are of no interest to the goblins  who look on them as a type of fungus  and they appear to attach no importance to hair  of which  it has to be said  they seldom have very much .   at this point  lord vetinari  patrician of ankh morpork  stopped reading and stared at nothing .  after a few seconds  nothing was eclipsed by the form of drumknott  his secretary  who  it must be said  had spent a career turning himself into something as much like nothing as anything  .   drumknott said     you look pensive  my lord     to which observation he appended a most delicate question mark  which gradually evaporated .      awash with tears  drumknott  awash with tears .      drumknott stopped dusting the impeccably shiny black lacquered desk .     pastor oats is a very persuasive writer  isn   t he  sir      .         indeed he is  drumknott  but the basic problem remains and it is this  humanity may come to terms with the dwarf  the troll and even the orc  terrifying though all these may have proved to be at times  and you know why this is  drumknott .      the secretary carefully folded the duster he had been using and looked at the ceiling .     i would venture to suggest  my lord  that in their violence we recognize ourselves .         oh  well done  drumknott  i shall make a cynic of you yet .  predators respect other predators  do they not .  they may perhaps even respect the prey  the lion may lie down with the lamb  even if only the lion is likely to get up again  but the lion will not lie down with the rat .  vermin  drumknott  an entire race reduced to vermin .      lord vetinari shook his head sadly  and the ever attentive drumknott noticed that his lordship   s fingers had now gone back  for the third time that day  to the page headed    unggue pots    and he seemed  quite unusually  to be talking to himself as he did so         these are traditionally crafted by the goblin itself  out of anything from precious minerals to leather  wood or bone .  among the former are some of the finest eggshell thin containers ever found in the world .  the plundering of goblin settlements by treasure hunters in search of these  and the retaliation by the goblins themselves  has coloured human   goblin relationships even to the present day .      lord vetinari cleared his throat and continued     i quote pastor oats again  drumknott  i must say that goblins live on the edge  often because they have been driven there .  when nothing else can survive  they do .  their universal greeting is  apparently     hang     which means    survive    .  i know dreadful crimes have been laid at their door  but the world itself has never been kind to them .  let it be said here that those who live their lives where life hangs by less than a thread understand the dreadful algebra of necessity  which has no mercy  and when necessity presses in extremis  well  that is the time when the women need to make the unggue pot called    soul of tears     the most beautiful of all the pots  carved with little flowers and washed with tears .      drumknott  with meticulous timing  put a cup of coffee in front of his master just as lord vetinari finished the sentence and looked up .        the dreadful algebra of necessity     drumknott .  well  we know about that  don   t we .         indeed we do  sir .  incidentally  sir  we have received a missive from diamond king of trolls  thanking us for our firm stance on the drugs issue .  well done  sir .         hardly a concession     vetinari observed  waving it away .     you know my position  drumknott .  i have no particular objection to people taking substances that make them feel better or more contented  or  for that matter  see little dancing purple fairies     or even their god if it comes to that .  it   s their brain  after all  and society can have no claim on it  providing they   re not operating heavy machinery at the time .  however  to sell drugs to trolls that actually make their heads explode is simply murder  the capital crime .  i am glad to say that commander vimes fully agrees with me on this issue .         indeed  sir  and may i remind you that he will be leaving us very shortly .  do you intend to see him off  as it were .      the patrician shook his head .     i think not .  the man must be in terrible turmoil  and i fear that my presence might make things worse .      was there a hint of pity in drumknott   s voice when he said     don   t blame yourself  my lord .  after all  you and the commander are in the hands of a higher power .     .   his grace the duke of ankh  commander sir samuel vimes of the ankh morpork city watch  was feverishly pushing a pencil down the side of his boot in order to stop the itching .  it didn   t work .  it never did .  all his socks made his feet itch .  for the hundredth time he considered telling his wife that among her sterling qualities  and they were many  knitting did not feature .  but he would rather have chopped his foot off than do so .  it would break her heart .   they were dreadful socks  though  so thick  knotted and bulky that he had had to buy boots that were one and a half times bigger than his feet .  and he did this because samuel vimes  who had never gone into a place of worship with religious aforethought  worshipped lady sybil  and not a day went past without his being amazed that she seemed to do the same to him .  he had made her his wife and she had made him a millionaire  with her behind him the sad  desolate  penniless and cynical copper was a rich and powerful duke .  he   d managed to hold on to the cynical  however  and a brace of oxen on steroids would not have been able to pull the copper out of sam vimes  the poison was in too deep  wrapped around the spine .  and so sam vimes itched  and counted his blessings until he ran out of numbers .   among his curses was doing the paperwork .   there was always paperwork .  it is well known that any drive to reduce paperwork only results in extra paperwork .   of course  he had people to do the paperwork  but sooner or later he had  at the very least  to sign it and  if no way of escape presented itself  even read it .  there was no getting away from it  ultimately  in all police work  there was a definite possibility that the manure would hit the windmill .  the initials of sam vimes were required to be on the paper to inform the world that it was his windmill  and therefore his manure .   but now he stopped to call through the open door to sergeant littlebottom  who was acting as his orderly .      anything yet  cheery .     he said hopefully .      not in the way i think you mean  sir  but i think you   ll be pleased to hear that i   ve just had a clacks message from acting captain haddock down in quirm  sir .  he says he   s getting on fine  sir  and really enjoying the avec .       vimes sighed .     anything else .         dead as a doorknob  sir     said the dwarf  poking her head around the door .     it   s the heat  sir  it   s too hot to fight and too sticky to steal .  isn   t that wonderful  sir .      vimes grunted .     where there are policemen there   s crime  sergeant  remember that .         yes  i do  sir  although i think it sounds better with a little reordering of the words .         i suppose there   s no chance at all that i   ll be let off .      sergeant littlebottom looked concerned .     i   m sorry  sir  i think there   s no appeal .  officially captain carrot will relieve you of your badge at noon .      vimes thumped his desk and exploded .     i don   t deserve this treatment after a lifetime of dedication to the city .         commander  if i may say so  you deserve a lot more .      vimes leaned back in his chair and groaned .     you too  cheery .         i really am very sorry  sir .  i know this is hard for you .         to be forced out after all this time .  i begged  you know  and that doesn   t come easy to a man like me  you can be sure .  begged .      there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs .  cheery watched as vimes pulled a brown envelope out of his desk drawer  inserted something into it  licked it ferociously  sealed it with a spit and dropped it on his desk  where it clanged .     there     he said  through gritted teeth .     my badge  just like vetinari ordered .  i put it down .  it won   t be said they took it off me .      captain carrot stepped into the office  ducking briefly as he came through the door .  he had a package in his hand and several grinning coppers were clustered behind him .      sorry about this  sir  higher authority and all that .  if it   s any help i think you   ve been lucky to be let off with two weeks .  she was originally talking about a month .      he handed vimes the package and coughed .     me and the lads had a bit of a whip round  commander     he said with a forced grin .      i prefer something sensible like chief constable     said vimes  grabbing the package .     do you know  i reckoned that if i let them give me enough titles i   d eventually get one i could live with .      he tore open the package and pulled out a very small and colourful bucket and spade  to the general amusement of the surreptitious onlookers .      we know you   re not going to the seaside  sir     carrot began     but            i wish it was the seaside     vimes complained .     you get shipwrecks at the seaside  you get smugglers at the seaside and you get drownings and crime at the flaming seaside .  something interesting .         lady sybil says you   re bound to find lots to amuse yourself with  sir     said carrot .   vimes grunted .     the countryside .  what   s to amuse you in the countryside .  do you know why it   s called the countryside  carrot .  because there   s bloody nothing there except damn trees  which we   re supposed to make a fuss about  but really they   re just stiff weeds .  it   s dull .  it   s nothing but a long sunday .  and i   m going to have to meet nobby people .         sir  you   ll enjoy it .  i   ve never known you to take even a day off unless you were injured     said carrot .      and even then he worried and grumbled every moment     said a voice at the doorway .  it belonged to lady sybil vimes  and vimes found himself resenting the way his men deferred to her .  he loved lady sybil to distraction  of course  but he couldn   t help noticing how  these days  his bacon  lettuce and tomato sandwich was no longer  as it had been traditionally  bacon  tomato and lettuce but had become a lettuce  tomato and bacon sandwich .  it was all about health  of course .  it was a conspiracy .  why did they never find a vegetable that was bad for you  hey .  and what was so wrong with onion gravy anyway .  it had onions in it  didn   t it .  they made you fart  didn   t they .  that was good for you  wasn   t it .  he was sure he had read that somewhere .   two weeks    holiday with every meal overseen by his wife .  it didn   t bear thinking about  but he did anyway .  and then there was young sam  growing up like a weed and into everything .  a holiday in the fresh air would do him good  his mother said .  vimes hadn   t argued .  there was no point in arguing with sybil  because even if you thought that you   d won  it would turn out  by some magic unavailable to husbands  that you had  in fact  been totally misinformed .   at least he was allowed to leave the city wearing his armour .  it was part of him  and just as battered as he was  except that in the case of the armour the dents could be hammered out .   vimes  with his son on his knee  stared out at the departing city as the coach hurried him towards a fortnight of bucolic slumber .  he felt like a man banished .  but  to look on the bright side  there was bound to be some horrible murder or dreadful theft in the city which for the very important purposes of morale  if nothing else  would require the presence of the head of the watch .  he could but hope .   sam vimes had known ever since their marriage that his wife had a place out in the country .  one of the reasons he knew this was because she had given it to him .  in fact  she had transferred all the holdings of her family  said family consisting solely of her at that point  to him in the old fashioned but endearing belief that a husband should be the one doing the owning .   she had insisted .   periodically  according to the season  a cart had come from the country house all the way to their home in scoone avenue  ankh morpork  loaded with fruits and vegetables  cheeses and meats  all the produce of an estate that he   d never seen .  he wasn   t looking forward to seeing it now .  one thing he knew about the country was that it squelched underfoot .  admittedly most of the streets of ankh morpork squelched underfoot  but  well  that was the right kind of squelch and a squelch that he had squelched ever since he could walk and  inevitably  slip .   the place was officially called crundells  although it was always referred to as ramkin hall .  apparently it had a mile of trout stream and  vimes seemed to recall from the deeds  a pub .  vimes knew how you could own a pub but he wondered how you could own a trout stream because  if that was your bit  it had already gurgled off downstream while you were watching it  yes .  that meant somebody else was now fishing in your water  the bastard .  and the bit in front of you now had recently belonged to the bloke upstream  that bloated plutocrat of a fat neighbour now probably considered you some kind of poacher  that other bastard .  and the fish swam everywhere  didn   t they .  how did you know which ones were yours .  perhaps they were branded     that sounded very countryside to vimes .  to be in the countryside you had to be permanently on the defensive  quite the opposite of the city .           uncharacteristically for him  lord vetinari laughed out loud .  he very nearly gloated at the downfall of his enemy and slammed his copy of the ankh morpork times  open at the crossword page  on to his desk .     cucumiform  shaped like a cucumber or a variety of squash .  i thumb my nose at you  madam .      drumknott  who was carefully arranging paperwork  smiled and said     another triumph  my lord .     vetinari   s battle with the chief crossword compiler of the ankh morpork times was well known .      i am sure she is losing her grip     said vetinari  leaning back in his chair .     what is it that you have there  drumknott .     he pointed at a bulky brown envelope .      commander vimes   s badge  sir  as delivered to me by captain carrot .         sealed .         yes  sir .         then it doesn   t have vimes   s badge in it .         no  sir .  a careful fingertip examination of the envelope suggests that it contains an empty tin of double thunder snuff .  a conclusion confirmed by a casual sniff  my lord .      a still ebullient vetinari said     but the captain must have realized this  drumknott .         yes  sir .         of course  that would be in the nature of the commander     said vetinari     and would we have him any other way .  he has won a little battle and a man who can win little battles is well set up to win big ones .      unusually  drumknott hesitated a little before saying     yes  sir .  apropos of that  it was lady sybil who suggested the trip to the countryside  was it not .      vetinari raised an eyebrow .     why yes  of course  drumknott .  i can   t imagine who would propose otherwise .  the brave commander is well known for his dedication to his work .  who else but his loving wife could possibly persuade him that a few weeks of jolly holiday in the countryside would be a good thing .         who indeed  sir     said drumknott  and left it at that  because there was no point in doing anything else .  his master appeared to have sources of information unavailable even to drumknott  however hard he tried  and only the heavens knew who all those were who scuttled in darkness up the long stairs .  and thus life in the oblong office was a world of secrets and considerations and misdirections  where the nature of truth changed like the colours of the rainbow .  he knew this because he played a not insignificant role in the spectrum .  but to know what lord vetinari knew and exactly what lord vetinari thought would be a psychological impossibility  and a wise man would accept that and get on with his filing .   vetinari stood up and stared out of the window .     this is a city of beggars and thieves  drumknott  is it not .  i pride myself that we have some of the most skilled .  in fact  if there were such a thing as an inter city thieving contest  ankh morpork would bring home the trophy and probably everyone   s wallets .  theft has a purpose  drumknott  but one intrinsically feels that while there are things by nature unavailable to the common man  there are also things not to be allowed to the rich and powerful .      drumknott   s understanding of his master   s thought processes would appear to an outsider to be magical  but it was amazing what could be gleaned by watching what lord vetinari was reading  listening to apparently pointless observations and integrating those  as only drumknott could integrate  into current problems and concerns .  he said     is this now about the smuggling  sir .         quite so  quite so .  i have no problem with smuggling .  it involves the qualities of enterprise  stealth and original thinking .  attributes to be encouraged in the common man .  in truth  it doesn   t do that much harm and allows the man in the street a little frisson of enjoyment .  everyone should occasionally break the law in some small and delightful way  drumknott .  it   s good for the hygiene of the brain .      drumknott  whose cranial cleanness could never be in dispute  said     nevertheless  sir  taxes must be levied and paid .  the city is growing .  all of this must be paid for .         indeed     said vetinari .     i could have taxed all kinds of things  but i have decided to tax something that you could eminently do without .  it   s hardly addictive  is it .         some people tend to think so .  there is a certain amount of grumbling  sir .      vetinari did not look up from his paperwork .     drumknott     he said .     life is addictive .  if people complain overmuch  i think i will have to draw that fact to their attention .      the patrician smiled again and steepled his fingers .     in short  drumknott  a certain amount of harmless banditry amongst the lower classes is to be smiled upon if not actively encouraged  for the health of the city  but what should we do when the highborn and wealthy take to crime .  indeed  if a poor man will spend a year in prison for stealing out of hunger  how high would the gallows need to be to hang the rich man who breaks the law out of greed .         i would like to reiterate  sir  that i buy all my own paperclips     said drumknott urgently .      of course  but in your case i am pleased to say that you have a brain so pristine that it sparkles .         i keep the receipts  sir     drumknott insisted     just in case you wish to see them .     there was silence for a moment  then he continued .     commander vimes should be well on his way to the hall by now  my lord .  that might prove a fortunate circumstance .      vetinari   s face was blank .     yes indeed  drumknott  yes indeed .      the hall had been a full day   s journey  which in coaching terms really meant two  with a stay at an inn .  vimes spent the time listening for the sound of overtaking horsemen from the city bringing much to be desired news of dire catastrophe .  usually ankh morpork could supply this on an almost hourly basis but now it was singularly failing to deliver its desperate son in his hour of vegetation .   the other sun was setting on this particular son when the coach pulled up outside a pair of gates .  after a second or two  an elderly man  an extremely elderly man  appeared from nowhere and made a great show of opening said gates  then stood to attention as the coach went through  beaming in the knowledge of a job well done .  once inside  the coach stopped .   sybil  who had been reading  nudged her husband without looking up from her book and said     it   s customary to give mister coffin a penny .  in the old days my grandfather kept a little charcoal brazier in the coach  you know  in theory to keep warm but mostly to heat up pennies to red heat before picking them up in some tongs and tossing them out for the gatekeeper to catch .  apparently everybody enjoyed it  or so my grandfather said  but we don   t do that any more .      vimes fumbled in his purse for some small change  opened the carriage door and stepped down  much to the shock of the aforesaid mr coffin  who backed away into the thick undergrowth  watching vimes like a cornered animal .      nice job  mister coffin  very good lifting of the latch there  excellent work .     vimes proffered the coin and mr coffin backed further away  his stance suggesting that he was going to bolt at any moment .  vimes flicked the coin in the air and the fearful man caught it  deftly spat on it and melted back into the scenery .  vimes got the impression that he resented the lack of hiss .      how long ago did your family stop throwing hot money at the servants .     he said  settling back into his seat as the coach progressed .   sybil laid aside her book .     my father put a stop to it .  my mother complained .  so did the gatekeepers .         i should think so .         no  sam  they complained when the custom was stopped .         but it   s demeaning .      sybil sighed .     yes  i know  sam  but it was also free money  you see .  in my great grandfather   s day  if things were busy  a man might make sixpence in a day .  and since the old boy was almost permanently sozzled on rum and brandy he quite often threw out a dollar .  one of the real old fashioned solid gold dollars  i mean .  a man could live quite well for a year on one of those  especially out here .         yes  but       vimes began  but his wife silenced him with a smile .  she had a special smile for these occasions  it was warm and friendly and carved out of rock .  you had to stop discussing politics or you would run right into it  causing no damage to anything but yourself .  wisely  with a wisdom that had been well learned  sam vimes restricted himself to staring out of the window .   with the gate far behind he kept looking  in the fading light  to see the big house that was apparently at the centre of all this  and couldn   t find it until they had rattled along an avenue of trees  past what some wretched poet would have had to call    verdant pastures    dotted with almost certainly  vimes considered  sheep  through manicured woodland  and then reached a bridge that would not have been out of place back in the city .   the bridge spanned what vimes first thought was an ornamental lake but turned out to be a very wide river  even as they trundled over it  in dignified splendour  vimes saw a large boat travelling along it by some means unknown  but which  to judge from the smell as it went past  must have something to do with cattle .  at this point young sam said     those ladies haven   t got any clothes on .  are they going to have a swim .      vimes nodded absently because the whole area of naked ladies was not something you wanted to discuss with a six year old boy .  in any case  his attention was still on the boat  white water churned all around it and the seamen on the deck made what was possibly a nautical gesture to lady sybil or  quite possibly  one of the naked ladies .      that is a river  isn   t it .     said vimes .      it   s the quire     said lady sybil .     it drains most of the octarine grass country and comes out in quirm .  if i recall correctly  however  most people call it    old treachery    .  it has moods  but i used to enjoy those little riverboats when i was a child .  they really were rather jolly .      the coach rumbled down the far end of the bridge and up a long drive to  yes  the stately home  presumably so called  vimes thought  because it was about the size of the average state .  there was a herd of deer on the lawn  and a big herd of people clustered around what was obviously the front door .  they were shuffling into two lines  as though they were a wedding party .  they were  in fact  some kind of guard of honour  and there must have been more than three hundred there  from gardeners through to footmen  all trying to smile and not succeeding very well .  it reminded vimes of a watch parade .   two footmen collided while endeavouring to place a step by the coach  and vimes totally spoiled the moment by getting out of the opposite door and swinging lady sybil down after him .   in the middle of the throng of nervous people was a friendly face  and it belonged to willikins  vimes   s butler and general manservant from the city .  vimes had been adamant about that  at least .  if he was going to the countryside  then he would have willikins there .  he pointed out to his wife that willikins was definitely not a policeman  and so it was not the same as bringing your work home .  and that was true .  willikins was definitely not a policeman  because most policemen don   t know how to glass up somebody with a broken bottle without hurting their hands or how to make weapons of limited but specific destruction out of common kitchen utensils .  willikins had a history that showed up when he had to carve the turkey .  and now young sam  seeing his scarred but familiar smile  ran up through the row of hesitant employees to cuddle the butler at the knees .  for his part  willikins turned young sam upside down and spun him around before gently putting him back on the gravel  the whole process being a matter of huge entertainment to a boy of six .  vimes trusted willikins .  he didn   t trust many people .  too many years as a copper made you rather discriminating in that respect .   he leaned towards his wife .     what do i do now .     he whispered  because the ranks of worried half smiles were unnerving him .      whatever you like  dear     she said .     you   re the boss .  you take watch parade  don   t you .         yes  but i know who everyone is and their rank and  well  everything .  it   s never been like this in the city .         yes  dear  that   s because in ankh morpork everybody knows commander vimes .      well  how hard could it be .  vimes walked up to a man with a battered straw hat  a spade and  as vimes neared  a state of subdued terror even worse than that of sam vimes himself .  vimes held out his hand .  the man looked at it as if he had never seen a hand before .  vimes managed to say     hello  i   m sam vimes .  who are you .      the man thus addressed looked around for help  support and guidance or escape  but there was none  the crowd was deathly silent .  he said     william butler  your grace  if it   s all the same to you .         pleased to meet you  william     said vimes  and held out his hand again  which william almost leaned away from before offering vimes a palm the texture of an ancient leather glove .   well  thought vimes  this isn   t too bad  and he ventured into unknown territory with     and what   s your job around here  william .         gardener     william managed  and held up his spade between himself and vimes  both as a protection and as exhibit    a     proof positive of his bona fides .  since vimes himself was equally at sea  he settled for testing the blade with his finger and mumbling     properly maintained  i see .  well done  mister butler .      he jumped when there was a tap on his shoulder and his wife said     well done yourself  dear  but all you really needed to do is go up the steps and congratulate the butler and the housekeeper on the wonderful turnout of the staff .  we   ll be here all day if you want to chat to everybody .     and with that  lady sybil took her husband firmly by the hand and led him up the steps between the rows of owlish stares .      all right     he whispered     i can see the footmen and the cooks and gardeners  but who are those blokes in the thick jackets and the bowler hats .  have we got the bailiffs in .         that is reasonably unlikely  dear .  in fact  they are some of the gamekeepers .         the hats look wrong on them .         do you think so .  as a matter of fact they were designed by lord bowler to protect his gamekeepers from vicious attacks by poachers .  deceptively strong  i   m told  and much better than steel helmets because you don   t get the nasty ringing in your ears .      clearly unable to hide their displeasure that their new master had chosen to shake the hand of a gardener before addressing either of them  the butler and housekeeper  who shared the traditional girth and pinkness that vimes had learned to expect on these occasions  were aware that their master had not come to them and  he noticed  were coming to him as fast as their little legs would carry them .   vimes knew about life below stairs  hell  yes  he did .  not so long ago a policeman summoned to a big house would be sent round to the back door to be instructed to drag away some weeping chambermaid or not very bright boot boy accused without evidence of stealing some ring or silver handled brush that the lady of the house would probably find later  perhaps when she had finished the gin .  that wasn   t supposed to be what coppers were for  although in reality of course it was what coppers were for .  it was about privilege  and young vimes had hardly worn in his first pair of policeman   s boots when his sergeant had explained what that meant .  it meant private law .  in those days an influential man could get away with quite a lot if he had the right accent  the right crest on his tie or the right chums  and a young policeman who objected might get away without a job and without a reference .   it wasn   t like that now  not even close .   but in those days young vimes had seen butlers as double traitors to both sides and so the large man in the black tailcoat got a glare that skewered him .  the fact that he gave vimes a little nod did not help matters .  vimes lived in a world where people saluted .      i am silver  the butler  your grace     the man carefully intoned reprovingly .   vimes immediately grabbed him by the hand and shook it warmly .     pleased to meet you  mister silver .      the butler winced .     it   s silver  sir  not mister .         sorry about that  mister silver .  so what   s your first name .      the butler   s face was an entertainment .     silver  sir .  always silver .         well  mister silver     said vimes     it   s an item of faith with me that once you get past the trousers all men are the same .      the butler   s face was wooden as he said     that is as maybe  sir  but i am and always will be  commander  silver .  good evening  your grace     the butler turned     and good evening  lady sybil .  it must be seven or eight years since anyone from the family came to stay .  may we look forward to further visits .  and might i please introduce to you my wife  mrs silver  the housekeeper  whom i think you have not met before .      vimes could not stop his mind translating the little speech as  i am annoyed that you ignored me to shake hands with the gardener     which  to be fair  was not deliberate .  vimes had shaken the gardener   s hand out of sheer  overpowering terror .  the translation continued  and now i am worried that we might not be having such an easy life in the near future .      hold on a minute     said vimes     my wife is a grace as well  you know  that   s a bit more than a lady .  syb   her grace made me look at the score chart .      lady sybil knew her husband in the way people living next door to a volcano get to know the moods of their neighbour .  the important thing is to avoid the bang .      sam  i have been lady sybil to all the servants in both our houses ever since i was a girl  and so i regard lady sybil as my name  at least among people i have come to look on as friends .  you know that .     and  she added to herself  we all have our little quirks  sam  even you .   and with that scented admonition floating in the air  lady sybil shook the housekeeper   s hand  and then turned to her son .     now it   s bed for you  young sam  straight after supper .  and no arguing .      vimes looked around as the little party stepped into the entrance hall which was to all intents and purposes an armoury .  it would always be an armoury in the eyes of any policeman  although undoubtedly  to the ramkins who had put the swords  halberds  cutlasses  maces  pikes and shields on every wall  the assemblage was no more than a bit of historical furniture .  in the middle of it all was the enormous ramkin coat of arms .  vimes already knew what the motto said     what we have we keep    .  you could call it     a hint .   soon afterwards lady sybil was busily engaged in the huge laundry and ironing room with purity the maid  whom vimes had insisted she take on after the birth of young sam  and who  both he and his wife believed  had an understanding with willikins  although exactly what it was they understood remained a speculation .  the two women were engrossed in the feminine pastime of taking clothes out of some things  and putting them into other things .  this could go on for a long time  and included the ceremony of holding some things up to the light and giving a sad little sigh .   in the absence of anything else to do  vimes headed back out to the magnificent flight of steps  where he lit a cigar .  sybil was adamant about no smoking in the house .  a voice behind him said     you don   t need to do that  sir .  the hall has a rather good smoking room  including a clockwork air extractor  which is very posh  sir  believe me  you don   t often see them .     vimes let willikins lead the way .   it was a pretty good smoking room  thought vimes  although his first hand experience of them was admittedly limited .  the room included a large snooker table and  down below  a cellar with more alcohol than any reformed alcoholic should ever see .      we did tell them i don   t drink  didn   t we  willikins .         oh yes  sir .  silver said that generally the hall finds it appropriate     i think his words were     to keep the cellar full in case of arrivals .         well  it seems to me to be a shame to pass up the opportunity  willikins  so be my guest and pour yourself a drink .      willikins perceptibly recoiled .     oh no  sir  i couldn   t possibly do that  sir .         why not  man .         it   s just not done  sir .  i would be the laughing stock of the league of gentlemen   s gentlemen if i was so impertinent as to have a drink with my employer .  it would be getting ideas above my station  sir .      this offended vimes to his shakily egalitarian core .   he said     i know your station  willikins  and it   s about the same station as mine when the chips are down and the wounds have healed .         look  sir     said willikins  almost pleading .     just occasionally we have to follow some rules .  so on this occasion i won   t drink with you  it not being hogswatch or the birth of an heir  which are accounted for under the rules  but instead i   ll follow the acceptable alternative  which is to wait until you   ve gone to bed and drink half the bottle .      well  thought vimes  we all have our funny little ways  although some of willikins    would not be funny if he was angry with you in a dark alley  but he brightened as he watched willikins rummage through a well stocked cocktail cabinet  meticulously dropping items into a glass shaker .    it should not be possible to achieve the effect of alcohol in a drink without including alcohol  but among the skills that willikins had learned  or possibly stolen  over the years was the ability to mix out of common household ingredients a totally soft drink that nevertheless had very nearly everything you wanted in alcohol .  tabasco  cucumber  ginger and chilli were all in there somewhere and beyond that it was best not to ask too many questions .   drink gloriously in hand  vimes leaned back and said     staff okay  willikins .      willikins lowered his voice .     oh  they   re skimming stuff off the top  sir  but nothing more than usual in my experience .  everyone sneaks something  it   s the perk of the job and the way of the world .      vimes smiled at willikins    almost theatrically wooden expression and said loudly for the hidden listener     a conscientious man  then  is he  silver .  i   m very glad to hear it .         seems like a steady one to me  sir     said the manservant  rolling his eyes towards heaven and pointing a finger to a small grille in the wall  the inlet to the fabled extractor  which no doubt needed a man behind the scenes to wind the clockwork  and would any butler worth his bulging stomach forgo an opportunity to keep tabs on what the new master was thinking .  would he hell .   it was perks  wasn   t it .  of course people here would be on the take .  you didn   t need evidence .  it was human nature .  he had constantly suggested to sybil     he wouldn   t have dared insist     that the place be closed down and sold to somebody who really wanted to live in what he had heard was a creaking  freezing pile that could have housed a regiment .  she would not hear of it .  she had warm childhood memories of the place  she said  of climbing trees and swimming and fishing in the river  and picking flowers and helping the gardeners and similar jolly rural enterprises that were  to vimes  as remote as the moon  given that his adolescent preoccupations had had everything to do with just staying alive .  you could fish in the river ankh  provided you took care not to catch anything .  in fact it was amazing what you could catch by just letting one drop of the ankh pass your lips .  and as for picnicking  well  in ankh morpork when you were a kid sometimes you nicked and sometimes you picked  mostly at scabs .   it had been a long day and last night   s sleep in the inn had not been salubrious or restful  but before he got into the huge bed vimes opened a window and stared out at the night .  the wind was murmuring in the trees  vimes mildly disapproved of trees  but sybil liked them and that was that .  things that he didn   t care to know about rustled  whooped  gibbered and went inexplicably crazy in the darkness outside .  he didn   t know what they were and hoped never to find out .  what kind of noise was this for a man to go to sleep to .   he joined his wife in the bed  thrashing around for some time before he found her  and settled down .  she had instructed him to leave the window open to get some allegedly glorious fresh air  and vimes lay there miserably  straining his ears for the reassuring noises of a drunk going home  or arguing with the sedan chair owner about the vomit on the cushions  and the occasional street fight  domestic disturbance or even piercing scream  all punctuated at intervals by the chiming of the city clocks  no two of which  famously  ever agreed  and the more subtle sounds  like the rumble of the honey wagons as harry king   s night soil collectors went about the business of business .  and best of all was the cry of the night watchman at the end of the street  twelve o   clock and all is well .  it wasn   t so long ago that any man trying this would have had his bell  helmet and quite probably his boots stolen before the echoes had died away .  but not any more .  no  indeedy .  this was the modern watch  vimes   s watch  and anyone who challenged the watchman on his rounds with malice aforethought would hear the whistle blow and very quickly learn that if anybody was going to be kicked around on the street  it wasn   t going to be a watchman .  the duty watchmen always made a point of shouting the hour with theatrical clarity and amazing precision outside number one scoone avenue  so that the commander would hear it .  now  vimes stuck his head under an enormous pillow and tried not to hear the tremendous and disturbing lack of noise whose absence could wake a man up when he had learned to ignore a carefully timed sound every night for years .   but at five o   clock in the morning mother nature pressed a button and the world went mad  every blessed bird and animal and  by the sound of it  alligator vied with all the others to make itself heard .  the cacophony took some time to get through to vimes .  the giant bed at least had an almost inexhaustible supply of pillows .  vimes was a great fan of pillows when away from his own bed .  not for him one or even two sad little bags of feathers as an afterthought to the bed     no .  he liked pillows to burrow into and turn into some kind of soft fortress  leaving one hole for the oxygen supply .   the awful racket was dying down by the time he drifted up to the linen surface .  oh yes  he recalled  that was another bloody thing about the country .  it started too damn early .  the commander was  by custom  necessity and inclination  a night time man  sometimes even an all night man  alien to him was the concept of two seven o   clocks in one day .  on the other hand  he could smell bacon  and a moment later two nervous young ladies entered the room carrying trays on complex metallic things which  unfolded  made it almost but not totally impossible to sit up and eat the breakfast they contained .   vimes blinked .  things were looking up .  usually sybil considered it her wifely duty to see to it that her husband lived for ever  and was convinced that this happy state of affairs could be achieved by feeding him bowel scouring nuts and grains and yoghurt  which to vimes   s mind was a type of cheese that wasn   t trying hard enough .  then there was the sad adulteration of his mid morning bacon  lettuce and tomato snack .  it was amazing but true that in this matter the watchmen were prepared to obey the boss   s wife to the letter and  if the boss yelled and stamped  which was perfectly understandable  nay forgivable  when a man was forbidden his mid morning lump of charred pig  would refer him to the instructions given to them by his wife  in the certain knowledge that all threats of sacking were hollow and if carried out would be immediately rescinded .   now sybil appeared among the pillows and said     you   re on holiday  dear .     what you could eat on holiday also included two fried eggs  just as he liked them  and a sausage     but not  unfortunately  the fried slice  which even on holiday was apparently still a sin .  the coffee  however  was thick  black and sweet .      you slept very well     said sybil  as vimes stared at the unexpected largesse .   he said     no  i didn   t  dear  not a wink  i assure you .         sam  you were snoring all night .  i heard you .      vimes   s grasp of successful husbandry prevented him from making any further comment except     really .  was i  dear .  oh  i am sorry .      sybil leafed through a small pile of pastel envelopes that had been inserted into her breakfast tray .     well  the news has got around     she said .     the duchess of keepsake has invited us to a ball  sir henry and lady withering have invited us to a ball  and lord and lady hangfinger have invited us to  yes  a ball .         well     said vimes     that   s a lot of           don   t you dare  sam .     his wife warned and vimes finished lamely         invitations .  you know i don   t dance  dear  i just shuffle about and tread on your feet .         well  it   s mainly for the young people  you see .  people come for the therapeutic baths at ham on rye  just down the road .  really  it   s all about getting the daughters married to suitable gentlemen  and that means balls  almost continuous balls .         i can manage a waltz     said vimes     that   s just a matter of counting  but you know i can   t stand all those jumping about ones like strip the widow and the gay gordon .         don   t worry  sam .  most of the older men find a place to sit and smoke or take snuff .  the mothers do the work of finding the eligible bachelors for their daughters .  i just hope that my friend ariadne will find suitable husbands for her girls .  she had sextuplets  very rare  you know .  of course  young mavis is very devout  and there is invariably a young clergyman looking for a wife and  above all  a dowry .  and emily is petite  blonde  an excellent cook but rather conscious of her enormous bosom .      vimes stared at the ceiling .     i suspect that not only will she find a husband     he forecast     a husband will find her .  call it a man   s intuition .         and then there   s fleur     said lady sybil  not rising to the bait .     she makes quite nice little bonnets  so i understand .  and  er  amanda  i think .  apparently quite interested in frogs  although i fear i may have misheard her mother .     she thought for a moment and added     oh  and then there   s jane .  rather a strange girl  according to her mother  who doesn   t seem to know what to make of her .      vimes   s lack of interest in other people   s children was limitless  but he could count .     and the last one .         oh  hermione  she may be difficult as she has rather scandalized the family  at least in their opinion .         how .         she   s a lumberjack .      vimes thought for a moment and said     well  dear  it is a truth universally acknowledged that a man with a lot of wood must be in want of a wife who can handle a great big        lady sybil interrupted sharply     sam vimes  i believe that you intend to make an indelicate remark .         i think you got there before me     said vimes  grinning .     you generally do  dear  admit it .         you may be right  dear     she said     but that is only to forestall you from saying it aloud .  after all  you are the duke of ankh and widely regarded as lord vetinari   s right hand man  and that means a certain amount of decorum would be advisable  don   t you think .      to a bachelor this would have appeared to be gentle advice  to an experienced husband it was a command  all the more powerful because it was made delicately .   so  when sir samuel vimes and commander vimes and his grace the duke of ankh  walked out after breakfast  they were all on their best behaviour .  as it turned out  other people weren   t .   there was a maid sweeping in the corridor outside the bedroom who took one frantic look at vimes as he strolled towards her and turned her back on him  and remained staring fixedly at the wall .  she appeared to be trembling with fear  and vimes had learned that in these circumstances the last thing any man should do is ask a question or  above all  offer to lend a helping hand .  screaming could result .  she was probably just shy  he told himself .   but it seemed that shyness was catching  there were maids carrying trays or dusting or sweeping as he walked down through the building  and every time he came near one she turned her back crisply and stood staring at the wall as if her life depended on it .   by the time he reached a long gallery lined with his wife   s ancestors  vimes had had enough  and when a young lady carrying a tea tray spun around like the dancer on the top of a musical box he said     excuse me  miss  am i as ugly as all that .     well  that was surely better than asking her why she was so rude  wasn   t it .  so why in the name of any three gods did she start to run away  crockery rattling as she headed down the hall .  among the various vimeses it was the commander who took over  the duke would be too forbidding and the blackboard monitor just wouldn   t do the trick .     stop where you are .  put down your tray and turn round slowly .      she skidded  she actually skidded and  turning with perfect grace while still clutching the tray  slowed gently to a stop  where she stood shaking with anxiety as vimes caught up with her and said     what   s your name  miss .      she answered while keeping her face turned away .     hodges  your grace  i   m very sorry  your grace .     the crockery was still rattling .      look     said vimes     i can   t think with all that rattling going on .  just put it down carefully  will you .  nothing bad is going to happen to you  but i   d like to see who i   m talking to  thank you very much .     the face turned reluctantly towards him .      there     he said .     miss  er  hodges  what is the matter .  you don   t have to run away from me  surely .         please  sir     and with that the girl headed for the nearest green baize door and vanished through it .  it was at this point that vimes realized there was another maid only a little way behind him  practically camouflaged by her dark uniform and facing the wall and  indeed  trembling .  she was surely a witness to all that had happened  so he walked carefully towards her and said     i don   t want you to say anything .  just nod or shake your head when i ask you a question .  do you understand .     there was a barely perceptible nod .     good  we make progress .  will you get into trouble if you say anything to me .      another microscopic nod .      and is it likely that you   ll get into trouble because i   ve talked to you .     the maid  rather inventively  gave a shrug .      and the other girl .     still with her back to him  the unseen girl stuck out her left hand with the thumb emphatically turned down .      thank you     said vimes to the invisible informant .     you   ve been very helpful .      he walked thoughtfully back upstairs  through an avenue of turned backs  and was thankful to encounter willikins in the laundry on the way .  the batman did not turn his back on vimes  which was a relief .    he was folding shirts with the care and attention he might otherwise have marshalled for the neat cutting off of a defeated opponent   s ear .  when the cuffs of his own spotlessly clean jacket slid up a little you could just see part of the tattoos on his arms but not  fortunately  spell out anything they said .  vimes said     willikins  what are the whirling housemaids all about .      willikins smiled .     old custom  sir .  a reason to it  of course     there often is if it sounds bloody stupid .  no offence  commander  but knowing you i   d suggest that you let twirling housemaids spin until you have got the lie of the land  as it were .  besides  her ladyship and young sam are in the nursery .      a few minutes later vimes  after a certain amount of trial and error  walked into what was  in a musty kind of way  a paradise .   vimes had never had much in the way of relatives .  not many people are anxious to let it be known that their distant ancestor was a regicide .  all that  of course  was history and it amazed the new duke of ankh that the history books now lauded the memory of old stoneface  the watchman who executed the evil bastard on the throne and had suddenly struck a blow for freedom and law .  history is what you make it  he had learned  and lord vetinari was a man with access to and the keys of a whole range of persuasive mechanisms left over  as luck would have it  from the regicide days and currently still well oiled in the cellar .  history is  indeed  what you make it and lord vetinari could make it     anything he wanted .  and thus the dreadful killer of kings was miraculously gone     never been there  you must be mistaken  never heard of him  no such person     and replaced with the heroic  if tragically misunderstood  slayer of tyrants stoneface vimes  the famous ancestor of the highly respected his grace the duke of ankh  commander sir samuel vimes .  history was a wonderful thing  it moved like the sea and vimes was taken at the flood .   vimes   s family had lived a generation at a time .  there had never been heirlooms  family jewels  embroidered samplers stitched by a long dead aunt  no interesting old urns found in granny   s attic which you hoped the bright young man who knew all about antiques would tell you was worth a thousand dollars so that you could burst with smugness .  and there was absolutely no money  only a certain amount of unpaid debt .  but here in the playroom  neatly stacked  were generations of toys and games  some of them a little worn from long usage  particularly the rocking horse  which was practically life size and had a real leather saddle with trappings made from  vimes discovered to his incredulity by rubbing them with a finger  genuine silver .  there was also a fort  big enough for a kid to stand in and defend  and a variety of child sized siege weapons to assault it  possibly with the help of boxes and boxes of lead soldiers  all painted in the correct regimental colours and in fine detail .  for two pins vimes would have got down on hands and knees and played with them there and then .  there were model yachts  and a teddy bear so big that for one horrible moment vimes wondered whether it was a real one  stuffed  there were catapults and boomerangs and gliders     and in the middle of all this  young sam stood paralysed  almost in tears with the knowledge that no matter how hard he tried he just couldn   t play with everything all at once .  it was a far cry from the vimes childhood  and playing poo sticks with real poo .   while the apple of their eyes tentatively straddled the rocking horse  which had frighteningly big teeth  vimes told his wife about the objectionable spinning housemaids .  she simply shrugged  and said     it   s what they do  dear .  it   s what they   re used to .         how can you say that .  it   s so demeaning .      lady sybil had developed a totally calm and understanding tone of voice when dealing with her husband .     that   s because  technically speaking  they are demeaned .  they spend a lot of time serving people who are a lot more important than they are .  and you are right at the top of the list  dear .         but i don   t think i   m more important than them .     vimes snapped .      i think i know what you   re saying  and it does you credit  it really does     said sybil     but what you actually said was nonsense .  you are a duke  a commander of the city watch and        she paused .      a blackboard monitor     said vimes automatically .      yes  sam  the highest honour that the king of the dwarfs can bestow .     sybil   s eyes glittered .     blackboard monitor vimes  one who can erase the writings  somebody who can rub out what is there .  that   s you  sam  and if you were killed the chanceries of the world would be in uproar and  sam  regrettably they would not be perturbed at the death of a housemaid .     she held up a hand because he   d opened his mouth and added     i know you would be  sam  but wonderful girls though i   m sure they are  i fear that if they were to die a family and  perhaps  a young man would be inconsolable  and the rest of the world would never know .  and you  sam  know that this is true .  however  if you were ever murdered  dread the thought and indeed i do every time you go out on duty  not only ankh morpork but the world would hear about it instantly .  wars might start and i suspect that vetinari   s position might become a little dangerous .  you are more important than girls in service .  you are more important than anybody else in the watch .  you are mistaking value for worth  i think .     she gave his worried face a brief kiss .     whatever you think you once were  sam vimes  you   ve risen  and you deserved to rise .  you know the cream rises to the top .         so does the scum     said vimes automatically  although he immediately regretted it .      how dare you say that  sam vimes .  you may have been a diamond in the rough  but you   ve polished yourself up .  and however you cut it  husband of mine  although you are no longer a man of the people  it certainly seems to me that you are a man for the people  and i think the people are far better off for that  d   you hear .      young sam looked up adoringly at his father  while the rocking horse rocked into a gallop .  between son and spouse  vimes never had a chance .  he looked so crestfallen that lady sybil  as wives do  tried a little consolation .      after all  sam  you expect your men to get on with their duties  don   t you .  likewise the housekeeper expects the girls to get on with theirs .         that   s quite different  really it is .  coppers watch people  and i   ve never told them that they can   t pass the time of day with somebody .  after all  that somebody might provide useful information .     vimes knew that this was technically true  but anybody who was seen giving anything more useful than the time of day to a policeman in most streets of the city would soon find a straw would be necessary to help him eat his meals .  but the analogy was right  anyway  he thought  or would have thought  had he been a man to whom the word analogy came easily .  just because you were a member of somebody   s staff didn   t mean you had to act like some kind of clockwork toy         shall i tell you the reason for the spinning housemaids  sam .     said sybil  as young sam cuddled the huge teddy bear  who frightened him by growling .     it was instituted in my grandfather   s time at the behest of my grandmother .  in those days we entertained all the time with scores of guests on some weekends .  of course  a number of these guests would be young men from very good families in the city  quite well educated and full of  shall i say  vim and vigour .      sybil glanced down at young sam and was relieved to see he was now lining up some small soldiers .     the maids  on the other hand  in the very nature of things are not well educated and i   m ashamed to say might have been slightly too compliant in the face of people whom they had come to think of as their betters .     she was starting to blush  and she pointed down at young sam  who she was glad to see was still paying no attention .     i   m sure you get the picture  sam .  absolutely sure  and my grandmother  whom you would almost certainly have hated  had decent instincts  and therefore decreed that all the housemaids should not only refrain from talking to the male guests  but should not make eye contact with them either  on pain of dismissal .  you might say she was being cruel to be kind  but not all that cruel  come to think of it .  in the fullness of time  the housemaids would leave the hall with good references and not be embarrassed about wearing a white dress on their wedding day .         but i   m happily married     vimes protested .     and i can   t imagine willikins risking the wrath of purity  either .         yes  dear  and i   ll have a word with mrs silver .  but this is the country  sam .  we do things a little more slowly here .  now  why don   t you take young sam out to see the river .  take willikins with you     he knows his way around .              young sam did not need very much in the way of entertainment .  in fact he made his own entertainment  manufacturing it in large quantities out of observations of the landscape  the stories that had lulled him to sleep at bedtime last night  or some butterfly thought that had just sped across his mind  and  increasingly  he   d talk about mister whistle  who lived in a house in a tree but was sometimes a dragon .  he also had a big boot and didn   t like wednesdays because they smell funny and he had a rainbrella .   young sam was thus totally unfazed by the countryside  and ran ahead of vimes and willikins  pointing out trees  sheep  flowers  birds  dragonflies  funny shaped clouds and a human skull .  he seemed quite impressed by the find and rushed to show it to his daddy  who stared at it as if he had seen  well  a human skull .  it had clearly been a human skull for quite a long time  however  and appeared to have been looked after  to the point of being polished .   as vimes turned it over in his hands  searching forensically for any sign of foul play  there was a flip flop sound approaching through the shrubbery  accompanied by a vocal number on the subject of what a person unknown would do to people who stole skulls off him .  when the bushes parted said person unknown turned out to be a man of uncertain age and teeth  a grubby brown robe and a beard longer than any vimes had seen before  and vimes was a man who had often been inside unseen university  where wizards considered that wisdom was embodied in the growing of a beard that would keep the knees warm .  this one tailed comet like behind its owner .  it caught up with him when his hugely sandalled feet slithered to a stop  but its momentum meant that it began to pile up on his head .  possibly it carried wisdom with it  because its owner was bright enough to stop dead when he saw the look in vimes   s eye .  there was silence  apart from the chuckling of young sam as the endless beard  with a life of its own  settled on the man like the snows of winter .   willikins cleared his throat  and said     i think this is the hermit  commander .         what   s a hermit doing here .  i thought they lived up poles in deserts .     vimes glared at the raggedy man  who clearly felt that an explanation was called for and was going to deliver it whether it was called for or not .      yes  sir  i know  sir  that is a popular delusion  and personally i   ve never given it much credence  on account of the difficulty of dealing with what i might call the bathroom necessities and similar .  i mean  that sort of thing might be all right in foreign parts  where there   s sunshine and lots of sand  but it wouldn   t do for me  sir  no indeed .      the apparition held out a grubby hand that was mostly fingernails and went on  proudly     stump  your grace  although i   m not often stumped  ha ha  my little joke .         yes  it is     said vimes  keeping his eyes blank .      indeed it is  sir     said stump .     the only one i   ve got .  i   ve been following the noble profession of herming here for nigh on fifty seven years  practising piety  sobriety  celibacy and the pursuit of true wisdom in the tradition of my father and grandfather and great grandfather before me .  that   s my great grandfather you are holding there  sir     he added cheerfully .     lovely sheen  hasn   t he .     vimes managed not to drop the skull he was holding .  stump went on     i expect your little boy wandered into my grotto  sir  no offence meant  sir  but the village lads round here are a bit frolicsome sometimes and i had to get granddad out of the tree only two weeks ago .      it was willikins who found the mental space to say     you keep your great grandfather   s skull in a cave .         oh yes  gentlemen  and my father   s .  family tradition  see .  and my grandfather   s .  unbroken tradition of herming for nearly three hundred years  dispensing pious thinking and the knowledge that all paths lead but to the grave  and other sombre considerations  to all those who seek us out     who are precious few these days  i might add .  i hope my son will be able to step into my sandals when he   s old enough .  his mother says that he   s turning out a very solemn young man  so i live in hopes that one day he might be giving me a right good polishin    up .  there   s plenty of room on the skull shelf back in the grotto  i   m pleased to say .         your son .     said vimes .     you mentioned celibacy            very attentive of you  your grace .  we get a week   s holiday every year .  a man cannot live by snails and herbs of the riverbank alone         vimes delicately indicated that they had ground to cover  and left the hermit carefully carrying the family relic back to his grotto  wherever that was .  when they seemed to be safely out of earshot he said  waving his hands in the air     why .  i mean     why .         oh  quite a few of the really old ancestral homes had a hermit on the strength  sir .  it was considered romantic to have a grotto with a hermit in it .         he was a bit whiffy on the nose     said vimes .      not allowed to bathe  i believe  sir  and you should know  sir  that he gets an allowance consisting of two pounds of potatoes  three pints of small beer or cider  three loaves of bread and one pound of pork dripping per week .  and presumably all the snails and herbs of the riverbank he can force down .  i looked at the accounts  sir .  not a bad diet for an ornamental garden feature .         not too bad if you throw in some fruit and the occasional laxative  i suppose     said vimes .     so sybil   s ancestors used to come along and talk to the hermit whenever they were faced with a philosophical conundrum  yes .      willikins looked puzzled .     good heavens  no  sir  i can   t imagine that any of them would ever dream of doing that .  they never had any truck with philosophical conundra .   they were aristocrats  you see .  aristocrats don   t notice philosophical conundra .  they just ignore them .  philosophy includes contemplating the possibility that you might be wrong  sir  and a real aristocrat knows that he is always right .  it   s not vanity  you understand  it   s built in absolute certainty .  they may sometimes be as mad as a hatful of spoons  but they are always definitely and certainly mad .      vimes stared at him in admiration .     how the hell do you know all this  willikins .         watched them  sir .  in the good old days when her ladyship   s granddad was alive he made certain that the whole staff of scoone avenue came down here with the family in the summer .  as you know  i   m not much of a scholar and  truth to tell  neither are you  but when you grow up on the street you learn fast because if you don   t learn fast you   re dead .      they were now walking across an ornamental bridge  over what was probably the trout stream and  vimes assumed  a tributary of old treachery  a name whose origin he had yet to comprehend .  two men and one little boy  walking over a bridge that might be carrying crowds  and carts and horses .  the world seemed unbalanced .      you see  sir     said willikins     being definite is what gave them all this money and land .  sometimes lost it for them as well  of course .  one of lady sybil   s great uncles once lost a villa and two thousand acres of prime farmland by being definite in believing that a cloakroom ticket could beat three aces .  he was killed in the duel that followed  but at least he was definitely dead .         it   s snobbishness and i don   t like it     vimes said .   willikins rubbed the side of his nose .     well  commander  it ain   t snobbishness .  you don   t get much of that from the real mccoy  in my experience .  the certain ones  i mean     they don   t worry about what the neighbours think or walking around in old clothes .  they   re confident  see .  when lady sybil was younger the family would come down here for the sheep shearing  and her father would muck in with everybody else  with his sleeves rolled up and everything  and he   d see to it that there was a round of beer for all the lads afterwards  and he   d drink with them  flagon for flagon .  of course  he was a brandy man mostly  so a bit of beer wouldn   t have him on the floor .  he never worried about who he was .  he was a decent old boy  her father     and her granddad  too .  certain  you see  never worried .      they walked along an avenue of chestnut trees for a while and then vimes said  morosely     are you saying that i don   t know who i am .      willikins looked up into the trees and replied  thoughtfully     it looks as though there   ll be a lot of conkers this year  commander  and if you don   t mind me suggesting it  you might think of bringing this young lad down here when they start falling .  i was the dead rat conkers champion for years when i was a kid  until i found out that the real things grew on trees and didn   t squish so easily .  as for your question     he went on     i think sam vimes is at his best when he   s confident that he   s sam vimes .  good grief  and they are fruiting early this year .      the avenue of chestnut trees ended at this point and before them lay an apple orchard .     not the best of fruit  as apples go     said willikins as vimes and young sam crossed over to it  raising the dust on the chalky road .  the comment seemed inconsequential to vimes  but willikins appeared to consider the orchard very important .      the little boy will want to see this     willikins said enthusiastically .     saw it myself when i was the boot boy .  totally changed the way i thought about the world .  the third earl     mad    jack ramkin  had a brother called woolsthorpe  probably for his sins .  he was something of a scholar and would have been sent to the university to become a wizard were it not for the fact that his brother let it be known that any male sibling of his who took up a profession that involved wearing a dress would be disinherited with a cleaver .      nevertheless  young woolsthorpe persevered in his studies of natural philosophy in the way a gentleman should  by digging into any suspicious looking burial mounds he could find in the neighbourhood  filling up his lizard press with as many rare species as he could collect  and drying samples of any flowers he could find before they became extinct .  the story runs that  on one warm summer day  he dozed off under an apple tree and was awakened when an apple fell on his head .  a lesser man  as his biographer put it  would have seen nothing untoward about this  but woolsthorpe surmised that  since apples and practically everything else always fell down  then the world would eventually become dangerously unbalanced     unless there was another agency involved that natural philosophy had yet to discover .  he lost no time in dragging one of the footmen to the orchard and ordering him  on pain of dismissal  to lie under the tree until an apple hit him on the head .  the possibility of this happening was increased by another footman who had been told by woolsthorpe to shake the tree vigorously until the required apple fell .  woolsthorpe was ready to observe this from a distance .      who can imagine his joy when the inevitable apple fell and a second apple was seen rising from the tree and disappearing at speed into the vaults of heaven  proving the hypothesis that what goes up must come down  provided that what goes down must come up  thus safeguarding the equilibrium of the universe .  regrettably  this only works with apples and  amazingly  only the apples on this one tree  malus equilibria .  i hear someone has worked out that the apples at the top of the tree fill with gas and fly up when the tree is disturbed so that it can set its seeds some way off .  wonderful thing  nature  shame the fruit tastes like dog   s business     willikins added as young sam spat some out .     to tell you the truth  commander  i wouldn   t give you tuppence for a lot of the upper classes i   ve met  especially in the city  but some of them in these old country houses changed the world for the better .  like turnip ramkin  who revolutionized agriculture            i think i   ve heard of him     said vimes .     wasn   t he something to do with planting root crops .  wasn   t that how he got his nickname .         very nearly right  sir     said willikins .     in fact  he invented the seed drill  which meant more reliable crops and a great saving in seed corn .  he only looked like a turnip .  people can be so cruel sometimes  sir .  there was also his brother     rubber ramkin     who devised not only rubber boots but also rubberized fabric  even before the dwarfs did .  very interested indeed in rubber  so i heard  but it takes all sorts to make a world and it would be a funny old place if we were all the same  and especially if we were all like him .  dry feet and dry shoulders  sir  what every farmworker prays for .  i did a spell cutting cabbages one winter  sir  weather as cold as charity and rain coming down so fast it had to queue up to hit the ground .  i blessed his name then  so i did  even if it was true what they said about the young ladies  who i heard actually enjoyed the experience            this is all very well     said vimes     but it doesn   t make up for all the stupid  arrogant        this time it was willikins who interrupted his master .     and then there was the flying machine  of course .  her ladyship   s late brother put a lot of work into the project  but it never got off the ground .  flying without a broomstick or a magic spell was his goal  but regrettably he fell victim to the outbreak of crisms  poor lad .  there   s a model of it in the nursery  as a matter of fact .  it runs on rubber bands .         i expect there was plenty of material around the place  unless rubber ramkin tidied up after himself     said vimes .   the tour continued  across meadows of what vimes decided to call cows and around fields of standing corn .  they navigated their way around a ha ha  kept their distance from the ho ho and completely ignored the he he  then climbed a gentle path up a hill on which was planted a grove of beech trees and from which you could see practically everywhere  and certainly to the end of the universe  but that probably involved looking straight up with no beech trees in the way .  it was even possible to make out the tall cloud of smoke and fumes that rose from the city of ankh morpork .      this is hangman   s hill     said willikins  as vimes got his breath back .     and you might not want to go any further     he said as they neared the summit     unless  that is  you want to explain to your young lad what a gibbet is .      vimes looked questioningly at his servant .     really .         well  as i say  this is hangman   s hill .  why do you think they named it that  sir .     black jack    ramkin was regrettably mistaken when he made an enormous drunken wager with one of his equally drunk drinking pals that he could see the smoke of the city from his estate .  he was told by a surveyor  who had tested the hypothesis  that the hill was thirty feet too short .  pausing only to attempt to bribe the surveyor and when unsuccessful to subsequently horsewhip the same  he rallied all the working men from this estate and all the others round here and set them to raise the hill by the aforesaid thirty feet  a most ambitious project .  it cost a fortune  of course  but every family in the district probably got warm winter clothes and new boots out of it .  it made him very popular  and of course he won his bet .      vimes sighed .     somehow i think i know the answer to this  but i   m going to ask anyway  how much was the bet .         two gallons of brandy     said willikins triumphantly     which he drank in one go while standing on this very spot  to the cheers of the assembled workforce  and then  according to legend  rolled all the way down to the bottom  to more cheers .         even when i was a boozer i don   t think i could have taken two gallons of brandy     said vimes .     that   s twelve bottles .         well  towards the end i expect a lot of it went down his trousers  one way or the other .  there were plenty like him  even so            all down his trousers     young sam piped up  and dissolved into that curious hoarse laughter of a six year old who thinks he has heard something naughty .  and by the sound of it the workmen who had cheered the old drunk had thought the same way .  cheering a man drinking a year   s wages in one go .  what was the point .   willikins must have read his thoughts .     the country isn   t as subtle as the city  commander .  they like big and straightforward things here  and black jack was as big and as straight as you could hope for .  that   s why they liked him  because they knew where they stood  even if he was about to fall down .  i bet they boasted about him all over the shires .  i can just imagine it .  our drunken old lord can outdrink your drunken old lord any day of the week  and they would be proud of it .  i   m sure you thought you were doing the right thing when you shook hands with the gardener  but you puzzled people .  they don   t know what to make of you .  are you a man or a master .  are you a nob or one of them .  because  commander  from where they sit no man can be both .  it would be against nature .  and the countryside doesn   t like puzzles  either .         big puzzled trousers .     said young sam and fell on the grass  overwhelmed with humour .      i don   t know what to make of me either     said vimes  picking up his son and following willikins down the slope .     but sybil does .  she   s got me marked down for balls  dances  dinners  and  oh yes  soir  es     he finished  in the tones of a man genetically programmed to distrust any word with an acute accent in it .     i mean  that sort of thing in the city i   ve come to terms with .  if i reckon that it   s going to be too bloody dreadful i make certain i get called out in an emergency halfway through     at least i used to  before sybil twigged .  it   s a terrible thing when a man   s employees take their orders from his wife  you know .         yes  commander .  she has given the kitchen staff orders that no bacon sandwiches are to be prepared without her express permission .      vimes winced .     you brought the little cookery kit  didn   t you .         unfortunately  her ladyship knows about our little cookery kit  commander .  she has forbidden the kitchen to give me bacon unless the order comes directly from her .         honestly  she   s as bad as vetinari .  how does she find out all this stuff .         as a matter of fact  commander  i don   t think she does  at least as an actual fact .  she just knows you .  perhaps you should think of it as amiable suspicion .  we should be getting along  commander .  i   m told there is chicken salad for lunch .         do i like chicken salad .         yes  commander  her ladyship tells me that you do .      vimes gave in .     then i do .      back in scoone avenue  vimes and sybil generally took only one meal a day together  in the kitchen  which was always pleasantly snug by then .  they sat facing one another at the table  which was long enough to carry vimes   s huge collection of sauce bottles  mustard pots  pickles and  of course  chutneys  vimes being of the popular persuasion that no jar of pickles is ever truly empty if you rattle the spoon around inside it long enough .   things were different at the hall .  for one thing there was far too much food .  vimes had not been born yesterday  or even the day before  and refrained from commenting .   willikins served vimes and lady sybil .  strictly speaking it wasn   t his job while they were away from home  but strictly speaking most gentlemen   s gentlemen didn   t carry a set of brass knuckles in their well cut jacket either .      and what did you boys do this morning .     said sybil cheerfully  as the plates were emptied .      we saw the stinky bone man .     said young sam .     he was like all beard  but stinky .  and we found the smelly apple tree which is like poo .      lady sybil   s placid expression did not change .     and then you came down the roly poly hill  didn   t you .  and what about the ha ha  the ho ho and the he he .         yes  but there   s all cow poo .  i treaded in it .      young sam waited for an adult response  and his mother said     well  you   ve got your new country boots  haven   t you .  treading in cow poo is what they   re for .      sam vimes watched his son   s face glow with impossible pleasure as his mother went on .     your grandfather always told me that if i saw a big pile of muck in a field i should kick it around a bit so as to spread it evenly  because that way all the grass will grow properly .     she smiled at vimes   s expression and said     well  it   s true  dear .  a lot of farming is about manure .         just so long as he understands that he doesn   t start kicking up the gutters when he gets back to the city     vimes said .     some of that stuff will kick back .         he should learn about the countryside .  he should know where food comes from and how we get it .  this is important  sam .         of course  dear .      lady sybil gave her husband a look only a wife can give .     that was your put upon but dutiful voice  sam .         yes  but i don   t see        sybil interrupted him .     young sam will own all this one day and i   d like him to have some idea about it all  just as i   d like you to relax and enjoy your holiday .  i   m taking young sam over to the home farm later on  to see the cows being milked  and to collect some eggs .     she stood up .     but first i   m going to take him down to the crypt  to see his ancestors .     she noted her husband   s look of panic and added  quickly     it   s all right  sam  they aren   t walking around  they are  in fact  in very expensive boxes .  why don   t you come too .      sam vimes was no stranger to death  and vice versa .  it was the suicides that got him down .  they were mostly hangings  because you would have to be extremely suicidal to jump into the river ankh  not least because you would bounce several times before you broke through the crust .  and they all had to be investigated  just in case it was a murder in disguise   and whereas mr trooper  the current city hangman  could drop someone into eternity so quickly and smoothly that they probably didn   t notice  too often vimes had seen what amateurs managed to do .   the ramkin family crypt reminded him of the city morgue after hours .  it was crowded  some coffins were stacked edgewise  as though they were on shelves in the mortuary  but  it was to be hoped  they didn   t slide out .  vimes watched warily as his wife carefully took their son from plaque to plaque reading out the names and explaining a little about every occupant  and he felt the cold  bottomless depths of time around him  somehow breathing from the walls .  how could it feel for young sam to know the names of all those grandfathers and grandmothers down the centuries .  vimes had never known his father .  his mum told him that the man had been run over by a cart  but vimes suspected that if this was true at all  then it was probably a brewer   s cart  which had    run him over    a bit at a time for years .  oh  of course there was old stoneface  the regicide  now rehabilitated and with his own statue in the city which was never graffitied because vimes had made it clear what would happen to the perpetrator .   but old stoneface was just a point in time  a kind of true myth .  there wasn   t a line between him and sam vimes  only an aching gulf .   still  young sam would be a duke one day  and that was a thought worth hanging on to .  he wouldn   t grow up worrying about what he was  because he would know  and the influence of his mother might just outweigh the enormous drag factor of having samuel vimes as a father .  young sam would be able to shake up the world the right way .  you need confidence to do that  and having a bunch of  apparently  loony but interesting ancestors could only impress the man in the street  and vimes knew a lot of streets  and a lot of men .   willikins hadn   t entirely told the truth .  even city people liked a character  especially a black hearted one or one interesting enough to materially add to the endless crazy circus show which was the street life of ankh morpork  and while having a drunkard for a father was a social faux pas  having a great great great grandfather who could drink so much brandy that his urine must surely have been inflammable  and then  according to willikins  proceed to go home to a meal of turbot followed by roast goose  with appropriate wines  and then play a hand of saddle pork   with his cronies until dawn  winning back his earlier losses     well  people loved that sort of thing  and that sort of person  who kicked the world in the arse and shouted at it .  that was an ancestor to be proud of  surely .      i think     i   d like to go for a walk by myself     said vimes .     you know  have a look round  poke about a bit  get the hang of this countryside business at my own pace .         willikins ought to accompany you  dear     said lady sybil     just in case .         in case of what  my dear .  i walk around the streets of the city every night  don   t i .  i don   t think i need a chaperone for a stroll in the country  do i .  i   m trying to get into the spirit of things .  i   ll look at daffodils to see if they fill me with joy  or whatever it is they   re supposed to do  and keep an eye open for the very rare grebe warbler and watch the moles take flight .  i   ve been reading the nature notes in the paper for weeks .  i think i know how to do this by myself  dear .  the commander of the watch is not afraid to spot the spotted flycatcher .      lady sybil had learned from experience when it was wise not to argue  and contented herself with saying     don   t upset anybody  at least  will you  dear .      after ten minutes of walking  vimes was lost .  not physically lost but metaphorically  spiritually and peripatetically lost .  the fragrances of the hedgerows were somehow without body compared with the robust stinks of the city  and he had not the faintest idea what was rustling in the undergrowth .  he recognized heifers and bullocks  because he often walked through the slaughterhouse district  but the ones out here weren   t bewildered by fear and stared at him carefully as he walked past as if they were calmly taking notes .  yes     that was it .  the world was back to front .  he was a copper  he had always been a copper  and he would die a copper .  you never stopped being a copper  on the whole  and as a copper he walked around the city more or less invisible  except to those people who make it their business to spot coppers  and whose livelihood depends upon their spotting coppers before coppers spot them .  mostly you were part of the scenery  until the scream  the tinkle of broken glass and the sound of felonious footsteps brought you into focus .   but here everything was watching him .  things darted away behind a hedge  flew up in panic or just rustled suspiciously in the undergrowth .  he was the stranger  the interloper  not wanted here .   he turned another corner  and there was the village .  he had seen the chimneys some way off  but the lanes and footpaths crisscrossed one another in a tangle  repeated in the overflowing hedgerows and trees  that made tunnels of shade     which were welcome     and played merry hells with his sense of direction  which was not .   he had lost all his bearings and was hot and bothered by the time he came out into a long dusty lane with thatched cottages on either side and halfway down a large building which had    pub    written all over it  particularly by the three old men who were sitting on the bench outside it eyeing the approaching vimes hopefully in case he was the kind of man who would buy another man a pint .  they wore clothes that looked as if they had been nailed on .  then  when he got closer  one said something to the other two and they stood up as he passed  index fingers touching their hat brims .  one of them said     garternoon  yer grace     a phrase which vimes interpreted after a little thought .  there was also a slight and meaningful tip of the empty tankards to indicate that they were  in fact  empty tankards and therefore an anomaly in need of rectification .   vimes knew what was expected of him .  there wasn   t a pub in ankh morpork which didn   t have the equivalent three old men sunning themselves outside and ever ready to talk to strangers about the good old days  i . e .  when the tankards they were nursing still had beer in them .  and the form was that you filled them up with cheap ale and got a    well  thank you  kind sir     and quite possibly little bubbles of information about who had been seen where doing what and with whom and when  all grist to the copper   s mill .   but the expressions on these three changed when another of them whispered hurriedly to his cronies .  they pushed themselves back on the wooden seat as if trying to make themselves inconspicuous while still clasping the empty flagons because  well  you never knew .  a sign over the door proclaimed that this was the goblin   s head .   opposite the pub was a large open space laid  as they say  to grass .  a few sheep grazed on it and towards the far end was a large stack of wood like wicker hurdles  the purpose of which vimes could not guess .  he was  however  familiar with the term    village green     although he had never seen one .  ankh morpork wasn   t very big on greens .   the pub smelled of stale beer .  this helped as a bulwark against temptation  although vimes had been clean for years  and could face the occasional sherry at official events  because he hated the taste of it anyway .  the smell of antique beer had the same effect .  by the pitiful light of the tiny windows vimes made out an elderly man industriously polishing a tankard .  the man looked up at vimes and gave him a nod  the basic nod which is understood everywhere as meaning    i see you  you see me  it   s up to you what happens next     although some publicans can put an inflection on a nod which also manages to convey the information that there might just be a two foot length of lead piping under the counter should the party of the second part want to start anything  as it were .   vimes said     do you serve anything that isn   t alcoholic .      the barman very carefully hung the tankard on a hook over the bar and then looked directly at vimes and said  without rancour     well  you see  sir  this is what we call a pub .  people gets stuffy about it if i leaves out the alcohol .     he drummed his fingers on the bar for a moment and went on  uncertainly     my wife makes root beer  if that takes your fancy .         what kind of root .         beetroot  as it happens  sir .  it   s good for keeping you regular .         well  i   ve always thought of myself as a regular kind of person     said vimes .     give me a pint     no  make that half a pint  thanks .      there was another nod and the man disappeared briefly behind the scenes and came back with a large glass overflowing with red foam .     there you go     he said  putting it carefully on the bar .     we don   t put it in pewter because it does something to the metal .  this one is on the house  sir .  my name is jiminy  landlord of the goblin   s head .  i dare say i know yours .  my daughter is a maid at the big house  and i treat every man alike  the reason being that the publican is a friend to any man with money in his pockets and also  if the whim takes him  perhaps even to those who temporarily find themselves stony broke  which does not  at the moment  include them three herberts outside .  the publican sees all men after a couple of pints  and sees no reason to discriminate .      jiminy winked at vimes  who held out his hand and said     then i   ll happily shake the hand of a republican .      vimes was familiar with the ridiculous litany .  every man who served behind a bar thought of himself as one of the world   s great thinkers and it was wise to treat him as such .  after the handshake he added     this juice is pretty good .  rather tangy .         yes  sir  my wife puts chilli peppers in it  and celery seed to make a man think that he   s drinking something with bones in .      vimes leaned on the counter  inexplicably at peace .  the wall over the bar was hung with the heads of dead animals  particularly those possessed of antlers and fangs  but it came as a shock to spot  in the grubby light  a goblin   s head .  i   m on holiday  he thought  and that probably happened a long time ago  ancient history  and he left it at that .   jiminy busied himself with the dozens of little tasks that a barman can always find to do  while occasionally glancing at his single customer .  vimes thought for a moment and said     can you take a pint to those gentlemen outside  mister jiminy  and put a brandy in each one so that a man knows he   s drinking something .         that would be long tom  short tom and tom tom     said jiminy  reaching for some mugs .     decent lads     triplets  as it happens .  they earn their keep but  as you might say  they shared one brain out between all three of them and it wasn   t that good a brain to start with .  very good when it comes to scaring crows  though .         and were all named tom .     said vimes .      that   s right .  it   s by way of being a family name  see  their dad being called tom also .  maybe it saves confusion  them being easily confused .  they   re getting on a bit now  of course  but if you give them a job they can do then they   ll do it well  and won   t stop until you tell them to .  no beggars in the countryside  see .  there   s always little jobs that need doing .  by your leave  sir  i   ll give them short measure on the brandy .  they don   t need too much confusing  if you get my drift .      the publican put the mugs on a tray and disappeared out into the bright sunshine .  vimes moved swiftly behind the bar and back again without stopping .  a few seconds later he was leaning nonchalantly on the counter as three faces peeped in through the open door .  with a look of some apprehension three thumbs up salutes were aimed at vimes and the faces were hauled back out of sight again  presumably in case he exploded or developed horns .   jiminy came back with the empty tray  and gave vimes a cheerful smile .     well  you   ve made some friends there  sir  but don   t let me keep you .  i   m sure you   ve got a lot to do .      a copper  thought vimes .  i recognize a police truncheon when i see one .  that   s the copper   s dream  isn   t it     to leave the streets behind and run a little pub somewhere  and because you   re a copper and because being a copper never leaves you  you will know what is going on .  i know you and you don   t know that i do .  and from where i   m sitting i call that a result .  you wait  mister jiminy .  i know where you live .   now vimes could hear slow and heavy footsteps in the distance  getting closer .  he saw the local men as they arrived in their working clothes and carrying what most people would call agricultural implements  but which vimes mentally noted as offensive weapons .  the troupe stopped outside the door and now he heard whispering .  the three toms were imparting today   s news  apparently  and it seemed to be received with either incredulity or scorn .  some sort of conclusion was being reached  not happily .   and then the men trooped in  and vimes   s mind clocked them for ready reference .  exhibit one was an elderly man with a long white beard and  good heavens  a smock .  did they really still wear those .  whatever his name the others probably called him    granddad    .  he shyly touched his forefinger to his forehead in salute and headed for the bar  job safely done .  he had been carrying a big hook  not a nice weapon .  exhibit two carried a shovel  which could be an axe or a club if a man knew what he was doing .  he was smocked up too  didn   t catch vimes   s eye  and his salute had been more like a begrudged wave .  exhibit three  who was holding a toolbox  terrific weapon if swung accurately   scurried past with speed and barely glanced in vimes   s direction .  he looked young and rather weedy  but nevertheless you can get a good momentum on one of those boxes .  then there was another elderly man  wearing a blacksmith   s apron  but the wrong build  so vimes marked him down as a farrier .  yes  that would be it  short and wiry  would easily be able to get under a horse .  the man presented a reasonable attempt at a forelock salute  and vimes was unable to make out any dangerous bulges concealed by the apron .  he couldn   t help this algebra  it was what you did when you did the job .  even if you didn   t expect trouble  you  well  expected trouble .   and then the room froze .   there had been some desultory conversation in the vicinity of jiminy but it stopped now as the real blacksmith came in .  bugger .  all vimes   s warning bells rang at once  and they weren   t tinkly bells .  they clanged .  after a brief glower round the room the man headed for the bar on the course that would take him past  or probably over  or even through sam vimes .  as it was  vimes carefully pulled his mug out of harm   s way so that the man   s undisguised attempt to    accidentally    spill it failed .      mister jiminy     vimes called out     a round of drinks for these gentlemen  all right .      this caused a certain amount of cheerfulness among the other newcomers  but the smith slammed a hand like a shovel down on the wood so that glasses jumped .      i don   t care to drink with them as grinds the faces of the poor .      vimes held his gaze  and said     sorry  i didn   t bring my grinder with me today .     it was silly  because a couple of sniggers from hopeful drinkers at the bar merely stoked whatever fires the blacksmith had neglected to leave at work  and made him angry .      who are you to think you   re a better man than me .      vimes shrugged  and said     i don   t know if i am a better man than you .     but he was thinking  you look to me like a big man in a small community  and you think you   re tough because you   re strong and metal doesn   t sneak up behind you and try to kick you in the goolies .  good grief  you don   t even know how to stand right .  even corporal nobbs could get you down and be kicking you industriously in the fork before you knew what was happening .   like any man fearing that something expensive could get broken  jiminy came bustling across the floor and grabbed the smith by one arm  saying     come on  jethro  let   s have no trouble .  his grace is just having a drink the like of which any man is entitled to         this appeared to work  although aggression smouldered on jethro   s face and indeed in the surrounding air .  by the look on the faces of the other men  this was a performance they were familiar with .  it was a poor copper who couldn   t read a pub crowd  and vimes could probably write a history  with footnotes .  every community has its firebrand  or madman  or self taught politician .  usually they are tolerated because they add to the gaiety of nations  as it were  and people say things like    it   s just his way     and the air clears and life goes on .  but jethro  now sitting in the far corner of the bar nursing his pint like a lion huddled over his gazelle  well  jethro  in the vimes lexicon of risk  was a man likely to explode .  of course the world sometimes needed blowing up  just so long as it didn   t happen where vimes was drinking .   vimes was becoming aware that the pub was filling up  mostly with other sons of the soil  but also with people who  whether they were gentlemen or not  would expect to be called so .  they wore colourful caps and white trousers and spoke continuously .   there was also further activity outside  horses and carriages were filling the lane .  hammering was going on somewhere and jiminy   s wife was now manning or  more correctly  womaning the bar while her husband ran back and forth with his tray .  jethro remained in his corner like a man biding his time  occasionally glaring daggers  and probably fists as well with an option on boots  if vimes so much as looked at him .   vimes decided to take a look out of the grubby pub window .  regrettably  the pub was that most terrifying of things  picturesque  which meant that the window consisted of small round panes fixed in place with lead .  they were for letting the light in  not for looking out of  since they bent light so erratically that it nearly broke .  one pane showed what was probably a sheep but looked like a white whale  until it moved  when it became a mushroom .  a man walked past with no head until he reached another pane and then had one enormous eyeball .  young sam would have loved it  but his father decided to give eventual blindness a miss and stepped out into the sunshine .   ah  he thought  some kind of game .   oh well .   vimes wasn   t keen on games because they led to crowds  and crowds led to work for coppers .  but here in fact he wasn   t a copper  was he .  it was a strange feeling  so he left the pub and became an innocent bystander .  he couldn   t remember when he had been one before .  it felt     vulnerable .  he strolled over to the nearest man  who was hammering some stakes into the ground  and asked     what   s going on here  then .     realizing that he had spoken in copper rather than in ordinary citizen  he added quickly     if you don   t mind me asking .      the man straightened up .  he was one of the ones with the colourful caps .     haven   t you ever seen a game of crockett  sir .  it   s the game of games .      mr civilian vimes did his best to look like a man eager for more delicious information .  judging by his informant   s enthusiastic grin  he was about to learn the rules of crockett  whether he wanted to or not .  well  he thought  i did ask         at first sight  sir  crockett might seem like just another ball game wherein two sides strive against one another by endeavouring to propel the ball by hand or bat or other device into the opponents    goal of some sort .  crockett  however  was invented during a game of croquet at st onan   s theological college in ham on rye  when the novice priest jackson fieldfair  now the bishop of quirm  took his mallet in both hands  and instead of giving the ball a gentle tap         after that vimes gave up  not only because the rules of the game were incomprehensible in their own right  but also because the extremely enthusiastic young man allowed his enthusiasm to overtake any consideration of the need to explain things in some sensible order  which meant that the flood of information was continually punctuated by apologetic comments on the lines of    i   m sorry  i should have explained earlier that a second cone is not allowed more than once per exchange  and in normal play there is only one tump  unless  of course  you   re talking about royal crockett         vimes died     the sun dropped out of the sky  giant lizards took over the world  the stars exploded and went out and all hope vanished with a gurgle into the sink trap of oblivion  and gas filled the firmament and combusted and behold there was a new heaven  one careful owner  and a new disc  and lo  and possibly verily  life crawled out of the sea  or possibly didn   t because it had been made by the gods     that was really up to the bystander     and lizards turned into less scaly lizards  or possibly did not  and lizards turned into birds  and worms turned into butterflies  and a species of apple turned into bananas  and possibly a kind of monkey fell out of a tree and realized that life was better when you didn   t have to spend your time hanging on to something  and  in only a few million years  evolved trousers and ornamental stripy hats and lastly the game of crockett and there  magically reincarnated  was vimes  a little dizzy  standing on the village green looking into the smiling countenance of an enthusiast .   he managed to say     well  that   s amazing  thank you so very much .  i look forward to enjoying the game .     at which point  he thought  a brisk walk home might be in order  only to be foiled by a regrettably familiar voice behind him saying     you  i say you  yes  you .  aren   t you vimes .      it was lord rust  usually of ankh morpork  and a fierce old warhorse  without whose unique grasp of strategy and tactics several wars would not have been so bloodily won .  now he was in a wheelchair  a newfangled variety pushed by a man whose life was  knowing his lordship  quite probably unbearable .   but hatred tends not to have a long half life and in recent years vimes had regarded the man as now no more than a titled idiot  rendered helpless by age  yet still possessed of an annoying horsy voice that  suitably harnessed  might be used to saw down trees .  lord rust was not a problem any more .  there were surely only a few more years to go before he would rust in peace .  and somewhere in his knobbly heart vimes still retained a slight admiration for the cantankerous old butcher  with his evergreen self esteem and absolute readiness not to change his mind about anything at all .  the old boy had reacted to the fact that vimes  the hated policeman  was now a duke  and therefore a lot more nobby than he was  by simply assuming that this could not possibly be true  and therefore totally ignoring it .  lord rust  in vimes   s book  was a dangerous buffoon but  and here was the difficult bit  an incredibly  if suicidally  brave one .  this would have been absolutely ticketyboo were it not for the suicides of those poor fools who followed him into battle .   witnesses had said that it was uncanny  rust would gallop into the jaws of death at the head of his men and was never seen to flinch  yet arrows and morningstars always missed him while invariably hitting the men right behind him .  bystanders     or rather people peering at the battle from behind comfortingly large rocks     had testified to this .  perhaps he was capable of ignoring  too  the arrows meant for him .  but age could not be so easily upstaged  and the old man  while no less arrogant  had a sunken look .   rust  most unusually  smiled at vimes and said     first time i   ve ever seen you down here  vimes .  is sybil going back to her roots  what .         she wants young sam to get some mud on his boots  rust .         well done her  what .  it   ll do the boy good and make a man of him  what .      vimes never understood where the explosive whats came from .  after all  he thought  what   s the point of just barking out    what .     for absolutely no discernible reason .  and as for    what what .      well  what was that all about .  why what .  whats seemed to be tent pegs hammered into the conversation  but what the hells for  what .      so not down here on any official business  then  what .      vimes   s mind spun so quickly that rust should have heard the wheels go round .  it analysed the tone of voice  the look of the man  that slight  ever so slight but nevertheless perceptible hint of a hope that the answer would be    no     and presented him with a suggestion that it might not be a bad idea to drop a tiny kitten among the pigeons .   he laughed .     well  rust  sybil has been banging on about coming down here since young sam was born  and this year she put her foot down and i suppose an order from his wife must be considered official  when .     vimes saw the man who pushed the enormous wheelchair trying to conceal a smile  especially when rust responded with a baffled    what .      vimes decided not to go with    where    and instead said  in an offhand way     well  you know how it is  lord rust .  a policeman will find a crime anywhere if he decides to look hard enough .      lord rust   s smile remained  but it had congealed slightly as he said     i should listen to the advice of your good lady  vimes .  i don   t think you   ll find anything worth your mettle down here .     there was no    what    to follow  and the lack of it was somehow an emphasis .   it was often a good idea  vimes had always found  to give the silly bits of the brain something to do  so that they did not interfere with the important ones which had a proper job to fulfil .  so he watched his first game of crockett for a full half hour before an internal alarm told him that shortly he should be back at the hall in time to read to young sam     something that with any luck did not have poo mentioned on every page     and tuck him into bed before dinner .   his prompt arrival got a nod of approval from sybil  who gingerly handed him a new book to read to young sam .   vimes looked at the cover .  the title was the world of poo .  when his wife was out of eyeshot he carefully leafed through it .  well  okay  you had to accept that the world had moved on and these days fairy stories were probably not going to be about twinkly little things with wings .  as he turned page after page  it dawned on him that whoever had written this book  they certainly knew what would make kids like young sam laugh until they were nearly sick .  the bit about sailing down the river almost made him smile .  but interspersed with the scatology was actually quite interesting stuff about septic tanks and dunnakin divers and gongfermors and how dog muck helped make the very best leather  and other things that you never thought you would need to know  but once heard somehow lodged in your mind .   apparently it was by the author of wee and if young sam had one vote for the best book ever written  then it would go to wee .  his enthusiasm was perhaps fanned all the more because a rare imp of mischief in vimes led him to do all the necessary straining noises .   later  over dinner  sybil quizzed him about his afternoon .  she was particularly interested when he mentioned stopping by to watch the crockett .      oh  they still play it .  that   s wonderful .  how did it go .      vimes put down his knife and fork and stared thoughtfully at the ceiling for a moment or two  then said     well  i was talking to lord rust for some of the time  and i had to leave  of course  because of young sam  but fortune favoured the priests  when their striker managed to tump a couple of the farmers by a crafty use of the hamper .  there were several appeals to the hat man about this  because he broke his mallet in so doing  and in my opinion the hat man   s decision was entirely correct  especially since the farmers had played a hawk manoeuvre .     he took a deep breath .     when play recommenced  the farmers still had not found their stride but got a breathing space when a sheep wandered on to the pitch and the priests  assuming that this would stop play  relaxed too soon  and higgins j .  fired a magnificent handsaw under the offending ruminant         sybil finally stopped him when she realized that the meal was growing very cold  and said     sam .  how did you become an expert on the noble game of crockett .      vimes picked up his knife and fork .     please don   t ask me again     he sighed .  in his head meanwhile a little voice said  lord rust tells me there is nothing here for me .  oh dear  i   d better find out what it is  what .   he cleared his throat and said     sybil  did you actually look at that book i   m reading to young sam .         yes  dear .  felicity beedle is the most famous children   s writer in the world .  she   s been at it for years .  she wrote melvin and the enormous boil  geoffrey and the magic pillow case  the little duckling who thought he was an elephant            did she write one about an elephant who thought he was a duckling .         no  sam  because that would be silly .  oh  she also wrote daphne and the nose pickers  and gaston   s enormous problem won for her the gladys h .  j .  ferguson award     the fifth time she   s been given it .  she gets children interested in reading  you see .         yes     said vimes     but they   re reading about poo and brain dead ducklings .         sam  that   s part of the commonality of mankind  so don   t be so prudish .  young sam   s a country boy now  and i   m very proud of him  and he likes books .  that   s the whole point .  miss beedle also finances scholarships for the quirm college for young ladies .  she must be quite wealthy now  but i hear she   s taken apple tree cottage     you can practically see it from here  it   s on the side of the hill     and i think it right  if you don   t mind  of course  that we invite her here to the hall .         of course     said vimes  though his don   tmindedness was entirely due to the way his wife   s question had been phrased and the subtle resonances that miss beedle   s attendance was a done deal .   vimes slept a lot better that night  partly because he could feel that somewhere in the universe near by there was a clue waiting for him to pull .  that made his fingers itch already .   in the morning  as he had promised  he took young sam horse riding .  vimes could ride  but hated doing so .  nevertheless  falling off the back of a pony on to one   s head was a skill that every young man should learn if only so that he resolved never to do it again .   the rest of the day  however  did not work out well .  vimes  suspicions filling his mind  was metaphorically and only just short of literally dragged by sybil to see her friend ariadne  the lady blessed with the six daughters .  in actual fact there were only five visible in the chintzy drawing room when sybil and he were ushered in .  he was feted as    the dear brave commander vimes        he hated that shit  but under sybil   s benign but careful gaze he was wise enough not to say so  at least not in those precise words .  and so he grinned and bore it while they fluttered around him like large moths  and he waved away yet more teacakes  and cups of tea that would have been welcome were it not that they looked and tasted like what proper tea turns into shortly after you drink it .  as far as sam vimes was concerned  he liked tea  but tea was not tea if  even before drinking  you could see the bottom of the cup .   still worse than the stuff he was being offered was the conversation  which inclined towards bonnets  a subject on which his ignorance was not just treasured but venerated .  and besides  his breeches were chafing  wretched things  but sybil had insisted  saying that he looked very smart in them  just like a country gentleman .  vimes had to suppose the country gentleman had different arrangements in the groinal department .   there was  besides himself and lady sybil  a young omnian curate  wisely dressed in a voluminous black robe  which presumably presented no groinal problems .  vimes had no idea why the young man was there  but presumably the young ladies needed somebody to fill with weak tea  suspect scones and mindless twittering conversation when someone like vimes wasn   t there .  and it seemed that when the subject of bonnets lost its fascination the only other topics were legacies and the prospects for forthcoming balls .  and so  inevitably  given his restlessness in female company  a growing disaffection for urine coloured tea  and small talk that would barely be visible under a microscope  vimes said     excuse me asking  ladies  but what is it that you actually  i mean actually do     for a living  i mean .      this question elicited five genuinely blank looks .  vimes couldn   t tell the daughters one from the other  except the one called emily  who certainly lodged in the mind and possibly also in doorways  and who now said  in the tones of one slightly out of her depth     i do beg your pardon  commander  but i don   t think we understand what you just vouchsafed .         i meant  well  how do you make a living .  are any of you in employment .  how do you make your daily crust .  what work do you do .     vimes could pick up nothing from sybil  because he couldn   t see her face  but the girls    mother was staring at him with gleeful fascination .  oh well  if he was going to get it in the neck he might as well get it all the way down .     i mean  ladies     he said     how do you make your way in the world .  how do you earn your keep .  apart from bonnets  do you have any skills     like cookery  for example .      another daughter  quite possibly mavis  but vimes was guessing  cleared her throat and said     fortunately  commander  we have servants for that sort of thing .  we   re gentlewomen  you see .  it would be quite  quite unthinkable for us to go into trade or commerce .  the scandal .  it   s just not done .      by now there appeared to be a competition to see who could terminally baffle who  or possibly whom  first .  but vimes managed to say     don   t you have a sister in the timber business .      it was amazing  he thought  that neither their mother nor sybil was as yet adding anything to the conversation .  and now another sister  possibly amanda .   looked about to speak .  why in the world did they all wear those silly diaphanous dresses .  you couldn   t hope to do a day   s work in something as skimpy as that .  amanda  possibly  said carefully     i   m afraid our sister is a bit of an embarrassment to the family  your grace .         what  for getting a job .  why .      another one of the girls  and vimes was in fact getting really confused at this point  said     well  commander  she has no hope of making a good marriage now     er  not to a gentleman .      this was becoming a tangle and so vimes said     tell me  ladies  what is a gentleman .      after some whispered conversation a sacrificial daughter said  very nervously     we understand the gentleman is a man who does not have to sully his hands by working .      adamantium is said to be the strongest of all metals  but it would have bent around the patience of sam vimes as he said  with every syllable carefully smelted     oh  a layabout .  and how do you go about snagging such a gentleman  pray .      now the girls looked as if they were indeed praying .  one of them managed to say     you see  commander  our dear late father was unlucky in the money market  and i   m afraid that until the death of great aunt marigold  of whom we have expectations  there is  alas  no money for a dowry for any of us .      the heavens held their breath while the concept of a dowry was explained to sam vimes  and ice formed on the windows as he sat in strangulated thought .   at last  he cleared his throat and said     ladies  the solution to your problem  in my opinion  would be to get off your quite attractive backsides  go out there in the world and make your own way .  a dowry .  you mean some man has to be paid to marry you .  what century do you think you   re living in .  is it just me  or is it the most bloody stupid thing you could ever imagine .     he glanced at the beautiful emily and thought  good grief  men would line up on the lawn to fight one another  my dear .  how come no one   s ever told you .  gentility is all very well  but practicality has its uses .  get out in the world and let the world see you and it might find a new word in its vocabulary such as  perhaps     wow .     aloud he continued     honestly  there are lots of jobs out there for a young lady with her wits about her .  the lady sybil free hospital is always on the lookout for sharp girls to train as nurses  for example .  good pay  very fetching uniforms  and a fine chance of snagging a skilled young physician who is on the way to the top  especially if you get your boot behind him .  plus  of course  as a nurse you inherit an amazingly large amount of amusing and embarrassing stories about things which people put     perhaps this is not the time  but anyway  there is also the possibility of becoming matron if you reach the specified weight .  a very responsible job  of use to the community at large and giving you at the end of a long day the satisfaction that you have done some good in the world .      vimes looked around at the pink and white faces contemplating a jump into the unknown and continued .     of course  if you really want to stick with bonnets  then sybil and i own a decent property in old cobblers  in the big city  which is standing empty .  used to be a tough area  but the upwardly mobile trolls and vampires are moving in right now  and the heavy dollar and the dark dollar are not to be sneezed at  especially because they   ll pay top dollar for what they want .  quite a sophisticated area  too .  people actually put tables and chairs out on the pavement and they don   t always all get stolen .  we could let you have it rent free for three months to see how you do and then maybe you   d have to learn the concept of rent  if only for your self respect .  trust me  ladies  self respect is what you get when you don   t have to spend your life waiting for some rich old lady to pop her clogs .  any takers .      vimes took as an optimistic sign the fact that the girls were staring at one another with what could only be called a wild surmise at the prospect of not being totally useless ornaments  and so he added     and whatever you do  stop reading bloody silly romantic novels .      there was  however  a pocket     or possibly purse     of resistance to the revolution .  one girl was standing by the curate as if she owned him .  she looked at vimes defiantly and said     please don   t think me forward  commander  but i   d rather like to marry jeremy and help him in his ministry .         very good  very good     said vimes     and you love him and he loves you .  speak up  the pair of you .     they both nodded  red with embarrassment  with one eye on the girl   s mother  whose wide grin suggested that would be a definite plus .     well then  i suggest you get yourselves sorted out  and you  young man  would be advised to find a better paying job .  can   t help you with that  but there are loads of religions these days  and if i were you i   d impress some bishop somewhere with my common sense  which is what a clergyman needs above everything else     well  nearly everything else  and remember there   s room at the top     although in the case of religion  not right at the top  eh .     vimes thought for a moment and added     but maybe the best idea  ladies  might be to take a look around a bit until you find some lad that   s got the makings of a successful man  noble or not  and if he suits then get behind him  support him as necessary  help him up when he   s down  and generally be around when he looks for you  and make certain that he   ll be around when you look for him .  well  if both of you put your backs into it then it might turn out to be something good .  it has certainly worked once before  hasn   t it  sybil .      sybil burst out laughing and the overwhelmed girls nodded dutifully as if they actually understood  but vimes was gratified to feel a gentle little prod from lady sybil that offered hope that he was not going to pay too high a price for speaking his mind to these precious flowers .   he looked around as if seeking to tidy things up .     well  that seems to be that  yes .         excuse me  commander .     it took vimes some time to see where the voice had come from  this daughter hadn   t spoken a word all afternoon  but had occasionally scribbled in a notebook .  now she gazed at him with a look somewhat brighter than those of her sisters .      can i help you  miss .  and perhaps you   ll tell me your name .         jane  commander .  i am endeavouring to be a writer .  may i ask if you have any views on that as an acceptable career for a young lady .      jane  thought vimes  the strange one .  and she was .  she was just as demure as the other sisters  but somehow as he looked at her he got the impression that she was seeing right through him  thoughts and all .   vimes leaned back in his chair  a little defensively  and said     well  it can   t be a difficult job  given that all the words have probably been invented already  so there   s a saving in time right there  considering that you simply have to put them together in a different order .     that was about the limit of his expertise in the literary arts  but he added     what sort of thing were you thinking of writing  jane .      the girl looked embarrassed .     well  commander  at the moment i   m working on what might be considered a novel about the complexities of personal relationships  with all their hopes and dreams and misunderstandings .     she coughed nervously  as if apologizing .   vimes pursed his lips .     yes .  sounds basically like a good idea  miss  but i can   t really help you on that     though if i was you  and this is me talking off the top of my head  i   d be putting in a lot of fighting  and dead bodies falling out of wardrobes     and maybe a war  perhaps  as a bit of background .      jane nodded uneasily .     a remarkable suggestion  commander  with much to recommend it  but possibly the relationships would be somewhat neglected .      vimes considered this input and said     well  you might be right .     then  out of nowhere  possibly some deep hole  a thought struck him  just as it had many times before  sometimes in nightmares .     i wonder if any author has thought about the relationship between the hunter and the hunted  the policeman and the mysterious killer  the lawman who must think like a criminal sometimes in order to do his job  and may be unpleasantly surprised at how good he is at such thinking  perhaps .  just an idea  you understand     he said lamely  and wondered where the hell it had come from .  maybe the strange jane had pulled it out of him and even  perhaps  could resolve it .      would anybody like more tea .     said ariadne brightly .   lady sybil was very quiet as their coach drove away  and so vimes decided to bite the bullet now and get it over with .  she was looking thoughtful  which was always worrying .      am i in trouble  sybil .      his wife looked at him blankly for a moment and then said     you mean for telling that bunch of precious blooms to stop yearning for a life and to get out there and make one .  good heavens  no .  you did everything i would have expected of you  sam .  you always do .  i told ariadne that you wouldn   t let her down .  she doesn   t have much of an income  and if you hadn   t given them the righteous word i think she would have eventually driven them out with a shovel .  no  sam  i just wonder what goes on in your head  that   s all .  i mean  i   m sure some people think being a policeman is just a job  but you don   t  do you .  i   m very proud of you  sam  and wouldn   t have you any other way  but i do worry sometimes .  anyway  well done .  i   ll look forward with interest to see what young jane writes .      next day  vimes took his little boy fishing  hampered somewhat by a total lack of knowledge of the art .  young sam didn   t seem to mind .  he had located a shrimping net among the largesse of the nursery and messed about in the shallows  chasing crayfish and sometimes going almost rigid in order to stare at things .  once he got over the shock  vimes noticed that young sam did this quite happily  and on one occasion pointed out to his doting father things in the stream    like insects in the water with a coat made of little pebbles     which vimes had to investigate  to find that this was entirely true .  this amazed sam vimes even more than it did his son  who in fact  he told his father as they strolled back for lunch  had been really looking to see if fish did a poo  a question that had never exercised sam vimes in his life  but appeared to be of great importance to his son .  so much so that on the way home he had to be restrained from doubling back to the stream to see if they got out to do it because otherwise  er  yuck .   sybil had promised young sam another trip around home farm in the afternoon  which left sam vimes to his own devices  or such devices as the policeman could find in the quiet lanes .  vimes was streetwise  he didn   t know what lanewise might entail  but possibly it would deal with things like throttling stoats and knowing whether whatever it was that had just said    moo    was a cow or a bull without having to bend down to find out .   and as he walked around his rolling acres on his aching feet  wishing that there were cobblestones under him  once again he could feel the tingle  the tingle that raises little hairs on a copper   s neck when his well honed senses tell him that there was something happening around here that shouldn   t be  and was crying out to have something done about it .   but there was another copper here  wasn   t there  a real old flatfoot let out to grass  but being a copper stained you to the bone  you never got rid of it .  he smiled .  time perhaps to go for a convivial drink with mr jiminy .   the goblin   s head was bare of customers at this time of day except the ever present trio on the bench outside .  vimes seated himself at the bar with a glass of mrs jiminy   s root beer and leaned confidentially towards the barman .     so  mister jiminy  what   s of interest here to an old copper .      jiminy opened his mouth  but vimes went on     rosewood truncheon  pseudopolis city watch .  i know i   m right .  it   s no crime .  that   s the copper   s dream  and you take your trusty truncheon with you to have a little friend you can depend on if the customer can   t hold his liquor and won   t take a hint .     vimes was now settled with one elbow on the bar and doodling on a small puddle of spilt beer .     but the job follows you  doesn   t it .  and if you run a pub  well  that goes double  because you hear all sorts of things  things you don   t do anything about because you aren   t a copper any more  except you know you are .  and it must worry you  somewhere in your soul  that there are things going wrong in these parts .  even i can tell .  it   s the copper   s nose .  i can smell it in the air .  it comes up through my boots .  secrets and lies  mister jiminy  secrets and lies .      jiminy made a point of wiping his cloth over the spilt beer and said  as if absent mindedly     you know  commander vimes  things are different in the country .  people think that the country is where you can go to hide out .  it ain   t so .  in the city you   re a face in the crowd .  in the country people will stare at you until you   re out of sight  just for the entertainment value .  like you say  i   m not a copper any more  i ain   t got a warrant card  and i ain   t got the inclination .  and now  if you don   t mind  i have some work to do .  there   ll be more customers soon .  watch where you tread  your grace .      vimes didn   t let him off the hook .     interesting thing  mister jiminy  i know you have the lease on this pub but  amazingly enough  i   m still your landlord .  i   m sorry about that  but before we came down here i looked at a map and saw a pub on our land  and what a waste  i thought  but that makes me your landlord .  not very republican of me  i know  but i just wonder  mister jiminy  if it may be that not everyone in these parts is that keen on having the commander of the city watch down here in this quiet little hideaway  hmm .     an image of poor old lord rust artlessly telling him that there was nothing here of interest passed across vimes   s inner vision .   jiminy   s expression was frozen  but vimes  who knew this game  saw that tiny twitch which  when decoded  meant     yes  but i didn   t say anything and no one can prove i did .  not even you  my friend .      further discussion on the point was interrupted when the sons of the soil began to come in  one by one  to celebrate the ending of the working day .  this time there was less suspicion in their eyes as they nodded to vimes en route to the bar  and so he sat nursing his pint of spiced up beetroot juice and just enjoyed the moment .  it was a very short moment  at the end of which the blacksmith swaggered into the bar and walked straight up to him .      you are sitting in my seat .      vimes looked around .  he was sitting on a bench that was indistinguishable from all the others in the room  but he accepted the possibility that there was something mystic about the one he was occupying  picked up his glass and strolled over to an unoccupied one  where he sat down just in time to hear the blacksmith say     that one   s my seat too  understand .      oh dear  here was the overture and beginners to a brawl  and vimes was no beginner  right enough  and the blacksmith   s eyes held the look of a man who wanted to punch somebody and very likely thought that vimes would make the ideal candidate .   he felt the gentle pressure of his own brass knuckles in his trouser pocket .  vimes had been economical with the truth when he promised his wife that he would not take any weapons on holiday with him .  however  he   d reasoned that a knuckleduster was not so much a weapon as a way of making certain that he stayed alive .  it could be called a defensive instrument  a kind of shield  as it were  especially if you needed to get your defence in before you were attacked .   he stood up .     mister jethro  i   d be grateful if you   d be so kind as to choose which chair is yours for the evening  thank you very much  after which i intend to enjoy my drink in peace .      whoever said that a soft answer turneth away wrath had never worked in a bar .  the blacksmith glowered at about the same temperature as his forge .     i ain   t jethro to you  not by a long way .  you can call me mister jefferson  do you hear .         and you can call me sam vimes .     he watched jefferson very deliberately place his drink on the bar before he strode towards vimes .      i know what i can call you  mister         vimes felt the smooth brass of the surrogate knuckles  polished as they had been by years of abrasion from his pants and  needless to say  the occasional chin .  as he dug down  they almost leapt to his grasp .      sorry about this  your grace     said jiminy as he pushed him gently out of the way and said to the smith .     well now  jethro  what   s this all about  then .         your grace .     sneered jethro .     i ain   t going to call you that .  i ain   t going to lick your boots like all the others do .  coming back here  lording it over us  ordering us about as if you owned the place .  and that   s it  isn   t it .  you do own the place .  one man with all this country .  that   s not right .  you tell me  how did that happen .  go on  you tell me .      vimes shrugged .     well  i   m not an expert  but as i understand it my wife   s ancestors fought somebody for it .      the blacksmith   s face bloomed with an evil pleasure as he threw off his leather apron .     well  okay .  no problem .  that   s how it   s done  is it .  fair enough .  tell you what i   ll do  i   ll fight you for it  here and now  and  tell you what i   ll do  i   ll fight you with one hand strapped behind my back  on account of you being a bit shorter than me .      vimes heard a slight wooden sound behind him  it was the sound of a barman stealthily pulling a two foot long rosewood truncheon from its accustomed place under the bar .   jethro must have heard it too  because he called out     and don   t you try anything with that  jim .  you know i   ll have it out of your hands before you know what   s happening  and this time i   ll shove it where the sun doesn   t shine .      vimes took a look at the rest of the clientele  who were doing remarkable impersonations of stone statues .     look     he said     you really don   t want to fight me .         i do  indeed i do .  you said it yourself .  some ancestor got all of this by fighting for it  yeah .  who said it   s the time to stop fighting .         burleigh and stronginthearm  sir     said a polite yet chilly voice behind the big man .  to vimes   s shock it was willikins .     i   m not cruel  sir  i won   t shoot you in the guts  but i will make you realize how much you took your toes for granted .  no  please do not make any sudden movements .  burleigh and stronginthearm crossbows have notoriously responsive triggers .      vimes resumed breathing again when jethro raised his hands .  somewhere in all that rage there must have been a halfpennyworth of self preservation .  nevertheless the blacksmith glared at him and said     you need to be protected by a hired killer  do you .         in point of fact  sir     said willikins smoothly     i am employed by commander vimes as a gentleman   s gentleman  and i require this crossbow because sometimes his socks fight back .     he looked at vimes .     do you have any instructions  commander .     and then he shouted     don   t move  mister  because as far as i know a blacksmith needs two hands to work with .     he turned back to vimes .     do excuse that interjection  commander  but i know his sort .         willikins  i rather think you are his sort .         yes  sir  thank you  sir  and i wouldn   t trust me one little inch  sir .  i knows a bad one when i sees them .  i have a mirror .         now  i want you to put that bloody thing down  willikins .  people could get hurt .     vimes said in his formal voice .      yes  sir  that would have been my intention .  i could not face her ladyship if anything had happened to you .      vimes looked from willikins to jethro .  here was a boil that needed lancing .  but you couldn   t blame the lad .  it wasn   t as if he hadn   t thought the same way himself  many times .     willikins     he said     please put that wretched thing down carefully and get out your notebook .  thank you .  now please write down as follows     i  samuel vimes  somewhat reluctantly the duke of ankh  do intend to duke it out  ha ha  with my friend jethro        what   s your full name again  jethro .         now look here  mister  i didn   t           i asked you your damn name  mister .  jiminy  what   s his surname .         jefferson     said the landlord  holding his truncheon like a security blanket .     but look  your grace  you don   t want to go         vimes ignored him and went on     now where was i .  oh  yes     my friend jethro jefferson  in a friendly fight for the ownership of the manor and environs  whatever the hell they are  which will go to the which of us that does not first cry    uncle     and should it be myself that utters the same  there will be no repercussions of any sort upon my friend jethro  or on my man willikins  who pleaded with me not to engage in this friendly bout of fisticuffs .     got that  willikins .  i   ll even give you a get out of jail free card to show to her ladyship if i get bruised .  now give it to me to sign .      willikins handed over the notebook with reluctance .     i don   t think it   ll work on her ladyship  sir .  look  dukes aren   t expected to go around       his voice faltered in the face of vimes   s smile .      you were going to say that dukes shouldn   t fight  weren   t you  willikins .  and if you had  i would have said that the word    duke    absolutely means that you do fight .         oh  very well  sir     said willikins     but perhaps you ought to warn him      .      willikins was interrupted by the pub   s customers pushing their way out at speed and running through the village  leaving jethro standing alone and bewildered .  halfway towards the man  vimes turned to look back at willikins and said     you may think you see me lighting a cigar  willikins  but on this occasion  i think  your eyes may turn out to be at fault  do you understand .         yes  and in fact i am deaf as well  commander .         good lad .  now let   s get outside where there   s less glass and a better view .      jethro looked like a man who had had the ground cut from under his feet but didn   t know how to fall down .   vimes lit his cigar and savoured  just for a moment  the forbidden fruit .  then he offered the packet to the blacksmith  who waved it away without a word .      very sensible     said vimes .     now then  i   d better tell you that at least once a week  even these days  i have to fight people who   re trying to kill me with everything from swords to chairs and in one case a very large salmon .  they probably don   t actually want to kill me  but they   ll try to stop me arresting them .  look     he waved a hand at the landscape in general     all this     stuff  just happened  whether i wanted it to or not .  by trade i   m just a copper .         yeah     said jethro  glaring at him .     stamping on the faces of the struggling masses .      vimes was used to this sort of thing  and put it mildly .     can   t tread on their faces these days  my grinder gets in the way .  all right  not very funny  i admit .     vimes was aware that people were coming back down the lane .  they included women and children .  it looked as though the pub   s clientele had roused the neighbourhood .  he turned to jethro .     are we going to do this by the marquis of fantailer   s rules .         what are they .     said the blacksmith  waving at the oncoming horde .      rules of sparring by the marquis of fantailer     said vimes .      if they was written by a marquis i don   t want no truck with them .      vimes nodded .     willikins .         i heard that  commander  and have recorded it in my notebook     refused fantailer    .         well then  mister jefferson     said vimes .     i suggest we ask mister jiminy to start the proceedings .         i want your lackey to write down in that book of his that my mum won   t get put out of her cottage  whatever happens  right .         it   s a deal     said vimes .     willikins  please make a memorandum that mister jefferson   s old mum should not be thrown out of her cottage  hit with sticks  put in the stocks or otherwise manhandled in any way  understand .      willikins  trying ineffectually to hide a smile  licked his pencil and wrote industriously .  vimes  less noisily  made a mental note and the note said     the ferocity is draining out of this lad .  he is wondering if he actually might get killed .  i haven   t thrown a punch  not one little punch  and he is already preparing for the worst .  of course  the right way to go about it is to prepare for the best .      the crowd was growing by the second .  even as vimes looked on  people came down the lane carrying a very old man on a mattress  their progress accelerated by his delight in hitting them on the back of the legs with his walking stick .  mothers towards the back of the crowd were holding up their children for a better look and  all unknown  every man had a weapon .  it was like a peasants    revolt  without the revolt and with a very polite class of peasant .  men touched their forelocks when vimes looked in their direction  women curtsied  or at least bobbed up and down a bit  disturbingly out of sequence  like organ pedals trembling .   jiminy approached vimes and the blacksmith cautiously and  to judge by the glistening of his face  very apprehensively .     now then  gents  i   m choosing to consider this a little demonstration of fisticuffs  a jolly trial of strength and prowess such as may be found on any summer evening  all friends under the skin  okay .     there was a pleading look in his eyes as he went on .     and when you   ve got it out of your systems there   ll be a pint waiting for each of you on the bar .  please don   t break anything .     he produced an overused handkerchief from a waistcoat pocket and held it in the air .     when this touches the ground  gentlemen        he said  backing away very quickly .   the slip of linen seemed to defy gravity for a while  but the moment it touched the ground vimes caught the blacksmith   s boot in both hands as it swung towards him and said very quietly to the struggling man     a bit previous  weren   t you .  and what good has it done you .  hear them all sniggering .  i   ll let you off  this time .      vimes gave a push as he loosened his grip on the foot  causing jethro to stagger backwards .  vimes felt a certain pleasure in seeing the man losing it this early  but the blacksmith pulled himself together and rushed at him  and paused  possibly because vimes was grinning .      that   s the ticket  my lad     said vimes     you just saved yourself a dreadful pain in the unmentionables .     he made fists and beckoned suggestively to his bewildered adversary over the top of his left fist .  the man came swinging and got a kick on the kneecap  which floored him  and he was picked up by vimes  which metaphorically floored him again .      whyever did you think i was going to box .  that   s what we professionals call misdirection .  you want to go for the hug .  i would if i were a big bloke like you  but you ain   t going to get the chance .     vimes shook his head sorrowfully .     should have gone for the marquis of fantailer .  i believe that has been carved on many a gravestone .     he took a generous pull of his cigar  the ash had yet to be disturbed .   enraged beyond belief  jethro threw himself at vimes and caught a glancing blow to his head  receiving at almost the same time a knee in the stomach which knocked all the breath out of him .  they went down together with vimes as the conductor of this orchestra .  he made certain he ended on top  where he leaned down and hissed into jethro   s ear     let   s see how smart you are  shall we .  are you a man who can control his temper .     cos if you aren   t  then i   ll give you a nose so wide that you   ll have to hold your handkerchief on the end of a stick .  don   t you  for one moment  think i   m not capable of it .  but i reckon a blacksmith knows when to cool the metal  and i   m giving you a chance to say that at least you got the duke on the floor in front of all your friends  and we   ll stand up and shake hands like the gentlemen neither of us is  and the crowd will cheer and go into the pub to get happily ratted on the beer that i shall pay for .  are we men of one accord .      there was a muffled    yes     and vimes stood up  took the blacksmith   s hand in his and raised it up high  which caused some slight puzzlement  but when he then said     sam vimes invites you all to take a drink with him in mister jiminy   s establishment .     everybody shrugged bewilderment aside to make room for the beer .  the crowd surged into the pub  leaving the blacksmith and vimes on their own     plus willikins  who could be remarkably self effacing when he wanted .      blacksmiths should know about temper  too     said vimes  as the crowd dispersed pubwards .     sometimes cool is better than hot .  i don   t know anything much about you  mister jefferson  but the city watch needs people who learn fast and i reckon you would soon make it to sergeant .  we could use you as a smith  too .  it   s amazing how dented the old armour can get when you   re standing on the faces of the poor .      jethro stared down at his boots .     all right  you can beat me in a fight  but that doesn   t mean it   s right  all right .  you don   t know the half of it .      there were sounds of merriment coming from the pub .  vimes wondered how embroidered that little scuffle would turn out to be .  he turned back to the smith  who hadn   t moved .     listen to me  you stupid young fool  i wasn   t born with a silver spoon in my mouth .  when i was a kid the only spoons i ever saw were made of wood and you were lucky if there was some edible food on the end of them .  i was a street kid  understand .  if i had been dumped out here i would have thought it was paradise  what with food jumping out on you from every hedge .  but i became a copper because they paid you and i was taught how to be a copper by decent coppers  because believe me  mister  i wake every night knowing that i could have been something else .  then i found a good lady and if i were you  kid  i   d hope that i   d find one of them  too .  so i smartened myself up and then one day lord vetinari     you have heard of him  haven   t you  kid .  well  he needed a man to get things done  and the title opens doors so that i don   t actually have to kick them open myself  and do you know what .  i reckon my boots have seen so much crime down the years that they walk me towards it of their own accord  and i know there   s something that needs kicking .  so do you  i can smell it on you .  tell me what it is .      jethro still stared at his own boots and said nothing .   willikins cleared his throat .     i wonder  commander  if it might help if i had a little talk with the young man  from what you might call a less elevated position .  why don   t you take a look at the beauties of the local countryside .      vimes nodded .     by all means  if you think it   ll do some good .      and he went away and examined a honeysuckle hedge with considerable interest  while willikins  with his shiny gentleman   s gentleman shoes and his immaculate jacket  strolled over to jethro  put an arm around him and said     this is a stiletto i   m holding to your throat and it ain   t no ladies    shoe  this is the real thing  the cutting edge  as it were .  you are a little twit  and i ain   t the commander and i will slice you to the bone if you make a move .  got that .  now don   t nod your head .  good  we are learning  aren   t we .  now  my lad  the commander here is trusted by the diamond king of trolls and the low king of the dwarfs  who would only have to utter a word for your measly carcass to come under the caress of a large number of versatile axes  and by lady margolotta of uberwald  who trusts very few people  and by lord vetinari of ankh morpork  who doesn   t trust anybody at all .  got that .  don   t nod .  and you  my little man  have the damn nerve to doubt his word .  i   m an easygoing sort of fellow  but that sort of thing leaves me right out of sorts  i don   t mind telling you .  you understand .  i said  do you understand .  oh  all right  you can nod now .  incidentally  young man  be careful who you call a lackey  all right .  some people might take violent exception to that sort of thing .  a word to the wise  lad  i know the commander  and you thought about your old mum and what might happen to her and i reckon that is why i won   t be seeing you in lavender  because he is a sensitive soul at heart .      willikins    knife disappeared as quickly as it had come  and with the other hand the gentleman   s gentleman produced a small brush and tidied the blacksmith   s collar .      willikins     said vimes from the distance     will you go for a little walk now  please .      when his manservant was loitering under a tree a little way further up the lane  vimes said     sorry about that  but every man has his pride .  i bear that in mind .  so should you .  i   m a copper  a policeman  and something here is calling to me .  it seems to me that you have something you   d like me to know and it   s not just about who sits in the high castle  am i right .  something bad has happened  you are practically sweating it .  well .      jethro leaned towards him and said     dead man   s copse  on the hill .  midnight .  i won   t wait .      the blacksmith then turned round and walked away without a glance behind .   vimes lit a fresh cigar and strolled towards the tree where willikins was appearing to enjoy the landscape .  he straightened up when he saw vimes .     we   d better get a move on  sir .  dinner is at eight o   clock and her ladyship would like you to be smart .  she sets a lot of store by your being smartly turned out  sir .      vimes groaned .     not the official tights .         happily not  sir  not in the country  but her ladyship was very specific about my bringing the plum coloured evening dress  sir .         she says it makes me look dashing     said vimes morosely .     do you think it makes me look dashing .  am i a dashing kind of person  would you say .     the birds started singing from a low branch of the tree .      i   d put you down as more the sprinting sort  sir     said willikins .   they set off home  in silence for a while  which is to say that neither man spoke while wildlife sang  buzzed and screeched  eventually causing vimes to say     i wish i knew what the hell all those things are .      willikins put his head on one side for a moment  then said     parkinson   s warbler  the deep throated frog eater and the common creed waggler  sir .         you know .         oh  yes  sir .  i frequent the music halls  sir  and there   s always a bird or animal impersonator on the bill .  it tends to stick .  i also know seventy three farmyard noises  my favourite of which is the sound of a farmer who has had one boot sucked from his foot by the muck he   s trying to avoid and has nowhere else to put his stockinged foot but in the said muck .  hugely amusing  sir .      they had reached the long drive to the hall now  and gravel crunched beneath their boots .  under his breath  vimes said     i   ve arranged to meet young mister jefferson at midnight in the copse on hangman   s hill .  he wishes to tell me something important .  remind me  willikins  what is a copse  exactly .         anything between a clump of trees and a small wood .  technically  sir  the one at the top of hangman   s hill is a beech hanger .  that just means  well  a small beech wood on top of a hill .  you remember mad jack ramkin .  the bloke that got it made thirty feet higher at great expense .  he had the beech trees planted on the top .      vimes liked the crunching of the gravel  it would mask the sound of their conversation .     i talked to the blacksmith with  i would swear  no one else in earshot .  but this is the country  yes  willikins .         there was a man setting rabbit snares in the hedge behind you     said willikins .     perfectly normal activity  although to my mind he took too long over it .      they crunched onwards for a while  and vimes said     tell me  willikins .  if a man had arranged to meet another man at midnight in a place with a name like dead man   s copse  on hangman   s hill  what would you consider to be his most sensible course of action  given that his wife had forbidden him to bring weapons to his country house .      willikins nodded .     why  sir  given your maxim that everything is a weapon if you choose to think of it as such  i would advise said man to see whether he has a compatriot what has  for example  acquired the keys to a cabinet that contains a number of superbly made carving knives  ideal for close fighting  and i personally would include a side order of cheesewire  sir  in conformance with my belief that the only important thing in a fight to the death is that the death should not be yours .         can   t carry cheesewire  man .  not the commander of the watch .         quite so  commander  and may i therefore advise your brass knuckles     the gentleman   s alternative .  i know you never travel without them  sir .  there   s some vicious people around and i know you have to be among them .         look  willikins  i don   t like to involve you in all this .  it   s only a hunch  after all .      willikins waved this away .     you wouldn   t keep me out of it for a big clock  sir  because all this is tickling my fancy as well .  i shall lay out a selection of cutting edges for you in your dressing room  sir  and i myself will go up to the copse half an hour before you   re due to be there  with my trusty bow and an assortment of favourite playthings .  it   s nearly a full moon  clear skies  there   ll be shadows everywhere  and i   ll be standing in the darkest one of them .      vimes looked at him for a moment and said     could i please amend that suggestion .  could you not be there in the second darkest shadow one hour before midnight  to see who steps into the darkest shadow .         ah yes  that   s why you command the watch  sir     said willikins  and to vimes   s shock there was a hint of a tear in the man   s voice .     you   re listening to the street  aren   t you  sir  yes .      vimes shrugged .     no streets here  willikins .      willikins shook his head .     once a street boy always a street boy  sir .  it comes with us  in the pinch .  mothers go  fathers go     if we ever knew who they were     but the street  well  the street looks after us .  in the pinch it keeps us alive .      willikins darted ahead of vimes and rang the doorbell  so that the footman had the door open by the time vimes came up the steps .     you   ve got just enough time to listen to young sam read to you  sir     willikins added  making his way up the stairs .     wonderful thing  reading  i wish i   d learned it when i was a kid .  her ladyship will be in her dressing room and guests will be arriving in about half an hour .  must go  sir .  i   ve got to teach that fat toad of a butler his manners  sir .      vimes winced .     you   re not allowed to strangle butlers  willikins .  i   m sure i read it in a book of etiquette .      willikins gave him a look of mock offence .     no garrotting will be involved  sir     he said  opening the door to vimes   s dressing room     but he is a snob of the first water .  never did meet a butler who wasn   t .  i just have to give him an orientation lesson .         well  he is the butler  and this is his house     said vimes .      no  sir  it   s your house  and since i am your personal manservant i  by the irrevocable laws of the servants    hall  outrank every one of the lazy buggers .  i   ll show them how we do things in the real world  sir  don   t you worry        he was interrupted by a heavy knock at the door  followed by a determined rattling of the doorknob .  willikins opened the door and young sam stomped in and announced     reading .      vimes picked up his son and sat him on a chair .     how was your afternoon  my lad .         do you know     said young sam  as if imparting the results of strict research     cows do really big floppy poos  but sheep do small poos  like chocolates .      vimes tried not to look at willikins  who was shaking with suppressed laughter .  he managed to keep his own expression solemn and said     well  of course  sheep are smaller .      young sam considered this .     cow poos go flop     he said .     it never said that in where   s my cow .     young sam   s voice betrayed a certain annoyance that this important information had been withheld .     miss felicity beedle wouldn   t have left it out .      vimes sighed .     i just bet she wouldn   t .      willikins opened the door .     i   ll leave you gentlemen to it  then  and see you later  sir .         willikins .     said vimes  just as the man had his hand on the doorknob .     you appear to think that my brass knuckles are inferior to yours .  is that so .      willikins smiled .     you   ve never really agreed with the idea of the spiked ones  have you  sir .     he carefully shut the door behind him .   young sam was already reading by himself these days  which was a great relief .  fortunately the works of miss felicity beedle did not consist solely of exciting references to poo  in all its manifestations  but her output of small volumes for young children was both regular and highly popular  at least among the children .  this was because she had researched her audience with care  and young sam had laughed his way through the wee wee men  the war with the snot goblins  and geoffrey and the land of poo .  for boys of a certain age  they hit the squashy spot .  at the moment he was giggling and choking his way through the boy who didn   t know how to pick his own scabs  an absolute hoot for a boy just turned six .  sybil pointed out that the books were building young sam   s vocabulary  and not just about lavatorial matters  and it was indeed true that he was beginning  with encouragement  to read books in which nobody had a bowel movement at all .  which  when you came to think about it  was a mystery all by itself .   vimes carried his son to bed after ten minutes of enjoyable listening  and had managed to shave and get into the feared evening clothes a few moments before his wife knocked on the door .  separate dressing rooms and bathrooms  vimes thought     if you had the money  there was no better way to keep a happy marriage happy .  and in order to keep a happy marriage happy he allowed sybil to bustle in  wearing  in fact  a bustle    to adjust his shirt  tweak his collar and make him fit for company .   and then she said     i understand you gave the blacksmith a short lesson in unarmed combat  my dear        the pause hung in the air like a silken noose .   vimes managed     there   s something wrong here  i know it .         i think so  too     said sybil .      you do .         yes  sam  but this is not the time .  we have guests arriving at any minute .  if you could refrain from throwing any of them over your shoulder in between courses i would be grateful .     this was a terrific scolding by sybil   s normally placid standards .  vimes did what any prudent husband would do  which was dynamically nothing .  suddenly all downstairs was full of voices and the noise of carriages crunching over the gravel .  sybil trimmed her sails and headed down to be the gracious hostess .   despite what his wife liked to imply  vimes was rather good at dinners  having sat through innumerable civic affairs in ankh morpork .  the trick was to let the other diners do the talking while agreeing with them occasionally  giving himself time to think about other things .   sybil had made certain that this evening   s dinner was a light occasion .  the guests were mostly people of a certain class who lived in the country but were not  as it were  of it .  retired warriors  a priest of om  miss pickings  a spinster  together with her companion  a strict looking lady with short hair and a man   s shirt and pocket watch  and  yes  miss felicity beedle .  vimes thought he had put his foot in it when he said     oh yes  the poo lady     but she burst out laughing and shook his hand  saying     don   t worry  your grace  i wash mine thoroughly after writing .     and it was a big laugh .  she was a small woman with the strange aspect that you see in some people that causes them to appear to be subtly vibrating even when standing perfectly still .  you felt that if some interior restraint suddenly broke  the pent up energy released would catapult her through the nearest window .   miss beedle prodded him in the stomach .     and you are the famous commander vimes .  come to arrest us all  have you .     of course  you got this all the time if you didn   t stop sybil accepting the invitation to yet another posh society do .  but while miss beedle laughed  silence fell on the other guests like a cast iron safe .  they were scowling at miss beedle  and miss beedle was staring intently at vimes  and vimes knew that expression .  it was the expression of somebody with a story to tell .  certainly this was no time to broach the subject  and so vimes filed it under    interesting    .   whatever vimes   s misgivings  ramkin hall did a damn good dinner and     and this was the important thing     the dictates of popular social intercourse decreed that sybil had to allow a menu full of things that would not be permitted at home if vimes had asked for them .  it   s one thing to act as arbiter of your own husband   s tastes  but it is frowned on to do the same to your guests .   across the table from him a retired military man was being assured by his wife that he did not  contrary to what he himself believed  like potted shrimps .  in vain the man protested weakly that he thought he did like potted shrimps  to get the gentle response     you may like potted shrimps  charles  but they do not like you .      vimes felt for the man  who seemed puzzled at having developed enemies among the lower crustacea .     well  er  does lobster like me  dear .     he said  in a voice that did not express much hope .      no  dear  it does not get on with you at all .  remember what happened at the parsleys    whist evening .      the man looked at the groaning sideboard and tried     do you think the scallops could get on with me for five minutes or so .         good heavens no  charles .      he cast a glance at the sideboard again .     i expect the green salad is my bosom friend  though  isn   t it .         absolutely  dear .         yes  i thought so .      the man looked across at vimes and gave him a hopeless grin followed by     i am given to believe that you are a policeman  your grace .  that right .      vimes took proper stock of him for the first time  a whiskery old warrior  now out to grass     and that was probably all his wife was going to let him eat without an argument .  he had burn scars on his face and hands and the accent of pseudopolis .  easy .     you were with the light dragons  weren   t you  sir .      the old man looked pleased .     well done  that man .  not many people remember us .  alas  i   m the only one left .  colonel charles augustus makepeace     strange name for a military man  or perhaps not  i don   t know .     he sniffed .     we   re just a scorched page in the history of warfare .  i dare say you haven   t read my memoirs  twenty four years without eyebrows .  no .  well  you are not alone in that  i have to say .  met your missus in those days .  she told us it would be totally impossible to breed dragons stable enough for use in warfare .  she was right  and no mistake .  of course  we went on trying  because that   s the military way .         you mean  pile dreadful failure on top of failure .     said vimes .   the colonel laughed .     well  it works sometimes .  i still keep a few dragons  though .  wouldn   t be without    em .  a day without a singe is a day without sunshine .  they   re a great saving in matches  and  of course  they keep undesirables away  too .      vimes reacted like an angler who  after some time dozing by the water   s edge  felt that the fish were rising .      oh  you don   t get many of them around here  surely .         you think so .  you don   t know the half of it  young man .  i can tell you a few stories        he stopped talking abruptly  and vimes   s experience of husbandry told him that the man had just been kicked under the table by his wife  who did not look happy and  to judge by the lines on her face  probably never had .  she leaned past her husband  who was now accepting another brandy from the waiter  and said  icily     as a policeman  your grace  does your jurisdiction extend to the shires .      another ring in the water  thought the angler inside vimes   s head .  he said     no  madam  my beat is ankh morpork and some of the surrounding area .  traditionally  however  the policeman drags his jurisdiction with him if he is in hot pursuit in connection with crime committed within his domain .  but  of course  ankh morpork is a long way from here  and i doubt if i   d be able to run that far .     this got a laugh from the table in general and a thin lipped smile from mrs colonel .   play the fish  play the fish        nevertheless     vimes continued     if i was to witness an arrestable offence here and now  i   d have the authority to make an arrest .  like a citizen   s arrest  but somewhat more professional  and after that i   d be required to turn the suspect over to the local force or other suitable authority  as i deemed fit .      the clergyman  whom vimes had noticed out of the corner of his eye  was taking an interest in this conversation and leaned forward to say     as you deem fit  your grace .         my grace would not come into it  sir .  as a sworn member of the ankh morpork city watch it would be my bounden duty to ensure the safety of my suspect .  ideally i   d look for a lock up .  we don   t have them in the city any more  but i understand most rural areas still do  even if they only hold drunks and escaped pigs .      there was laughter  and miss beedle said     we do have a village constable  your grace  and he keeps pigs in the lock up down by the old bridge .      she looked brightly at vimes  whose expression was stony .  he said     does he ever put people in there .  does he have a warrant card .  does he have a badge .         well  he puts the occasional drunk in there to sober up  and he says the pigs don   t seem to mind  but i have no idea what a warrant card is .      there was more laughter at this but it faded quickly  sucked into nowhere by vimes   s implacable silence .   then he said     i would not consider him to be a policeman  and until i found that he was working within a framework of proper law enforcement i would regard him not as a policeman by my standards but as a slightly bossy street cleaner .  of some use  but not a policeman .         by your standards  your grace .     said the clergyman .      yes  sir  by my standards .  my decision .  my responsibility .  my experience .  my arse if things go wrong .         but  your grace  as you say  you are outside your jurisdiction here     said mrs colonel gently .   vimes could sense her husband   s nervousness  and it was certainly not to do with the food .  the man was wishing heartily that he wasn   t there .  it was funny how people always wanted to talk to policemen about crime  and never realize what strange little signals their anxieties betrayed .   he turned to the man   s wife  smiled and said     but as i   ve said  madam  if a copper comes across a flagrant crime his jurisdiction reaches out to him like an old friend .  and do you mind if we change the subject .  no offence meant to any of you ladies and gentlemen  but over the years i   ve noticed that bankers and military men and merchants all get a chance to eat their dinners at their leisure at affairs like this  while the poor old copper has to talk about police work  which is most of the time rather dull .     he smiled again to keep everything friendly  and went on     exceedingly dull around here  i would imagine .  from my point of view  this place is as quiet as the     grave .     score  one wince from the dear old colonel  and the priest looking down at his plate  although the latter shouldn   t be taken too seriously  he thought  because you seldom saw a clergyman who couldn   t strike sparks with his knife and fork .   sybil  using her hostess voice  shattered the silence like an icebreaker .     i think it   s time for the main course     she said     which will be superb mutton avec no talking about police work at all .  honestly  if you get sam going he   ll quote the laws and ordinances of ankh morpork and force standing orders until you throw a cushion at him .      well done  vimes thought  at least i can now eat my dinner in peace .  he relaxed as the conversation around him became less fraught and once again replete with the everyday gossip and grumblings about other people living in the area  the difficulties with servants  the prospects for the harvest and  oh yes  the trouble with goblins .   vimes paid attention then .  goblins .  the city watch appeared to contain at least one member of every known bipedal sapient species plus one nobby nobbs .  it had become a tradition  if you could make it as a copper  then you could make it as a species .  but nobody had ever once suggested that vimes should employ a goblin  the simple reason being that they were universally known to be stinking  cannibalistic  vicious  untrustworthy bastards .   of course  everybody knew that dwarfs were a chiselling bunch who would swindle you if they could  and that trolls were little more than thugs  and the city   s one resident medusa would never look you in the face  and the vampires couldn   t be trusted  however much they smiled  and werewolves were only vampires who couldn   t fly  when you got right down to it  and the man next door was a real bastard who threw his rubbish over your wall and his wife was no better than she should be .  but then again it took all sorts to make a world .  it was not as if you were prejudiced because  after all  there had been an orc working at the university  but he liked his football  didn   t he just  and you could forgive anyone who could score from the centre spot and  well  you took as you found     but not bloody goblins  thank you very much .  people hounded them out if they came into the city and they tended to end up downriver  working for the likes of harry king in the bone grinding  leather tanning and scrap metal industries .  a fair walk outside the city gates and so outside the law .   and now there were some in the vicinity of the hall  as evidenced by chickens and cats disappearing  and so on .  well  probably  but vimes remembered when people said that trolls stole chickens .  there was nothing of interest to a troll in a chicken .  it would be like humans eating plaster .  he certainly did not mention any of this .   yes  no one had a good word to say about goblins  but miss beedle had no word to say at all .  her gaze remained firmly fixed on vimes   s face .  you could read a dining table if you learned the knack and if you were a policeman then you could build a clear picture of what each diner thought about the others .  it was all in the looks .  the things said or not said .  the people who were in the magic circle and the people who weren   t .  miss beedle was an outsider  tolerated  because obviously there is such a thing as good manners  but not exactly included .  what was the phrase .  not one of us .   vimes realized that he was staring at miss beedle just as she was staring at him .  they both smiled  and he thought that an inquisitive man would go and see the nice lady who had written the books that his little boy enjoyed so much and not because she looked like somebody prepared to blow so many whistles that it would sound like a pipe band .   miss beedle frowned a lot when the talk was about goblins  and occasionally people  especially the people he had tagged as mrs colonel  would cast a look at her as one might glance at a child who was doing something wrong .   and so he maintained a nice exterior air of attention while at the same time sifting through the affairs of the day .  the process was interrupted by mrs colonel saying     by the way  your grace  we were very pleased to hear that you gave jefferson a drubbing this afternoon .  the man is insufferable .  he upsets people .         well  i noticed that he   s not afraid to air his views     said vimes     but nor are we  are we .         but surely you of all people  your grace     said the clergyman  looking up earnestly     cannot possibly believe that jack is as good as his master .         depends on jack .  depends on the master .  depends what you mean by good     said vimes .     i suppose i was a jack  but when it comes to the ankh morpork city watch  i am the master .      mrs colonel was about to answer when lady sybil said brightly     talking of which  sam  i had a letter from a mrs wainwright commending you highly .  remind me to show it to you .      all long term couples have their code .  classically there is one that the wife uses in polite conversation to warn her husband that  because of hasty dressing  or absent mindedness  he is becoming exposed in the crotch department .     in the case of vimes and lady sybil  any mention of mrs wainwright was a code that meant     if you don   t stop annoying people  sam vimes  then there will be a certain amount of marital discord later this evening .      but this time sam vimes wanted the last word  and said     in fact  come to think of it  i know quite a few risen jacks in various places  and let me tell you  they often make better masters than their erstwhile masters ever did .  all they needed was a chance .         do remind me to show you the letter  sam .      vimes gave in  and the arrival of the ice cream pudding lowered the temperature somewhat  especially since her ladyship made certain that everybody   s glasses remained filled     and in the case of the colonel this meant an extremely regular top up .  vimes would have liked to talk to him further  but he too was under wifely orders .  the man had definitely had something important on his mind that caused the presence of a policeman to make him very nervous indeed .  and the nervousness was apparently catching .   this wasn   t a posh affair  by any means .  sybil had organized this little party before building up to anything more lavish  and some fairly amicable goodbyes were being said long before eleven .  vimes listened intently to the colonel and his wife as they walked  in his case unsteadily  to their carriage .  all he heard  however  was a hissed     you had the stable door open all evening .      followed by a growled     but the horse was fast asleep  my dear .      when the last carriage had been waved away and the big front door firmly shut  sybil said     well  sam  i understand  i really do  but they were our guests .         i know  and i   m sorry  but it   s as if they don   t think .  i just wanted to shake their ideas up a bit .      lady sybil examined a sherry bottle and topped up her glass .     surely you don   t think that the blacksmith really had the right to fight you for this house .      sam wished that he could drink  right now .     no  of course not .  i mean  there wouldn   t be an end to it .  people have been winning and losing on the old roulette wheel of fate for thousands of years .  i know that  but you know that i think that if you   re going to stop the wheel then you have to spare some thought for the poor buggers who   re sitting on zero .      his wife gently took his hand .     but we endowed the hospital  sam .  you know how expensive that is .  dr lawn will train up anyone who shows an aptitude for medicine  even if they  in his words  turn up with the arse hanging out of their trousers .  he   s even letting girls train .  as doctors .  he even employs igorinas .  we   re changing things  sam  a bit at a time  by helping people help themselves .  and look at the watch .  these days a kid is proud to say that his father or even his mother is a watchman .  and people need pride .      vimes grasped her hand .  he said     thank you for being kind to the boy from cockbill street .      she laughed this away .     i waited a long time for you to turn up  samuel vimes  and i don   t intend to let you go to waste .      this seemed to sam vimes a good time to say     you don   t mind if willikins and i take a little stroll to dead man   s copse before i go to bed .      lady sybil gave him the smile women give to husbands and small boys .     well  i can hardly say no  and there is a strange atmosphere .  i   m glad willikins is involved .  and it   s very pleasant up there .  perhaps you   ll hear the nightingale .      vimes gave her a little kiss before going up to change and said     actually  dear  i   m hoping to hear a canary .      probably no duke or even commander of the city watch had found in their dressing room anything like that which lay on the bed of sam vimes right now .  pride of place was for a billhook  which was a useful agricultural implement .  he had seen a couple of them being carried earlier in the day .  he reminded himself that    agricultural implement    did not mean    not a weapon    .  they turned up sometimes among the street gangs and were almost as much to be feared as a troll with a headache .   then there was a truncheon .  vimes   s own truncheon  which his manservant had thoughtfully brought along .  of course  it had silver work on it because it was the ceremonial truncheon of the commander of the watch  and wasn   t a weapon at all  oh dear me  no .  on the other hand  vimes knew himself not to be a cheese monger and therefore it would be somewhat difficult to explain why he had a foot of cheesewire about his person .  that was going to stay here  but he   d take the billhook .  it was a pretty poor lookout if a man walking on his own land couldn   t take the opportunity to trim a branch or two .  but what to make of the pile of bamboo which resolved itself into a breastplate of articulated sections and a most unfetching bamboo helmet .  there was a small note on the bed .  it said  in willikins    handwriting  the gamekeeper   s friend  commander .  yours too .  .  .   vimes grunted and hit the breastplate with his truncheon .  it flexed like a living thing and the truncheon bounced across the room .   well  we live and learn  vimes thought  or perhaps more importantly  we learn and live .  he crept downstairs and let himself out into the night     which was a chequerboard of black and white .  he   d forgotten that outside the city  where the smogs  smokes and steams rendered the world into a thousand shades of grey  out in places like this there was black and white  and  if you were looking for a metaphor  there was one  right there .   he knew the way to the hill  you couldn   t miss it .  the moon illuminated the way as if it had wanted to make things easier for him .  actual agriculture ran out around here .  the fields gave way to furze  and to turf nibbled by rabbits into something resembling the baize of a snooker table     although given that rabbits did other things than just eat grass  he would play snooker with a lot of very small balls .  bunnies scattered as he climbed and he worried that he was making too much noise  but it was his land and therefore this was just a walk in the park .  so he walked a little more jauntily  following what seemed to be the only path  and saw  in the moonlight  the gibbet .   well  he thought  it says dead man   s copse on the map  doesn   t it .  they used to do a lot of things like this in the old days  didn   t they .  and the metal cage was just there to keep the corpses upright so that the ravens didn   t have to kneel .  good old fashioned policing  you could call it  if you wanted to chill a spine or two .  a pile of crumbling ancient bones at the foot of the gibbet testified to the old fashioned policing at work .   vimes felt the stealthy movement of a knife on the hairs of his neck .   a moment later willikins got up off the ground and fastidiously brushed dirt from his clothing .     oh  well done  sir .     he said  wheezing a little  owing to the shortness of breath .     i can see that i can   t put anything across you  commander .     he stopped  held his hand up to his nose and sniffed .     blow me down  commander .  there   s blood all over my clothes .  you didn   t stick me  did you  sir .  you just spun round and kicked me in the nuts  which i may say  sir  was done most expertly .      vimes sniffed .  you learned to smell blood .  it smelled like metal .  now  people would say that metal doesn   t smell  but it does  it smells like blood .      you got up here on time .     he said .      yes  sir .  didn   t see a living soul .     willikins knelt down .     didn   t see a thing .  wouldn   t have seen the blood if you hadn   t kicked me into a puddle of it .  it   s all over the place .      i wish i had igor here  thought vimes .  these days he handed over the forensics to the experts .  on the other hand  you acquired a forensic skill of your own and beyond the smell of blood he could smell butchery and unbelievable coincidence .  everybody sees everything in the countryside .  jefferson was going to meet vimes  but here there was a definite shortage of jefferson and no shortage whatsoever of blood while  at the same time  a noticeable absence of corpse .  vimes   s brain worked through things methodically .  of course  you took it for granted that if a citizen was surreptitiously going to tell a policeman a secret it was likely that somebody did not wish said citizen to say said thing .  and if said citizen was found dead then said policeman  who had been seen to have a scrap with him earlier  might just be considered to be a tiny bit guilty when all was said and done  and while all was being said and all was being done  someone really intent on getting vimes into difficulties would have left the corpse of the blacksmith there  wouldn   t they .      found something  sir     said willikins  straightening up .      you what .         found something  sir  felt along the ground  as you might say .         but it   s soaked with blood  man .      this didn   t seem to worry willikins .     never minded blood  commander  leastways when it wasn   t mine .     there was some scrabbling  then light appeared  willikins had shifted the trap door of a dark lantern .  he handed it to vimes and then held something small to the glow .     it   s a ring  sir .  looks like it   s been made of stone .         what .  you mean it   s a stone with a hole in it .      he heard willikins sigh .     no  sir  it   s polished smooth .  and there   s a claw in it .  looks like goblin to me .      vimes thought  all that blood .  severed claw .  goblins aren   t that big .  somebody bothered to come up here to kill a goblin .  where   s the rest of it .   in theory  moonlight should help the search  but moonlight is deceptive  creating shadows where shadows should not be  and the wind was getting up .  dark lantern or not  there was little he could do here .   the curtains were drawn and a few lights still burned in the goblin   s head .  apparently  there were licensing laws .  a good copper should always be ready to test the strength of them .  he led the way round to the back of the pub and knocked on the little wooden sliding panel set into the building   s back door .  after a few moments jiminy pulled the sliding panel aside and vimes stuck his hand in the hole before the man could close it again .      not you  please  your grace  the magistrates would have my guts for garters .         and i   m sure they   ll be very decorative     said vimes     but it won   t happen  because i   ll warrant that about a third of your regular customers are still imbibing intoxicating liquors at this hour  and probably at least one magistrate is among them     no  i take back that last remark .  magistrates do their drinking at home  where there are no licensing laws .  i won   t say a word  but it   ll be a bad old day for the job if a thirsty copper can   t mump a night time beverage from a former colleague .     he slapped some coins on the tiny shelf inside the little panel and added     that should buy a double brandy for my man here  and for me the address of mister jefferson  the smith .         you can   t treat me like this  you know .      vimes looked at willikins .     can i .      the gentleman   s gentleman cleared his throat .     we are now in the world of feudal law  commander .  you own the ground this public house stands on  but he has rights as strong as your own .  if he has paid his rent  then you can   t even go into the property without his permission .         how do you know all this stuff .         well  commander  as you know  i   ve had one or two holidays in the tanty in my time  and one thing about prison is there are always a lot of books about the law lying around  criminals being very keen on going through the old legal smallprint  just in case it turns out that giving a rival gang member some cement boots and dropping him in the river might be legal after all .  that kind of learning sticks .         but i   m investigating a mysterious disappearance now .  the blacksmith was very keen to see me up the hill  but when i got up there there was nothing but a load of blood all over the place .  jefferson wanted to tell me something and you must know what that smells like to a copper .     even though i   m not sure  said vimes to himself .     definitely something iffy  that   s for sure .      the landlord shrugged .     not my business  squire .      vimes   s hand gripped the landlord   s wrist before the man could pull it away and tugged him so hard that his face was up against the woodwork .      don   t you squire me .  there   s something going down here  something wrong  i can feel it in my boots and  believe me  they are the most sensitive boots that ever were .  the man who runs the village pub knows everything     i know that and so do you .  if you   re not on my side you   re in my way and you know something  i can see it in your eyes .  if it turns out you knew something of importance about the blacksmith you   ll have invited yourself to be an accessory after the fact  with a free option  if i can get the bit between my teeth  of before the fact  which leaves you right in the middle  and that   s a fact .      jiminy wriggled  but vimes   s grip was steely .     your badge doesn   t work here  mister vimes  you know that .      vimes heard the tiny whine of fear in the man   s voice  but old coppers were tough .  if you weren   t tough  you never became an old copper .     i   m going to let go  sir     said vimes  which is policeman   s code for    trembling arsehole    .     you think that legally around here i don   t have a leg to stand on .  this may or may not be true  but my man here is not a policeman and is not accustomed to doing things nicely like we in the job do  and you might end up without a leg to stand on as well .  i   m telling you this as a friend .  we both know this game  eh .  i expect you were working in the bar when the goblin was killed  yes .         i didn   t know a bloody goblin was killed  did i .  so how would i know when it may or may not have happened .  my advice  sir     said jiminy  with the same coded inflection that vimes had used     would be to report the matter to the authorities in the morning .  that would be young upshot  calls himself a copper .  look  i came here to retire  vimes  and staying alive is part of that .  i do not poke my nose into that which does not concern me .  and i know there   s a lot of things that you could do and i know you ain   t going to do them  but just so   s you don   t go home empty handed  jethro lives where all blacksmiths live  right in the centre of the village overlooking the green .  he lives with his old mum  so i wouldn   t disturb her at this time of night .  and now  gents  i   d better shut the pub .  don   t want to break the law .      the panel slid back  and there was the sound of a bolt slotting into place .  a moment later  to the time honoured cry of    ain   t you lot got no homes to go to .      they heard the front door open and the lane filled with men trying to get their brains to go in the direction of their feet  or vice versa .   in the shadows of the pub   s back yard  which smelled of old barrels  willikins said     would you like to take a bet on whether your blacksmith is tucked up in his bed tonight  sir .         no     said vimes     but this stinks to me .  i think i   ve got a murder  but i haven   t got a corpse  not all of it anyway     he said  as willikins opened his mouth .  he grunted .     for it to be definitely murder  willikins  you need to be missing an important bit of you that you really need to stay alive  like your head .  okay  or like your blood  but it   s difficult to collect that in the dark  isn   t it .      they set off  and vimes said     the one thing you can say about the dead is that they stay dead  well  generally speaking  and so     it   s been a long day  and that   s a long walk and old age is creeping on  okay .         not very noticeably from the outside  commander     said willikins loyally .   the door was opened to them by a yawning night footman and as soon as he had retired willikins produced from the pocket of his coat the reeking and severed goblin claw and placed it on the hall table .      not much to a goblin once you get past the head  or so they say .  see  there   s the ring on the finger .  definitely looks like stone .  see the little blue bead .  pretty good workmanship for a goblin .         animals don   t wear jewellery     said vimes .     you know  willikins  i   ve said it before  you   d make a bloody good copper if it wasn   t for the fact that you   d make a bloody good assassin .      willikins grinned .     i did think about the assassins when i was a lad  sir  but unfortunately i was not of the right social class and  besides  they have rules .     he helped vimes out of his jacket and went on     the street don   t have rules  commander  except one  which is    survive     and my dear old dad would probably turn in his grave if i even thought of being a copper .         but i thought you never knew who your father was .         indeed  sir  that is the case  but one must consider the fact of heredity .     willikins produced a small brush and whisked a speck of dirt off the coat before putting it on a hanger  then went on     i do feel the absence of a parent sometimes and i have wondered whether it might be a sensible idea to go along to the cemetery at small gods and shout out     dad  i   m going to be a copper     and then see which gravestone revolved  sir .      the man was still grinning .  vimes reflected  and not for the first time  that he had quite an unusual gentleman to be a gentleman   s gentleman  especially given that neither of them was a gentleman in the first place .     willikins  and i mean this most sincerely  if i were you i   d go instead down to the tanty and shout it out into the lime pit next to the gallows .      willikins    grin widened .     thank you  sir .  i don   t have to tell you that that means a lot to me .  if you would excuse me  sir  i   ll go and put my jacket in the incinerator before retiring .          sybil turned over and made a big warm noise when vimes got into bed next to her .  it had been a long day  and he dropped into that pink semi conscious stupor that is even better than sleep  waking up slightly every hour when nobody rang a bell in the street below to say that all was well .   and he woke up again to hear the sound of heavy cart wheels rumbling over stones .  half asleep as vimes was  suspicion woke him the rest of the way .  stones .  it was all bloody gravel around the hall .  he opened a window and stared out into the moonlight .  it was an echo bouncing off the hills .  a few brain cells doing the night shift wondered what kind of agriculture had to be done at night .  did they grow mushrooms .  did turnips have to be brought in from the cold .  was that what they called crop rotation .  these thoughts melted into his somnolent brain like little grains of sugar in a cup of tea  slithering and dripping from cell to synapse to neuro transmitter until they arrived in the receptor marked    suspicion     which if you saw a medical diagram of a policeman   s brain would probably be quite a visible lump  slightly larger than the lump marked    ability to understand long words    .  he thought  ah yes  contraband .  and  feeling cheerful  and hopeful for the future  he gently closed the window and went back to bed .   the food at the hall was copious and sumptuous and quite probably very nearly everything else ending in us .  vimes was old enough to know that the senior staff got to eat the leftovers and therefore made certain there would be leftovers .  with this in mind he had a very large helping of haddock kedgeree and ate all four rashers of bacon on his plate .  sybil tut tutted about this  and vimes pointed out that he was on holiday  after all  and on holiday you did not do the things you did on other days  causing sybil  with forensic accuracy  to point out that this should therefore include police work  should it not  but vimes was ready  and said that of course he understood this  which was why he was going to take young sam for a walk down to the centre of the village to put his suspicions in the hands of the local policeman .  sybil said     all right  then     in deliberate tones of disbelief  and he was to be sure to take willikins with him .   this was another aspect of his wife that puzzled vimes to the core .  in the same way that sybil thought that nobby nobbs  although a rough diamond  was a good watchman  she thought that vimes was safer in the company of a man who never moved abroad without the weaponry of the street about his person  and who had once opened a beer bottle with somebody else   s teeth .  this was true  but in some ways very disconcerting .   he heard the doorbell ring  heard the footman open the front door  heard a muffled conversation followed by somebody walking on the gravel path round to the back of the hall .  it wasn   t important  it was just ambience  and the sound of a footman coming into the room and whispering to sybil fell into the same category .   he heard her say     what .  oh well  i suppose you   d better show him in     then snapped to attention when she addressed him .     it   s the local policeman .  can you see him in the study .  policemen never wipe their feet properly  especially you  sam .      vimes hadn   t seen the study yet .  the hall seemed never to run out of rooms .  by dint of being pointed the way by a swivelling maid  he arrived in the study a few seconds before the local copper was shown in by a footman  who was making a face like a man having to handle a dead rat .  at least  it was presumably the local copper  he looked like the local copper   s son .  seventeen years old  vimes reckoned  and he smelled of pigs .  he stood where the footman had deposited him  and stared .   after a while vimes said     can i help you  officer .      the young man blinked .     er  am i addressing sir samuel vimes .         who are you .      this query appeared to take the young man by surprise  and after a while vimes took pity on him and said     look  son  the correct drill is to say who you are and then ask me if i am me  so to speak .  after all  i don   t know who you are .  you   re not wearing a uniform i recognize  you have shown me no warrant card or badge and you don   t have a helmet .  i assume  nevertheless  and for the purposes of concluding this interview before lunchtime  that you are the chief constable in this vicinity .  what   s your name .         er  upshot  sir  feeney upshot     er  chief constable upshot .      vimes felt ashamed of himself  but this kid was representing himself as a police officer and even nobby nobbs would have laughed .   aloud  he said     well  chief constable upshot  i am sir samuel vimes  amongst other things  and i was thinking only just now that i should talk to you .         er  that   s good  sir  because i was thinking only just now that it was about time i should arrest you on suspicion of causing the death of jethro jefferson  the smith .      vimes   s expression did not change .  so  what do i do now .  nothing  that   s what .  you have the right to remain silent  i   ve said that to hundreds of people  knowing it for the rubbish that it is  and i   m absolutely certain of one other thing  that i certainly haven   t laid anything more than an educational hand on that damned blacksmith and therefore it   s going to be very interesting to find out why this little twerp thinks he can feel my collar for doing so .   a copper should always be willing to learn  and vimes had learned from lord vetinari that you should never react to any comment or situation until you had decided exactly what you were going to do .  this had the dual attraction of preventing you from saying or doing the wrong thing while at the same time making other people extremely nervous .      sorry about that  sir  but it took me an hour to get the pigs out and make the lock up comfortable  sir  it still smells a bit of disinfectant  sir  and pig  if it comes to that  but i whitewashed the walls and there   s a chair and a bed you can curl up on .  oh  and so you don   t get bored i found the magazine .      he looked hopefully at vimes  whose expression had not changed  merely calcified  but after a suitably long stare vimes said     which magazine .         sir .  i didn   t know there was more than one .  we   ve always had it .  it   s about pigs .  it   s a bit worn now  but pigs is always pigs .      vimes stood up .     i   m going to go for a walk  chief constable .  you can follow me if you like .         sorry  sir  but i   ve arrested you .         no  son  you haven   t     said vimes  heading towards the front door .      but i definitely told you that you were arrested  sir .     it was almost a wail .   vimes opened the front door and started down the steps with feeney trotting along behind him .  a couple of gardeners who would otherwise have turned away leaned on their brooms at the sight  suspecting a cabaret .      what in the world have you got on you that tells me you are an official policeman .     enquired vimes over his shoulder .      i have the official truncheon  sir .  it   s a family heirloom .      sam vimes stopped walking and turned .     well  my lad  if it   s official then you   d better let me look at it  hadn   t you .  come on  hand it over .     feeney did so .   it was just an oversized blackjack  with the word    law    inexpertly burnt into it with maybe a poker .  good weight  though .  vimes tapped it in his palm and said     you   ve given me to understand that you believe that i   m potentially a murderer and you   ve handed your weapon to me .  don   t you think that   s unwise .      vimes saw the landscape drift past as he floated over the terrace and landed on his back in a flower bed  staring at the sky .  feeney   s concerned face  somewhat overlarge  appeared in his vision .     sorry about that  commander .  personally i wouldn   t hurt you for anything  but i didn   t want to give you the wrong impression .  that move translates as one man he up down very sorry .      vimes watched the patch of sky above him in a state of inexplicable peace as the boy said     you see  my granddad worked on the tall ships when he was a lad  sailing over to bhangbhangduc and all them places where folk is so strange  and when he came back he brought my granny  ming chang  and she taught that to my dad and to me .     he sniffed .     she died a few months ago  but at least she taught my mum cookery  too .  bung ming suck dog is still a favourite in these parts and  of course  it   s not too difficult to get the ingredients  being so close to the sea .  bong can bang keng doesn   t grow very well around here  although packed shop chop muck dick grows pretty well .  oh  the colour is coming back to your face  sir  i   m very pleased to say .      aching at every joint  vimes pulled himself upright .     don   t do that again  d   you hear .         i   ll try not to do so  sir  but you are under arrest  sir .         i told you  young man  you have not properly arrested me .     vimes got to his feet  wheezing a little .     in order to effect a legal arrest  the arresting officer must be physically touching the suspect while clearly uttering the words    i arrest you     like this  although at that time you need not specify the crime of which your suspect is suspected .  while so doing        and here vimes punched the boy so hard in the solar plexus that he curled up         it pays to take care  which you are going to need to do  my lad  if you intend to arrest me  which i may point out you still have not done  which is a shame because if you had you would now have a clear case against me for resisting arrest as well as assaulting a policeman in the execution of his duty .  with the proviso that nothing about you so far leads me to believe that you truly are a policeman .      vimes sat down on a handy stone and watched as feeney began to unfold .     i   m sam vimes  young man  so don   t try that chop sally stuff on me  understand .      now feeney   s voice was a sort of attenuated wheeze     and one day someone will say to you     do you know who i am  constable .     to which you will reply     yes  sir  or  as it may be  madam  you are the person i am interviewing in connection with the aforesaid crime     or similar appropriate wording  which should not include such phrases as    you are going down  chummy    or    i   ve got you bang to rights and no mistake    .  ignore  but remember  all threats made .  the law is one and immutable .  it does not care who anybody is and at that moment you  in a very real way  are it  and therefore nor do you .      vimes sat with his mouth open as feeney continued .     we don   t often get the times over here  but i bought a load of pig medicine a year ago and it was wrapped in the times and i saw your name when you spoke about being a policeman .  it made me feel very proud  sir .      vimes remembered that speech .  he   d had to write it for the passing out parade of some newly trained officers from the watch school .  he had spent hours trying to get it down  hampered by the fact that for him any form of literature was in every sense a closed book .   he had shown it to sybil and asked her whether she thought he should get somebody to help him with it  and she had patted him on the head and said     no  dear  because then it would look like something written by somebody for somebody else  whereas right now the pure vimes shows through  like a radiant beacon .     that had quite cheered him up  because he had never been a radiant beacon before .   but now his heart sank as his train of thought was interrupted by a very polite cough and the voice of willikins  who said     excuse me  commander  i thought it right at this time to introduce the young gentleman to my friends mister burleigh and mister stronginthearm .  lady sybil would not be happy to see you arrested  commander .  i fear that you would find her a bit     acerbic  sir .      vimes found his voice .     you   re a bloody fool  man .  put that damn thing down .  you keep it on a hair trigger .  put it down right now .      willikins wordlessly set down the shining crossbow on the parapet of the staircase like a mother putting her baby to bed .  there was a twang  and seventeen yards away a geranium was decapitated .  this passed without notice  except by the geranium and a raggedy figure hiding in the rhododendrons  that said    snack .     to itself  but resolutely carried on staring at vimes .   the tableau of shock on the steps was interrupted by lady sybil  who could walk very quietly for a large woman .     gentlemen  what is going on here .         this young man  allegedly the local policeman  wishes to take me into custody on a charge of suspicion of murder  my dear .      there passed between husband and wife a look that deserved the status of telepathy .  sybil stared at feeney .     ah  you would be young upshot  i suppose .  i was sorry to hear about the death of your father  and i do trust that your mother continues well .  i used to visit her when i was a girl .  and you want to arrest my husband  do you .      feeney  goggle eyed  managed an unprofessional    yes  ma   am    .   sybil sighed and said sternly     well  then  can i hope that at least this can be done without further vegetable carnage .     she looked at vimes .     is he taking you to prison .      she turned her attention back to feeney  a man now confronted by a cannon loaded with a thousand years of upper class self assurance .     he   ll need fresh clothing  constable .  if you tell me where you   re taking him  and you will tell me where you   re taking him  i   ll personally bring down suitable garments .  will i need to sew the stripes on them  or does that happen automatically .  and i would be grateful if you had him back here by teatime  because we   re expecting visitors .      lady sybil took a step forward and feeney took a step backwards to escape the wrath of the impending bosom .  she said     may i wish you the best of luck in your undertaking  young man .  you   ll need it .  now please excuse me .  i have to go and talk to the cook .      she swept away  leaving the incredulous feeney staring after her .  then the doors that had just closed behind her opened again  and she said     are you still a bachelor  young man .      feeney managed a    yes    .      then you are invited to tea     she said cheerfully .     there are some very eligible young ladies coming  and i   m sure that they will be most excited to see a young man who is prepared to dance on the very edge of hell .  do wear your helmet  sam  in case there is any police brutality .  willikins  come with me .  i want to have a talk to you .      vimes let the silence curdle .  after too much of it  feeney said     your wife is a very remarkable woman  sir .      vimes nodded .     you have no idea .  what do you want to do now  chief constable .      the boy hesitated .  that was sybil for you .  just by speaking calmly and confidently she could leave you believing that the world had turned upside down and dropped on to your head .      well  sir  i believe i must take you before the magistrates .      vimes noted the little question mark .     who is your boss  feeney .         the aforesaid bench of magistrates  sir .      vimes began to walk down the steps  and feeney hurried after him .  vimes waited until the boy was racing  and then stopped dead so that feeney ran into him .     your boss is the law  chief constable  and don   t you forget it .  in fact  one of the jobs of the magistrates is to make certain that you do not .  did you ever take an oath .  what did it say .  who was it to .         oh  i remember that all right  sir .  it was to the bench of magistrates  sir .         it     was     what .  you made an oath to obey the magistrates .  they can   t make you do that .     he stopped .  remember  in the country there is always somebody watching you  he thought  and probably listening too .   feeney looked shocked  so vimes said     get me down to your lock up  kid  and lock me in .  and while you   re about it  lock yourself in with me .  don   t rush  don   t ask questions  and keep your voice down  apart from possibly saying things like    i have you bang to rights  you miscreant     and other rubbish of that general nature  because  young man  i believe somebody is in real difficulties here and i believe that person is you .  if you have any sense  you   ll keep quiet and take me to your lock up  okay .      eyes wide  feeney nodded .   it was a pleasant walk down to the lock up  which turned out to be on a small quay by the river .  the area had all the semi nautical detritus that a man might expect and there was a swing bridge  presumably to allow the bigger boats to pass .  the sun shone and nothing was happening  in a slow sort of way .  and then there was the much spoken of lock up .  it looked like a giant pepperpot built of stone .  a flowering creeper grew up it  and  next to the door and restrained by a chain  there was an enormous pig .  when it saw their approach it got on its hind legs  and  tottering somewhat  begged .      this is masher     said feeney .     his father was a wild boar  his mother was surprised .  see those fangs .  no one gives me much trouble when i threaten to let masher off his lead  do they  masher .     he disappeared behind the lock up and returned immediately with a bucket of swill  into which masher tried to bury himself  with hugely contented noises     as huge  in fact  as his fangs .  vimes was staring at them when a friendly looking woman wearing an apron bustled out of a thatched cottage  stopped when she saw vimes and dropped a curtsy .  she looked hopefully at feeney .     who would this fine gentleman be  son .         it   s commander vimes  mum     you know  the duke .      there was a pause while the woman clearly wished that she had been wearing a better dress  hairdo  and shoes  and had cleaned the privy  the kitchen  the scullery  and had tidied up the garden  painted the front door and cleaned the inside of the roof .   vimes prevented her spin from making a hole in the ground by holding out his hand and saying     sam vimes  madam  pleased to make your acquaintance     but this only caused her to run indoors in a panic .      my mum is very keen on the aristocracy     feeney confided as he unlocked the door of the lock up with an unfeasibly large key .      why .     said vimes  mystified .  it was reasonably comfortable in the lock up .  granted  the pigs had left a fragrant memory behind them  but for a boy from ankh morpork this counted as fresh air .  feeney sat down beside him on a well scrubbed bench .     well  sir  when my granddad was young  lord ramkin gave him a whole half dollar for opening a gate  just to let the hunt go by .  according to my dad  he said     no canting hypocrite going on about the rights of man ever gave me as much as a quarter farthing so i say here   s to lord ramkin  who gave me a whole half dollar when he was as pissed as a fart  and never asked for it back when he were sober .  that   s what i call a gentleman .         vimes squirmed inside  knowing that the supposedly generous old drunkard would have had more money than you could ever imagine  and here was a working man pathetically grateful for a handout from the old piss artist .  he snarled in his soul to a man long dead .  but the part of him that had been married to sybil for years whispered  but he didn   t have to give the man anything  and in those days a whole half dollar was probably more money than the old man could imagine .  once sybil  in one of their very infrequent arguments  had surprised him by blurting out     well  sam  my family got its start in life  its grub stake if you like  by piracy .  you should like that  sam .  good honest manual labour .  and look what it led to .  the trouble with you  sam vimes  is that you   re determined to be your very own class enemy .         is there something wrong  commander .     said feeney .      everything     said vimes .     for one thing  no policeman swears allegiance to the civil power  he swears allegiance to the law .  oh  politicians can change the law  and if the copper doesn   t like it then he can quit  but while he is in the job it   s up to him to act in accordance with the law as laid down .     he leaned his back against the stone wall .     you do not swear to obey magistrates .  i   d like to see what it was that you signed       vimes stopped talking because the little metal plate in the lock up door slid open to reveal feeney   s mother  looking very nervous .      i   ve made bang suck duck  feeney  with swede and chips  and there   s enough for the duke as well  if he would be so condescending as to accept it .      vimes leaned forward and whispered     does she know you   ve arrested me .      feeney shuddered .     no  and  sir  please  please don   t tell her  because i think she   d never let me into the house ever again .      vimes walked over to the door and said to the slot     i shall be honoured by your hospitality  mistress upshot .      there was a nervous giggle from the other side of the slot  and feeney   s mother managed to say     i   m sorry to say we have no silver plates  your highness .      at home vimes and sybil ate off serviceable earthenware  cheap  practical and easy to keep clean .  he said aloud     i   m sorry you don   t have any silver plates  too  mistress upshot  and i   ll have a set sent to you directly .      there was something like a scuffle from the other side of the slot  at the same time as feeney said     i beg your pardon .  have you gone mad  sir .      well  that would help  vimes thought .     we   ve got hundreds of damn silver plates up at the hall  my lad .  bloody useless  they make the food cold and they turn black as soon as your back is turned .  we appear to be overrun with spoons  too .  i   ll see what we   ve got .         you can   t do that  sir .  she gets scared of having valuables in the house .         do you have much theft hereabouts  chief constable .     said vimes  emphasizing the last two words .   feeney opened the door of the lock up and picked up his mother  who had apparently been stunned by the possibility of owning silver plates  brushed her down and said over her shoulder     no  sir  the reason being no one has anything to steal .  my mum always told me money can   t buy you happiness  sir .      yes  vimes thought  so did my ma  but she was glad enough when i gave her my first wages  because it meant we could have a meal with meat in it  even if we didn   t know what kind of meat it was .  that   s happiness  isn   t it .  blimey  the lies we tell ourselves      when a blushing mistress upshot had gone to fetch the meal  vimes said     between ourselves  chief constable  do you believe that i   m guilty of murder .         no  sir .     said feeney instantly .      you said that very quickly  young man .  are you going to say that it   s copper   s instinct .  because i get the impression you ain   t been a copper long and haven   t had much to do .  i   m no expert  but i don   t reckon pigs try lying to you very much either .      feeney took a deep breath .     well  sir     he said calmly     my granddad was a wily old bird and he could read people like books .  he used to walk me around the area introducing me to people  sir  and then as they strolled along he   d tell me their stories  like the one about the man who   d been caught in flagrante delicto with a common barnyard fowl         vimes listened open mouthed as the pink  well scrubbed face talked about the gentle  fragrant landscape as if it was populated by devils from the most invidious pit .  he unrolled a crime sheet that badly needed the laundry  no major murders  just nastiness  silliness and all the crimes of human ignorance and stupidity .  of course  where there were people there was crime .  it just seemed out of place in the slow world of big spaces and singing birds .  and yet he   d smelled it as soon as he was here and now he was in the middle of it .      you get a tingle     said feeney .     that   s what my dad told me .  he said watch  listen and keep your eye on every man .  there never was a good policeman who didn   t have a slice of villain somewhere in him  and this will call to you .  it will say    this man has something to hide     or    this man is far more frightened than he should be    or    this man is acting too cocky by half because underneath he   s a bag of nerves    .  it will call to you .      vimes opted for admiration rather than shock  but not too much admiration .     well  mister feeney  i reckon your grandfather and your dad got it right .  so i   m sending the right signals  am i .         no  sir  none at all  sir .  my granddad and my dad could go like that sometimes .  totally blank .  it makes people nervous .     feeney cocked his head on one side and said     just a moment  sir  i think we have a little problem         the door to the lock up clanged open as chief constable upshot skidded around to the rear of the squat little building .  something yelped and squealed and then vimes  sitting peacefully inside  suddenly had goblins on his lap .  in fact it was only one goblin  but one goblin is more than sufficient at close quarters .  there was the smell  to begin with  and not to end with either  because it appeared to permeate the world .  yet it wasn   t the stink     although heavens knew that they stank with all the stinks an organic creature could generate     no  anyone who walked the streets of ankh morpork was more or less immune to stinks  and indeed there was now a flourishing  if that was the word  hobby of stink collecting    and dave  of dave   s pin and stamp emporium  was extending the sign over his shop again .  you couldn   t bottle  or whatever it was the collectors did  the intrinsic smell of a goblin because it wasn   t so much a stink as a sensation  the sensation in fact that your dental enamel was evaporating and any armour you might have was rusting at some speed .  vimes punched at the thing but it hung on with arms and legs together  screaming in what was theoretically a voice  but sounded like a bag of walnuts being jumped on .  and yet it wasn   t attacking     unless you considered the biological warfare .  it clung with its legs and waved its arms  and vimes just managed to stop feeney braining it with his official truncheon  because  once you paid attention  the goblin was using words  and the words were  ice .  ice .  we want just ice .  demand .  demand just ice .  right .  just ice .   feeney  on the other hand  was shouting     stinky  you little devil  i told you what i   d do to you if ever i saw you stealing the pigswill again .     he looked at vimes as if for support .     they can give you horrible diseases  sir .         will you stop dancing around with that damn weapon  boy .     vimes looked down at the goblin now struggling in his grasp  and said     as for you  you little bugger  stop your racket .      the little room went silent  apart from the dying strains of    they eat their own babies .     from feeney and    just ice .     from the goblin  simply and accurately named as    stinky    .   not panicking now  the goblin pointed a claw at vimes   s left wrist  looked him in the face  and said     just ice .     it was a plea .  the claw tugged at his leg .     just ice .     the creature hobbled to the door and looked up at the glowering chief constable and then turned to vimes with an expression that bored into the man   s face and said very deliberately     just ice .  mister po leess maan .      vimes pulled out his snuffbox .  you could say this for the brown stuff  all that ceremony you went through before you took a pinch gave you rather more thinking time than lighting a cigar .  it also got people   s attention .  he said     well now  chief constable  here is somebody asking you for justice .  what are you going to do about it .      feeney looked uncertain  and took refuge in a certainty .     it   s a stinking goblin .         do you often see them around the lock up .     said vimes  keeping his tone mild .      only stinky     said feeney  glowering at the goblin  who stuck out his worm like tongue .     he   s always hanging around .  the rest of them know what happens if they   re caught thieving around here .      vimes glanced down at the goblin and recognized a badly set broken leg when he saw one .  he turned the snuffbox over and over in his hands  and did not look at the young man .     but surely a policeman wonders what has happened for a wretched thing like this to walk right up to the law and risk being maimed     again .      it was a leap in the dark  but  hell  he had leapt so often that the dark was a trampoline .   his arm itched .  he tried to ignore it  but just for a moment there was a dripping cave in front of him  and no other thought except of terrible endless vengeance .  he blinked and the goblin was tugging at his sleeve again and feeney was getting angry .      i didn   t do that .  i didn   t see it done .         but you know it happens  yes .     and again vimes remembered the darkness and the thirst for vengeance  in fact vengeance itself made sapient and hungry .  and the little bugger had touched him on that arm .  it all came back  and he wished that it hadn   t  because while all coppers must have a bit of villain in them  no copper should walk around with a piece of demon as a tattoo .   feeney had lost his anger now  because he was frightened .     bishop scour says they   re demonic and insolent creations made as a mockery of mankind     he said .      i don   t know about any bishops     said vimes     but something is going on here and i can feel the tingle  felt it on the day i came here  and it   s tingling on my land .  listen to me  chief constable .  when you apprehend the suspect you should take the trouble to ask them if they did it  and if they say no you must ask them if they can prove their innocence .  got it .  you   re supposed to ask .  understand .  and my answers are  in order  hell no and hell yes .      the little clawed hand scratched at vimes   s shirt again .     just ice .      vimes thought  oh well  i thought i   d been gentle with the lad up until now .     chief constable  something is wrong  and you know that something is wrong  and you are all alone  so you   d better enlist the help of anyone you know that can be trusted .  such as me  for example  in which case i   ll be the suspect who  having been bailed on my own recognizance of one penny     and here vimes handed a partly corroded small copper disc to the astonished feeney     has been requested to help you with your inquiries  such as they are  and that will be all fine and dandy and in accordance with the standard work on police procedure  which  my lad  was written by me  and you had better believe it .  i   m not the law  no policeman is the law .  a policeman is just a man  but when he wakes up in the morning it is the law that is his alarm clock .  i   ve been nice and kind to you up until now  but did you really think i was going to be spending the night in a pig pen .  time to be a real copper  lad .  do the right thing and fudge the paperwork afterwards  like i do .     vimes looked down at the persistent little goblin .     okay  stinky  lead the way .         but my old mum is just coming out with your dinner  commander .     feeney   s voice was a wail  and vimes hesitated .  it didn   t do to upset an old mum .   it was time to let the duke out .  vimes never normally bowed to anybody  but he bowed to mistress upshot  who almost dropped her tray in ecstatic confusion .     i am mortified  my dear mistress upshot  to have to ask you to keep your man dog suck po warm for us for a little while  because your son here  a credit to his uniform and to his parents  has asked me to assist him in an errand of considerable importance  which can only be entrusted to a young man with integrity  as your lad here .      as the woman very nearly melted in pride and happiness vimes pulled the young man away .      sir  the dish was bang suck duck .  we only have man dog suck po on sundays .  with mashed carrots .      vimes turned back and shook mrs upshot warmly by the hand  and said     i look forward to tasting it later  my dear mistress upshot  but if you   ll excuse me  your son is a stickler for his police work  as i   m sure you know .      colonel charles augustus makepeace had long ago  with the expertise of a lifelong strategist  decided to let letitia have her way in all things .  it saved so much trouble and left him able to potter around in his garden  take care of his dragons and occasionally go trout fishing  a pastime that he loved .  he rented half a mile of stream  but was sadly now finding it difficult to keep running fast enough .  nowadays he spent a lot of time in his library  working on the second volume of his memoirs  keeping from under his wife   s feet and not getting involved .   until this moment he had been quite happy that she had the role of chairman of the magistrates because it kept her away from home for hours at a time .  he had never been very much of a one for thinking in terms of good or bad and guilty or not guilty .  he had learned to think in terms of us and them and dead and not dead .   and therefore he wasn   t exactly listening to the group sitting around the long table at the other end of the library  talking in worried voices  but nevertheless he couldn   t help overhearing .   she had signed that damned document .  he ought to have tried to talk her out of it  but he knew where that would have ended .  commander vimes .  okay  by all accounts the man was the sort to rush in  and maybe he did have a scrap with what   shisname the blacksmith  who wasn   t too bad a cove in his way  bit of a hot head of course but he   d made a damn good dragon prod only the other day at quite a reasonable price .  vimes .  not a killer  surely .  that   s one thing you learned in the military .  you don   t last long if you   re a killer .  killing as duty called was another thing entirely .  letitia had listened to that unspeakable lawyer and they had all agreed that it be signed simply because that wretched rust fella wanted it .   he opened this month   s edition of fang and fire .  occasionally somebody lowered their voice  which you couldn   t help thinking was damn insulting  given that they were sitting in a chap   s library and especially when the chap hadn   t been consulted .  but he didn   t protest .  he had long ago learned not to protest  and so he kept his eyes focused on the pullout feature on flame retardant incubators  holding it in front of him as if to ward off evil .   however  among the words he didn   t hear were     of course  he only married her for her money  you know .     that was his wife   s voice .  then     i heard she was desperate to find a husband .     the curiously sharp tone of that voice identified its owner as miss pickings  who  the colonel couldn   t help noting  as he stared grimly at a full page advertisement for asbestos kennels  had clearly been in no hurry to find a husband herself .   the colonel was  by inclination  a live and let live personality and  frankly  if a gel wanted to go around with another gel who wore a shirt and tie  trained horses and had a face like a bulldog licking vinegar off a thistle  then it was entirely her business .  after all  he told himself  what about old    beefy    jackson  eh .  wore a dress every night in the mess and rather flowery aftershave for a chap  but when the call to arms came he could fight like a bloody demon .  funny old world .   he tried to find his place on the page again  but was interrupted by the very reverend mouser .  he never could get on with padres  couldn   t see the point .     i find it very suspicious that the ramkin family have turned up here after so many years  don   t you .  i keep reading about vimes in the newspaper  not the kind of person you can imagine as simply taking a holiday .         according to gravid  he is known as vetinari   s terrier     said letitia .   at the other end of the room her husband thrust his head even deeper into his magazine so as not to snigger .  gravid .  who would call their child gravid .  no one who had ever kept dragons or fish  that was certain .  of course  there was such a thing as a dictionary  but then the old lord rust had never been the kind of man to open a book if he could help it .  the colonel tried to contemplate an article on the treatment of zig zag throat in older males and the wife of his heart continued     well  we don   t want any of vetinari   s nonsense here .  apparently  his lordship rather enjoys allowing vimes to break wind in the halls of the mighty .  apparently  vimes is no respecter of rank .  indeed  quite the reverse .  and indeed  it would seem that he is prepared to ambush a decent working man .      funny  thought the colonel  first time i ever heard her call the smith anything other than a blasted nuisance .  it seemed to him that the gossip around the table was trite  artificial  like the conversation of raw recruits on the eve of their first battle .  he thought  there   s a warrant out for commander vimes  hero of koom valley  bloody good show .  wonderful execution .  peace in our time between brother troll and brother dwarf and that sort of thing .  just the job .  i   ve seen too much killing in my time   and now you are going to put him out of a job and a reputation  just because that greasy lad with a name like a pregnant frog has charmed you into doing so .      i understand he has a very violent nature     said  oh  what was his name .  bit of a bad hat in the colonel   s opinion .  bought a big villa up near overhang  one of rust   s cronies .  never seemed to do any work .  what was his name  ah yes  edgehill  not a man that you would trust behind you or in front of you  but they   d sworn him in even so .      and he was just a street kid and a drunkard .     said letitia .     what do you think of that .      the colonel paid careful attention to his magazine while his unspoken thoughts said  sounds jolly good to me  my dear .  all i got when i married you was the promise of a half share in your dad   s fish and chip shop when i left the service  and i never even got that .      everybody knows that his ancestor killed a king  so i can   t imagine a vimes would jib at killing a blacksmith     said the honourable ambrose .  bit of a mystery  this one .  something to do with shipping .  sent out from the city to lie low here because of something to do with a girl .  and the colonel  who spent a lot of time thinking    had some time ago wondered to himself how  in these modern days  you got banished from the city because of a girl  and instinct had told him that possibly it had something to do with the age of the girl .  after incubating that thought for a while  the colonel had written to his old chum    jankers    robinson  who always knew a thing or two about this and that and one thing and another and was now some political wallah in the palace .  he had made an enquiry  as one might  of his friend whom he had once dragged to safety over the pommel of his saddle before a klatchian scimitar got him  and had received a little note with nothing more than    yes indeed  under age  hushed up at great expense     and after that the colonel had taken great care never to shake the bastard   s hand again .   blithely unaware of the thoughts of the colonel  the honourable ambrose  who always seemed to be slightly bigger than his clothes     said clothes being of a fashion more suited to somebody twenty years his junior     sneered     frankly  i think we   re doing the world a service .  they say that he favours dwarfs and all kinds of low life .  you might expect anything of a man like that .      yes  you might  thought the colonel .   and miss pickings said     but we haven   t done anything wrong     have we .      the colonel turned a page and smoothed it down with military exactitude .  he thought  well  you all condone smuggling when the right people are doing it because they   re chums  and when they aren   t they   re heavily fined .  you apply one law for the poor and none for the rich  my dear  because the poor are such a nuisance .   he felt eyes suddenly upon him because marital telepathy is a terrible thing .  his wife said     it doesn   t do any harm  everybody does it .     her head swung round again as her husband turned the page  his eyes fixedly on the type as he thought  as noiselessly as his brain could contrive  and of course there was the     incident  a few years ago .  not good  that .  not good .  not good when little babies of any sort are taken away from mothers .  not good at all .  and you all know it and it worries you  and well it should .   the room was silent for a moment and then mrs colonel continued .     there will not be any problems .  young lord rust has promised me .  we have rights  after all .         i blame that wretched blacksmith     said miss pickings .     he keeps bringing it back into people   s memories  him and that damn writing woman .      mrs colonel bridled at this .     i have no idea what you   re talking about  miss pickings .  legally nothing wrong has happened here .     her head swivelled towards her husband .     are you all right  dear .     she demanded .   for a moment he looked as though he wasn   t and then the colonel said     oh  yes  dear .  right as rain .  right as rain .     but his thoughts continued  you have partaken in what is  i strongly suggest  a cynical attempt to ruin the career of a very good man .      i heard you coughing .     it sounded like an accusation .      oh  just a bit of dust or something  dear  right as rain .  right as rain .     and then he slammed his magazine on to the table .  standing up  he said     when i was nothing but a subaltern  dear  one of the first things i learned was that you never give away your position by frantic firing .  i think i know the type of your commander vimes .  young lord rust may be safe  with his money and contacts  but i doubt very much that you all will be .  who knows what would have happened if you hadn   t been so hasty .  what   s a bit of smuggling .  you   ve just pulled the dragon   s tail and made him angry .      when his wife regained control of her tongue  she said     how dare you  charles .         oh  quite easily  as it turns out  dear     said the colonel  smiling happily .     a bit of smuggling might be considered a peccadillo  but not when you   re supposed to be upholding the law .  it baffles me that none of you seems to realize that .  if you have any sense  ladies and gentlemen  you will explain that whole unfortunate goblin event to his grace right now .  after all  your chum gravid organized it .  the only little problem is that you allowed him to do it  as i recall  without so much as a murmur .         but it was not illegal     said his wife icily .   her husband didn   t move  but in some ineffable sense he was suddenly taller .     i think things got a bit tangled  you see  you thought about things as being legal or illegal .  well  i   m just a soldier and never was a very good one  but it   s my opinion you were so worried about legal and illegal that you never stopped to think about whether it was right or wrong .  and now  if you will excuse me  i   m going down to the pub .      automatically  his wife said     no  dear  you know drink doesn   t agree with you .      the colonel was all smiles .     this evening i intend to settle my differences with drink and make it my friend .      the rest of the magistrates looked at mrs colonel  who glared at her husband .     i   ll talk to you about this later  charles     she growled .   to her surprise  his smile did not change .     yes  dear  i suspect you will  but i think you   ll find that i won   t be listening .  good evening to you all .     there was a click as the door shut behind him .  there should have been a slam  but some doors never quite understand the situation .   the goblin was already moving quite fast with a dot and carry one gait that was deceptively speedy .  vimes was surprised to find that feeney made heavy weather of the little jog towards     he was not surprised     hangman   s hill .  he could hear the boy wheezing slightly .  perhaps you didn   t need to be all that fast to overtake a wayward pig  but you needed to be very fast indeed to catch up with a young troll blizzarded to the eyeballs with slice and you needed lots of stamina to overtake him and slap the cuffs on him before he came down enough to try to twist your head off .  policing was obviously very different in the country .   in the country  there is always somebody watching you  he thought as they sped along .  well  there was always somebody watching you in the city  too  but that was generally in the hope that you might drop dead and they could run off with your wallet .  they were never interested .  but here he thought he could feel many eyes on him .  maybe they belonged to squirrels or badgers  or whatever the damn things were that vimes heard at night time  gorillas  possibly .   he had no idea what he was going to see  but certainly didn   t expect to find the top of the hill bright with lines of rope  painted yellow .  he gave it only a second   s glance  however .  with their backs to one of the trees  and looking very apprehensive  were three goblins .  one of them stood up  thus bringing its head and therefore its eyes to a level in the vicinity of vimes   s groin  not a good position to find himself .  it held up a wrinkled hand and said     vimes .  hang .      vimes stared down at it and then at feeney .     what does he mean     hang    .         never been quite sure     said feeney .     something like  have a nice day  i think  only in goblin .         vimes .     the old goblin continued .     it said be  you be po leess maan .  it be big po leess maan .  if po leess maan  then just ice .  but just ice it be no .  and when dark inside dark .  dark moving .  dark must come  vimes .  dark rises .  just ice .      vimes had no idea of the sex of the speaker  or even its age .  dress wasn   t a clue  goblins apparently wore anything that could be tied on .  its companions were watching him unblinkingly .  they had stone axes  flint  vicious stuff  but it lost its edge after a couple of blows  which was no consolation when you were bleeding from the neck .  he had heard that they were berserk fighters  too .  oh  and what was the other thing people said .  ah yes  whatever you do  don   t let them scratch you         you want justice  do you .  justice for what .      the goblin speaker stared at him and said     come with me  po leess maan     the words rolling out like a curse  or  at least  a threat .  the speaker turned and began to walk solemnly down the far side of the hill .  the other three goblins  including the one known to vimes as stinky  did not move .   feeney whispered     this could be a trap  sir .      vimes rolled his eyes and sneered     you think so  do you .  i thought it was probably an invitation to a magical show featuring the amazing bonko and doris and the collapsing unicycle brothers with fido the cat .  what   s this yellow rope all about  mister upshot .         police cordon  sir .  my mum knitted it for me .         oh yes  i can see she   s managed to work the word plice in black in there several times  too .         yes  sir  sorry about the spelling  sir     said feeney  clearly spooked by the stares .  he went on     there was blood all over the ground  sir  so i scraped some into a clean jam jar  just in case .      vimes paid that no attention  because the two goblin guards had unfolded and were standing up .  stinky beckoned vimes to walk ahead of them .  vimes shook his head  folded his arms and turned to feeney .      let me tell you what you thought  mister upshot .  you acted on information received  didn   t you .  and you heard that the blacksmith and i indulged in a bout of fisticuffs outside the pub yesterday  and that is true .  no doubt you were also told that at some time later someone heard a conversation in which he arranged to meet me up at this place  yes .  don   t bother to answer  i can see it in your face     you haven   t quite got the copper   s deadpan yet .  has mister jefferson gone missing .      feeney gave up .     yes  mister vimes .      he didn   t deserve  or perhaps he did deserve  the force with which vimes turned on him .      you will not call me mister vimes  lad  you ain   t earned the right .  you call me    sir    or    commander     or even    your grace    if you   re dumb enough to do so  understand .  i could have sent the blacksmith home walking very strangely if i   d had a mind to do so yesterday .  he   s a big man but no street hero .  but i let him get the steam out of his tubes and calm down without losing face .  yes  he did say he wanted to meet me up here last night .  when i came up here  with a witness  there was blood on the ground which i will warrant is goblin blood  and certainly no sign of any blacksmith .  you had a bloody stupid case against me when you came up to my house and it   s still a bloody stupid case .  any questions .      feeney looked down at his feet .     no  sir  sorry  sir .         good  i   m glad .  think of this as a training experience  my lad  and it won   t cost you a penny .  now  these goblins seem to want us to follow them and i intend to do so  and i also intend that you will come with me  understood .      vimes looked at stinky and the two goblin guards .  an axe was waved in a half hearted sort of way  indicating that they should indeed be travelling .  they set off and he could hear sorrowful feeney trying to be brave  but broadcasting anxiety .      they   re not going to touch us  kid  first because if they had intended to do that they   d have done it already  and second  they want something from me .      feeney moved a little closer .     and what would that be  sir .         justice     said vimes .     and i think i have a premonition about what that is going to mean         sometimes people asked commander vimes why sergeant colon and corporal nobbs were still on the strength  such as it was  of the modern ankh morpork city watch  given that nobby occasionally had to be held upside down and shaken to reclaim small items belonging to other people  while fred colon had actually cultivated the ability to walk his beat with his eyes closed  and end up  still snoring  back at pseudopolis yard  sometimes with graffiti on his breastplate .   to lord vetinari  commander vimes had put forward three defences .  the first was that both of them had an enviable knowledge of the city and its inhabitants  official and otherwise  that rivalled vimes   s own .   the second was the traditional urinary argument .  it was better to have them inside pissing out than outside pissing in .  it was at least easy to keep an eye on them .   and not least  oh my word not least  they were lucky .  many a crime had been solved because of things that had fallen on them  tried to kill them  tripped one of them up  been found floating in their lunch  and in one case had tried to lay its eggs up nobby   s nose .   and so it was that  today  whatever god or other force it might be that regarded them as its playthings directed their steps to the corner of cheapside and rhyme street  and the fragrant emporium of bewilderforce gumption .     sergeant colon and corporal nobbs  as is the way with policemen  entered the building by the back door and were greeted by mr gumption with that happy but somewhat glassy smile with which a trader greets an old acquaintance who he knows will end up getting merchandise with a discount of one hundred per cent .      why  fred  how nice to see you again .     he said  while awakening the mystic third eye developed by all small shopkeepers  especially those who see nobby nobbs coming into the shop .      we were patrolling in the area  bewilderforce  and i thought i   d drop in to get my tobacco and see how you were managing  with all this fuss about the tax and everything .      the sergeant had to speak up to be heard above the rumbling of the snuff mill  and the carts that were moving across the factory floor in a stream .  lines of women at tables were packing snuff and     here  he leaned sideways to get a better view     the cigarette production line was also a bustle .   sergeant colon looked around .  policemen always look  on the basis that there is always something to see .  of course  sometimes they may find it sensible to forget that they have seen anything  at least officially .  mr gumption had a new tie pin  in which a diamond flashed .  his shoes were also clearly new     bespoke  if fred colon was any judge     and a barely noticeable sniff suggested the wearing of  let   s see now  oh yes  cedar fragrance pour hommes  from quirm at am    a pop .   he said     how   s business doing .  is the new tax hitting you at all .      mr gumption   s visage flew into the expression of a hardworking man sorely pressed by the machinations of politics and fate .  he shook his head sadly .     we   re barely making ends meet  fred .  lucky to break even at the end of the day .      oh  and a gold tooth  too  thought sergeant colon .  i nearly missed that .  out loud he said     i   m very sorry to hear that  bewilderforce  i really am .  allow me to raise your profits by expending two dollars in the purchase of my usual three ounces of twist tobacco .      fred colon proffered his wallet and mr gumption  with a scolding noise  waved it away .  it was a ritual as old as merchants and policemen  and it allowed the world to keep on turning .  he cut a length of tobacco from the coil on the marble counter  wrapped it quickly and expertly  and as an afterthought reached down and came up with a large cigar  which he handed to the sergeant .      try one of these handsome smokes  fred  just in  not local  made on the plantation for our valued customers .  no no  my pleasure  i insist     he added  as fred made grateful noises .     always nice to see the watch in here  you know that .      actually  mr gumption thought  as he watched the departing policemen  that was pretty mild  all that the nobbs creature had done was stare around .      they must be coining it     said nobby nobbs as they ambled onwards .     did you see the    staff wanted    note in their window .  and he was writing out a list of prices on the counter .  he   s lowering them .  he must have a good deal going on with the plantation people  that   s all i can say .      sergeant colon sniffed the big fat cigar  the fattest he had ever seen  which smelled so good it was probably illegal  and he felt the tingle  the feeling that he had walked into something that was a lot bigger than it seemed  the feeling that if you pulled a thread something large would unravel .  he rolled the cigar between his fingers the way he had seen connoisseurs do .  in truth  sergeant colon was  when it came to tobacco products  something of a bottom feeder  cheapness being the overriding consideration  and the protocol of cigars was unfamiliar to a man who very much enjoyed a good length of chewing tobacco .  what was the other thing he had seen posh types do .  oh yes  you had to roll it in your fingers and hold it up to your ear .  he had no idea why this had to be done  but he did it anyway .   and swore .   and dropped it on the ground      the track from the top of hangman   s hill went beyond the trees and down  mostly through furze bushes and rocky outcrops  with the occasional patch of raw and useless soil  all substance eroded away .  wild land  wasteland  home to skinny rabbits  hopeless mice  the occasional concussed rat  and goblins .   and there among the bushes was the entrance to a cave .  a human would have to bend double to get into that fetid hole and would be an easy target .  but vimes knew  as he ducked through  that he was safe .  he knew that .  he had suspected it out in the daylight  and down in the darkness he knew .  the knowledge was almost physical as wings of darkness spread over him  and he heard the sounds of the cave  every sound .   he suddenly knew the cave  all the way down to the place where water could be found  the fungus and mushroom gardens  the pathetically empty storerooms  and the kitchen .  these were human translations  of course .  goblins generally ate where they could and slept where they fell asleep  they had no real concept of a room with one particular purpose .  he knew this now as if he had known it all his life  and he had never before been in any place that a goblin would call home .   but this was the dark  and vimes and the dark had an     understanding  didn   t they .  at least  that   s what the dark thought .  what vimes thought  unprosaically  was damn  here we go again .   he was prodded in the small of his back  and he heard feeney gasp .  vimes turned to a grinning goblin and said     try that one more time  sunshine  and i   ll give you a smack around the head  understand .     and that was what he said  and that was what he heard himself say     except that something  not exactly another voice  climbed along his words like a snake coiling itself around a tree  and both his guards dropped their weapons and bolted back into the daylight .  it was instant .  they didn   t yelp or shout .  they wanted to save their breath for running .      great hells  commander vimes .  that was bloody magical .     said feeney  as he bent to grope for the fallen axes .  vimes watched in the thick darkness as he saw the boy   s hands scrabbling and  by luck  find them .      drop them .  i said drop them right now .         but we   re unarmed .         don   t you bloody argue with me  boy .     there were a couple of thumps as the axes hit the ground .   vimes breathed again .     now  we   re going to see that nice senior goblin  you understand  and we walk without fear because we are the law  you understand .  and the law can go everywhere in pursuit of its inquiries .      the headroom increased as they walked onwards  until vimes was able to stand fully upright .  feeney  on the other hand  was having difficulties .  behind vimes there was a chorus of thumps  scrapes and words that dear old mums should not know about  let alone hear .  vimes had to stop and wait for the boy to catch up  stubbing his feet on easily avoidable outcrops and banging his head where the ceiling dipped briefly .      come on  chief constable .     vimes shouted .     a copper should have good night vision .  you should eat more carrots with your bang sung suck dog or whatever .         it   s pitch black  sir .  i can   t see my hand in front of my face   ouch .     feeney had walked directly into vimes .  light dawned  although not on feeney .   vimes looked around the meandering cave .  it was lit as if by daylight .  there were no torches  no candles  just a pervading  moderately bright light     the light he had seen before  years ago now  in a cave  a big cave  far away  and he knew what it meant  he was seeing darkness  probably better than the goblins did .  the dark had become incredibly light on that day when vimes  underground  had fought creatures     walking  speaking creatures     that made their home away from the light  and had hatched dark plans .  but vimes had fought them  and he had won  and because of that  the koom valley accord had been written and signed  and the oldest war in the world had ended in  if not peace  then a place where the seeds of peace could hopefully be planted .  it was good to know that  because out of the darkness vimes had acquired     a companion .  the dwarfs had one name for it  the summoning dark .  and they had any number of explanations for what it was  a demon  a lost god  a curse  a blessing  vengeance made flesh  except that it had no flesh other than the flesh it borrowed  a law unto itself  a killer but sometimes a protector  or something that no one could find the right words for .  it could travel through rock  water  air and flesh and  for all vimes knew  through time .  after all  what limits can you put on a creature made of nothing .  yes  he had met it and  when they parted  for amusement  playfulness  mischief or simply reward the summoning dark had put its mark on him  drifting through him and leaving that little glowing tattoo .   vimes pulled up his shirt sleeve and there it was  and it seemed to be brighter .  sometimes he met it in dreams  where they nodded at one another in respect and then went their separate ways .  months  even years might pass between meetings and he might think it had gone for good  but its mark was on his forearm .  sometimes it itched .  all in all  it was like having a nightmare on a leash .  and now it was giving him sight in the darkness .  but hold on  this was a goblin burrow  not a dwarf cave .  and his own thoughts came right back at him with that slight overtone  as if they were a duet     yes  but goblins steal everything  commander .      right here and now  it appeared that goblins had stolen away .  the floor of the cave was covered with debris  rubbish and things that presumably goblins thought were important  which would probably mean everything  bearing in mind they religiously collected their own snot .  he could see the old goblin beckoning him to follow before disappearing .  there was a door ahead of him  of goblin manufacture  as was borne out by its look of rottenness and the fact that it was hanging by one hinge  which broke when vimes gave the door a push .  behind him feeney said     what was that .  please  sir  i can   t see a thing .      vimes walked across to the boy and tapped him on the shoulder  causing him to jump .      mister upshot  i   ll take you up to the entrance so that you can go home  okay .      he felt the boy shudder .     no  sir .  i   d rather stay with you  if it   s all the same to you     please .         but you can   t see in the dark  lad .         i know  sir .  i   ve got some string in my pocket .  my granddad said a good copper should always have a piece of string .     his voice was trembling .      it is generally useful  yes     said vimes  carefully picking it out of the boy   s pocket .     it   s amazing how helpless a suspect can be with his thumbs tied together .  are you sure you wouldn   t feel better up in the fresh air .         sorry  sir  but if it   s all the same to you i think the safest place to be right now is behind you  sir .         you really can   t see a thing  lad .         not a blessed thing  sir .  it   s like i   ve gone blind  sir .      in vimes   s opinion the young man was about to go postal  and maybe tethering him to vimes was better than hearing him knock himself out in an attempt to flee .      you   re not blind  lad  it   s just that all that night duty i   ve done     well  it looks as if i   m better than i thought at seeing in the dark .      feeney shuddered again at vimes   s touch  but together they succeeded in linking chief constable upshot to vimes with about six feet of hairy string  which smelled of pig .   there were no goblins behind the broken door  but a fire was smouldering fitfully  with a piece of blessedly unrecognizable meat on a spit above it .  a man might think that a goblin had found a reason to leave his tea behind in a hurry .  and talking of tea  there was a pot  which was to say a rusty tin can  bubbling in the embers of the fire .  vimes sniffed at it  and was surprised that it smelled of bergamot  and somehow the idea of a goblin drinking posh tea with his pinkie extended managed  temporarily  to overwhelm his incongruity functions .  well  it grew  didn   t it .  and goblins probably got thirsty  didn   t they .  nothing to worry about .  although if he found a plate of delicate biscuits he would definitely have to sit down and rest .   he walked on  the light never failing  goblins never appearing .  the cave complex certainly sloped downwards  and there were still signs of goblins everywhere  but of goblins themselves no sign  which in theory should be a good thing  given that generally the first sign of a goblin would be one landing on your head and trying to turn it into a bowling ball .  and then there was a flash of colour in this drab subterranean landscape of greys and browns  it was a bunch of flowers  or what had been a bunch before it had been dropped .  vimes wasn   t an expert on flowers  and when he bought them for sybil  at maritally advisable intervals  he generally stuck to a bunch of roses  or its seemingly acceptable equivalent  one single orchid .  he was vaguely aware of the existence of other flowers  of course  which brightened up the place  to be sure  but he had never been one for the names .   there were no roses here  no orchids either .  these flowers had been plucked from hedgerows and meadows and even included the scrawny plants that managed to hang on and flower in the wilderness up above .  someone had carried them .  someone had dropped them .  someone had been in a hurry .  vimes could read it in the flowers .  they had fallen from somebody   s open hand  so that they spread back along their path like a comet tail .  and then more than one person had trampled them underfoot  but probably not because they were chasing the aforesaid bouquet carrier  but by the look of it because they wanted to go the way that he or she had run  and even faster than he or she did .   there had been a stampede  in fact .  scared people running away .  but running away from what .      you  commander vimes  you  the majesty of the law .  see how i help you  commander .     the familiarity of the voice annoyed him  it sounded too much like his own voice .     but i   m here because they wanted me to come .     he said to the cave in general .     i wasn   t intending to fight anybody .     and in his head his own voice told him     oh my little ragtag  rubbish people  who do not trust and are not trusted .  tread with care  mister policeman  the hated have no reason to love .  oh  the strange and secret people  last and worst  born of rubbish  hopeless  bereft of god .  the best of luck to you  my brother     my brother in darkness     do what you can for them  mister po leess maan .      on vimes   s wrist the sigil of the summoning dark glowed for a moment .      i   m not your brother .     vimes shouted .     i   m not a killer .     the words echoed around the caves  but under them vimes thought he felt something slithering away .  could something with no body slither .  gods damn the dwarfs and their subterranean folklore .      are you  er  all right  sir .     came the nervous voice of feeney behind him .     er  you were shouting  sir .         i was just cussing because i banged my head on the ceiling  lad     vimes lied .  he had to deliver reassurance quickly before feeney got so unnerved that he might try to make a break for the exit out of panic .     you   re doing very well  chief constable .         only  i don   t like the dark  sir  never have     er  do you think anyone   ll worry if i have a wee up against the wall .         i should go ahead if i was you  lad .  i don   t think anything could make this place smell worse .      vimes heard some vague sounds behind him  and then feeney said  in a damp little voice     er  nature has taken its course  sir .  sorry  sir .      vimes smiled to himself .     don   t worry  lad  you won   t be the first copper to have to wring out his socks  and you won   t be the last  either .  i remember the first time i had to arrest a troll .  big fellow  he was  a very nasty character .  i was a bit damp around the socks that day  and i don   t mind admitting it .  think of it as a kind of baptism .     keep it jolly  he thought  make a joke of it .  don   t let him dwell on the fact that we   re walking into the scene of a crime that he can   t see .     funny thing     that troll is now my best sergeant  and i   ve relied on him for my life quite a few times .  that just goes to show that you never know  although what it is we never know i suspect we   ll never know .      vimes turned a corner and there were the goblins .  he was glad that young feeney couldn   t see them .  strictly speaking  vimes wished he couldn   t see them either .  there must have been a hundred of them  many of them holding weapons .  they were crude weapons  to be sure  but a flint axe hitting your head does not need a degree in physics .      have we got somewhere  sir .     said feeney behind him .     you   ve stopped walking .      they   re just standing there  vimes thought  as if they   re on parade .  just watching in silence  waiting for that silence to break .      there are a few goblins in this cave  lad  and they   re watching us .      after a few seconds of silence feeney said     could you tell me exactly what    a few    means  sir .      dozens and dozens of owlish faces stared at vimes without expression .  if the silence was going to be broken by the word    charge    then he and feeney would be smears on the floor  which was pretty smeared as it was .  why did i come in here .  why did i think it was a good thing to do .  oh well  the lad is a policeman  after all  and it isn   t as if he doesn   t already have a clothing problem .  he said     i would say there are about a hundred  lad  all heavily armed  as far as i can see  except for a couple of broken down ones right at the front  could be chieftains  i suppose .  beards you could keep a rabbit in  and  by the look of it  may have .  it looks as if they are waiting for something .      there was a pause before feeney said     it   s been an education  working with you  sir .         look     said vimes     if i have to turn and run  just hang on  okay .  running is another skill a policeman sometimes needs .      he turned to the crowd of impassive goblins and said     i am commander vimes of the ankh morpork city watch .  how can i help you .         just ice .     the cry caused things to drop from the ceiling .  it echoed around the cave and echoed again  as cavern after cavern picked up the shout  spun it around  and sent it back .  light rose as torches were kindled .  it took vimes a few moments to realize this  because the light he had seen  some curious artificial light that was probably in his head  had been brighter  and mixed strangely with the smoky orange that was now filling the cave .      well  sir  it looks as though they   re pleased to see us  yes .      feeney   s relief and hope should have been bottled and sold to despairing people everywhere .  vimes just nodded  because the ranks were pulling apart  leaving a pathway of sorts  at the end of which there was  inarguably  a corpse .  it was a mild relief to see that it was a goblin corpse  but no corpse is good news  particularly when seen in a grimy low light and especially for the corpse .  and yet something inside him exulted and cried hallelujah .   because here was a corpse and he was a copper and this was a crime and this place was smoky and dirty and full of suspicious looking goblins and here was a crime .  his world .  yes  here was his world .   in the ankh morpork city watch forensic laboratory igor was brewing coffee  to the accompaniment of distant rumblings  strange flashes of light and the smell of electricity .  at last he pulled the big red lever and frothing brown liquid gurgled into a pot  to be subsequently delivered into two mugs  one of which carried the slogan    igorth thtitch you up     while the other was emblazoned with    dwarfs do it slightly lower down    .  he handed that one to sergeant cheery littlebottom  whose previous experience as an alchemist meant that she sometimes did duty in the lab .  but at this point the cosiness of morning coffee was interrupted by nobby nobbs  towing sergeant colon behind him .     the sergeant has had a bit of a shock  igor  so i thought you might be able to help him .         well  i could give him another one     igor volunteered  as fred colon slumped into a chair  which creaked ominously under his weight .  the chair had straps on it .      look     said nobby     i   m not mucking about .  you   ve heard of the tobacco that counts .  well  he just had a cigar that cries .  i   ve put it in this    ere evidence bag  as per standing instructions .      cheery took the bag and peered inside .     it   s got egg sandwiches in it .  honestly  nobby  has anyone explained to you what forensic means .     on the basis that she probably couldn   t make things actually worse  cheery emptied the sandwiches on to the table  where they were joined by one cigar with mayonnaise .  she wiped this down with some care and looked at it .     well  nobby .  i don   t smoke and i don   t know much about cigars  but this one appears to be quite happy at the moment .         you have to hold it to your ear     said nobby helpfully .   cheery did so  and said     all i can hear is the crinkling of the tobacco  which i suspect hasn   t been properly kept .      the dwarf held the cigar away from her face and looked at it suspiciously  and then wordlessly she handed it to igor  who put it to his ear  or at least the one that he was currently using  because you never know with igors .  they looked at one another and igor broke the silence .     there are such things  i believe  as tobacco weevils .         i   m sure there are     said cheery     but i doubt very much if they     chuckle .         chuckle .  it sounded to me like somebody crying     said igor  as he squinted at the bulging cigar  and added     we should wash down the table and clean a scalpel and use the number two tweezers and two  no  make that four sterilized surgical masks and gloves .  it may be some kind of unusual insect in there .         i held that cigar up to my ear     said nobby .     what kind of insect are we talking about .         i   m not sure     said igor     but generally the places in the world where tobacco is cultivated are known for some remarkably dangerous ones .  for example  the yellow grass weevil of howondaland has been known to enter the skull via the ears  lay its eggs in the victim   s brain and leave the poor victim hallucinating continuously until it has exited via the nostrils .  death inevitably ensues .  my cousin igor has a tank full of them .  they   re very good at getting skulls scrupulously clean .     igor paused .     so i   m told  that is  although i personally cannot confirm that .     he paused again  then added     of course .      nobby nobbs headed for the door  but  unusually  sergeant colon did not follow his friend .  instead  he said     i   ll just stay with my fingers in my ears  if it   s all the same to you .      he craned his head to watch as igor carefully pulled the cigar apart  and said conversationally     they say that the cigars made in foreign parts are rolled on the thighs of young women .  personally i call that disgusting .      there was a tinkle and a glint   and something dropped on to the table .  cheery leaned cautiously forward .  it looked like a small expensive phial for the most delicate alchemical experiments and yet  she thought later  it seemed to have movement in it  movement while staying still .  igor looked over her shoulder and said     oh .      they looked at the phial in silence  silence that was soon broken by sergeant colon .     that looks shiny     he said .     is it worth anything .      cheery littlebottom raised her eyebrows at igor  who shrugged .  he said     priceless  i should think  if you could find a buyer with enough money and the  how shall i put it  right taste in ornamentation .         it   s an unggue pot     cheery said carefully .     a goblin ceremonial pot  sarge .      the dawn of understanding began to flow across sergeant colon   s gas giant of a face .     ain   t they the things they make to store all their piss and shit in .     he said  backing away .   igor cleared his throat and looked at cheery as he said  icily     not this type  if i   m right  and at least not down here on the plains .  those that feel themselves protected in the high mountains make pots  and also use the unggue brushes and  of course  the unggue masks .     he looked expectantly  but without any real hope  at the sergeant .  cheery  who had known fred for longer  said     i understand  sarge  that the goblins on the plains think the ones in the mountains are rather strange .  as for this pot     she hesitated     i rather fear that this is a particularly special one .         well  it looks like the little buggers got that right     said fred cheerfully  and  to cheery   s horror  he snatched up the tiny pot .     it   s mine  that   s why  far too good for a stinking goblin  but how come it makes a noise .      sergeant littlebottom looked at igor   s expression  and  to prevent trouble in the forensic department  she grabbed the sergeant   s arm and dragged him out of the door  slamming it behind them .      sorry about this  sergeant  but i could see that igor was becoming a little bit agitated .      sergeant colon brushed himself down with as much dignity as he could muster  and said     if it   s valuable  then i want it  thank you so very much .  after all  it was given to me in good faith .  right .         well  of course that is so  sergeant  but you see  it already belongs to a goblin .      sergeant colon burst out laughing .     them .  what have they got to own apart from big piles of crap .      cheery hesitated .  lazy and bombastic as fred colon was  the record showed that  against all apparent evidence  he had been a helpful and useful officer .  she needed to be tactful .      sergeant  can i say right now that i appreciate all the help you have given to me since i arrived in pseudopolis yard .  i   ll always remember you pointing out to me all those places where a watchman could stand out of the wind and the worst of the rain  and i definitely committed to memory the list of public houses who would be generous to a thirsty copper after hours .  and indeed i remember you telling me that a copper should never take a bribe  and why a meal was not a bribe .  i cherish your approval  sergeant  since i know that by upbringing you are not particularly happy about women in the watch  and especially when one of those women is of the dwarf persuasion .  i realize that in the course of your long career you have had to adapt your thinking to meet the new circumstances .  therefore  i   m proud to be a colleague of yours  sergeant colon  and i hope you   ll forgive me when i tell you that there are times when you should shut up and get some new ideas in that big fat head of yours rather than constantly reheating the old ones .  you picked up a little trinket  sergeant  and now it really is yours  more yours than i think you can possibly imagine .  i wish i could tell you more  but i only know what the average dwarf knows about goblins  and i don   t know too much about this type of unggue pot but i think  given the floral decoration and its small size  that it is the one they call the soul of tears  sergeant  and i think you have made your life suddenly very interesting because   can i ask you to put it down for just one moment  please .  i promise most sincerely that i won   t take it away from you .      colon   s somewhat piggy eyes looked at cheery suspiciously  but he said     well  if it gives you any satisfaction .     he went to put the pot on the nearby windowsill and she saw him shake his hand .     seems to be stuck on .      cheery thought to herself  so it   s true .  out loud she said     i   m very sorry to hear that  sergeant  but you see  in that pot is the living soul of a goblin child and it belongs to you .  congratulations .     she said  trying to keep the rising sarcasm out of her voice .   that night sergeant colon dreamed he was in a cave with monsters chattering away at him in their dreadful lingo .  he put it down to the beer  but it was funny the way he couldn   t let the little glittering thing go .  his fingers never quite managed it  however hard he tried .   the mother of sam vimes had managed  heavens know how  to scrape up the penny a day necessary for him to be educated at the dame school run by mistress slightly .   mistress slightly was everything a dame should be .  she was fat  and gave the impression of being made of marshmallows  had a gentle understanding of the fact that the bladders of small boys are almost as treacherous as the bladders of old men  and  in general  taught the basics of the alphabet with a minimum of cruelty and a maximum of marshmallow .   she kept geese  as any self respecting dame should do .  later in life the older vimes had wondered if  underneath the endless layers of petticoats  mistress slightly wore red and white spotted drawers .  she certainly had a mob cap and a laugh like rainwater going down a drain .  invariably  while she took lessons  she was peeling potatoes or plucking geese .   there was still a place in his heart for old mistress slightly  who occasionally had a mint in her pocket for a boy who knew his alphabet and could say it backwards .  and you had to be grateful to someone who taught you how not to be afraid .   she had one book in her tiny sitting room  and the first time she had given it to young sam vimes to read he had got as far as page seven when he froze .  the page showed a goblin  the jolly goblin  according to the text .  was it laughing  was it scowling  was it hungry  was it about to bite your head off .  young sam vimes hadn   t waited to find out and had spent the rest of the morning under a chair .  these days he excused himself by remembering that most of the other kids felt the same way .  when it came to the innocence of childhood  adults often got it wrong .  in any case  she had sat him on her always slightly damp knee after class and made him really look at the goblin .  it was made of lots of dots .  tiny dots  if you looked closely .  the closer you looked at the goblin the more it wasn   t there .  stare it down and it lost all its power to frighten .     i hear that they are wretched  badly made mortals     the dame had said sadly .     half finished folk  or so i hear .  it   s only a blessing this one had something to be jolly about .      later on  because he had been a good boy  she had made him blackboard monitor  the first time anyone had entrusted him with anything .  good old mistress slightly  vimes thought  as he stood in this gloomy cave surrounded by ranks of silent  solemn goblins .  i   ll have a bag of peppermints on your grave if i get out of this alive .  he cleared his throat .     well now  lad  what we appear to have here is a goblin who has been in a fight .     he looked down at the corpse  and then to feeney .     perhaps you would care to tell me what you see .      feeney was one step away from trembling .     well  sir  i surmise that it is dead  sir .         and how do you deduce this  please .         er  its head isn   t attached to its body  sir .         yes  we generally recognize that as a clue that the corpse is indeed dead .  incidentally  lad  you may as well take the string off .  i wouldn   t say this is the best light i   ve ever seen by  but it   ll do .  do you notice anything else  chief constable .     vimes tried to keep his tone level .      well  sir  it   s pretty cut about  sir .      vimes smiled encouragingly .     notice anything about that  lad .     feeney was making heavy weather of it  but recruits often did at the start  doing so much looking that they forgot to see .     you   re doing well  chief constable .  would you care to extrapolate .         sir .  extrapolate  sir .         why would somebody be all cut about on their arms .  think about that .      feeney   s lips actually moved as he thought  and then he grinned .     he was defending himself with his hands  sir .         well done  lad  and people who are defending themselves with their hands are doing so because they don   t have a shield or a weapon .  i would wager  too  that his head was cut off while he was on the ground .  can   t exactly put my finger on it  but that looks to me like deliberate butchering rather than a hasty slice .  everything is messy  but you can see that the belly has been sliced open  yet there is hardly any blood around it .     now he was taken by surprise .     and because of the belly wound i know something else about him that i wish i didn   t know     he said .      what   s that  sir .         he is a she  and she was ambushed  or maybe trapped .     and  he thought  there   s a claw missing .   after a while it becomes a puzzle  not a corpse  said vimes to himself as he knelt down  but never soon enough  and never for long enough .  aloud he said     look at the marks on this leg  lad .  i reckon she stepped in a rabbit snare  probably because she was running away from     somebody .      vimes stood up so fast that the watching goblins backed away .     good grief  boy  we shouldn   t do that  not even in the country .  isn   t there some kind of code .  you kill the bucks  not the does  isn   t that right .  and this isn   t some spur of the moment thing .  someone wanted to get a lot of blood out of this lady .  you tell me why .      vimes wasn   t certain what feeney would have replied had they not been surrounded by solemn faced goblins  which was just as well .      this is murder  lad  the capital crime .  and do you know why it was done .  i   ll wager anything that it was so that constable upshot  acting on information received  would find a lot of blood in dead man   s copse  where commander vimes was apparently going to have a meeting with an annoying blacksmith  and so  given that both of them were men of quick temper  quite possibly foul play could have been involved  yes .         it   s a legitimate deduction  sir  you must admit that .         of course i do  and now it   s a total bastard of a deduction  and now you must admit that .         yes  sir  i do  sir  and apologize .  however  i   d like to search the premises for any sign of mister jefferson .     feeney looked half ashamed  half defiant .      and why do you want to do that  chief constable .      feeney stuck out his chin .     because i   ve been shown to be a bloody fool once  and i don   t intend to be one again .  besides  sir  you might be wrong .  this poor lady might have been in a fight with the blacksmith  perhaps  i don   t know  but i do know that if i don   t make a search here in the circumstances  somebody important is bound to ask me why i didn   t .  and that person would be you  wouldn   t it  commander .         good answer  young man .  and i have to admit that i   ve been a bloody fool more times than i can count  so i can sympathize .      vimes looked down again at the corpse and it was suddenly urgent to try to find out what willikins had done with the claw  complete with ring  that they had found the previous night .  awkwardly  he said to the assembled goblins     i believe that i have found some jewellery belonging to this young lady and  of course  i shall bring it to you .      there was not so much as an acknowledgement from the impassive horde .  vimes considered that thought .  hordes come in killing and stealing .  this lot look like a bunch of worried people .  he walked over to a grizzled old goblin who might have been the one he had seen up on the surface a thousand years ago  and said     i   d like to see more of this place  sir .  i   m sorry for the death of the lady .  i   ll bring the killers to justice .         just ice .     once again it echoed around the cave .  the old goblin stepped forward very gently and touched vimes   s sleeve .     the dark is your friend  mister po leess maan .  i hear you  you hear me .  in the dark you may go where you wish .  mister po leess maan  please do not kill us .      vimes looked past the goblin to the ranks behind  most of them as skinny as rakes  and this  well  chieftain probably  who looked as though he was decomposing while standing up  didn   t want him to hurt them .  he remembered the scattered flowers .  the orphaned bergamot tea .  the uneaten meal .  they were trying to hide away from me .  he nodded and said     i do not attack anyone who isn   t attacking me  sir  and i will not start today .  can you tell me how this lady came to be     killed .         she was thrown into our cave last night  mister po leess maan .  she had gone out to check the rabbit snares .  thrown down like old bones  mister po leess maan  like old bones .  no blood in her .  like old bones .         what was her name .      the old goblin looked at vimes as if shocked  and after a moment said     her name was the pleasant contrast of the orange and yellow petals in the flower of the gorse .  thank you  mister po leess maan of the dark .         i   m afraid i   m only just starting to investigate this crime     said vimes  feeling unusually embarrassed .      i meant  mister po leess maan  thank you for believing that goblins have names .  my name is sound of the rain on hard ground .  she was my second wife .      vimes stared at the rugged face that only a mother could tolerate and perhaps love  searching for any sign of anger or grief .  there was just a sense of sorrow and hopeless resignation at the fact that the world was as it was and always would be and there was nothing that could be done .  the goblin was a sigh on legs .  in dejection he looked up at vimes and said     they used to send hungry dogs into the cave  mister po leess maan .  those were good days  we ate well .         this is my land     said vimes     and i think i can see to it that you   re not disturbed here .      something like a chuckle found its way through the old goblin   s ragged beard .     we know what the law is  mister po leess maan .  the law is the land .  you say     this is my land     but you did not make the land .  you did not make your sheep  you did not make the rabbits on which we live  you did not make the cows  or the horses  but you say     these things are mine    .  this cannot be a truth .  i make my axe  my pots  and these are mine .  what i wear is mine .  some love was mine .  now it has gone .  i think you are a good man  mister po leess maan  but we see the turning of the times .  maybe a hundred or two hundred years ago there was in the world what people called    the wilderness     or    no man   s land     or    wasteland     and we lived in such places  we are waste people .  there was the troll race  the dwarf race  the human race  and i am sorry for the goblin race that we cannot run so fast .      somebody pulled at vimes   s shirt .  this time it was feeney .     you   d best be going now  sir .      vimes turned .     why .         sorry  sir  but her ladyship did instruct you to be back for tea .         we   re conducting a murder investigation  chief constable .  i don   t mean to be rude  but i   m sure mister rain on hard ground here will understand .  we must see for ourselves that the missing blacksmith is not here .      feeney fidgeted .     i couldn   t help noticing that her ladyship was very expressive on the subject  sir .      vimes nodded to the old goblin .     i   ll find out who killed your wife  sir  and i   ll bring them to justice .     he paused on cue as another chorus of    just ice .     echoed around the caves .     but first i must  for police reasons  inspect the rest of this     establishment  if you have no objection .      the goblin looked at him bright eyed .     and if i object  mister po leess maan .      vimes matched his stare .     an interesting question     he said     and if you threatened us with violence i would leave .  indeed  if you forbade me to search then i would leave  and  sir  the worst part is that i would not come back .  sir  i respectfully ask that i may in the pursuit of my inquiries be shown around the rest of these premises .      was that a smile on the old goblin   s face .     of course  mister po leess maan .      behind the old goblin the rest of the crowd began to move away  presumably to either make pots or fill them .  rain on hard ground  who  it had to be assumed  because nothing had been said to the contrary  was either a chieftain  as vimes would understand it  or simply a goblin tasked with talking to stupid humans  said     you are seeking the blacksmith .  he visits us sometimes .  there is iron down here  not much  but he finds it useful .  of course it is no good for pots  but we trade it for food .  i don   t think i have seen him for several days .  however  by all means look for him without hindrance .  the dark is in you .  i would not dare to stand in your way  mister po leess maan .  such as it is  this place is yours .      with that the old goblin beckoned to some juvenile goblins to pick up all that was left of his wife and drifted away towards another cave mouth .      have you seen a lot of dead bodies  commander .     said feeney  in a voice that almost managed not to shake .      oh yes  lad  and some of them i helped to make .         you   ve killed people .      vimes looked at the ceiling so as not to have to look at feeney   s face .     i like to think i did my best not to     he said     and on the whole i   ve been good at that  but sooner or later there   s always going to be somebody who is determined to finish you off and you end up having to take him down the wrong way because he   s just too damn stupid to surrender .  it doesn   t get any better  and i   ve never seen a corpse that looked good .      the funeral group had disappeared into the other cave now  and the two policemen were left alone  but feeling  however  that around them people were going about their business .   the old goblin had just stood there and mentioned that the woman was his wife almost as an afterthought .  he hadn   t even raised his voice .  vimes couldn   t have stood there like that if it had been sybil   s body on the ground in front of him  and as sure as hell he would not be polite to any goblins who were in front of him either .  how can you get like that .  how can life so beat you down .   the street was always with you  just as willikins had said .  and vimes remembered the ladies who scrubbed .  cockbill street got scrubbed so often that it was surprising it wasn   t now at a lower level than the ground around it .  the doorstep was scrubbed  and then whitened  the red tiles on the floor inside were scrubbed and then polished with red lead  and the black cooking stove was blackened even further by being rubbed ferociously with black lead .  women in those days had elbows that moved like pistons .  and it was all about survival  and survival was all about pride .  you didn   t have much control over your life  but by jimmy you could keep it clean and show the world you were poor but respectable .  that was the dread  the dread of falling back  losing standards  becoming no better than those people who bred and fought and stole in that ferocious turmoil of a rookery known as the shades .   the goblins had succumbed  had they .  going through the motions now  while the world gently expelled them  they were giving up  letting go     but murder was murder in any jurisdiction or none at all .  he tied his thoughts in a knot under his chin  snatched a couple of smouldering torches and said     come on  chief constable  let   s go and fight crime .         yes  sir     said feeney     but can i ask you another question .         of course     said vimes  heading towards a tunnel that was perceptibly sloping downwards .      what   s going on here  sir  if you don   t mind me asking .  i mean  i know that there   s been a murder and maybe some bugger wanted me to think it was you as done it  but how come  sir  that you understand that heathen lingo of theirs .  i mean  i hear you talking to them  and they must understand you     cos they talk back  sir  but they talk like somebody cracking walnuts under their foot  sir  and i can   t understand a damn word of it  sir  if you   ll excuse my klatchian  not a damn word .  i want an answer  sir  because i feel enough of a bloody fool as it is  i don   t want to be even more foolish than i feel now .      vimes  in the privacy of his own head  tried out the statement     well  since you ask  i have a deadly demon sharing my mind  which seems to be helping me for reasons of its own .  it lets me see in this gloom and somehow allows me and goblins to communicate .  it   s called the summoning dark .  i don   t know what its interest in goblins is but the dwarfs think it brings down wrath on the unrighteous .  if there has been a murder i   ll use any help i can get .     he did not in fact articulate this  on the basis that most people would have left very quickly by the time he had finished  so he settled for saying     i have the support of a higher power  chief constable .  now  let   s check out this place .     this didn   t satisfy feeney  but he appeared to understand that it was all he was going to get .   it was an eerie journey .  the hill was honeycombed with caves linked by passages natural and  occasionally  by the look of it  artificial .  it was a small city .  there were middens  crude cages now empty of whatever had been in them  and here and there quite large beds of fungus  in some cases being harvested very  very slowly  by goblins who barely glanced at the policemen .  at one point they passed an opening which appeared to lead to a cr  che  by the sound of it  in which case baby goblins twittered like birds .  vimes couldn   t bring himself to look further inside .   as they went lower down they came across a very small rivulet that trickled out of one wall .  the goblins in a rough and ready way had made a culvert  so that their journey onwards was to the sound of running water .  and everywhere there were goblins  and the goblins were making pots .  vimes was prepared for this  but badly prepared .  he had expected something like the dwarf workshops he had seen in uberwald     noisy  busy and full of purposeful activity .  but that wasn   t the goblin way .  it appeared that if a goblin wanted to start on a pot  all it needed to do was find a place to hunker down  rummage through whatever it was it had in its pockets and get to work  so slowly that it was hard to tell that anything was going on .  several times vimes thought he heard the chip of stone on stone  or the sound of scratching  or what might be sawing  but whenever he came close to a squatting goblin it politely edged around and leaned over the work like a child trying to keep a secret .  how much snot  he thought  how many fingernail clippings  how much earwax did a goblin accumulate in one year .  would an annual pot of snot be something like a lady   s delicate snuffbox  or would it be a sloshing great bucketful .   and why not  yes  why not teeth .  even humans were careful when it came to the escaped teeth  and  come to that  there were people  especially wizards  who made a point of ensuring that their toenails were put beyond use .  he smiled to himself .  maybe the goblins weren   t all that stupid  only more stupid than humans were  which  when you came to think about it  took some effort .   and then  as they crept past a cross legged goblin  it sat back on its haunches and held up     light .  vimes had seen plenty of jewels  generations of rings  brooches  necklaces and tiaras had funnelled down the centuries and into lady sybil   s lap  although these days most of them were kept in a vault .  that always amused him .   sparkle though sybil   s jewels might  he would have sworn that none of them could have filled the air with light as much as the little pot did when its creator held it up for a critical appraisal .  the goblin turned it this way and that  inspecting it like a man thinking of buying a horse from somebody called honest harry .  white and yellow beams of light shimmered as it moved  filling the drab cave with what vimes could only think of as echoes of light .  feeney was staring as a child might stare at his first party .  the goblin  however  appeared to sneer at its creation and tossed it dismissively over its shoulder  where it smashed on the wall .      why did you do that .     vimes shouted  so loudly that the goblin he was addressing cowered and looked as if it expected to be struck .  it managed to say     bad pot .  bad work .  for to be ashamed .  make much better one time more .  will start now .     it took another terrified look at vimes and hurried into the darkness of the cave .      he smashed it .  he actually smashed it .     feeney stared at vimes .     he took one look at it and smashed it .  and it was wonderful .  that was criminal .  you can   t just destroy something as wonderful as that  can you .      vimes put a hand on feeney   s shoulder .     i think you can if you   ve just made it and think you could have done it better .  after all  even the best craftsmen sometimes make mistakes  yes .         you think that was a mistake .     feeney rushed over to where the debris of the late pot had hit the floor  and picked up a handful of glittering remains .     sir  he did throw these away  sir .      vimes opened his mouth to reply  but there was a faint noise from feeney   s hand  dust was falling between his fingers like the sands of time .  feeney grinned nervously at vimes and said     maybe it was a bit shoddy after all  sir .      vimes squatted down and ran his fingers through the pile of dust .  and it was just dust  stone dust  no more colour or sparkle to it than you would find in a pebble by the road .  there was no trace of the scintillating rainbow that they had just seen .  but on the other side of this cave another goblin was trying to look inconspicuous as it worked on what was probably another pot .  vimes stepped over to it with care  because it was holding its pot as if prepared to use it to defend itself .   casually  to show that he meant no harm  vimes put his arms behind his back and said in tones learned from his wife     my word .  that looks like a very good pot .  tell me  how do you make a pot  sir .  can you tell me .      the potter looked down at the thing in its hands  or the thing in its claws if you wanted to be nasty  and perhaps slightly more accurate  and said     i make the pot .     it raised the work in progress .   vimes wasn   t that good at stone which wasn   t part of masonry  but this one was slightly yellow and shiny .  he said     yes  i can see that  but how do you actually make the pot .      once again  the potter sought enlightenment from the universe  looking up and down and everywhere that vimes wasn   t .  at last inspiration dawned .     i make pot .      vimes nodded gravely .     thank you for sharing the secrets of your success     he said  and turned to feeney .     come on  let   s keep going .      it seemed that a goblin cave     or lair or burrow  depending on what effect you wanted to give     was not quite the hellhole that you might have thought .  instead it was just  well  a hole  stuffy with the smoke of the innumerable small fires goblins appeared to need  along with the associated small pile of rotted kindling  and not forgetting the personal midden .   goblins old and young watched them carefully as they passed  as if expecting them to put on a programme of entertainment .  there were certainly juvenile goblins .  vimes had to admit that alone among the talking species  goblin babies were plug ugly  merely small versions of their parents who themselves were no oil paintings  and not even a watercolour .  vimes told himself that they could not help it  that some incompetent god had found a lot of bits left over  and decided that the world needed a creature that looked like a cross between a wolf and an ape  and gave them what was surely one of the most unhelpful pieces of religious dogma  even by the standards of celestial idiocy .  they looked like the bad guys and  without the intervention of the summoning dark  they sounded like them  too .  if walnuts could shriek when they were being cracked  then people would say     doesn   t that remind you of a goblin .     and it appeared that  not content with all this  the laughing god had apparently given them that worst of gifts  self knowledge  leaving them so certain that they were irrevocably walking rubbish that metaphorically they couldn   t even find the energy to clean the step .      oh  blast .  i   m treading on something     in something     said feeney .     you seem to be able to see much better than me down here  sir .         good clean living  lad  carrots and whatnot .         jefferson could be in here somewhere .  i   m sure there are caves that we   re missing .         i know he   s not in here  lad  only don   t ask me how i know because i would have to lie to you .  i   m going through the motions to help myself think .  it   s an old copper trick .         yes  sir  treading in every motion  i should think .      vimes smiled in the gloom .     well done  lad .  a sense of humour is the copper   s friend .  i always say the day isn   t complete without a little chuckle       he paused because something had clanged against his helmet .     we   ve reached jefferson   s iron workings  my lad .  i just found an oil lamp  i certainly haven   t seen those higher up .     he felt in his pocket and soon a match flame bloomed .   well  vimes thought  it   s not that much of a mine  but i bet it works out better than paying dwarf prices .      i can   t see any way out     feeney volunteered .     i suppose he drags the ore out through the main entrance .         i don   t think that the goblins are stupid enough to live in a set of caves that have just one entrance .  there   s probably one that doesn   t even show up on the outside .  look  you can see where somebody   s been lugging heavy weights across the stone       vimes stopped .  there was another human in the cave .  well  thank you  darkness  he thought .  i suppose asking who it is might be in order .      sir  i don   t think it   s just mining that goes on here .  take a look at these     said feeney  behind vimes .   feeney held out some books  children   s books  by the look of it .  they were grubby     this was  after all  the home of goblins     but vimes turned to the first page of the first book and was not surprised to see an unfeasibly large red apple  currently somewhat soiled by the pressure of many dirty hands .   a voice in the gloom  a female voice  said     not all questions are answered  commander  but fortunately some answers are questioned .  i   m attempting to teach the goblin children .  of course  i had to bring in an apple for the young ones to see     the woman in the shadows added .     not many knew what one was  and certainly not what they were called .  troll language is unbelievably complex compared with what these poor devils have got .  good day to you too  mr upshot .  not cowering away from the truth in your lock up .      vimes had spun round when he first heard that voice  and was now staring with his mouth open .     you .  aren   t you the  er            the poo lady  yes  commander vimes .  it   s amazing  isn   t it  how people remember .         well  you must admit that it does     how can i put it .      stick in the mind  miss felicity beedle .         very well done  commander  considering that we   ve met only once .      and now vimes noticed that with her there was a goblin  a young one by the size of it  but more noticeable because it was staring directly at him with a keen and interested gaze  quite uncharacteristic of the goblins that he had seen so far  apart from the wretched stinky .  feeney  on the other hand  was taking great care not to catch the lady   s eye  vimes noticed .   he smiled at miss beedle .     madam  i reckon i see your name at least once every day .  when i was putting my lad to bed yesterday  do you know what he said .  he said     dad  do you know why cows do big wet sloppy poos and horses do them all nice and soft and smelling of grass .  because it   s weird  isn   t it .  that you get two different kinds of poo when they   re both about the same size and it   s the same grass  isn   t it  dad .  well  the poo lady says it   s because cows have room in ants  and the ants help them get  sort of  more food out of their food  but because horses don   t have room in ants  they don   t sort of chew all that much  so that their poo is still very much like grass and doesn   t smell too bad .         vimes saw that the woman was grinning  and went on     i believe that tomorrow he is going to ask his mother if he may chew his dinner very hard one day  and the next day not do it very much  and see if he gets different smells .  what do you think of that  madam .      miss beedle laughed .  it was a very enjoyable laugh .     well  commander  it would seem that your son combines your analytical thinking with the inherited ramkin talent for experimentation .  you must be very proud .  i certainly hope you are .         you can bet on that  madam .     the child standing in miss beedle   s shadow was smiling too  the first smile he   d seen on a goblin .  but before he could say anything  miss beedle directed a disapproving look at feeney and went on     i only wish i could find you in better company  commander .  i wonder if you know where my friend jethro is  officer .      even in the lamplight  feeney looked furious  but if you read people  and vimes was a ferocious reader  it was clear the fury was spiced with shame and dread .  then vimes looked down at the little bench  where there were a few tools and some more brightly covered books .  it was the street that had taught vimes that there were times when you would find it best to let a nervous person get really nervous  and so he picked up a book as if the previous dreadful exchange had not taken place  and said     oh  here   s where   s my cow .  .  young sam loves it .  are you teaching it to the goblins  miss .      with her eyes still on the agitated feeney  miss beedle said     yes  for what it   s worth .  it   s hard work .  incidentally  technically i   m mrs beedle .  my husband was killed in the klatchian war .  i went back to    miss    because  well  it   s more authory  and besides  it wasn   t as though i   d had much time to get accustomed to    mrs    .         i   m sorry about that  madam .  had i known i   d have been a lot less flippant     said vimes .   miss beedle gave him a wan smile .     don   t worry  flippant sometimes does the trick .     beside the teacher the little goblin said     flip ant .  the ant is turned over .         tears of the mushroom is my star pupil .  you   re wonderful  aren   t you  tears of the mushroom .         wonderful is good     said the goblin girl  as though tasting every word .     gentle is good  the mushroom is good .  tears are soft .  i am tears of the mushroom  this much is now said .      it was a strange little speech  the girl spoke as if she were pulling words out of a rack and then tidily putting them back in their places as soon as they had been said .  it sounded very solemn and it came from an odd  flat  pale face .  in a way  tears of the mushroom looked handsome  if not exactly pretty  in what looked like a wraparound apron  and vimes wondered how old she was .  thirteen .  fourteen  maybe .  and he wondered if they would all look as smart as this if they got their hands on some decent clothing and did something about their godawful hair .  the girl   s hair was long and braided and pure white .  amazingly  in this place  she looked like a piece of fragile porcelain .   not knowing what to say  he said it anyway     pleased to meet you  tears of the mushroom .     vimes held out his hand .   the goblin girl looked at it  then looked at him  and then turned to miss beedle  who said     they don   t shake hands  commander .  for people who seem so simple they   re astoundingly complicated .     she went on .     it would seem that providence has brought you here in time to solve the murder of pleasant contrast  who was an excellent pupil .  i came up here as soon as i heard  but the goblins are used to undeserved and casual death .  i   ll walk with you to the entrance  and then i   ve got a class to teach .      vimes tugged at feeney to make him keep up as they followed miss beedle and her charge towards the surface and blessed fresh air .  he wondered what had become of the corpse .  what did they do with their dead .  bury them  eat them  throw them on the midden .  or was he just not thinking right  a thought which itself had been knocking at his brain for some time .  without thinking  he said     what else do you teach them  miss beedle .  to be better citizens .      the slap caught him on the chin  probably because even in her anger miss beedle realized that he still had his steel helmet on .  it was a corker  nonetheless  and out of the corner of his stinging gaze he saw feeney take a step back .  at least the boy had some sense .      you are the gods    own fool  commander vimes .  no  i   m not teaching them to be fake humans  i   m teaching them how to be goblins  clever goblins .  do you know that they have only five names for colours .  even trolls have around sixty  and a lot more than that if they find a paint salesman .  does this mean goblins are stupid .  no  they have a vast number of names that even poets haven   t come up with  for things like the way colours shift and change  the melting of one hue into another .  they have single words for the most complicated of feelings  i know about two hundred of them  i think  and i   m sure there are a lot more .  what you may think are grunts and growls and snarls are in fact carrying vast amounts of information .  they   re like an iceberg  commander  most of them is where you can   t see or understand  and i   m teaching tears of the mushroom and some of her friends so that they may be able to speak to people like you  who think goblins are dumb .  and do you know what  commander .  there isn   t much time .  they   re being slaughtered .  it   s not called that  of course  but slaughter is how it ends  because they   re just dumb nuisances  you see .  why don   t you ask mister upshot what happened to the rest of the goblins three years ago  commander vimes .      and with that miss beedle turned on her heel and disappeared down into the darkness of the cave with tears of the mushroom bobbing along behind her  leaving vimes to walk the last few yards out into the glorious sunlight .   the feeling that hit samuel vimes when he stepped into the vivid light of day was as if somebody had pushed an iron wire through his body and then  in one moment  pulled it out again .  it was all he could do to keep his balance and the boy grabbed him by the arm .  full marks  vimes thought  for being either smart enough to see how the land lay  or at least smart enough not to make a run for it just now .   he sat down on the turf  relishing the breeze through the gorse bushes and sucking in pure fresh air .  whatever you thought about goblins  their cave had the kind of atmosphere about which people say     i should wait two minutes before going in there  if i was you .         i   d like to talk with you  chief constable     he said now .     copper to copper .  about the past and maybe about the shape of things to come .         actually  i meant to thank you  commander  for thinking that i   m a policeman .         your father was policeman down here three years ago  yes .      feeney stared straight ahead .     yes  sir .         so  what happened with the goblins  feeney .      feeney cleared his throat .     well  dad told me and mum to stay indoors .  he said we was not to look  but he couldn   t tell us not to listen  and there was a lot of shouting and i don   t know what  and it upset my old mum no end .  i heard later that a load of goblins had been taken out of the hill  but dad never spoke about it until much later .  i think it broke him  sir  it really did .  he said he watched while a bunch of men  gamekeepers and roughs mostly  came down from the cave dragging goblins behind them  sir .  lots of them .  he said what was so dreadful was that the goblins were all sort of meek  you know .  like they didn   t know what to do .      vimes relented a little at the sight of feeney   s face .     go on  lad .         well  sir  he told me people came out of their houses and there was a lot of running about and he started to ask questions and  well  the magistrates said it was all right because they were nothing more than vermin  and they were going to be taken down to the docks so they could earn their living for a change and not bother other people .  it was all right  dad said .  they were going somewhere sunny  a long way away from here .         just out of interest  mister feeney  how could he know that .         dad said the magistrates were very firm about it  sir .  they were just to be put to work for their living .  he said that it was doing them a favour .  it wasn   t as if they were going to be killed .      vimes kept his expression deliberately blank .  he sighed .     if it was without their consent  then that would be slavery  and if a slave doesn   t work for his living he   s dead .  do you understand .      feeney looked at his boots .  if eyeballs had polish on them his boots would have been gleaming .     after he told me this  my dad told me that i was a copper now and i was to look after mum  and he gave me the truncheon and his badge .  and then his hands started shaking  sir  and a few days later he was dead  sir .  i reckon something snuck up on him  sir  in his head  like .  it overcame him .         have you heard about lord vetinari  feeney .  i can   t say i like him all that much but sometimes he   s bang on the money .  well  there was a bit of a fracas  as we say  and it turned out that a man had a dog  a half dead thing  according to bystanders  and he was trying to get it to stop pulling at its leash  and when it growled at him he grabbed an axe from the butcher   s stall beside him  threw the dog to the ground and cut off its back legs  just like that .  i suppose people would say    nasty bugger  but it was his dog     and so on  but lord vetinari called me in and he said to me     a man who would do something like that to a dog is a man to whom the law should pay close attention .  search his house immediately .     the man was hanged a week later  not for the dog  although for my part i wouldn   t have shed a tear if he had been  but for what we found in his cellar .  the contents of which i will not burden you with .  and bloody vetinari got away with it again  because he was right  where there are little crimes  large crimes are not far behind .      vimes stared at the rolling acres stretching out below  his fields  his trees  his fields of yellow corn     all his  even though he   d never planted a seed in his life  except for the time when he was a kid and he tried to grow mustard and cress on a flannel  which he   d then thrown up because no one had told him he should have washed the flannel first to get all the soap out .  not a good background for a landowner .  but     his land  right .  and he was sure that neither he nor sybil had ever said yes to turning a lot of sad looking goblins out of the mess they were pleased to call a home and taking them to who knew where .      nobody told us .      feeney leaned back to escape that particular ball of wrath .     i wouldn   t know about that  sir .      vimes stood up and stretched his arms .     i   ve heard enough  lad  and i   ve had enough too .  it   s time to report to a higher authority .         i think it   d take at least a day and a half to get a galloper to the city  sir  and you   d have to be lucky with horses .      sam vimes began to walk smartly down the hill .     i was talking about lady sybil  lad .      sybil was in a drawing room full of teacups and ladies when vimes arrived at the hall in a run  with feeney lagging behind .  she took one look at him and said  rather more brightly than warranted     oh  i see you have something to discuss with me .     she turned to the ladies  smiled and said     please do excuse me  ladies .  i must just have a brief word with my husband .     and with that she grabbed vimes and pulled him none too gently back into the hallway .  she opened her mouth to deliver a wifely sermon on the importance of punctuality  sniffed and recoiled .     sam vimes  you stink .  did you fall into something rural .  i   ve hardly seen you since breakfast .  and why are you still dragging that young policeman behind you .  i   m sure he   s got something more important to do .  didn   t he want to arrest you .  is he still coming to tea .  i hope he washes first .     this was said to vimes but aimed at feeney  who was keeping his distance and looked ready to run .      that was a misunderstanding     said vimes hastily     and i   m sure that if i ever find out where my escutcheon is there won   t be a stain on it  but mister feeney here has been generously and of his own free will imparting information to me .      and by the time the husband and wife conversation was in full swing  containing shouted whispers on the lines of    surely not .     and    i think he   s telling the truth     feeney looked ready to sprint .      and they didn   t put up a fight .     said sybil .  the young policeman tried to avoid her gaze  but she had the kind of gaze that came around to find you wherever you stood .      no  your ladyship     was all he managed .   lady sybil looked at her husband and shrugged .     there would be one hell of a fight with someone who wanted to take me off to a place i didn   t want to go to     she said     and i thought goblins had weapons .  pretty nasty fighters  so i   ve heard .  i   d have thought there   d have been a war .  we would have heard about it .  from the way you talk about it  it sounds as if they were sleepwalking .  or perhaps they were starving .  i haven   t noticed very many rabbits around here  compared with when i was a little girl .  and why leave some behind .  it   s all a bit of a puzzle  sam .  nearly everyone around here is a family friend       she held up a hand quickly .     i wouldn   t dream of asking you to fail in your duty  sam  you must understand that  but be careful and be sure of every step .  and please  sam     and i know you  sam     don   t go at it like a bull at a gate .  people round here might get the wrong idea .      sam vimes was certain that he did have the wrong idea and his brow wrinkled as he said     i don   t know  sybil  how does a bull go at a gate .  does it just stop and look puzzled .         no  dear  it smashes everything to pieces .      lady sybil gave a warning smile and brushed herself down .     i don   t think we need detain you any longer  after all  mister upshot     she said to the grateful feeney .     do remember me to your dear mother .  if she doesn   t mind  i   d like to meet her while i   m down here again to talk about old times .  in the meantime i suggest you leave via the kitchen  no matter what my husband thinks about a policeman using the servants    entrance  and tell cook to supply you with  well  anything your mother would like .      she turned to her husband .     why don   t you escort him down there  sam .  and since you   re enjoying the fresh air  why not go and find young sam .  i think he   s back in the barnyard  with willikins .      feeney was silent as they went down the long corridors  but vimes sensed the boy   s mind working its way through a problem  which came out when he said     lady sybil is a very nice kind lady  isn   t she  sir .         i do not need to be reminded of that     said vimes     and i   d like you to understand that she stands in vivid contrast to me .  i get edgy when i think there   s a crime unsolved .  a crime unsolved is against nature .         i keep thinking of the goblin girl  sir .  she looked like a statue  and the way she spoke  well  i don   t know what to say .  i mean  they can be a bloody nuisance     they   ll have the laces out of your boots if you don   t move quick enough     but when you see them in their cave you realize there   s  well  kids  old granddad goblins and           old mum goblins .     vimes suggested quietly .   once again  mrs upshot   s little boy struggled in the unfamiliar and terrifying grip of philosophy and fetched up with     well  sir  i dare say cows make good mothers  but at the end of the day a calf is veal on the hoof  yes .         maybe  but what would you say if the calf walked up to you and said     hello  my name is tears of the mushroom    .      feeney   s face once again frowned in the effort of novel cogitation .     i think i   d have the salad  sir .      vimes smiled .     you were in a difficult position  lad  and i   ll tell you something  so am i .  it   s called being a copper .  that   s why i like it when they run .  that makes it all so simple .  they run and i chase .  i don   t know if it   s metaphysical  or something like that .  but there was a corpse .  you saw it  so did i and so did miss beedle .  keep that in mind .      young sam was sitting on a hay bale in the farmyard  watching the horses come in .  he ran to his dad  looking very pleased with himself  and said     dad  you know chickens .      vimes picked up his son and said     yes  i have heard of them  sam .      young sam wriggled out of his father   s grasp as if being picked up and swung around was inappropriate activity for a serious researcher in scatological studies  and looked solemn .     do you know  dad  that when a chicken does a poo  there   s a white bit on top which is the wee .  sometimes it   s like the icing on a bun  dad .         thank you for letting me know     said vimes .     i   ll remember that next time i eat a bun .     and every time after that  he added to himself .     i suppose you know everything about poo now  sam .     he said hopefully  and he saw willikins smile .   young sam  still staring at a pile of chicken droppings through a little magnifying glass  shook his head without looking up .     oh no  dad  mister        here  young sam stopped and looked at willikins hopefully .   willikins cleared his throat and said     mister trout  one of the gamekeepers  was around half an hour ago  and of course your lad will strike up a conversation with anybody  and the upshot is that young sam  it would appear  sir  would like to amass a collection of the droppings of a number of woodland creatures .      gamekeepers  thought vimes .  he ran that across his brain and thought about who had actually rounded the goblins up three years ago .  and then he thought  how important is that compared with the question who told them to .  i think i   ve got the smell of this place  people do what they   re told because they   ve always done what they   re told .  but gamekeepers are a canny lot  it   s not just human beings they have to outsmart .  and remember  this is the countryside  where everybody knows everybody else  and notices everybody else .  i don   t think feeney is lying  so other people know what happened here one night three years ago .  i mustn   t be a bull at a gate  sybil said  and she   s right .  i need to know where i   m treading .  what happened happened three years ago .  i can afford to take my time over this one .  aloud he said     how far can i take this .         it seems you   ve had a busy day  sir     said willikins .     this morning you went down to the lock up with a little tit who thinks he is a copper  and then  in company with a goblin  you and said little tit went up to dead man   s copse  where you remained for quite some time  until you and the aforesaid little tit came out and you arrived here  minus one tit  just now .     willikins grinned at vimes .     there   s people coming and going down in the kitchens all the time  sir  and gossip is a kind of currency when you get beyond the green door .  you   ve got to remember  sir  that  despite mister silver   s dirty looks  i am the top nob below stairs and i can go where i like and do what i like and they can choke on it if they like .  the whole of the hill is visible from some window or other in this house  and maids are very cooperative  sir .  it seems that all the girls are busting for a job in the scoone avenue establishment .  very keen they are for the city lights  sir .  very cooperative .  also  i found quite a good telescope in the study .  remarkable view of hangman   s hill  you know .  i could practically read your lips .  young sam quite enjoyed the game of searching for dad .      vimes felt a pang of guilt at those words .  this was supposed to be a family holiday  wasn   t it .  but        someone killed a goblin girl up at dead man   s copse     he said  his voice dull .     they made sure there was a lot of blood to give our keen young copper something that he could think of as a case .  he   s floundering  i don   t think he   s ever seen a corpse before .      willikins looked genuinely taken aback .     what  never .  maybe i   ll retire down here  except i   d die of boredom .      a thought struck vimes and he said     when you were looking through the telescope  did you see anyone else go up the hill .      willikins shook his head .     no  sir  just you .      they both turned to watch young sam  who was carefully drawing chicken poo in his notebook  and willikins said quietly     you   ve got a good lad there  very bright .  make the most of the time  sir .      vimes shook his head .     gods know you   re right  but  well  she was cut about  and with steel  definitely steel .  they only have stone weapons .  they cut her about to make certain there was so much blood that even a stupid flatfoot would spot it .  and she was named after the colours of a flower .      there was a disapproving noise from willikins .     coppers shouldn   t get sentimental  it   s bad for the judgement .  you said it yourself .  you find yourself in some bloody awful domestic scene and you think things could be improved by kicking the shit out of somebody  only how do you know when to stop .  that   s what you said .  you said whacking a bloke in a fight is one thing  but when he   s been cuffed  it ain   t right .      to vimes   s surprise willikins tapped him on the shoulder in a kindly way  you   d know it instantly if willikins tapped you in an unfriendly way  .      take my advice  commander  and have tomorrow off  too .  there   s a boating house on the lake  and later you could take the little lad out in the woods  which are  by all accounts  knee deep in poo of all sorts .  he   ll be in poo heaven .  oh  and he also told me that he wants to go and see the smelly skull man again .  i   ll tell you what  i reckon with a mind like his  he   ll be archchancellor of unseen university by the time he   s sixty .      willikins must have seen the grimace on vimes   s face  because he went on     why so surprised sir .  he might want to be an alchemist  right .  don   t say you   d want him to be a copper  you wouldn   t  would you .  at least when you   re a wizard people don   t try to kick you in the fork  right .  of course you do have to go up against dreadful creatures from hellish dimensions  but they don   t carry knives  and you get training .  worth thinking about  commander     cos he   s growing like a weed and you should be putting him on the right track through life .  and now  if you   ll excuse me  commander  i   m off to annoy the servants .      willikins took a few steps then stopped  looked at vimes and said     look at it like this  sir .  if you take some time off  the guilty will be no less guilty  and the dead won   t get any less dead  and her ladyship will not try to behead you with a coat hanger .      the guests at lady sybil   s tea party were leaving when vimes got back to the hall .  he scraped the countryside off his boots and headed to the hall   s master bathroom .   of course  there were plenty of bathrooms around the place     probably more than there were in a street in most of the city  where a tin bath  a jug and basin  or nothing at all were the ablutions of choice or necessity     but this bathroom had been built to a design by mad jack ramkin and resembled the famous bathroom at unseen university  although  had mad jack designed that one  it would have been called the obscene university  since mad jack had a healthy  or possibly unhealthy  liking for the ladies  and in his bathroom it showed  oh dear  it showed .  of course  the white marble lovelies were dignified with urns  bunches of marble grapes  and the ever popular length of gauze which had  happily  landed in just the right place to stop art becoming pornography .  it was also  in all probability  the only bath that had taps marked hot  cold  brandy .   and then there were the frescoes  such that if you were a man easily persuaded then it was a good job there was a cold tap  because not to put too fine a point on it  as it were  there were a large number of fine points all over them  yes indeed  and the ladies were only the start of the problem .  there were marble gentlemen  as well  definitely gentlemen  even the ones with goats    feet .  it was surprising that the water in the bath didn   t boil of its own accord .  he had asked sybil about it  and she said that it was an important feature of the hall  and gentlemen collectors of antiquities would often visit in order to inspect it .  vimes had said that he expected that they did  oh yes indeed .  sybil had said that there was no need for that tone of voice  because she had occasionally taken a bath there from the time she had been twelve and had seen no harm in it .  it had  she said  stopped her from being surprised later on .   and now vimes lay in the luxurious tub  feeling as if he was trying to fit all the bits of his brain together .  he was only vaguely aware of the bathroom door opening  and of hearing sybil say     i   ve put young sam to bed  and he   s sleeping soundly  although i can   t imagine what he might be dreaming about .      then vimes floated again in the warm steamy atmosphere and was only just aware of the swish of cloth hitting the floor .  lady sybil slid in beside him .  the water rose  and so  in accordance with the physics of this business  did the spirits of sam vimes .   a few hours later  almost drowning in the pillows on the huge bed and floating just above unconsciousness in a warm pink glow  sam vimes was certain that he heard his own voice whispering to him .  and it said     think of the things that don   t fit .  wonder why the nice lady of the nobby classes wanders down into a goblin cave as if it   s a natural thing to do .     he replied     well  sybil spends half her time at home covered in heavy protective gear and a flameproof helmet because she likes dragons .  it   s the sort of thing that nobby ladies tend to do .      he considered what he had to say  and responded to himself     yes  but dragons are what you might call socially acceptable .  goblins  on the other hand  definitely aren   t .  no one has got a good word to say for goblins  except miss beedle .  why not take young sam along to see her tomorrow .  after all  she   s the one that got him on to this poo business  and she is a writer  so i expect she   ll be quite glad of the interruption .  yes  that   d be a good idea  and it   d be educational for young sam and not an investigation at all        thus satisfied  he waited for the onset of sleep  against a chorus of howls  shrieks  mysterious distant bangs  surreptitious rustlings  screeches  disconcerting ticking noises  dreadful scratching sounds  terrible flappings of wings very close  and all the rest of the unholy orchestra that is known as the peace of the countryside .   he had enjoyed a late night game of snooker with willikins  just to keep his hand in  and vimes  half listening now to the outlandish cacophony  wondered whether the solving of a complex crime  one that needed a certain amount of care  could be compared to a game of snooker .  sure  there were a lot of red balls and they got in the way  so you had to knock them down  but your target  your ultimate target  was going to be the black .   powerful people lived in the shires and so he would tread with care .  metaphorically  sam vimes  somewhere in his head  picked up his cue .   he lay back in the bed  enjoying the wonderful sensation of gradually being eaten by the pillows  and said to sybil     do the rust family have a place down here .      too late he reflected that this might be a bad move because she might well have told him all about it on one of those occasions when  so unusually for a married man  he was not paying much attention to what his wife was saying  and therefore he might be the cause of grumpiness in those precious  warm minutes before sleep .  all he could see of her right now was the very tip of her nose  as the pillows claimed her  but she mumbled  drowsily     oh  they bought hangnail manor ten years or so ago  after the marquis of fantailer murdered his wife with a pruning knife in the pineapple house .  don   t you remember .  you spent weeks searching the city for him .  in the end everybody seemed to think he   d gone off to fourecks and disguised himself by not calling himself the marquis of fantailer .         oh yes     said vimes     and i remember that a lot of his chums were quite indignant about the investigation .  they said that he   d only done one murder  and it was his wife   s fault for having the bad taste to die after just one little stab .      lady sybil turned over  which meant that     since she was a woman happily rich in gravitational attraction     as she turned  the pillow closest to sam  acting like a gear in a chain  spun softly in the opposite direction so that sam vimes found himself now lying on his face .  he struck out for the surface again and said     and rust bought it  did he .  it   s unusual for the old fart to spend a penny more than he needs to .         it wasn   t him  dear  it was gravid .      vimes woke a little more .     the son .  the criminal .         i believe  sam  that the word is entrepreneur  and i   d like to go to sleep now  if it   s all the same to you .      sam vimes knew that the best thing he could say was nothing  and he sank back into the depths  thinking words like fiddler  sharp dealer  inserter of a crafty crowbar between what is right and wrong  and mine and thine  wide boy  financier and untouchable      gently drifting into a nightmare world where the good guys and bad guys so often changed hats without warning  vimes wrestled sleeplessness to the ground and made certain that it got eight hours .       next morning vimes  hand in hand with his son  walked thoughtfully towards the house of miss beedle  not knowing what to expect .  he had little experience of the literary world  much preferring the literal one  and he had heard that writers spent all day in their dressing gowns drinking champagne .    on the other hand  as he approached the place up another little lane  some reconsideration began to take place .  for one thing  the    cottage    had a garden that would do credit to a farm .  when he looked over the fence he saw rows of vegetables and soft fruit  and there was an orchard and what was probably a pigsty and  over there  a proper outdoor privy  very professionally done  with the very nearly compulsory crescent moon shape fretsawed into the door  and the log pile close at hand so that the most efficient use could be made of every trip down the path .  the whole place had a sensible and serious air  and certainly wasn   t what you would expect of somebody who just mucked about with words every day .   miss beedle opened the door a fraction of a second after he had knocked .  she didn   t look surprised .      i was rather expecting you  your grace     she said     or is it mister policeman today .  from what i hear  it   s always mister policeman one way or the other .     then she looked down .     and this must be young sam .     she glanced up at his father and said     they tend to get rather tongue tied  don   t they .         you know  i   ve got lots of poo     said young sam proudly .     i keep it in jam jars and i   ve got a laboratory in the lavatory .  have you got any elephant poo .  it goes     and here he paused for effect        dung .      for a moment miss beedle had that slightly glazed sheen often seen on the face of someone meeting young sam for the first time .  she looked at vimes .     you must be very proud of him .      the proud father said     it   s very hard to keep up     i know that .      miss beedle led the way out of the hall and into a room in which chintz played a major part  and drew young sam over to a large bureau .  she opened a drawer and handed the boy what looked like a small book .     this is a bound proof of the joy of earwax  and i shall sign it for you if you like .      young sam took it like one receiving a holy object  and his father  temporarily becoming his mum  said     what do you say .     to which young sam responded with a beam and a thank you and a    please don   t scribble on it .  i   m not allowed to scribble in books .      while young sam was happily turning the pages of his new book  his father was introduced to an overstuffed chair .  miss beedle gave him a smile and hurried off towards the kitchen  leaving vimes with not much to look at except for a room full of bookcases  more overstuffed furniture  a full size concert harp  and a wall clock made to look like an owl  whose eyes swung backwards and forwards hypnotically in time with the tick     presumably to the point where you either committed suicide or picked up the poker in the hearth nearby and beat the damn thing until the springs broke .   while vimes was warmly contemplating this he realized that he was being watched  and he looked round into the worried face and prognathous jaw of the goblin called tears of the mushroom .   instinctively he looked at young sam  and suddenly the biggest raisin in his cake of apprehension was  what will young sam do .  how many books had he read .  they hadn   t told him nasty tales about goblins  had they  or read him too many of those innocent  colourful fairytale books which contain nightmares ready to leap out and some needless fear that will cause trouble one day .   and what young sam did was march across the floor  stop dead in front of the girl and say     i know a lot about poo .  it   s very interesting .      tears of the mushroom looked frantically for miss beedle while young sam  totally at ease  began a brief dissertation on sheep poo .  in response  with words slapping together like little bricks  she said     what     is     poo     for .      young sam frowned at this as if somebody was questioning his life   s work .  then he looked up brightly and said     without poo  you would go off bang .     and he stood there beaming  the meaning of life completely solved .   and tears of the mushroom laughed .  it was a rather staccato laugh  reminding vimes of the laughter of certain kinds of women  after certain kinds of too much gin .  but it was laughter     straight  genuine and unaffected     and young sam bathed in it  giggling  and so did sam vimes  with sweat beginning to cool on his neck .   then young sam said     i wish i had big hands like you .  what   s your name .      in that clipped way vimes was learning to recognize  the goblin girl said     i am the tears of the mushroom .      instantly young sam threw his arms around as much of her as he could encompass and shouted     mushrooms shouldn   t cry .      the look that the goblin girl gave vimes was one that he had seen many times before on the face of someone in receipt of young sam   s hugs  a mixture of surprise and what vimes had to call non plussedness .   at this point miss beedle came back into the room holding a plate which she passed to tears of the mushroom .     please be so good as to serve our guests  my dear .      tears of the mushroom picked up the plate and tentatively pushed it towards vimes  and said something that sounded like half a dozen coconuts rolling downstairs  but somehow managed to include the syllables you and eat and i make .  there seemed to be a pleading in her expression  as if trying to make him understand .   vimes stared at her face a while and then thought  well  i could understand  couldn   t i .  it has to be worth a try  and closed his eyes  an errand of some dubiousness when you were face to longer face with a jaw like that .  with eyes firmly shut  and one hand over them to cut out the last vestige of light  he said     will you say that again  young     lady .     and in the darkness of his skull he heard  quite clearly     i have baked biscuits today  mister po leess man .  i washed my hands     she added nervously .     they are clean and tasty .  this i have said and it is a thing exact .      baked by a goblin  thought vimes as he opened his eyes and took a knobbly but appetizing looking biscuit from the plate in front of him  then shut his eyes again and asked     why does the mushroom cry .      in the dark he heard the goblin girl gasp  and then say     it cries so that there are many more mushrooms .  this is a certain thing .      vimes heard the faint chink of crockery behind him  but as he took his hands away from his eyes miss beedle said     no  stay in darkness  commander .  so it   s true what the dwarfs say about you .         i wouldn   t know .  what do the dwarfs say about me  miss beedle .      vimes opened his eyes .  miss beedle sat down on a chair almost opposite  while tears of the mushroom waited for more biscuit activity with the air of someone who would probably wait for ever or until told not to .  she looked imploringly at vimes and then at young sam  who was studying tears of the mushroom with interest  although  knowing young sam  most of the interest had to do with the plate of biscuits .  so he said     okay  lad  you may ask the lady for a biscuit  but mind your manners .         they say that the dark is in you  commander  but you keep it in a cage .  a present from koom valley  they say .      vimes blinked in the light .     a dwarf superstition in a goblin cave .  you know a lot about dwarfs .         quite a lot     said miss beedle     but far more about goblins  and they believe in the summoning dark  just like the dwarfs  after all  they are both creatures of the caves and the summoning dark is real .  it   s not all in your head  commander  no matter what you hear  i sometimes hear it too .  oh dear  you of all people must recognize a substition when you   re possessed by it .  it   s the opposite of a superstition  it   s real even if you don   t believe in it .  my mother taught me that  she was a goblin .      vimes looked at the pleasant brown haired woman in front of him and said  politely     no .         all right  perhaps you   ll allow me a little theatricality and misdirection for effect .  truthfully  my mother was found as a child when she was three and raised by goblins in uberwald .  until she was about eleven     and i say about because she was never quite certain about the passage of time     she pretty much thought and acted like a goblin and picked up their language  which is insanely difficult to learn if you   re not brought up to it .  she ate with them  had her own plot in the mushroom farm and was very highly thought of among them for the way she looked after the rat farm .  she once told me that until she met my father  all her best recollections were of those years in the goblin cave .      miss beedle stirred her coffee and continued .     and she also told me her worst recollections  the ones that haunted her nightmares and  i might say  haunt mine now  of one day after some nearby humans had found out that there was a golden haired  pink cheeked human girl running around underground with evil  treacherous brutes who  as everybody knows  eat babies .  well  she screamed and fought as they tried to take her away  especially since people who she had thought of as family were being slaughtered around her .      there was a pause .  and vimes glanced somewhat fearfully at young sam  who  thankfully  had returned to the joy of earwax and was therefore oblivious of all else .      you haven   t touched your coffee  commander .  you   re just holding it in your hand and looking at me .      vimes took a deep draught of very hot coffee  which at the moment suited him just fine .  he said     this is true .  i   m sorry  i don   t know what to say .      tears of the mushroom was watching him carefully  ready should he feel a biscuit attack coming on .  they were in fact pretty good  and to hide his confusion he thanked her and took another one .      best not to say anything  then     said miss beedle .     all slaughtered  for no reason at all .  it happens .  everybody knows they   re a worthless people  don   t they .  i tell you  commander  it   s true that some of the most terrible things in the world are done by people who think  genuinely think  that they   re doing it for the best  especially if there is some god involved .  well  it took a lot of those things  and quite a lot of time  to convince a little girl that she wasn   t one of the nasty goblins any more and was really one of the human beings who were not nasty at all  because they were certain she would understand one day that all this terrible business with the bucket of cold water and the beatings every time she spoke in the goblin tongue  or started absent mindedly to sing a goblin song  was in her best interest .  fortunately  although she probably didn   t think so at the time  she was strong and clever and she learned  learned to be a good girl  learned to wear proper dresses and eat with a knife and fork and kneel down to pray her thanks for all that she was receiving  including the beatings .  and she learned not to be a goblin so successfully that they allowed her to work in the garden  where she vaulted over the wall .  they never broke her  and she said to me that there would always be some goblin in her .  i never met my father .  according to my mother he was a decent and hardworking man  and a considerate and understanding one too  i suspect .      miss beedle stood up and brushed at her dress  as if trying to remove the crumbs of history .  standing there  in the chintzy room with the harp in it  she said     i don   t know who those people were who killed the goblins and beat my mother  but if i ever found out i would slaughter them without a thought  because good people have no business being so bad .  goodness is about what you do .  not what you pray to .  and that   s how it went     she said .     my father was a jeweller  and he soon found out that my mother was absolutely gifted in that respect  probably because of her goblin background that led her to have a feel for stones .  i   m sure that made up for having a wife who would swear in goblin when she was annoyed     and let me tell you a good goblin swear can go on for at least a quarter of an hour .  she wasn   t one for the books  as you might expect  but my dad had been  and one day i thought  how hard can writing be .  after all  most of the words are going to be and  the and i and it  and so on  and there   s a huge number to choose from  so a lot of the work has already been done for you .  that was fifty seven books ago .  it seems to have worked .      miss beedle sat back down in her chair and leaned forward .     they have the most complex language you could possibly imagine  commander .  the meaning of every word is contingent on the words around it  the speaker  the listener  the time of year  the weather  oh  and so many other things .  they have something equivalent to what we think of as poetry  they use and control fire     and about three years ago nearly all of them in this countryside were rounded up and carted away  because they were a nuisance .  isn   t that why you   re here .      vimes took a deep breath .     actually  miss beedle  i came here to see my wife   s family estate and let my lad learn about the countryside .  in the process of which i   ve already been arrested on suspicion of killing a blacksmith and have seen the brutally slaughtered body of a goblin woman .  on top of this i have no knowledge of the whereabouts of said blacksmith and  miss beedle  would like somebody to enlighten me  preferably yourself .         yes  i saw the poor thing  and i   m sorry that i can   t tell you where jethro is .      vimes stared at her and thought  she   s probably telling the truth .     he   s not hiding in some part of the mine  is he .         no  i   ve looked .  i   ve looked everywhere .  no note  nothing .  and his parents have no idea either .  he   s a bit of a free spirit  but he   s not the sort of person to go away without telling me .     she looked down  clearly embarrassed .   the silence said a lot .  vimes broke it by saying     the murder of that poor girl on the hill will not go unpunished while i live .  i   m taking it personally  you might say .  i think someone was trying to set me up and mud sticks .     he paused .     tell me     these pots the goblins make .  do they carry them around all the time .         well  yes  of course  but only the ones they   re filling at the moment  obviously     said miss beedle  with a trace of annoyance .     is this relevant .         well  a policeman  you might say  thinks in goblin language  everything is contingent on everything else .  incidentally  how many other people know that you have a tunnel into the hill .         what makes you think i have a tunnel going into the hill .         let me see now .  this place is practically at the foot of the hill  and if i lived here i   d have dug out a decent wine cellar for myself .  that   s one reason  and the other is because i saw the flash in your eyes when i asked you the question .  would you like me to ask you the question again .      the woman opened her mouth to speak  and vimes raised a finger .     not finished yet .  what isn   t so simple as that is the fact that yesterday you arrived in the cave without anybody seeing you walk up the hill .  everyone tells me that there are eyes watching you everywhere in the country and  as luck would have it  i had a few working for me yesterday .  please don   t waste my time .  you   ve committed no crime that i know of     you understand being kind to goblins is not a crime .     he thought about that and added     although perhaps some people round here might think it is .  but i don   t and i   m not stupid  miss beedle .  i saw that goblin head in the pub .  it looked as if it   s been there for years .  now  i just want to go back up to the cave without anybody seeing me  if you don   t mind  because i have a few questions to ask .      miss beedle said     you want to interrogate the goblins .         no  that word suggests that i mean to bully them .  i simply have to obtain the information i need to know before i start to investigate the murder of the girl .  if you don   t want to help me  i   m afraid that will be your choice .      the next day sergeant colon did not turn up for work .  mrs colon sent a note around by a boy as soon as she got back from work herself .     there was nothing romantic about fred colon when she got home  and so after sweeping the floor  doing the washing up  wiping all the surfaces and spending some time teasing out the lumps of mud that had got caught on the doormat  she made haste to pseudopolis yard     after visiting her friend mildred who had a rather nice porcelain jug and basin set she wanted to sell .  when she eventually got to the watch house she explained that fred was terribly poorly  and sweating cobs and gabbling about rabbits .   sergeant littlebottom was sent to investigate  and returned looking solemn as she climbed the steps to vimes   s office  now occupied by captain carrot .  you could tell he was the occupant now not simply because he was sitting in the chair  which was a persuasive hint  but also because all the paperwork was done and aligned  a trait which always impressed inspector a .  e .  pessimal  a small man who had the heart of a lion and the physical strength of a kitten and the face  disposition and general demeanour that would make even hardened accountants say     just look at him .  doesn   t he look like a typical accountant to you .      but this didn   t worry the lion heart of a .  e .  pessimal .  he was the watch   s secret weapon .  there wasn   t a bookkeeper in the city who would like to see a visit from a .  e .  pessimal unless  of course  he was perfectly innocent     although generally that could be ruled out  because mr and mrs pessimal   s little boy could track an error all the way through the ledger and down into the cellar where the real books had been hidden .  and all inspector a .  e .  pessimal wanted for his genius was a meticulously calculated wage and a chance  every now and again  to go out on the streets with a real policeman  swinging his truncheon and glaring at trolls .   carrot leaned back .     so how   s fred getting on  cheery .         nothing much that i can see  really  um            that was a big um  cheery .      the trouble was that captain carrot had a friendly  honest and open face that made you want to tell him things .  it didn   t help that sergeant littlebottom held a small torch for the captain  even though he was well and truly spoken for     he was also a dwarf  well  technically  and you can   t help how you dream .     well        she began reluctantly .   carrot leaned forward .     yes  cheery .      she gave in .     well  sir  it   s unggue .  you come from copperhead     did you run into many goblins up there .         no  but i know that unggue is their religion  if you can call it that .      cheery littlebottom shook her head  trying to get out of her mind some speculation about the part a reasonably high stool might play in a relationship  and telling herself that sergeant hammer of gold  over in the dolly sisters watch house  caught her eye every time she was busily catching his eye when they happened to meet on patrol  and was probably a really good catch if she could pluck up the courage to ask him if he was actually male .    she said     unggue is not a religion  it   s a superstition .  the goblins don   t believe in tak    sir  they   re savages  scavengers  but        she hesitated again .     there   s something i was told once  and it   s unbelievable  but sometimes they eat their babies  sir  or at least  the mother will eat her child  her newborn child  if there   s famine .  can you believe that .      carrot   s mouth dropped open for a moment  and then a small voice said     yes  i think i can  sergeant  if you would excuse my saying so .      a .  e .  pessimal looked defiantly at their expressions and tried to stand a little straighter .     it   s a matter of logic  you see .  no food .  but the mother may survive by reconsuming the child  as it were  whereas  if all other food has been exhausted  then the child will die .  in fact the child is dead as soon as the conundrum is postulated .  the mother  on the other hand  might  by so doing  survive for long enough for more food to be found and become available  and in the course of time may bear another child .         you know  that is a very accountancy thing to say .     said cheery .   a .  e .  pessimal remained calm .     thank you  sergeant littlebottom  i shall take that as a compliment because the logic is impeccable .  it   s what is known as the dreadful logic of necessity .  i   m well versed in the logistics of survival situations .      the chair creaked as captain carrot leaned forward .     no offence meant  inspector pessimal  but may i enquire as to what kind of issues of survival arise during double entry bookkeeping .      a .  e .  pessimal sighed .     it can get pretty hazardous as the end of the fiscal year draws near  captain .  however  i take your point and would like you to understand that i believe i have read every single memoir  manual  log  and message in a bottle     by which i mean  of course  message taken from a bottle     that is currently available  and i can assure you that you would be amazed at the terrible decisions that sometimes have to be made by a group of people so that some  if not all  may live .  classically we have the shipwrecked sailors adrift in an open boat far on the ocean with succour extremely unlikely .  generally  the procedure is to eat one another   s legs  although sooner or later the supply of legs is going to run  if i may use the word  out  and then arises the question who will die so that some may live .  dreadful algebra  captain .     only then did a .  e .  pessimal blush .     i   m sorry .  i know that i am a small  weak man  but i have amassed a large library  i dream of dangerous places .         perhaps you should walk through the shades  inspector     said carrot     you wouldn   t have to dream .  do carry on  cheery .      cheery littlebottom shrugged .     but eating your own child  that   s got to be wrong  yes .         well  sergeant     said a .  e .  pessimal     i have read about such things and if you think of the outcomes  which are the death of both mother and child or the death of the child but the possible life of the mother  the conclusion must be that her decision is right .  in his book a banquet of worms colonel f .  j .  massingham does mention this about the goblins and apparently  according to the goblins    world view  a consumed child  which clearly did emerge from the mother  has been returned whence it came and will  hopefully  be reborn anew at some future date when circumstances are more favourable with  therefore  no actual harm done .  you may think that this view does not stand up to scrutiny  but when you   re faced with the dreadful algebra  the world becomes quite a different place .      there was silence while they all contemplated this .   carrot said     you know how it is in a street fight  cheery .  sometimes if things get hot and you know it   s you or them     that   s when you do the algebra .         fred doesn   t seem to know where he is     said cheery .     he wasn   t running a temperature and his bedroom isn   t particularly warm  but he acts as if he   s very hot and he won   t let go of that damn little pot .  he shouts if anyone tries even to get near it .  actually  he screamed at me .  and that   s another thing  his voice has changed  he sounds like a man who   s gargling rocks .  i had a word with ponder stibbons at the university  but they don   t appear to have anyone who knows anything much about goblins .      captain carrot raised his eyebrows .     are you sure .  i know for a fact that they have a professor of dust  miscellaneous particles and filaments  and you tell me that there   s no expert on an entire species of talking humanoids .         that   s about right  sir .  all we could turn up was stuff about what a bloody nuisance they are     you know the kind of thing .         nobody knows anything about goblins .  i mean  stuff worth knowing .      a .  e .  pessimal actually saluted .     harry king does  captain .  there   s quite a few of them downriver .  they don   t come into town much  though .  you may remember that lord vetinari was gracious enough to ask for me to be seconded to the revenue in order that i might go through mister king   s returns  given that all the other tax officers were frightened to set foot on his property .  i myself  sir  was not frightened     said a .  e .  pessimal proudly     because i am protected by my badge and the majesty of the law .  harry king might throw a taxman out of the building  but he   s clever enough not to try that with one of commander vimes   s men  no indeed .     you could have lit the city with the proud glow from a .  e .  pessimal   s face as he tried to puff out a chest that mostly went in .   it became a little more swollen when carrot said     very well done  inspector .  you   re a mean man with a smoking abacus indeed .  i think i shall pay a visit to our old friend harry first thing in the morning .      vimes did some thinking about the problem of taking young sam to a crime scene  but frankly  the lad was showing himself to be up to just about any encounter .  besides  any lad wants to go and see where his dad works .  he looked down at his son .     would you be scared of a long walk in the dark  lad .  with me and these ladies .      young sam looked solemn for a moment and then said     i think i   ll let mister whistle do the being scared and then it won   t bother me .      the door to the secret tunnel  if indeed it was secret  was in miss beedle   s cellar  which had quite a well appointed wine rack and a general  not unpleasant smell of  well  a cellar .  but once through the door there was a smell of distant goblins .   it was a long walk in the dark  especially when you were obliged to walk up quite a steep slope very nearly on hands and knees .   the smell of goblins grew stronger after a while  but during that while  you tended to get used to it .  here and there light shone into the gloom from holes to the outside world  which vimes thought was sensible engineering until he realized that rabbits used this tunnel too  and had left plenty of droppings as evidence .  he wondered whether he should pocket a few samples for young sam   s collection and suggested this to young sam  toiling manfully behind him  who said     no  dad  got rabbits .  want elephant if we find one .      rabbit poo  vimes noticed  was about the size of a chocolate raisin  a thought which instantly dragged him back to his youth  when if by some means  never entirely legal  he had acquired some cash  he would spend it on a ticket to the fleapit music hall and buy a packet of chocolate raisins with the change .  nobody knew  or cared to guess  what the things were that scuttled and scratched down below the seats  but you soon learned a very important rule  if you dropped your chocolate raisins  it was vitally important not to pick them up .   vimes stopped  causing miss beedle to walk into the sack of apples that she had asked him to carry  and got a grip on himself sufficiently to say     i   d like a moment or two to catch my breath  miss beedle .  sorry  not as young as i was and all that .  i   ll catch you up .  what are we carrying these bags for anyway .         fruit and vegetables  commander .         what .  to goblins .  i   d have thought they found their own food .      miss beedle inched her way around him and climbed on into the dark  saying  over her shoulder     yes  they do .      vimes sat with young sam for a moment until he felt better and said     how are you doing  lad .      in the dark a small voice said     i told mister whistle not to worry  dad  because he   s a bit silly .      so is your father  thought vimes  and is probably going to continue to be so .  but he was on the chase .  one way or another he was on the chase .  who you were chasing could wait .  the chasing was the thing .   anger helped vimes up the last leg of the climb .  anger at himself and whoever it was who had punctured his holiday .  but it was worrying  he had wanted something to happen and now it had .  somebody was dead .  sometimes you had to take a look at yourself and then look away .   he found miss beedle and tears of the mushroom waiting with a dozen or so other     ladies .  it was a calculated guess  given that he had yet to find any reliable way of telling one goblin from another     except  of course  that tears of the mushroom was wearing her apron with pockets in which he hadn   t seen before  and apparently neither had the other ladies  since tears of the mushroom was now the hit of the season as far as her sisters were concerned  given that they currently wore daring little outfits of old sacking  plaited grasses and rabbit skin .  they gathered around her chorusing  presumably  the goblin equivalent of    oh my dear  you look fabulous    .     miss beedle sidled up to vimes and said     i know what you   re thinking  but it   s a start .  carrying things  useful things  without having to use your hands     well  that   s a step in the right direction .     she pulled vimes a little way from the newly formed goblin branch of the women   s institute  who had by now attracted the attention of young sam  whose cheerful reluctance to be overawed by anything had clearly won over the girls  resulting in his being where he always felt he should be  the centre of attention .  it was a knack .   miss beedle went on     if you want to change a whole people  then you start with the girls .  it stands to reason  they learn faster  and they pass on what they learn to their children .  i suppose you   re wondering why we were trekking up here with all the sacks .      behind them  the apron was being tried on by one girl after another  this year   s must have item .  vimes turned back to the woman and said     well  this is just a guess  but i see a lot of rabbit bones around the place  and i have heard that you can die if you live only on rabbit  only i don   t know why this is .      miss beedle lit up .     well  commander vimes  you   ve certainly gone up in my estimation .  yes  rabbit has been the scourge of the goblin nation .  i understand it depletes the body of some vital nutrient if you don   t eat other things as well .  just about any green stuff will do  but the male goblins think a proper meal is a rabbit on a stick .     she sighed .     dwarfs know about this  and they   re absolutely fanatical about good food  as you should be if you spend much of your time underground  but nobody cared to tell the goblins  as if they would listen anyway  and so bad health and premature death is their lot .  some survive  of course  mostly those who prefer rat or eat the whole rabbit  not just the more apparently edible bits  or they simply eat their vegetables .      she began to unfasten a sack of cabbages and continued     i was well in with the wife of the head man here  because he got sick and i made certain he got a few good meals .  of course he swears it was because he did the magic  but his wife was remarkably sensible  and the other males don   t worry about what the girls get up to  so they slip fruit and veg into their stews  saying they   re magical  and so they have children who survive and thus we change the world one meal at a time .  that is if the goblins get a chance to live at all .     she looked sadly at the gossiping girls and said     what they really need is a first class theologian  because  you see  they agree with the rest of the world  they think they   re rubbish .  they think they did something very bad  a long time ago  and because of it they   ve lived as they do .  they think they have it coming to them  as you might say .      vimes frowned .  he couldn   t remember ever going into a church or temple or one of the numerous other places of more or less spirituality for any other reason than the occasional requirements of the job .  these days he tended to go in for reasons of sybil  i . e .   his wife dragging him along so that he could be seen  and  if possible  be seen remaining awake .   no  the world of next worlds  afterlives and purgatorial destinations simply did not fit into his head .  whether you wanted it or not  you were born  you did the best you could  and then  whether you really wanted to or not  you died .  they were the only certainties  and so the best thing for a copper to do was to get on with the job .  and it was about time that sam vimes got back to doing his .   young sam at this point had tired of petticoat company and had drifted over to an elderly goblin man who was working on a pot  and was watching with extreme fascination to the apparent pleasure  as far as vimes could tell  of the elderly goblin .  that   s a lesson to us     i don   t know what kind of lesson  but it   s a lesson  he thought .   vimes waited until miss beedle returned from discussing the possible new fashion explosion with the girls  then politely asked her     did the victim have any unggue pots on her .         i would be amazed if she hadn   t     said miss beedle .     one or two at the very least  but probably the quite small ones for use during the day .         i see     said vimes     but were any found on her  er  afterwards  i mean  if she was laid out .     he didn   t know what the protocol was and continued     look  miss beedle  is it possible that she had an unggue pot on her that   s now missing .  i know they   re valuable  of course     they   re shiny .         i don   t know  but i   ll go and ask the cold bone wakes .  he   s the head goblin .  he   ll know .      that reminded vimes .  feeling embarrassed  he delved into his pocket and took out a small package very  very carefully wrapped  and handed it to miss beedle with a pleading look .     i believe this belonged to the dead girl     he said .     a stone ring with a little blue bead in it .  can you see that it gets to someone here who   ll value it .     all she had was a stone ring  he thought  and even that got taken away .   there were times when the world did not need policemen  because what it really did need was for somebody who knew what they were doing to shut it all down and start it all up again so that this time it could be done properly      but before despair could entirely set in  miss beedle was back  and excited .     how apposite that you should ask that question  commander .  one of them was missing .  unggue cat .      vimes could register absolute flat faced incomprehension as well as any copper born .  it radiated a searchlight of ignorance  but that was fine because miss beedle was prepared to be a fountainhead of information .     i   m sure you know what everybody knows  commander  which is that goblins do  i might say religiously  store certain bodily secretions in pots  in the belief that these must be reunited with their corpse when they are buried .  this obligation is called unggue .  all goblins must  by custom  which is very strict among goblins  maintain the unggue had  the trinity of snot  nail clippings and earwax .  the missing pot in this case is the pot of cat  which contains nail clippings .  don   t get misled by the word    cat    .  felines don   t come into the picture     it   s simply that there are only so many syllables in the world .         and this is the first time you   ve heard that it   s missing  miss beedle .         well  this is my first time up here since yesterday  and it   s a difficult time to talk to her family  as you may imagine            i see     said vimes  though he didn   t  not very much     although he could sense a tiny bead of light growing in the darkness of his mind .  he glanced again at young sam  who was studying the pot maker with every sign of forensic interest .  that   s my boy .  he continued     did they look for the pot .         looked everywhere  commander  even outside .  and it   ll be quite small .  you see  every goblin makes a set of pots which are kept deep inside the cave .  i don   t know where they are  though in most other things they trust me .  this is because humans steal pots .  for this reason  most goblins make other comparatively small pots for daily use and for when they leave the cave  and decant them into the larger pots later  in secret .     she tried to smile  and said     i   m sure this seems quite outlandish to you  commander  but the making and maintaining of the pots is to them a religion in itself .      at this point samuel vimes was not keen to be heard giving his views about pots  so he contented himself with saying     is it possible that another goblin might have stolen the pot .  anyway  what size is    quite small    .      miss beedle gave him a surprised look .     if you trust me on anything  commander  trust me on this .  no goblin would dream of stealing another goblin   s pot .  the concept of doing so would be totally alien to them  i assure you .  the size .  oh  usually similar to a lady   s compact or perhaps a snuffbox .  they have a shine on them like opals .         yes     said vimes     i know     and he thought  bright colours in the dark .  he said     i don   t want to be difficult  but could i borrow another of the poor lady   s pots .  i might need one to show people what it is i   m looking for .      miss beedle looked surprised again .     that would be impossible  but i think that if i talk to tears of the mushroom she might  just might  loan you one of hers  in which case i may say you will be a very special person  commander .  a pot usually changes hands only because of distress  but tears of the mushroom spends a lot of time with me and has learned  shall i say  the uses of flexible thinking  and  if i may say so  she has taken a little bit of a shine to you .      she walked away  leaving the startled vimes and young sam to their own devices .  here and there  goblins were doing whatever they did  tending small fires  sleeping  or in many cases fussing with their pots .  and a few just sat there staring blankly at nothing at all  like a policeman wondering how you spell phantasmagorical .   and a new image dragged itself out of vimes   s memory .  it was of a lot of little blue men shouting     crivens .     ah yes  the nac mac feegle .  they lived in holes in the ground as well .  admittedly  these were said to be rather more salubrious than this midden ridden cave system  but however you looked at it  they were in the same situation as the goblins .  they lived on the edge too  but they     they danced on the edge  they jumped up and down on it  made faces at it  thumbed their snotty noses at it  refused to see the peril of their situation and  in general  seemed to have a huge appetite for life  adventure and alcohol .  as a copper  he shouldn   t say it  because they could be a bloody nuisance  but there was something commendable about the cheerfully feisty way they faced  well  everything      somebody tugged at his sleeve .  he looked down into the face of tears of the mushroom  with miss beedle standing over her like a chaperone .  the other goblin girls stood behind the pair of them like an ephebian chorus .   the solemn voice from the little face said     hearts must give  mister po leess man .      with dreadfully bad timing  miss beedle broke in like an overactive schoolteacher  and vimes was privately overjoyed to see a brief look of annoyance on tears of the mushroom   s face .      she means that if she is to trust you with a pot  then you must trust her with something equally valuable .  i suppose you would call it a hostage situation .      no  i wouldn   t  vimes thought  looking into the dark eyes of the goblin girl .  that was a strange thing  when he got past the features  which at best could be considered homely  depending on what kind of home you had in mind  the eyes were as human as you could imagine .  they had a depth that not even the brightest animal could achieve .  he reached for his wallet  and miss beedle said sharply     money won   t do .      he ignored her and finished pulling out the picture of young sam that he took everywhere and carefully passed it to tears of the mushroom  who accepted it as if holding a rare and delicate object     which  from the point of view of vimes  it certainly was .  she looked at it  then down at the boy himself  who gave her a cheery smile  and her eyes confirmed that the grimace on her face was in fact an answering smile .  for young sam  the goblin cave was an interesting fairyland .  you had to admire his ability not to be immediately frightened of anything .   tears of the mushroom looked back at the picture and then back at young sam and then at the face of vimes .  she tucked the picture carefully into her apron and pulled out a small  iridescent pot .  she held it out to vimes  her hand trembling slightly  and he found himself taking it gingerly in both hands .  then tears of the mushroom said in her strange voice  like a living filing cabinet     hearts have given .     which almost brought vimes to his knees .   he thought  it could just as well have been her head grinning on the pub wall .  someone is going to burn .   in the back of his mind a cheerful voice said     well done  commander vimes  at last you are singing from my hymn sheet .      he ignored it  feeling the little pot  it was as smooth as skin .  whatever it was made to contain  and he wasn   t going to ask  the contents were masked by a carved latticework of flowers and mushrooms .   in the cool depths of his cellar  jiminy the publican was preparing for the evening rush when he heard a sound in the darkness among the barrels .  he dismissed it as being yet another rat until a hand was clamped over his mouth .      excuse me  sir  i have reason to believe that you can help me with my inquiries .     the man struggled  but vimes knew every trick when it came to apprehending a suspect .  he hissed     you know who i am  sir  and i know what you are .  we   re both coppers and we   ve been around the houses .  you said that the barman sees everything  hears everything and says nothing  and i   m a fair man  mister jiminy  but i   m investigating a murder .  a murder  sir  the capital crime  and maybe something much  much worse .  so excuse me if i take the view that those who aren   t behind me are standing in my way  with all that that entails .      jiminy was running out of breath now  and squirming feebly .     oh  too much of the booze and too little walking the beat  i fancy     said vimes .     now  i would not ask a man to break the barman   s solemn oath  so when i take my hand away  we   ll sit down peacefully and play a little game of charades .  i   m letting go     now .      the barman wheezed a curse  and added     you didn   t need to do that  commander .  i   ve got a bad chest  you know .         not as bad as it might otherwise be  mister jiminy .  and now a word on the subject of being too clever .      the publican glared as vimes went on     i   m strictly a copper .  i don   t kill people unless they   re trying to kill me .  you may be aware of my batman  mister willikins .  you saw him the other day .  regrettably he   s more direct  and also extremely loyal .  a few years ago  to save my family  he killed an armed dwarf with a common ice knife .  and he has other talents  among them  i have to say  is that he can iron a shirt as crisply as any man i know .  and  as i say  very loyal indeed .  c   mon  jiminy .  i   m a copper and you   re a copper .  you   re still a copper whatever you say     the stain never leaves you .  you know what i can do and i know what you can do and you   re smart enough to choose the right side .         all right  you don   t need to rub it in     jiminy grumbled .     we both know about the ins and outs .     his voice was suddenly and almost theatrically helpful as he crooned     how may i help you  officer  just like the good citizen that i am .      vimes carefully pulled out of his coat the little pot .  it was indeed about the size of a snuffbox .  the incongruity was not lost on vimes  in one pocket he held the glorious gem  quite likely the repository of goblin snot  and in the other he had his own small snuffbox .  how hilarious would it be if he   d mixed them up .   jiminy certainly reacted when he saw it  although he probably thought he hadn   t .  there is a subtle difference between hiding your reaction and showing that you are hiding your reaction .      all right  all right  mister vimes  you   re right .  we don   t have to play games  old coppers like us .  i give in .  i know what that is .  seen one like it recently  as a matter of fact .         and .         i can give you a name  mister vimes .     cos why .     cos he   s a nut job  a toe rag  and he ain   t from around here .  name of stratford  or so they call him .  a knife cove  the kind of bloke you never want to see walk through your pub door  i don   t mind telling you .  he isn   t often here  thank goodness .  day before yesterday was the first time i   ve seen him in months .  i don   t know where he kips  but the snotty bugger he was hanging out with is called ted flutter  works for young lord rust up at hangnail .  his lordship is big in tobacco  so they tell me .     jiminy stopped .   vimes interpreted this in exactly the way jiminy wanted  he was sure .  lord rust was up to something  and by insinuating as much jiminy was throwing a bone to vimes to get the man off his back .  some people would have thought this despicable  but the man was an ex policeman  after all .   jiminy gave a little cough as he endeavoured to find another victim for vimes to pursue .     but flutter  well  you know  he   s just a bloke .  if someone needs help for something or other  he   s the kind of bloke who   d be the lookout or be told to take away the bones .  when not up to mischief i think he hangs wallpaper and runs a turkey farm up on the road towards overhang .  you can   t miss it  it   s a stinky ol    place and he doesn   t take care of his birds .  not entirely all there  in my opinion .      vimes seized his opening .     tobacco  eh .  oh yes  mister jiminy  i did think i smelled rather more tobacco down here than might otherwise be expected  and  of course  as a policeman  it   s something that i   ll have to look into  perhaps  when time allows .     he winked  and jiminy nodded knowingly .   with the atmosphere now tentatively upbeat  jiminy said     they brings a few barrels up here some nights and then picks it up again as and when .  all right  i know it   s the revenue and all that  but i don   t see the harm .  and since we understand one another so well  mister vimes  i   ve been here for only three years .  i know there was some stuff way back  maybe they did scrag a few goblins  i don   t know  not my business .  don   t know why  don   t know who  if you get my meaning .     jiminy was sweating cobs  vimes noticed .   there are times when reacting the way that simple  common decency requires fails to serve a higher purpose  and because of this vimes merely gave the man a little smile and said     one day  mister jiminy  i   ll bring a lady here .  i think she   d be very interested to see your establishment .      jiminy was puzzled but had the grace to say     i   ll look forward to it  commander .         what i   m trying to say     said vimes     is that if this pub still has the head of a goblin hanging over the bar the next time i   m here there   ll be a mysterious fire  do you understand .  no doubt you want to keep in with young lord rust and his chums  because it always pays to keep in with the powerful .  i know that well enough .  you   ll find me a good friend  mister jiminy  and i   d like to suggest to you that it would not be in your interest to have commander vimes as your enemy .  just a word to the wise  you know  one copper to another .      with forced cheerfulness jiminy said  in a voice that dripped butter and sugar     no one ever said that constable jiminy didn   t know how the wind was blowing  and since you   ve been so gracious as to visit my humble establishment i think i can take the view that the wind has begun to blow due vimes .      vimes lifted the cellar hatch to depart and said     oh  so do i  mister jiminy  so do i  and if ever the weathercock decides to blow the other way  i   ll bite its bloody head off .      jiminy smiled uncertainly and said     do you have jurisdiction here  commander .      and was dragged by the shirt to within an inch of vimes   s face  eyeball to eyeball  and vimes said     try me .      feeling rather chirpy after this interlude  vimes jogged to the lane that led to the hill and found miss beedle and tears of the mushroom at the door of the cottage .  by the look of it they had been picking apples  several baskets of fruit had been piled up .  he thought that tears of the mushroom smiled when she saw him  although how could you tell  really .  goblin faces were hard to read .   the pot was dutifully traded back for the picture  and vimes couldn   t help noticing  because he always made a point of noticing  that both he and the girl tried surreptitiously to examine their precious items without causing offence .  he was sure he heard miss beedle stifle a sigh of relief .     did you find the murderer .     she said  leaning forward anxiously .  she turned to the girl .     go inside  dear  while i talk to commander vimes  will you .         yes  miss beedle  i will go inside as you request .      there it was again  a language of little boxes  opening and shutting as required .  the girl disappeared into the house  and vimes said     i have information that two men were in the pub on the night of the murder  and one of them certainly had a pot .  neither of them  i   ve been led to believe  was a pillar of society .      miss beedle clapped her hands .     well  that   s good  isn   t it .  you have them bang to rights .      it always embarrassed samuel vimes when civilians tried to speak to him in what they thought was    policeman    .  if it came to that  he hated thinking of them as civilians .  what was a policeman  if not a civilian with a uniform and a badge .  but they tended to use the term these days as a way of describing people who were not policemen .  it was a dangerous habit  once policemen stopped being civilians the only other thing they could be was soldiers .  he sighed .     as far as i know  miss  it is not illegal to have a goblin pot .  neither is it  strictly speaking  illegal to be described as not a pillar of society .  do goblins sign their pots in some way .         oh yes  indeed  commander  goblin pots are always distinctive .  do these criminals have a modus operandi .      vimes   s heart sank .     no  and i don   t think they   d know one if they saw it .     he tried to say this firmly  because miss beedle looked as if she would at any moment turn out with a magnifying glass and a bloodhound .   then  falling across his world like a rainbow of sound  came music  drifting out of the open cottage window .  he listened with his mouth open  entirely forgetting the conversation .   his grace the duke of ankh  commander sir samuel vimes  was not a man who made a point of frequenting performances of classical music  or indeed any music that you couldn   t whistle on the way home .  but apparently being a nob carried with it a requirement to attend the opera  the ballet and as many musical events as sybil could drag him to .  fortunately  they generally had a box  and sybil  very wisely  having dragged him to the performance  did not subsequently drag him into consciousness .  but some of it seeped through and it was enough for him to know that what he was hearing was the real  highbrow stuff  you couldn   t hum it  and at no point did anybody shout    whoops .  have a banana .     it was the pure quill of music  a sound that came close to making you want to fall on your knees and promise to be a better person .  he turned wordlessly to miss beedle  who said     she   s very good  isn   t she .         that   s a harp  isn   t it .  a goblin playing a harp .      miss beedle seemed embarrassed by the fuss .     certainly  why shouldn   t she .  strangely enough  her large hands are suited to the instrument .  i don   t think she understands the concept of reading music yet  and i have to help her tune it  but she does play very well .  heaven knows where she   s getting the music from            heaven .     said vimes  adding urgently     how long will she be playing .  have i got time to bring sybil over here .     he didn   t wait for an answer but hurried off down the lane  clambered over a gate  caused a flock of sheep to explode in all directions  swore at a kissing gate  jumped over the ha ha  completely ignored the he he and totally avoided the ho ho .  he hurtled down the drive  scampered up the steps and  providentially  went through the front door at exactly the same time as a footman swung it open .   sybil was taking tea with a group of ladies  which appeared to be obligatory procedure in the afternoons  but vimes leaned against the wall and panted out     you must come and listen to this music .  bring young sam .  bring these ladies if they want to come  but whatever you do  come on .  i   ve never heard anything so good .      sybil looked around .     well  we were just breaking up  sam .  you know  you look very flushed .  is anything the matter .     she looked imploringly at her friends  who were already rising in their seats  and said     i do hope you   ll forgive me  ladies .  it   s so very difficult being the wife of an important man .     there was a slight barb to the last syllable .     i   m sure  sam  that whatever it is can wait until i   ve said goodbye to my guests  yes .      and so sam vimes shook hands  smiled  shook hands  smiled and fretted until the last twitterer had tweeted and the last lady had left .   having seen the final carriage away  lady sybil came back in  flopped into a chair in front of sam and listened to vimes   s garbled account .      and this is that young goblin girl miss beedle has been teaching to talk .      vimes was almost frantic .     yes .  and she plays wonderful music .  wonderful .         sam vimes  when i take you to a concert you fall asleep in ten minutes .  do you know what .  you   ve convinced me .  let   s go  shall we .         where .     said vimes  in husbandly confusion .   sybil affected surprise .     why  to hear the young lady play the harp  of course .  i thought that was what you wanted .  i   ll go and get my jacket while you find young sam  please .  he   s in the laboratory .      for vimes  bewilderment was now accumulating .     the            the laboratory  sam .  you know my family were famous meddlers  don   t you .  willikins is in there with him  and i believe they   re dissecting some  shall i say  excrement .  make certain they   ve both washed their hands     thoroughly     she added  on the way out of the room .     and tell them i was emphatic  and tell young sam what emphatic means .      the coach stood empty in the lane .  they hadn   t dared knock on the door  not while that heavenly music was drifting out of the cottage window .  sybil was in tears  but often she looked up  and said things like     that shouldn   t be possible on a harp .     even young sam was transfixed  standing there with his little mouth open  while the music rushed in and  for a moment upon the world  lifted all hearts and forgave all sins     not having its work cut out in the case of young sam  a part of vimes managed to reflect  but doing a sterling and heavyweight job on his father .  and when the music stopped young sam said     more .     and that went for his parents  too .  they stood there  not looking at one another  and then the cottage door opened and miss beedle stepped out .      i saw you out there  of course .  do come in  but quietly .  i   ve made lemonade .     she led them through the hall and turned into the living room .   tears of the mushroom must have been forewarned by miss beedle .  she sat on a chair next to the harp with her oversized hands clasped demurely over her apron .  wordlessly  young sam walked over to her and cuddled her leg .  the goblin girl looked panicky and vimes said     don   t worry  he just wants to show that he loves you .     and he thought  i   ve just told a goblin not to be frightened of my son because he loves her and the world has turned upside down and all sins are forgiven  except possibly mine .   as the coach rattled gently back towards ramkin hall lady sybil said quietly to vimes     i understand that the young lady goblin who was     murdered could play the harp as well as miss mushroom .      vimes stirred from his inner thoughts and said     i didn   t know that .         oh yes     said sybil  in a curiously chatty voice .     apparently miss beedle wants young goblin girls to have something to be proud of .     she cleared her throat  and  after a pause  said     do you have any suspects  sam .         oh yes  two .  i have the testimony of a reliable witness that they were in the area  and i   m beginning to consider a chain of events that might lead me also to the whereabouts of mister jefferson the smith .  this is the countryside  after all .  everyone sees where you go and you never know who is behind a hedge .  i believe they may have heard him invite me to dead man   s copse on what the times would call    that fateful night    .      sybil looked down at young sam  dozing between them  and said     do you know where they live .         yes  one of them at least .  i think the other one just hangs around  as they say .     and now the rattle of gravel under wheel told them that they were going down the long drive .   sybil cleared her throat again  and in a quiet voice said     i fear you may have felt that i was being rather acerbic to you  sam  on the subject of letting your professional concerns get in the way of our holiday .  i may  at times  have been somewhat     blunt .         not at all  sybil  i fully understood your concern .      it seemed that lady sybil really could have done with some cough drops  but she carried on carefully and said     sam  i   d be very grateful if you could see your way clear to perhaps taking willikins with you to wherever it is that these scoundrels poison the world with their existence  and bring them to justice  if you would be so good .      he could feel her trembling with rage and said     i was considering doing so as soon as possible  my dear  but i must tell you that things may not go entirely in accordance with the rulebook .  after all  i   m out of my jurisdiction here .      but his wife said     you   re a stickler for the book  sam  and i admire that  but the jurisdiction of a good man extends to the end of the world     though who will you take them to .  havelock would hang them  you know that .  but he   s a long way away .  nonetheless  sam  i am certain of one thing and it   s this  the worst thing you can do is nothing .  go to it  sam .         actually  sybil  i was considering delivering them to the local justices .         what .  they   re a terrible bunch  apparently using what they call the law here for their own ends .  there   ll be an enormous stink .      vimes smiled .     oh dear  do you really think so .      there was no point going to bed  thought vimes later that evening  and so he kissed his wife goodnight and went to the snooker room where willikins was idly practising one of the more socially acceptable skills he had learned during a misspent youth .  the man straightened up when vimes walked in and said     good evening  commander .  would you like a sustaining drink to be going on with .      vimes also indulged in a rare cigar because  well  what good is a snooker room without smoke twisting among the lights and turning the air a desolate blue  the colour of dead hopes and lost chances .   willikins  who knew the protocol  waited until vimes had made his shot before coughing gently .     oh  well done  sir  and i understand her ladyship is somewhat vexed about the goblin situation  sir .  i believe this to be the case  sir  because i met her in the corridor earlier and she used language i haven   t heard on the lips of a woman since my old mother passed away  gods bless her soul  if they can find it .  but  well done again  sir .      vimes laid his cue aside .     i want to get them all  willikins .  it   s no good slamming up some local thug .         yes indeed  commander  it   s all about potting the black .      vimes looked up from his fiery drink .     i can see you must have played a lot in your time  willikins .  did you ever see pelvic williams .  very religious man in his way  lived somewhere in hen and chickens court with his sister  played like i   ve never seen anyone else play before or since .  i swear he could make a ball jump the table  roll along the edge and drop back on to the cloth just where he wanted it  to drop neatly into the pocket .     vimes gave a grunt of satisfaction  and went on     of course  everyone used to say that was cheating  but he used to stand there  as meek as milk  just repeating    the ball dropped    .  tell you the truth  the reason he never got beaten up was that it was an education watching the man .  he once sank a ball by bouncing it off the lamp and a pint mug .  but  like he said  the ball dropped .     vimes relaxed and said     the trouble is  of course  that in real life rules are more stringent .         yes indeed  commander     said willikins .     where i used to play the only rule was that after you   d hit your opponent over the head with your cue you had to be able to run very fast .  i understand from her ladyship that you might be requiring my assistance tonight .         yes  please .  we   re going to the village of hangnails .  it   s about twenty miles upriver .      willikins nodded .     yes indeed  sir  once the seat of the hangnail family and most notably of lord justice hangnail  who famously declared that he never took account of any plea of not guilty on the basis that    criminals always lie    and was  by happy chance  the worshipful master of the benevolent company of rope makers and braiders .  with any luck  we   ll not see his like again .         excellent  willikins  and we   ll stop en route to pick up our keen young local constable  who   ll see fair play .  i intend to make sure of that .         glad to hear it  sir     said willikins     but bear this in mind  what does it matter once the ball has dropped .      it was mrs upshot who opened the cottage door  gave a little scream  slammed the door  opened the door to apologize for slamming the door  and then shut the door carefully  leaving vimes on the doorstep .  thirty seconds later feeney opened the door  with his nightshirt half tucked into his trousers .     commander vimes .  is something wrong .     he said  trying valiantly to tuck all the nightshirt inside .   vimes rubbed his hands together briskly .     yes  chief constable upshot  almost everything is  but there is one part that can be made right with your help .  regarding the murder of the goblin girl  i have sufficient information to warrant apprehending two men for questioning .  this is your manor  so professionally speaking i think it   s only right and proper that you assist me with the arrests .      vimes took a step into the room so that the face of willikins was visible  and went on     and i think you know willikins  my manservant  who has volunteered to drive my coach and  of course  provide me with a clean white shirt should i need it .         yerrr     growled willikins  turning to wink at vimes .      chief constable upshot  i   d be obliged if you would arm yourself with whatever you think you might need and  since you don   t have a pair of handcuffs worth a damn  oh i   m so sorry  then at least can you source some rope .      the face of feeney upshot was a whole palette of conflicting emotions .  i   ll be working with the famous commander vimes     hooray .  but this is big and serious     oh dear .  but it   ll be like being a real policeman     hooray .  but there   s already a hot water bottle in my bed     oh dear .  on the other hand  if it all goes wrong  well  after all  the duke of ankh owns most of this place  so he   ll have to take most of the blame     hooray .  and maybe if i distinguish myself i can get a job in the city  so that my mum can live in a place where you don   t lie awake at night listening to the mice fighting the cockroaches     hooray .     it was a treat for vimes to watch the lad   s face in the candlelight  especially as feeney moved his lips as he thought .  and so he said     i   m sure  chief constable upshot  that assistance in this matter will be very helpful to your future career .      this last comment caused mrs upshot  peering over her son   s shoulder  to flush with pride and say     hark at his grace  feeney .  you could make something of yourself  just like i   m always telling you .  no arguing now  off you go  my lad .      this motherly advice was punctuated by mrs upshot bobbing up and down so fast that she could have been harnessed to a sewing machine .  thank goodness for old mums  vimes thought  as feeney eventually got into the coach with a flask of hot tea  a spare pair of clean drawers and half an apple pie .   as the wheels started to turn  and after feeney had finished waving to his old mum out of the window  vimes  balancing carefully against the rocking  lit the little spirit lamp that was all the coach had for illumination .  he fell back into his seat again and said     i   d be grateful  lad  if you would take some time to write down in your notebook everything i   ve said to you since i arrived this evening .  it might be of assistance to both of us .     feeney practically saluted  and vimes continued     when we saw the dead goblin girl the other day  mister feeney  did you make a note of that in your notebook .         yes  sir .     feeney nearly saluted again .     my granddad told me always to write everything down in my notebook .      they bounced in their seats as the coach hit a stone and vimes said quietly     did he ever tell you to accidentally sometimes turn over two pages at once so that you had the occasional blank page .         oh  no  sir .  should i .      the seat bounced them up and down again as vimes said     strictly speaking  lad  the answer is no  especially if you never work with me .  now please write it all down  just as i asked .  and since i am not as young as you  i   m going to try to get some rest .         yessir  i understand that  sir .  just one thing  sir .  mister stoner  the clerk to the magistrates  came to see me this afternoon  and had a chat and said not to bother about the goblin girl because goblins are officially vermin .  he was very kind  and brought some brandy for my old mum  and he said that you were a fine gentleman but tended to get a bee in your bonnet  sir  what with being upper class and out of touch  sir .  sir .  sir .  have you gone to sleep  sir .      vimes turned his head and in honeyed tones said     did you make a note of that in your notebook  lad .         oh  yessir .         and you still got in this coach with me .  why did you do that  mister feeney .      stones rattled behind them and it seemed some time before feeney upshot had assembled his thoughts to his satisfaction .  he said     well  commander vimes  i thought  well  that mister stoner he   s a nob more or less  and so is commander vimes  only he   s a duke and is therefore a very big nob and if you   re going to get caught between nobs  maybe you   d better pick the biggest one to be on the side of .     he heard vimes grunt  and continued     and then  sir  i thought  well  i was up there  i saw that poor creature and what had been done to her  and i remembered that stoner had tried to make a fool out of me by making me arrest your good self  sir  and i thought about the goblins and i thought  well  they   re mucky and smelly and the old goblin was crying  and animals don   t cry and goblins  well  they make stuff  beautiful stuff and as for pinching our pigswill and being generally mucky  we surely ain   t short of humans around here who are pretty big in that respect  i could tell you some stories  and so i thought some more and i thought  well  that mister stoner  i thought he must have got it wrong .      there was a rumbling as the coach went over a bridge and then the sound of wheels on packed flints was back .  feeney said anxiously     is that all right  sir .     he waited nervously .  and then the voice of vimes  and this time sounding rather far away  said     do you know what that little speech you made was called  mister feeney .         don   t know  sir  it   s just what i think .         it was called redemption  mister feeney .  hold on to it .      vimes woke from a doze in which he had dreamed about young sam playing a harp  and by the time he had understood that this was a dream the noise of the coach wheels had changed as they slowed down and stopped .   willikins slid open the small slot that allowed discourse between passenger and coachman and said quietly     rise and shine  sir  we   re about a quarter of a mile from hangnails  population thirty seven and still stupid .  and you can smell turkey from here and wish you bloody well couldn   t  excuse my klatchian .  i surmised that it might be a good idea to walk quietly the rest of the way  sir .      vimes got down from the coach and stamped the cramp out of his limbs .  the air stank with the curiously invasive smell of birds  not even goblins persecuted the sinuses one half so badly .  but this was a tiny distraction compared with the thrill  yes  the thrill .  how long was it since he had led a dawn raid .  far too long  that   s how long  and now captains and senior sergeants got the job while he stayed in the office  being the ankh morpork city watch .  well  not today .   whispering as they walked through the knee high mist  he said     you  chief constable upshot  you will hammer on the front door when i give you the signal  and i will be stationed outside the back door in case the gentleman does a runner  okay .      they were nearing the property now  yes  they would just need the two of them .  the farmhouse looked barely big enough to have two doors  let alone three .      what shall i say  commander .     hissed feeney .      oh  blimey  you   re the bloody son and grandson of coppers  my lad  what the hell do you think you should shout .  let me give you a clue .  it does not include the word    please    .  i   ll give you a whistle when i   m in position  got it .  good .      they walked with care across the stinking yard and vimes took up station around the back  where an interesting thought occurred to him and he made a mental note .  he then leaned against the dirty wall of the house a little bit away from the back door  took a pinch of snuff to clear the air of turkey and gave one faint whistle .      open up in the name of the law .  you are surrounded .  you have one minute to open the door .  i mean it .  open the door .  this is the police .      leaning cosily against the wall  vimes grudgingly rated that as pretty good for a beginner  with one point taken off for adding    i mean it     then  as a man flew out of the back door  he stuck out his boot .      good morning  sir .  my name is commander vimes .  i hope you   re in a position to remember yours .      in the sheds the turkeys were going insane  causing a slight rise in the smell .  the man struggled to his feet  looking around desperately .      oh  yes  you could run  yes  you could do that     said vimes in a conversational tone of voice     but it might be thought by others that this might indicate that you knew you had some reason to run .  now  personally  i would agree that anyone stopped by a copper should run like buggery  innocent or not  on first principles .  besides  we get so fat these days that we need the exercise .  but do run if you want to  mister flutter  because i can run too  and very fast .      by now flutter was smiling the smile of a man who thinks that this copper is not very smart .      i bet you don   t have a magistrate   s warrant  do ya .         well now  mister flutter  why might you think that  eh .  perhaps you think the magistrates might not issue a warrant to arrest you  yes .  by the way  thank you for showing me where the tobacco barrels are stored .  your cooperation will be taken into consideration .      some days are bad days  like when you stare right down into the mangled corpse of a young woman  and then you get good days  when the suspect   s darting eyes flashing across the yard show you exactly where the loot is hidden .      i shall  of course  mention your cooperation to the authorities and  of course  in the local pub as well  ah  yes .      and now mr flutter was visualizing the result of being seen as some kind of grass  so stupidly he went for     i never told you anything about any tobacco  and you know it  copper .      at this point feeney stepped around the corner with his fearsome club raised and a look of almost comical aggression on his face .     you want me to give him the old one two  commander  just say the word  guv .      vimes rolled his eyes in mock despair .     no need for that  feeney  no need for that  just when mister flutter here is so anxious to talk to us  understand .      flutter decided that the way forward was an appeal to feeney .     look  feeney  you know me        he got that far and no further because feeney said     it   s constable upshot to you  flutter .  my dad had you up before the beaks two dozen times .  he used to call you the blue bottle on account of whenever there was a load of shit going down he   d find you flapping about in it .  and he told me to watch you  which is what i am doing right now  in fact .      he glanced at vimes  who gave him an encouraging nod and then said     you see my problem  mister flutter  we   re not here to talk about contraband tobacco  okay .  now  i never saw myself as a revenuer  not a popular profession .  i   m a copper pure and simple  right  and in my hand i have this man what is only doing a favour to his employer by storing a few barrels of tobacco in his shed  but on the other hand  well  if i found a murderer in the other hand  why  gods bless you  i might totally forget all about the first hand     don   t ask me to draw you a picture  flutter  because my hands are full .      flutter looked aghast .     this is about that goblin  right .  look  it wasn   t me .  okay  i   m a bit of a naughty boy  i put my hand up to that  but i ain   t like him .  i   m a scallywag  not a damn murderer .      vimes looked at feeney .  some people could be said to be as pleased as punch .  feeney could be said to look as pleased as punch  judy  the dog toby  the crocodile and  above all  the policeman  all rolled in together .  vimes raised his eyebrows in new interrogation  and feeney said     i believe him  chief .  he hasn   t got it in him  i swear .  the best he could manage would be knocking over an old lady for her purse  and even then she   d probably have to be blind too .         there  you see .     said flutter triumphantly .     i   m not really a bad person .         no     said vimes     you   re a veritable choirboy  mister flutter  i can see that  and i   m rather religious too  and i like chapter and verse  but are you willing to swear that the individual known as stratford knifed a goblin girl to death on hangman   s hill in the grounds of ramkin hall  three nights ago .      flutter raised a finger .     can i say that i told him to leave off  and he laughed  and i didn   t know it was a girl neither     i mean  how can you tell .      vimes   s face was deadpan .     tell me  ted  what would you have done if you had known .  i   m intrigued .      flutter looked down at his feet .     well  i  well  well  i mean     not a girl  i mean     well  not a girl     i mean  that   s not right  know what i mean .      and you can find someone like this dangerous clown in nearly every neighbourhood  vimes thought .     clearly chivalry is not dead  mister flutter .  okay  feeney  let   s carry on .  mister flutter  why were you on hangman   s hill on the aforesaid night .         we were just having a walk     said flutter .   vimes   s face was again deadpan  so deadpan as to be mortified .     of course you were  mister flutter .  silly of me to ask the question  really .  constable upshot  i can see willikins over there having a smoke .     he pushed at the open door and dragged flutter inside .     does this building have a cellar .      flutter was one step away from a toilet break  but nevertheless  being the kind of fool to dig himself in deeper  managed to sneer     there might be .  so what .         mister flutter  i have already told you that i   m a religious man  and since you would test the patience of a saint i need to spend a moment in quiet contemplation  understand .  i   m sure you know that there   s always an easy way  and then again  there   s always the hard way .  currently  this is the easy way  but the hard way is also quite easy  in a manner of speaking .  before talking to you again i want to be alone with my thoughts .  and it occurs to me  mister flutter  that you might have some thoughts about  as it were  legging it  and so my colleague  chief constable upshot  will guard the door and i shall send in my batman  mister willikins  to keep you company .      before vimes was even able to tap on the window  the door opened and willikins  immaculate as ever  stepped into the grubby room  all smart and crisp with shiny shoes and a hint of pomade on his hair .  the three men then watched vimes heave at a likely ring on the floor  which pulled back to reveal the trap door to a dark cellar and a ladder going down .   vimes said     constable upshot  i need a little time to think in the darkness .  i won   t be long .     he went down the ladder and pulled the trap door closed behind him .   the darkness said     ah  commander  at long last .  i suspect that you   re here to take a witness statement .      this is wrong  vimes told himself .  how can you take testimony from a demon  especially when it   s one of no fixed abode .  but on the other hand  who needs a witness statement if you   ve got a confession .   up above  ted flutter   s eyes rolled this way and that as he analysed the situation .  let   s see  we have one young twit who is playing at being a copper  and a snooty butler type  all pink and shiny .  i reckon mrs flutter   s little boy is out of here .  at this point  at this very point  willikins  without looking at flutter  reached into his jacket and there was a slap as he laid down a steel comb on the table in front of him .  it gleamed .  and it gleamed even stronger in flutter   s imagination .  he took one look at willikins    expression  and mrs flutter   s little boy decided he would sit very still until that nice commander vimes came back .  out of another pocket willikins produced the sharpest looking knife flutter had ever seen and  without paying any attention whatsoever to flutter  began to clean his fingernails .   in fact it was only a matter of seconds before the trap door was heaved back  and vimes emerged  then nodded to willikins  who secured the comb and walked out of the room without a word .  vimes regained the chair .     mister flutter  i have a witness statement that puts you on hangman   s hill on the night in question with another man  said man being known as stratford .  the witness tells me that you said to him that you could have got hold of some turkey blood  but he said that there were rabbits all over the place and he never missed with his slingshot .  at this point the witness says a young goblin girl came out of the bushes and your companion struck at her as she was begging for her life     and furiously  to the extent that you yourself told him  in your words  to leave off  upon which he turned on you  still holding his knife  described to me as a machete  so swiftly that you urinated into your boots .      no  don   t speak  i haven   t finished .  nevertheless  i am informed that you did say to your companion that you were supposed to leave just blood  and not  as you put it     guts all over the place     whereupon he forced you to put them back into the cadaver and hide it further down the hill in some gorse bushes .  no  i said don   t talk .  in your pocket you had a pork pie  which you   d brought from home  and three dollars in cash  which was your payment for this little errand .      after that you and stratford walked back some distance to your horses  which you had temporarily stabled in the tumbledown old barn on the other side of the village .  the horses were a chestnut mare and a grey gelding  both of them broken down by ill use .  in fact  the gelding threw a shoe as you were leaving  and you had to stop your companion from killing it there and then .  oh  and the witness told me that you were naked to the waist when you left  since your shirt was soaked with blood and you left it in the barn after an argument with stratford .  i   ll recover it when we get back .  your friend told you to take your trousers off as well  but you declined  however  i noted splashes of blood on them earlier .  i don   t want to go to the expense of sending a rider back to the city  where my igor will ascertain whether the blood is human  goblin or turkey .  i said don   t speak  didn   t i .  i haven   t mentioned some of the other conversation between you and mister stratford  because feeney here is listening  and you should be relieved about that  gossip can be so cruel .      and now mister flutter  i   m going to stop talking and upon doing so i would like the first words you utter to be     pay attention        i want to turn king   s evidence    .  yes  i know we don   t have kings any more  but nobody has amended the law .  you are a little shit  but i   m reluctantly persuaded that you were dragged into something beyond your control and worse than you could have imagined .  the good news is that lord vetinari will almost certainly take my advice and you will live .  remember     i want to turn king   s evidence     that   s what i want to hear  mister flutter  otherwise i   ll go for a walk and mister willikins will comb his hair .      flutter  who had listened to most of this with his eyes shut  blurted out the words so fast that vimes had to ask him to repeat them more slowly .  when he had finished he was allowed to go to the privy  with willikins waiting outside  cleaning his nails with his knife  and feeney was sent to feed the frantic turkeys .   for his part  vimes entered one of the stinking sheds and prodded around in the dirty straw for what he knew would be there .  he was not disappointed .  sufficiently close to  the smell of tobacco was just discernible above the stifling stink of turkey .  he rolled a barrel out  found feeney and said     i think this is full of tobacco and so i   m intending to take it as evidence .  your job right now is to scout out a jemmy for me and somebody known to you as a decent upstanding citizen  insofar as there might be one around this place .         well  there   s dave who runs the dog and badger     feeney volunteered .      and he is an upstanding citizen .     said vimes .      i have seen him sitting down     said feeney     but he knows the score  if you get my meaning .      vimes nodded and waited a few minutes before feeney returned with a crowbar  a bandy legged man and a small tail of people who  for the moment  until proved otherwise  had to be counted as    innocent bystanders    .   they gathered around as vimes prepared to open the barrel .  he announced     pay attention  gentlemen .  i believe this barrel contains contraband goods .     he rolled up his sleeves        you see that i have nothing up my sleeves  but a crowbar in my hand        and with some effort on his part the lid of the barrel came off  and the smell of tobacco was overpowering .  and some of the bystanders decided it was now time to take the wonderful opportunity for a quick nonchalant walk .   vimes pulled out bale after bale of brown leaves bound with cotton .     can   t take too much on the coach     he said     but if mister dave here will  as an upstanding member of the community  sign to say that he saw me pull these from a sealed barrel  then you  mister feeney  will take a brief statement and we can all go about our business .      feeney beamed .     oh  very well spotted  commander .  i reckon you could hide anything in this stink  eh .     after a moment he looked at vimes and said     commander .      vimes appeared to look through him and said     you   re going to go far  chief constable upshot .  let   s empty the whole barrel  shall we .      he didn   t know where the thought had come from .  maybe from first principles .  if you were going to smuggle  where would you stop .  what would your market be .  how would you get the best price per pound of product carried .  he pulled and pulled at the bundles  and one  almost at the bottom of the barrel  was noticeably heavier than the others .  trying to keep his expression unchanged  he handed the heavy bundle to feeney and said     i   d be grateful if you and mister dave would open this bundle and tell me what you see inside .      he sat down on the barrel and took a pinch of snuff while behind him he heard the rustling  and then feeney said     well  commander  what this appears to be        vimes held up a hand .     does it look like stone dust to you  feeney .         yes  but        vimes held up his hand again .     does it appear to have little red and blue flecks in it when you hold it to the light .      sometimes the ancestral copper in feeney picked up the vibration .     yes  commander vimes .         then it   s a good job for you and your friend dave        vimes glanced at the said dave for the second time and decided to give him the benefit of the doubt        that the two of you are not trolls  because if you were you   d be stone dead  as it were  right now .  the stuff you are holding is crystal slam  i   d bet my badge on it .  troll kids use it as a drug  do you know that .  they take a hit as small as your little pinky and think they can walk through walls  which they invariably do  too  and when they   ve done it a few times more they drop down dead .  it   s illegal everywhere in the world  and very difficult to make because the smell when they   re boiling it up is unmistakable  you get a lot of sparks too .  selling it is a hanging offence in ankh morpork  uberwald and every troll city .  diamond king of trolls gives a very handsome bounty to anyone who presents him with evidence of manufacture .      vimes looked hopefully at the aforesaid dave  just in case the man would take the bait .  no  he thought  they wouldn   t do it round here .  all this tobacco must come from somewhere hot  and that means a long way away .   gingerly  they broke open other barrels and found plenty of tobacco and several packs of very high class cigars  one or two of which vimes put in his breast pocket for detailed forensic examination later  and  somewhere at the bottom of every barrel  there were neat packets of crystal slam  slunkie  slab  slice and slap  all of them very nasty     although slap was generally considered to be a recreational drug  at least if your idea of recreation was waking up in the gutter not knowing whose head you had on .   as many samples as possible were piled into the coach and vimes only stopped when it started to creak .  the other barrels were piled up and  at vimes   s instigation  a very proud chief constable upshot set fire to them .  when the controlled drugs caught alight there was a brief display of pyrotechnics and vimes thought to himself that this was only the start of the fireworks .   as people came running out to see what was happening  vimes reassured them of his bona fides and explained that mister flutter would be away for a while  and could somebody please look after the birds .  the responses he got made it clear that the neighbourhood considered a world without mister flutter and his stinking turkeys would be a much better world  so the last thing that vimes did was to open the sheds and let the wretched creatures take their chances .   as a last little bright idea  vimes beckoned to the nervous dave and said     diamond king of trolls will be very appreciative of this day   s work .  of course  as serving officers we wouldn   t be able to take any remuneration            we wouldn   t .     said feeney hopelessly .   vimes ignored this and continued     i will  however  see to it that your help today is suitably rewarded .     the publican   s face lit up .  something about the words diamond and rewarded in the same sentence does that to a face .   they travelled with the creaking coach doors locked  but with a window slightly open because mister flutter was currently not somebody you would wish to be in any confined space with  he appeared to be sweating turkeys .   king   s evidence .  that was a result .  flutter hadn   t thought about arguing  and vimes had seen his expression as the summoning dark   s statement was presented to him .  vimes had noticed every wince and shiver of recollection that  taken together  added up to rights well banged .  king   s evidence .  any man would opt for that to save his skin  or maybe for a better class of cell .  you took king   s evidence to save your miserable hide and it might indeed do so  but at a price  and that price was death by hanging if you lied .  it was one of the absolutes  lying when you had turned king   s evidence was the lie of lies .  you had lied to the judge  you had lied to the king  you had lied to society  you had lied to the world  and thus the cheerful mr trooper would welcome you to the gallows  and shake your hand to show you there were no hard feelings  and shortly afterwards would pull the lever that would drop you from the world you had betrayed  and stop     halfway down .   and then  of course  there were the troll drugs .  the evidence of their existence worried flutter so much that he invented new gods to swear to that he knew nothing about them .  vimes believed him .  as far as flutter was concerned  the barrels contained nothing more than tobacco .  good old tobacco  nothing harmful about tobacco  and smuggling it was  well  it really was like a game  everybody knew that .  nothing wrong with outsmarting the revenue  that was what the revenue was for .  vimes thought  isn   t that how i   ve always said it worked .  little crimes breeding big crimes .  you smile at little crimes and then big crimes blow your head off .   flutter was sitting miserably on the opposite seat  possibly fearing being kicked to death by trolls  but then  as vimes had noted  flutter probably feared everybody .  and so vimes found it in his heart to offer him not so much a crumb as a bacon sandwich of good news .     you were in the company of a violent man  ted .  you thought you were just going to make life difficult for a copper  and suddenly you were an accessory of the first part to murder and  even if unwittingly  tangled up in extremely serious troll narcotics  the worst there is .  but you   ve got into bad company  ted  and i will say so in court .      hope appeared in flutter   s red rimmed eyes  and he said     that   s very kind of you  sir .     that was it .  no swagger  no whining  just gratitude for mercies received and fervently hoped for .   vimes leaned forward and offered the bewildered man his snuffbox .  flutter took a large pinch and sniffed it up so hard that the inevitable sneeze tried to escape via his ears .  ignoring this  and the faint haze of brown in the air  vimes leaned back and said cheerfully     i   ll have a word with the screws in the tanty  they always owe me anyway        he looked at the hopeful face and thought  blast it .  i know they   re pretty crowded right now .  a squirt like him would be on a hiding to nothing  whatever i do .  oh well .  he carried on     no  mister flutter  tell you what i   ll do  at least we   ll put you in a cell in pseudopolis yard .  how about that .  it can be lonely in a cell all by yourself  but some might consider that a blessing  especially after fifteen minutes in some parts of the tanty  and  besides  my lads are fairly chatty when there   s not much happening .  we also have a better class of rat  the straw is fresh and we don   t gob in your stirabout  and if you   re helpful and don   t keep people awake at night  then you   ll be as right as rain .         you won   t have any trouble from me  commander .     the words came tumbling  frantic to be heard and terrified that they might not .      glad to hear it  ted     said vimes jovially .     i like a man who makes the right choices .  incidentally  ted  who suggested you play the little trick on the hill .         honestly  sir  it was stratford  sir .  he said it would be a little joke .  and i know what you   re going to ask me next  sir  and i asked him who was behind all this  because it worried me a bit  seeing as i mostly just breed turkeys and roll barrels around  you understand .     flutter assumed the expression of a simple  honest working man .     he said that if he told me he   d have to kill me  and i said to him  i said     thank you all the same  mister stratford  but i won   t put you to the trouble     and kept my mouth shut     cos he had a funny look in his eye .     flutter seemed to think for a moment and added     he always has a funny look in his eye .      vimes tried to pretend that this was of little interest .  like a man with a butterfly net  a killing jar and a passion to pin to a cork board the last of the very rare lancre blue butterflies  which has just taken its repose on a thistle nearby  he tried to do nothing to make his quarry take flight .   in an offhand way he said     but you do know  don   t you  ted .  i mean  you   re smart  ted  underneath it all .  a lot of people would say that two planks are smarter than you  but frankly you can   t make a success of things in this old world without keeping your eyes open and your ears too  right .      but of course  who would tell anything important to a twerp like flutter .  he wasn   t even a henchman     you needed a certain amount of tactical thinking before you could properly hench     but henchmen hang about  and when they   re with someone as thick as flutter they don   t always guard their tongues .   aloud he said     it   s a shame really  ted  you being the only one to get banged up for all this  seeing that all you really did was help out a mate for a couple of dollars and a pint  don   t you think .  terrible  ain   t it  that decent folk have to take the rap  yes .  especially when it   s a big rap .     he stopped talking and watched flutter   s face .      weeeell     said flutter     one day when he was a bit excited he did say to me that lord rust depended on him  took him into his confidence and everything and made sure his pockets always jingled  but i reckoned that was nothing but boasting .      vimes was impressed at his own patience and said     look  ted  did you ever hear either of them talk about the goblin girl .      a horrible grin suffused the man   s face .     i could if you want me to  commander .      vimes stared at flutter for a moment and said     ted  i want to know things that you have either seen or heard .  not things you may have imagined and     and this is the important bit  ted     not things made up to please me  right .  otherwise i won   t any longer be your friend        vimes stopped to think for a moment .     did you ever hear lord rust or stratford say anything about the blacksmith .      it was an education watching the prisoner rack his brains .  he looked like a big dog chewing a toffee .  apparently he found something because his next words were     the blacksmith .  i didn   t know that it was about the blacksmith .  yeah  when we were stacking in the yard young lord rust came up to stratford and said something like     any news about our friend .     and  well  stratford said     don   t you worry  sir  he   s going to see the queen     and they both laughed  sir .     in the silence he said     are you all right  sir .      vimes ignored this and said     have you any idea what he meant .         nosir     said flutter .      is there anything called the queen around here .  maybe a public house  perhaps .  maybe a riverboat .     vimes thought  yes  they all have strange names  there has to be a queen among them .   once again the dog chewed the toffee .     sorry  commander  i don   t really know anything about that .  no boat on the river called the queen .      vimes left it at that .  it was a result .  not the best result .  nothing that would satisfy vetinari  but a hint at least of a minor conspiracy to send jethro to somewhere he did not want to be .  vimes at least had to be satisfied .   vimes realized that flutter was holding up his hand cautiously  like a child half fearful of a reprimand from the teacher .      yes  ted .     he said wearily .   the man lowered his hand .     will i be able to find a god  sir .         what .  find what god .      flutter looked embarrassed but recovered manfully .     well  sir  i   m hearing about people who go into prison and find a god  sir  and if you find a god then you get better treatment and maybe you get let out sooner  on account of praying  and i was wondering if i was in the watch house whether there might be more or less chance of god avail ability  if you get my drift .  i don   t want to be a trouble  of course .         well  ted  if there was any justice in the universe i think there would be quite a few gods in the tanty  but if i were you and faced a choice between the possibility of heavenly intervention and a definite three meals a day that haven   t been spat on and no big blokes snoring in your ear all night and the certain knowledge that if you have to go down on your knees it will only be to pray  then i would say heaven can wait .      the sun was already well up now and willikins was keeping them moving at a good pace .  vimes took notice of that fact .  the street was talking to him even if it was in fact nothing more than a wide lane .  he nudged feeney awake .     soon be home now  lad  and i think mister flutter can be housed in your lovely lock up  don   t you .      flutter looked puzzled  and vimes said     good grief  man .  surely you didn   t think i could rush you all the way to ankh morpork in one go .  as it is i   ll have to send someone to get someone else to come all the way down here with the hurry up wagon .  don   t worry  the lock up is strong and cosy and made of stone  plus     and i   m led to believe that this is indeed a big plus  this     mrs upshot will probably make you a delicious bang suck muck muck dog  with carrots and garden peas .  speciality de maisonette .      rank has its privileges  vimes thought  when he alighted near the old lock up a little later .     chief constable upshot  please settle our prisoner down  see that he gets fed and watered and so on and so forth  okay  and  obviously  do the paperwork .         the what  sir .      vimes blinked .     is it possible  mister feeney  that you don   t know what paperwork is .      feeney was perplexed .     well  yes  sir  of course  but generally i just jot down the name in my notebook  sir .  i mean  i know who he is  and i know where he is and what he   s done .  oh  yes  and since the trouble we had with old mister parsley  after he had a skinful  i also make certain to check if the prisoner is allergic to anything in bhangbhangduc cuisine .  it took me all day to clean out the place  on account of there   d been a tiny bit of winky .     seeing vimes   s expression  he went on     very popular herb  sir .         habeas corpus  lad .  you want to be the copper here  right .  then mister flutter is your prisoner .  you are responsible for him .  if he gets ill  then he is your problem  if he dies then he is your corpse  and if he gets out and away then you would find yourself in a situation so problematical that the word    problem    just would not fit the situation .  i   m trying to be helpful  honestly  but i could just as easily take him up to the hall .  we   ve got loads of cellars and we could easily bed him down in one of them  no problem .  but then if i have to do that  what good are you .      feeney looked shocked .  he pulled himself upright .     i wouldn   t hear of that  sir  and neither would my ancestors  sir .  after all  we   ve never had anyone who has even been near a murder .         very well  then  give me a receipt for the prisoner  which is a very important thing  and i   ll go back to the hall to have a nap .      vimes stepped back as a riverboat came into view and a very small tidal wave of muddy water splashed gently on the little quayside .  the boat was another one with paddle wheels  sybil had explained all about them .  an ox patiently trod its way around a treadmill in the bilges and wonderful gearing caused the paddle wheels to turn .   the pilot of this one waved at him .  as it went past he saw a woman in the stern  hanging out clothing  watched by a cat .  a good life  at the speed of an ox  he thought  where probably no one is ever going to try to kill you .  and  just for a moment  he felt jealous  while a line of barges followed the boat past a flotilla of ducklings .  vimes sighed  got back in the coach  was driven to the hall by willikins and  after a very brief shower  sank into the pillows and descended into darkness .   people said that these days ankh morpork was moving .  others said that while this might be true  so was a sufficiently aged cheese .  and  like the hypothetical cheese  it was bursting out of its mould  in this case the outermost walls  which were  in the words of lord vetinari     a corset that should be unlaced    .  one of the first to let themselves spread had been harry king  now  of course  known as sir harold king .  he was a scallywag  a chancer  a ruthless fighter and a dangerous driver of bargains over the speed limit .  since all this was a bit of a mouthful  he was referred to as a successful business man  since that more or less amounted to the same thing .  and he had the knack of turning rubbish into money .  as captains carrot and angua walked along the towpath towards the reedy swamps downriver  harry king   s flame burned ahead of them .  all was grist to the mills of the king of muck .  his armies of workers swept the streets  emptied the cesspits  cleaned the chimneys  scoured the middens of the slaughterhouse district and carried away from those selfsame houses all those bits of previously living matter that could not  for the love of decency  be put in a sausage .  they said that harry king would suck the smoke out of the air if he thought he could get a good price for it .  and if you wanted a job  harry king would give you one  at a wage not very much less than you might get elsewhere in the city  and if you stole from harry king you would get what you deserved .  the mills of harry king stank  of course  but now the city itself did not  at least not as badly as it used to  and some people were complaining about the loss of the famous ankh morpork smell  rumoured to be so strong that it kept away illnesses and ailments of all sorts and  moreover  put hairs on your chest and did you good .   ankh morpork being what it was  there was already a smell preservation society .   the two watchmen began to breathe less deeply as they approached the smoke and fumes .  a small city surrounded the workings  a shanty town knocked together with harry   s blessing by the workers themselves because  after all  that meant they wouldn   t be late for work .   the security officer at the gate opened it instantly as they approached .  harry was probably not honest  but if there was dishonesty it happened at times and places that did not concern the watch  and faded from the memory of all concerned just as soon as the ripples of the splash had died away and the tide had gone out .   also going out as carrot and angua climbed the outside steps to the large office where harry presided over his kingdom was a man  moving horizontally at speed  with harry king   s big hands grasping him by his collar and the seat of his pants and finally throwing him down the steps  accompanied by a shout of    you   re fired .     the watchmen stood aside as the man rolled down from step to step .     and if i see you again  the dogs is always hungry .  oh  hello  captain carrot     said harry  his voice suddenly all matey     and the charming miss angua too .  my word  what a lovely surprise  do come in  always a pleasure to be of assistance to the watch .         sir harry  you really shouldn   t throw people down the steps like that     said carrot .   harry king looked innocent and spread his huge hands widely  and said     what .  are those bloody steps still there .  i gave orders to have them taken away .  thank you for the advice  captain  but the way i see it is that i caught him trying to steal my money and so if he   s still alive then on the whole i reckon we   re square .  coffee .  tea .  something stronger .  no  i thought not  but take a seat  no harm in that  at least .      they sat down and carrot said     we need to talk about goblins .      harry king looked blank  but said     got a few of them working for me  if that   s any help .  decent workers  you might be surprised to know .  a bit weird in their ways  not the fastest  but once they   ve got the hang of what you want them to do you can just leave them to it until you tell them to stop .  i pay them half what i pay humans and i reckon they do twice as much work  and do it better .  be happy to hire another hundred if they turned up .         but you pay them far less than humans .     said angua .   harry gave her a pitying look .     and who else would pay them anything at all  love .  well  business is business .  it   s not like i chain them down .  okay  not many people would want to employ goblins on account of the stink  but i know by the wrinkling of your pretty nose  captain  that i stink too .  it goes with the job .  besides  i let them stay on my land and they make those weird little pots in their spare time  and i see to it they don   t have much of that  and when they have enough money for whatever they want  they bugger off back to where they came from .  young slick and his granny are the only ones that   s ever stayed .  gonna make a name for himself  that one .         we   d like to talk to some of the goblins about the pots you mentioned  if that   s okay by you  harry .     said carrot .   harry king smiled and waggled a finger at him .     now  i   ll take that from you two  because we   ve all seen a bit of the world and know what   s what  but outside this office it   s sir harry  okay .  personally  i ain   t all that bothered  but her ladyship is a stickler  oh my word  yes .  nose so high in the air it brings down sparrows  i   m telling you .  still  i can   t say it does any harm .     harry king  or possibly sir harold king  thought for a moment .     out of interest  why do you want to talk about goblin pots .      angua hesitated  but carrot said     we are both very interested in goblin folklore  sir harry .      harry king chuckled .     you know  i never could read your face  captain carrot .  i   d hate to play poker with you .  okay  it   s not my business  i   ll take you at your word .  just you go down the steps and make your way to the sorting belts and find billy slick  and tell him that harry king would deem it a favour if he would be so good as to take you to see his old granny  okay .  no need to thank me  i suspect old vimes put in a good word about me to vetinari when the medals was being given out  if you know what i mean .  they say one hand washes the other  but i bet that when it came to old harry king it had to scrub .      they found billy slick stacking old copies of the ankh morpork times on to a truck .  you could always recognize a goblin  although this one  in his grubby overall  looked like any other working man in the place .  the only difference was that he was a goblin working man .   carrot tapped him gently on the shoulder and billy looked round .     oh  coppers .         we   ve come from harry king  billy     said carrot  adding quickly     you   ve done nothing wrong .  we just want to learn about unggue pots .         you want to learn about unggue .     billy stared at carrot .     i know i ain   t done nothing wrong  guv  and i don   t need you to do the telling of me and i wouldn   t touch any of those bloody pots to save my life .  i   m working my way up  i am .  can   t be bothered with fairy stories .      angua stepped forward and said     mister slick  this is quite important .  we need to find someone who can tell us about unggue pots .  do you know anyone who can help .      billy looked her up and down superciliously .     you   re a werewolf  ain   t ya .  can smell you a mile off .  and what would you do if i said i didn   t know anybody .         then     said carrot     we would regrettably have to go about our business .      billy looked sideways at him .     would that be the business of giving me a good kicking .      the morning sun shone on carrot   s enthusiastically polished breastplate .     no  mister slick  it would not .      billy looked him up and down .     well  there   s my granny .  maybe she   ll talk to you  maybe she won   t .  i   m only telling you that much because of mister king .  she   s right careful about who she talks to  you may bet your helmet on that .  what do you want to talk about pots for  anyway .  she hardly gets out of bed these days .  can   t see her doing a robbery .         nor do we  billy  we just want some information about the pots .         well  you   ve come to the right lady  she   s an expert  so i reckon  always fussing about the bloody things .  got a bottle of brandy on you .  she   s not one for strangers  my granny  but i reckon that anyone with a bottle of brandy is no stranger to granny as long as the drink holds out .      angua whispered to carrot     harry   s got a huge drinks cabinet in his office  and it   s not like this is bribery .  worth a try .      she waited with billy slick while carrot went on the errand  and for something to say  she said     billy slick doesn   t sound much like a goblin name .      billy made a face .     too right .  granny calls me of the wind regretfully blown .  what kind of name is that  i ask you .  who   s going to take you seriously with a name like that .  this is modern times  right .     he looked at her defiantly  and she thought  and so one at a time we all become human     human werewolves  human dwarfs  human trolls     the melting pot melts in one direction only  and so we make progress .  aloud  she said     aren   t you proud of your goblin name .      he looked at her with his mouth open  showing his pointy teeth .     what .  proud .  why the fruckle should anyone be proud of being a goblin .  except my granny  of course .  come along inside  and i surely hope that the brandy arrives quickly .  she can be fretful without the brandy .      billy slick and his granny lived in a building of sorts in the shanty town .  willow and other saplings had been liberated from the damp swamps and used to make a reasonably large hemisphere  the size of a small cottage .  it seemed to angua that some skill and thought had gone into the construction  smaller twigs and branches had been interwoven with the structure and some had  as is the way with willow  rooted themselves and sprouted  and then somebody  presumably billy slick  had further interwoven the new growth so that  in the summertime at least  it was a pretty good gaff  especially since somebody had meticulously filled most of the gaps with smaller weaves .  inside  it was a smoky cave  but the dark accustomed eye of the werewolf saw that the inner walls had been lined very carefully with old tarpaulin and any other rubbish that could be persuaded to bend  to keep away draughts .  okay  it had probably taken less than two days to build and cost nothing  but the city was full of people who would have been overjoyed to live there .      sorry about this     said billy .     i can   t say that harry is a big payer  but he turns a blind eye to us snaffling the occasional bits and pieces if we don   t get cheeky about it .         but you   ve even got a stove pipe .     said angua  astonished .   billy looked down .     leaks a bit  waiting for me to solder a few patches on  that   s all .  wait here  i   ll just make sure she   s ready for you .  i know she   ll be ready for the brandy .      there was a polite knock on the door which turned out to be courtesy of captain carrot who was on his way back with the brandy .  he carefully opened the battered and many times painted outside door and let in some light .  then he looked around and said     very cosy .      angua tapped her foot .     look  he   s even jigsawed broken bits of roof tile together to make a decent floor cover .  there   s some thoughtful construction going on here .     she lowered her voice and whispered     and he   s a goblin .  it   s not what i   d expected           got bloody good hearing as well  miss     said billy  re entering the room .     amazing  innit  what tricks us goblins can learn .  cor  you   d almost think we were people .     he pointed towards a hanging of some sort of felt that obscured the other end of the room .     got the brandy wine .  off we go  then .  hold the bottle out in front of you  that usually does the trick .  officers  the lady ain   t my granny as such  she   s my great granny  but that was too much of a mouthful for me when i was a little kid  so granny she became .  let me do the talking     cos unless you are a bloody genius  you won   t understand a blind word she says .  come on in  quickly  i   ve got to go and make her lunch in half an hour  and  like i said  you   ve probably got until the drink runs out .         i can   t see a thing     said carrot  as the felt sombrely swung back behind them  and angua said  carefully     i can .  would you be so good as to introduce us to your great grandmother  billy .      carrot still fought for any kind of vision but heard what he thought was the goblin boy speaking  although it sounded as if he was chewing gravel at the same time .  then  after a sense of movement in the darkness  another voice  cracking like ice  answered him .  then billy quite clearly said     regret of the falling leaf welcomes you  watchmen  and bids you give her the bloody brandy right now .      carrot held the bottle out in the direction of billy   s voice  and it was swiftly passed on to the shape beginning to form in front of him as sight trickled back .  the shape apparently said  according to billy     why you come to me  po leess man .  why you need help from dying lady .  what is unggue to you  mister po leess man .  unggue is ours  ours .  no good for you here  big mister po leess man .         what is unggue  madam .     said carrot .      no religion  no ringing bellsey  no knees all bendey  no chorus  no hallelujah  no by your leave  just unggue  pure unggue .  just unggue  who come when need .  little unggue .  when gods wash hands and turn away there is unggue who roll up the sleeves .  unggue strikes in the dark .  if unggue don   t come himself  he send .  unggue is everywhere .      carrot cleared his throat .     regret of the falling leaf  we have a man  a policeman  a good man  who is dying of unggue .  we don   t understand  please help us understand .  in his hand he is holding an unggue pot .      the screech must have echoed around the works  it certainly made the little shack rock .     unggue thief .  pot stealer .  not fit to live .     billy translated with every sign of embarrassment .  the old goblin woman tried to stand up and sank back into her cushions  muttering .   angua tried     you are wrong  old lady .  this pot came to him by chance .  he found it  it is the pot called soul of tears .      regret of the falling leaf had filled the world with noise .  now she appeared to empty it with silence .  she said  bitterly and  come to that  curiously  considering the fact that her great grandson had said she didn   t know much ankh morporkian     found in goblin cave  oh yes .  found on end of shovel  oh yes .  bad cess to him .         no .     suddenly carrot was face to face with the goblin woman .     it came to him by accident  like a curse .  he never wanted it and he didn   t know what it was .  he found it in a cigar .      there was a pause in which  presumably  the old woman was doing some complex thinking  because she said     would you pay me my price  mister po leess man .         we gave you the brandy     said angua .      indeedy  wolf whelp  but that was for consultation only .  now it   s price for diagnosis and cure  which will be from the snuff mill  two pounds of sweet raspberry  one pound of angler   s chum  and one pound of dr varies    medicated upright mixture  just the job on a winter   s day .     something like a laugh escaped from the old goblin woman   s mouth .     glad of the fresh air     she added .     my lad he gets around and about and says you are trustworthy  but goblins have learned not to rely on word  so we will seal the bargain the old way  which we have all understood since time was time .      the bewildered billy stood back as a long hand with longer fingernails extended towards carrot  who spat on his own hand and slapped it  with no thought of health and safety  on to the palm of regret of the fallen leaf  who cackled again .     that can   t be broke  that  it can   t be broke .  never .     after a moment   s hesitation she said in an offhand voice     wash hand after using .      there was a glug from the brandy bottle  and billy slick   s old granny went on     a pot of tears  you say .     angua nodded .     if so  only one meaning .  a poor goblin woman  a starving woman  had to eat her newborn baby  because she could not feed it .  i hear you stop breathing for a moment .  that such things happen .  is awful truth  oh yes .  is often awful truth in bad country when times are hard and food is nothing .  and so  weeping  she carved a little unggue pot for soul of her baby and cried life into it and sent it away until better times when baby will come back .      quietly  carrot said     could you tell us anything more  madam .      the old goblin was silent for a moment and then said     inside cigar  wrapped in tobacco .  ask the man who sell tobacco .      billy turned his granny   s brandy bottle upside down and not a drop came out .      one last thing  please  madam  how can we help our friend .  by the sound of it he   s dreaming that he   s a goblin .      little black eyes shone as the goblin said     i trusting you for tobacco .  now trusting you for another bottle of brandy .  find goblin cave .  find goblin maiden .  only such a one will be able to grasp the pot  in hope one day of having child .  so it goes  no other way .  and big problem for you  mister po leess man  is that goblin girl these days are hard to find .  none here .  maybe none anywhere .  we shrivel and shrink like old leaves .  goodbye until more brandy .  no .  make that cognac from quirm .  special reserve .  sixty dollars if bought from horrids on broadway or two for one deal at twister boote   s bottle shop in the shades .  slight taste of anchovy  but no questions asked and none answered .      the old voice went silent  and gently the watchmen came back to the stuff of reality around them  troubling images fading into recent memory .   carrot managed to say     i   m so sorry to have to ask  but will this harm my sergeant .  he seems to be having continuous nightmares and we can   t get the pot out of his hand .         three bottle of brandy  mister po leess man .     translated billy .   carrot nodded .     okay .         how long pot had him .      carrot looked at angua .     about two days  madam .         then get your man to a goblin cave as quick as you can  mister po leess man .  he may live .  he may die .  either way  three bottle of brandy  mister po leess man .     small black eyes twinkled at carrot .     so nice to meet a real gentleman .  hurry up  mister po leess man .      the old lady slumped back into her mound of pillows and rugs .  the audience was over  just like the brandy .      granny likes you     said billy  his voice full of awe  as he ushered them out .     i can tell .  she never threw anything at you .  better get her the snuff and the brandy pretty soon  however  otherwise she might get a bit stroppy in an occult sort of way  if you hear what i   m saying  or rather  of course  what i ain   t saying .  nice to meet you folks  but old man king doesn   t like to see people not working .         excuse me  billy     said carrot  grabbing him by his skinny arm .     are there any goblin caves anywhere around here .         you got what you wanted  officer .  there ain   t none  as far as i know .  i don   t care .  you could try up country  that   s my advice  but i really don   t care .  if you find a goblin cave on a map you can bet your teeth there won   t be any goblins there any more  not live ones  at least .         thank you very much for your assistance  mister slick  and may i congratulate you on having a grandmother with such good grasp of contemporary vocabulary .     said carrot .   there was a delighted shriek from the direction of the dome  the walls of which were very thin .      damn right .  granny slick ain   t so thick .         well  perhaps we have a result     said carrot as they headed back into the city     but  well  i know ankh morpork is a melting pot of a city  but don   t you think it   s rather sad when people come here and forget their ancestry .         yes     said angua  not looking at him .     it is .      when they were back in pseudopolis yard  carrot summoned cheery .     i   d like you to go and see the tobacconist who gave sergeant colon that cigar .  ask him where his tobacco comes from .  we know there   s lots of smuggling going on anyway  so he   ll be worried .  it might be a nice idea to take along an officer whose mere presence will worry him a little more .  wee mad arthur is back from leave .      cheery grinned .     in that case  i   ll take him .  he worries everybody .      mr bewilderforce gumption was having a good day so far .  he had been to the bank to deposit the takings and had bought two tickets to the opera .  mrs gumption would be very pleased about that and certainly more pleased than she was to be called a gumption .  she was always urging him into high society or  at least  higher society  but in some ways the name gumption always held you back .  and now he held open the door to his emporium and saw the policeman sitting patiently in the chair .   cheery littlebottom stood up .     mister bewilderforce gumption .      he tried to smile .     i generally see fred colon  officer .         yes .  and it   s sergeant littlebottom .  but strangely enough it   s about sergeant colon that i   m visiting you today .  do you remember giving him a cigar .      mr gumption was suffering from the illusion that many people have that policemen don   t see people lying all the time  so he said     not as i recall     to which cheery replied     mister gumption  it is a well known fact that sergeant colon buys or otherwise procures his tobacco requirements from your noble establishment .      once again bewilderforce led off on the wrong note .     i want to see my lawyer .         i   d like to see your lawyer as well  mister gumption .  perhaps you   d send someone to collect him while i and my colleague wait here .      bewilderforce looked around bewildered .     what colleague .         oh  aye  that   ll be me well enough     said the constable known  sometimes briefly  as wee mad arthur  who had been lurking behind a packet of cigarettes .   two police officers are far more than doubly worse than one  and cheery littlebottom took advantage of the sudden panic to say  carefully     it   s a very simple question  mister gumption .  where did that cigar come from .      cheery was aware that commander vimes didn   t like the phrase    the innocent have nothing to fear     believing the innocent had everything to fear  mostly from the guilty but in the longer term even more from those who say things like    the innocent have nothing to fear     but bewilderforce was fearful     she could see him sweating .      we know you   re a smuggler  mister gumption  or perhaps i should say that you take advantage of very good deals when they are  ahem  presented to you .  right now  however  all i need from you is to tell me where that cigar came from .  once you   ve been so kind as to tell me that  we   ll walk out of this building in a happy and cooperative frame of mind .      bewilderforce brightened up .  cheery continued     of course  other departments of the watch might wish to visit you in due course .  at the moment  sir  you just have to deal with me .  do you know where that batch of cigars came from .      valiantly bewilderforce tried it on .     i buy from dealers all the time     he said .     it   d take me ages to go through the records .      cheery kept smiling .     no problem there  mister gumption  i   ll call for my expert colleague mister a .  e .  pessimal right now .  i don   t know if you know of him .  it   s amazing how quickly he can work through paperwork and i   m sure he   ll find time in his busy schedule to help you out at no cost whatsoever .      five minutes later a grey faced and breathless bewilderforce handed cheery a small scrap of paper .   cheery looked up at him .     howondaland .  i thought that tobacco mostly came from klatch .      bewilderforce shrugged .     well  they   ve been starting up plantations in howondaland now .  good stuff  too .     feeling a little bit bolder  bewilderforce went on .     all properly paid for  i can tell you .  yes  i know there   s smuggling going on  but we don   t have any truck with that .  no need to when you can get a pretty good deal by buying in bulk .  it   s all in my ledgers .  every invoice .  every payment .  all set down properly .      cheery relented .  a .  e .  pessimal could probably find something to excite him somewhere in the gumption ledgers .  after all  business was business .  but there was business and there was bad business .  it didn   t do to get complicated .  she stood up .     thank you very much for your assistance  mister gumption .  we   ll trouble you no further .      bewilderforce hesitated and said     what   s up with fred colon .  he   s a bit of a scrounger  i don   t mind saying  but i would hate anything to have happened to him .  it wasn   t     poison or anything  was it .         no  mister gumption .  his cigar started singing to him .         they don   t usually do that     said bewilderforce nervously .     i   ll have to check my stock .         please do that  sir .  and while you   re doing so perhaps you   ll look out this little list of snuff products .      the tobacconist took it from her carefully .  his lips moved and he said     that   s quite a lot of snuff  you know .         yes  sir     said cheery .     i   m authorized to pay cash down .      bewilderforce looked extremely bewildered .     what .  policemen pay .      walking the streets in the company of wee mad arthur presented a difficulty even for a dwarf like cheery littlebottom .  he was around six inches high  so if you spoke to him while you walked you sounded like a madman .  on the other hand  he heartily disliked being picked up .  you just had to put up with it .  most people made a slight detour if they saw wee mad arthur in any case .   they arrived back at the watch house and reported to carrot and the first thing he said to cheery was     do you know where there are any goblin caves  cheery .         no  sir .  why do you ask .         i   ll explain later     said carrot .     it   s fairly unbelievable .  did you find out anything from old gumption .      cheery nodded .     yes  sir .  sergeant colon   s haunted cigar came from howondaland .  no doubt about it .      carrot stared at her .     i didn   t think there were goblins in howondaland .  all jolson   s family come from there .     he snapped his fingers .     hang on one moment .     he ran down the corridor to the canteen and came back followed by constable precious jolson  a lady for whom the word large simply would not do .  everything about her was  as it were  family sized  including her good nature .  everybody liked precious .  she seemed to be a fountainhead of jolliness with always a cheerful word for anybody  even when she was picking up a brace of drunks and throwing them into the hurry up wagon .   after brief questioning precious said     dad sent me over there last year  remember  wanted me to find my roots .  can   t say i took to it  really .  nice weather .  not much to do .  not very exciting really  unless you try to stroke one of the cats  they get kind of stroppy .  never heard of goblins there  not the sort of place for them  i suspect .  excuse me  captain  can i get back to my tea now .      the silence that followed was broken by carrot  who said     howondaland is months away by boat  and broomsticks don   t work very well over water  even if we could persuade the wizards to lend us one .  any ideas .         crivens .     said wee mad arthur .     no problemo .  i reckon i could get there in less than a day  ye ken .      they stared at him .  wee mad arthur was small enough to ride on the back of any bird larger than a medium sized hawk     his aerial broadcasts from the sky concerning traffic hold ups in the city   were a regular feature of ankh morpork street life     but all the way to another continent .   he grinned .     as ye ken  i was away for a wee while lately  making the acquaintance o    my brothers  the nac mac feegle .  weel  they fly the birds a lot  and there   s a thing they have called the craw step  ye ken .  and i reckon i   m canny enough to use it  ye ken .         that   s three kens in one speech  wee mad arthur     said angua  to laughter from the rest of the watchmen .     you really got into the feegle thing  didn   t you .         oh  ye may scoff  but i   m the only one of ye scunners who knows why we get so many big birds flying over the city at this time o    year .  ankh morpork is hot .  see the big plume of smoke and fumes .  that   s all heat .  it lifts ye up  a free ride that puts the wind under your wings .  have ye heard of the surreptitious albatross .  no  because only me and the professor of ornithology at the university know about it  and he only knows because i told the scunner .  outside the mating season it never touches ground .  that   s not the only thing that   s odd .  it   s an eagle masquerading as a type of albatross .  ye could call it a shark o    the sky  and i reckon one of them will do me nicely .  they like the city .  they hover up where you   ll never see them unless you really know how to look .  there   s always one about  and i could leave today .  what you say .         but  constable     said carrot     you   ll freeze that high up in the sky  won   t you .         oh aye  i ken my thermal drawers may not be sufficient  which is why the word    brandy    is about to enter this conversation .  trust me on this  captain .  i reckon i can be back within twa days .         how many is that .     said angua .   wee mad arthur rolled his eyes .     two  captain  for the likes o    you .      in fact it took wee mad arthur only an hour to identify the peaceful looking bird drifting happily high above the city with the meal it had just had courtesy of a seagull  the feathers of which were even now drifting gently towards the cityscape below .  the surreptitious albatross had no enemies that it couldn   t easily digest  and paid little attention to the nondescript and relatively harmless hawk soaring towards it  right up until it found wee mad arthur landing on its back .  it struggled but was unable to reach the feegle  because he was sitting comfortably and had his hands around its neck  wee mad arthur tended towards the swift methods of domesticating wildlife .   the surreptitious albatross fought for yet more height by constantly spiralling up on the huge wide pillar of free lift     as ankh morpork was known and understood by the avian community     and wee mad arthur passed the time by memorizing a tiny pencilled map of the world .  really  it wasn   t difficult .  on the whole  continents aren   t hard to find  and neither are the edges of continents  where  by general consensus  you tended to find ships moored .  wee mad arthur was the world expert at looking for things from above  which amused him  given that most people who wanted to see wee mad arthur had to look down .   oh well  he thought  let   s go .   it was called the craw step  and the nac mac feegle of the chalk country had carefully shown their brother how it works when you are sitting on top of a large bird .   people in ankh morpork looked up at the bang high above and then  given that the sky was still clear  lost interest .  meanwhile  on one astonished surreptitious albatross sat one hugely satisfied feegle  who settled down in the feathers and began to eat a piece of the single hardboiled egg and two inch slice of bread that were his rations for the trip    while the universe rushed past them making a noise like weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee .   darkness had lasted about four hours when vimes was woken by a small boy bouncing up and down on the bed  and therefore on sam vimes  and saying     willikins has found a bird that just died .  dad .  mum says i can di     ssect it if you say it   s all right  dad .      vimes managed a mumbled     yes  all right  if your mother says so     before slipping back into the black .  and the black spread around him .  he heard himself thinking  the summoning dark could tell me everything i need to know  and that is the truth .  but would the truth that it told me be the truth  and how would i know that .  if i rely on it then in some way i become its creature .  or perhaps it becomes mine .  perhaps we have an accord and it helped me under koom valley and because of that the world is a better place .  surely the darkness has no reason to lie .  i   ve always liked the night  the dead of night  those nights that are sheer blackness  making dogs nervous and causing sheep to leap their hurdles out of terror .  darkness has always been my friend  but i cannot let it be my master  though sooner or later i will have to take an oath  and if i lie  me  the chief policeman  then what am i .  how could i ever again rebuke a copper for looking the other way .   he turned over among the pillows .  and yet the cause is good .  it is a good cause .  the man stratford did kill the goblin girl  i have the evidence of his associate and the word of a being whose assistance has been of material use to society .  admittedly  i have put a man in fear  but then  people like flutter are always in fear  and better that he fears me than stratford  because i at least know when to stop .  he   s just another red ball on the baize  and for that matter  i suppose  so is stratford .  he   ll have a boss .  they always have a nobby boss because nearly everybody around here is either a worker or nobby  and as far as i know practically everybody doesn   t have a good word to say for goblins .  it   s a target rich environment  and the trouble with a target rich environment is that it is useless if you don   t know which target you have to aim at .   vimes dropped back into deep sleep  and was almost instantly shaken awake by the best efforts of his son  industriously pounding on the heap that was vimes in slumber .     mum says to come  dad .  she says there   s a man .      vimes wasn   t a dressing gown type of person  so he struggled back into his clothing and made himself as presentable as a man could who needed a shave and didn   t appear to have the time to get one .   there was a man sitting in the lounge  wearing a fantailer hat  jodhpurs and a nervous smile  three things that mildly annoyed vimes .  a nervous smile generally meant that somebody was after something they shouldn   t have  he personally thought a fantailer looked silly  and as for the jodhpurs  no man should meet a copper if he is wearing trousers that make his legs look as though he has just burgled a house full of silverware and shoved it hastily down his trousers .  in fact  vimes thought he could see the outline of a teapot  but possibly that was his eyes playing mischievous tricks on him .   the wearer of this presumably self inflicted triple misfortune stood up as vimes entered .     your grace .         sometimes     said vimes .     what can i do for you .      the man looked apprehensively at lady sybil  who was sitting comfortably in the corner with a little smile on her face  and said     your grace  i   m afraid i must serve you with this cease and desist order  on behalf of the board of magistrates for this county .  i am very sorry about this  your grace  and i hope you will understand that it does go against the grain to have to do this to a gentleman  but no one is above the law and the law must be obeyed .  i myself am william stoner  clerk to said justices       mr stoner hesitated because vimes had strolled over to the door .      just making sure you don   t leave in a hurry     said vimes  as he locked the door .     do sit down  mister stoner  because you   re just the man i want to talk to .      the clerk sat down carefully  clearly not wanting to be that man .  he held in front of him a scroll with a red wax seal affixed  the kind of thing believed to make a document official     or at least expensive and difficult to understand  which  in fact  amounts to the same thing .   suddenly  vimes realized that all those years being confronted by lord vetinari had in fact been a masterclass  had he but known .  well  it was time for the examination .  he went back to his chair  sat back comfortably  steepled his fingers together and frowned at the clerk over the top of them for ten whole seconds  a length of time that used to unnerve him every time it happened  and so should surely work on this little tit .   then he cracked the silence with     mister stoner  three nights ago murder was committed on my land .  land ownership means something around here  doesn   t it  mister stoner .  it appears that this was done to implicate me in the disappearance of one jethro jefferson  a blacksmith .  you may consider me somewhat offended  but that was nothing like the amount of offence i experienced when i met constable feeney upshot  our local copper  a decent lad  kind to his old mum  who nevertheless seemed to feel that he answered to a mysterious board of magistrates  rather than to the law .  the magistrates .  who are the magistrates .  some kind of local body .  there appears to be no oversight on these people  no circuit judge and   i haven   t finished talking yet .      mr stoner  his face grey  sank back into his seat .  so did vimes  trying not to catch sybil   s eye in case she laughed .  he made his face a mask of calm again and continued     and it appears  mister stoner  that officially  in this parish  goblins are vermin .  rats are vermin  so are mice  and i believe that pigeons and crows may be also .  but they don   t play the harp  mister stoner  they don   t make exquisitely configured pots  and  mister stoner  they do not beg for mercy  although i must say i   ve seen the occasional mouse attempt it by wiggling its nose winsomely  which did indeed lead me to put the hammer down .  but i digress .  goblins may be wretched  unhygienic and badly fed  and in that they are pretty much like the commonality of most of mankind .  where will your magistrates put the ruler  mister stoner .  then again we don   t use a ruler in ankh morpork  because once the goblins are vermin  then the poor are vermin  and the dwarfs are vermin  and the trolls are vermin .  she wasn   t vermin and she pleaded not to die .      he leaned back and waited for mr stoner to realize that he did in fact have the power of speech .  when he did so  the clerk dealt with his situation in true clerkly fashion  by ignoring it .     nevertheless  mister vimes  you are out of your jurisdiction and  i may say  encouraging constable upshot in ways of thinking and  i might say  behaviour that will bode ill for him in his career        the clerk got no further than that because vimes interrupted with     what career .  he has no career .  he   s a copper all by himself  except maybe for some pigs .  he   s a good lad at heart  doesn   t scare easy  and he writes with a clear  round hand and can spell  too  which in my book makes him automatically sergeant material .  as for bloody jurisdiction  murder is the crime of crimes .  according to the omnians it was the third crime ever committed .    i know of no society anywhere in the world that doesn   t consider it a crime to be pursued with vigour  understand .  and as for the law  don   t try to talk to me about the law .  i am not above the law  but i stand right underneath it  and i hold it up .  and currently i work with mister feeney  and we have an accessory to murder in his cell  and justice  not convenience  will be served .         well done  sam     said sybil loyally  giving the small but distinctive clap that people give when they want other people to join in .   mr stoner  on the other hand  simply said     well done  sir  but nevertheless my instructions are to arrest you .  the magistrates have sworn me in as a policeman  you see  and young upshot has been relieved of his duties .     he winced  because of the sudden freeze .   vimes stood up and said     i don   t think i   m going to allow you to arrest me today  mister stoner .  i dare say sybil will allow you a cup of tea  should you want it  but i   m going to see chief constable upshot .     and he stood up  unlocked the door and walked out of the room  out of the hall and  at a reasonable speed  down to the lock up .   halfway down  willikins overtook him  saying     i couldn   t help hearing all that garbage  commander  on account of how i was listening at the door as per section five of the gentleman   s gentleman   s code .  what a nerve .  you   ll need me to watch your back .      vimes shook his head .     i don   t think a civilian should get involved  willikins .      willikins had to run faster  because vimes was speeding up  but he managed to gasp out     that is a hell of a thing for you to say to me  commander .     and hurried on regardless .   something was going on at the lock up     it looked to vimes as though it might be a domestic disturbance  a ruckus  possibly a fracas or even a free for all  in which case it was definitely unlucky for some .  a happy thought occurred  yes  maybe it was an affray  always a useful word because nobody is quite certain what it means  but it sounds dangerous .   vimes burst out laughing as soon as he saw what was going on .  feeney was standing in front of the lock up  his face beetroot red and his ancestral truncheon in his hands .  quite possibly it had already been used on the small mob trying to assault the lock up  because there was a man lying on the floor clutching his groin and groaning .  however  vimes   s lengthy experience told him that the man   s carefully targeted misfortune had a lot to do with mrs upshot  who was in a semicircle of men  all of them ready to jump back as soon as she waved her broomstick at them .     don   t you dare say my lad feeney ain   t a copper .  he is a copper  and so was his dad  and his granddad and his great granddad before him .     she paused for a moment and went on  grudgingly     pardon me  i tell a lie  he was a criminal  but anyway that   s nearly like being a copper .      the broomstick made a whooshing sound as she swung it backwards and forwards .     i know you lot .  some of you is gamekeepers  and some of you is smugglers  and a few of you is bastards  excuse my klatchian .     by now she had caught sight of vimes  and pausing only to bring her broomstick down like a mallet on the foot of a man who made a step in the wrong direction  she pointed her finger at vimes and yelled     see him .  now he is a gentleman  and also a great copper .  you can tell a real copper  like my henry  gods bless his soul  and commander vimes too     cos they   ve got proper badges what have been used to open thousands of beer bottles  i dare say  and believe me one of them would hurt you if they tried to stick it up your nose .  the flimsy bits of cardboard you boys is waving make me laugh .  come any further  davey hackett     she said to the nearest man     and i will shove this broomstick in your ear  trust me  i will .      vimes scanned the mob  trying to sort out the vile and dangerous from the innocent and stupid  and was about to brush off a fly from his head when he heard the gasp from the crowd  and saw the arrow on the cobbles and mrs upshot looking at her broom falling into two pieces .   in theory  mrs upshot should have screamed  but she had been around coppers for a long time  and so  face red  she pointed at the broken broom and said  as only an old mum could say     that cost half a dollar .  they don   t grow on trees  you know .  it wants paying for .      instantly there was the jingle of frantic hands in pockets .  one man with great presence of mind removed his hat and coins showered into it .  since many of these coins were dollars and half dollars snatched in haste  mrs upshot would clearly be self sufficient in broomsticks for life .   but feeney  who had been simmering  smacked the hat to the ground just as it was proffered .     no .  that   s like a bribe  ma .  someone shot at you .  i saw the arrow  it came straight out of this lot  right out the middle .  now i want you to go inside  ma     cos i   m not going to lose you as well as dad  understand .  damn well get inside the house  ma  the reason being  the moment you shut the door i intend to show these gentlemen their manners .      feeney was on fire .  if a chestnut had fallen on his head it would have exploded  and his rage     pure righteous rage  the kind of rage in which a man might find the idea and the inclination and  above all  the stamina to beat to death everyone around him     was a pants wetting concern to the befuddled citizens quite outweighing the secondary one  which was that there was at least six dollars of anybody   s money lying there on the cobbles  and how much of it could they get away with reclaiming .   vimes did not say a word .  there was no room to say a word .  a word might dislodge the brake that held retribution in check .  feeney   s ancestral club over his shoulder looked like a warning from the gods .  in his hands it would be sudden death .  no one dared run  of a certainty  to run would be to make yourself a candidate for whistling oaken crushing .   now  perhaps  was the time .     chief constable upshot  may i have a word  as one policeman to another .      feeney turned on vimes a bleary look  like a man trying to focus from the other end of the universe .  one of the outlying men took this as a cue to leg it  and behind the crowd there was a thump and the voice of willikins  saying     oh  i do beg your pardon  your grace  but this gentleman stumbled over my feet .  regrettably  i have very large feet .     and  to accompany the apology  willikins held up a man whose nose would probably look a lot better by the end of next week .   all eyes turned to willikins  except those of vimes     because there in the shadows  keeping his distance from the mob  was that bloody lawyer again .  not with the mob  obviously  a respectable lawyer could not be part of a mob  oh no  he was just there watching .   feeney glared at the rest of the men  because tripping can come so easily to a man .     i appreciate your man   s assistance  commander  but this is my manor  if you know what i mean  and i will have my say .      feeney was panting heavily  but his gaze swept backwards and forwards to find the first man to move or even look like someone about to move some time in the future .     i am a policeman .  not always a good one or a clever one  but i am a policeman and the man in my lock up is my prisoner  and i   ll defend him to the death  and if it   s the death of some bastards who stood in front of my old mum with crossbows they didn   t know how to use  well  so be it .     he lowered his voice to less than a scream .     now  i know you  just like my father did  and granddad too     well  some of you at least     and i know you ain   t as bad as all that        he stopped for a moment  staring .     what are you doing here  mister stoner .  standing there next to a mob .  have you been making a few pockets jingle .         that statement is actionable  young man     said stoner .   vimes carefully made his way to stoner and whispered     i won   t say you   re pushing your luck  mister stoner  because your luck ran out the moment you set eyes on me .     he tapped the side of his nose .     a word to the wise  i   ve got big feet too .      oblivious of this  feeney went on     what i want you all to know is that a few nights ago a goblin girl up on the hill was chopped up while she was pleading for her life .  that   s bad .  very bad .  and one reason is that a man who can chop up a goblin girl will chop up your sister one day .  but i will help my        feeney hesitated and then said     colleague  commander vimes  and will bring those responsible to justice .  and that ain   t all  oh dear me not by a long chalk  because you see i know  just like you do  that three years ago a load of goblins were grabbed in the night and rounded up to be sent down the river .  my poor old dad did what he was told and turned a blind eye  but i ain   t doing the same thing .  i don   t know if any of you helped  and right now that don   t concern me overmuch     cos folks around here tend to do what they   re told  although maybe some like doing what they   re told more than others .      feeney turned round  making certain that all knew they were included .     and i know something else .  i know that late yesterday  when we were actually on the way to hangnails  a bunch of goblins from overhang were grabbed and put on an ox boat down the river to           what .  why haven   t you told me all this before .     vimes shouted .   feeney didn   t look in his direction  keeping his gaze on the mob .     what before .  sorry  commander  but it   s been all go and i only found out just before this bunch arrived  since when it   s all got busy .  the boat probably came past here while we were still opening barrels in hangnails .  this lot wanted me to hand over my     your     our prisoner  and then of course my old mum got involved  as it were  and you know it   s always difficult when it involves an old mum .  i never told anyone to move  did i .  .      this was to a man in some distress who was almost bent double with his hands on his groin .      i   m very sorry  er  feeney  er  constable  er  chief constable upshot  but i really need the privy  if it   s all the same to you  please  thanking you very much .      vimes looked down at the crouching man and said     oh  dear me  it   s you  mister stoner .  willikins .  do take him somewhere where he can go about his business  will you .  but be sure to bring him back here .  and if it turns out that he didn   t really need to do any business  do him the courtesy of making sure that he does .     he wanted to say a great deal more at this time  but this was  after all  feeney   s patch and the lad was surprisingly good at it  when it came to pushing people who pushed old mums .   and the boy hadn   t finished yet  his mood had simply moved from molten steel to cold  hard iron .     before i tell you what happens next  gentlemen  i   d like to draw your attention to the goblin sitting up there in the tree  watching you all .  all you who are locals know stinky  and you know sometimes you give him a kick  or sometimes he blags a cigarette off you  and sometimes he runs you a little errand  yes .      there was a sense of sweating relief among the crowd that the worst appeared to be over now .  in fact it had only just begun .     commander vimes would like you to know  and so indeed would i  that the law applies to everybody  and that means it applies to goblins as well .      there was a certain amount of nodding at that and feeney continued     but if the law applies to goblins then goblins have rights and if goblins have rights then it would be right to have a goblin policeman attached to the shire force .      vimes looked at feeney with amazement and a not inconsiderable amount of admiration .  that had got them  they had all been nodding and he had led them by the nod and before they knew it they were nodding at a goblin officer .      well  gentlemen  i am intending to make stinky a probationary special constable  just so he can keep me up to date with what   s happening up on the hill .  he   ll have a badge  and anyone giving him a kick from now on will be assaulting a police officer in the course of his duty .  i think the penalty for doing that is not just being hanged  but also to let you bounce up and down for a bit afterwards .  this is an internal force decision  which does not require the authority of any magistrate .  is that not so  commander vimes .      vimes was amazed at how his mouth responded without any reference to his brain .     yes  chief constable upshot  as per section     part   of the laws and ordinances of ankh morpork  generally considered a model for police procedure     he added confidently  knowing that no one present would have ever clapped eyes on them and would quite likely not have been able to read them even if they had .   inside vimes winced .  he   d got away with having dwarfs  trolls and finally even werewolves and vampires in the watch  albeit on certain obvious conditions  but that had been the result of leverage over the years .  vetinari always said     what is normal .  normal is yesterday and last week and last month taken together .     and  vimes supposed  they had slipped things in one at a time to allow normal to gradually evolve     although mister stinky  or rather probationary special constable stinky  had really better confine his policing activities to the cave .  yes  not such a bad idea at that  indeed if only he could get them to leave chickens alone maybe normal would have a chance .  after all  people seemed quite easy about having their rights and liberties taken away by those they looked up to  but somehow a space on the perch was a slap in the face  and treated as such .   and now feeney  getting out of breath  was nearly talked out .     i can   t force any of you to tell me anything  but is there any one of you anxious to help me with my inquiries .      vimes tried not to let anyone see his expression  least of all feeney .  of course  captain carrot had once been like that and     was it possible .      maybe even young sam vimes had been like that too  but surely anyone could see that you never expect people who are part of a crowd to put up their hand and pipe up     yes  constable .  i   d be very happy to tell you everything i know  and i   d like these fine gentlemen here to be my witnesses .      what you did do after a performance like that was just wait  wait until somebody sidles up and whispers something when you are alone  or just tilts his head in the right direction  or  and this had happened to vimes  writes three initials in the spilled beer on a bar top and industriously wipes it clean within two seconds .  some bright spark would think  you never know your luck  after all  feeney could be a coming man  right .  and a happy relationship might come in handy  one day .   vimes blew away the pink cloud of embarrassment .     well  gentlemen  speaking as commander of the ankh morpork city watch  it seems to me that your senior police officer is being considerably lenient with you .  i would not be  so be grateful for him .  how many of these        and here vimes inserted a sneer     gentlemen do you really know  chief constable upshot .         oh  about half of them  commander  that   s to say their names  families  home addresses and similar .  the rest of them are from other places .  i can   t say that they   re all angels  but they   re mostly not too bad .      this sensible little speech in the circumstances earned feeney a few smirks and a certain relieved look all round  and  happily  an opening for vimes  who said     so which one of them had an arrow ready in his crossbow  do you think  mister feeney .      but before feeney had time to open his mouth vimes had spun round to confront the returning mr stoner  whose digestion had let him down .  willikins  whose instincts seldom failed  was still keeping an eye on him .  loudly and cheerfully vimes said     i see that my good friend mister stoner is back  and he   s a lawyer and i   m a policeman and we know how to talk to one another .  do come this way  mister stoner .      he grabbed the unwilling lawyer gently but firmly by the arm and led him some way from the crowd  who watched  vimes was pleased to see  with immediate deep suspicion .      you are a lawyer  are you not  mister stoner .  not a criminal lawyer by any chance .         no  your grace  i specialize mostly in land and property matters .         ah  far less dangerous     said vimes     and i suppose you   re a member of the ankh morpork bar  presided over by my old chum mister slant .     he had said it convivially  but he knew that the name of the old zombie would strike terror into any lawyer   s heart     although whether mr slant still had one of his own was questionable .  and now mr stoner must be thinking quite quickly .  if he had any sense  and read his law journal between the lines  he would be aware that while mr slant would bow  rather stiffly  to the rich and influential  he did not like mistakes  and he did not like seeing the law being brought into disrepute by inept lawyers and laymen  believing that this particular duty should be left to senior lawyers  such as mr slant  who could do it with care and panache and am     an hour .  and mr stoner should be thinking that  since it appeared that landowners around here had made up the law to suit themselves  which was the prerogative of the legal profession as a whole  mr slant would not be a happy zombie  and  as custom and practice now dictated that he should no longer walk around groaning with his hands held out directly in front of him  one of them perhaps holding a severed head for effect   he was known to vent his still considerable spleen on snotty young lawyers with ideas above their station by talking to them for some time in a calm  low voice  causing them to say afterwards that the severed head was  by contrast  the vegetarian option .   vimes watched the young man   s face as he considered his own meagre options and found that there was no plural .      i did endeavour to properly advise the justices as to their situation  of course     he said  like a man rehearsing a plea     but i   m sorry to say that they took the view that since they own the land hereabouts  then they decide the law of said land .  i have to say that they are  in themselves  quite decent people .      vimes was surprised at how well his temper was keeping these days .  he said     land  i quite like land  it   s one of my favourite things for standing on .  but land  and landlord  and law  well     a man might get quite confused  yes .  especially in the presence of a pretty good fee .  and it   s quite easy for people to be jolly decent people when they can afford to hire thoroughly un decent people  people who don   t even need orders  just a nod and a wink .      at this point there was a roll of thunder  not really appropriate to the last comment  and therefore without occult significance .  nevertheless  it was a giant roll that trundled around the sky  dropping blocks of sound .  vimes looked up and saw a horizon the colours of a bruise  while all round him the air was calm and warm and insects and other creatures that he couldn   t guess at were buzzing in the undergrowth .  satisfied that he need not look for cover yet  he turned his attention back to the squirming lawyer .      may i suggest  mister stoner  that you suddenly develop a pressing reason to go to the city and possibly talk to some of the senior lawyers there .  i suggest that you describe yourself as foolish  and when they see your damp trousers  that will act as corroboration  believe me .  if necessary  i might find it in my heart to make a statement on your behalf  to the effect that i think you were silly and badly led rather than criminal .      the look of gratitude read well  and so vimes added     why don   t you try criminal law .  it   s mostly grievous bodily harm and murderers these days .  you could call it ointment for the soul .  just a couple of things  though  what do you know about goblins being sent downriver .  and what do you know about the disappearance of jefferson the blacksmith .      it   s never nice to face a difficult question when you   re thinking about getting on a horse and travelling long distances at speed .     i can assure you  your grace     replied the man     that i know nothing about the disappearance of the smith  if indeed he hasn   t simply gone to work elsewhere .  and goblins .  yes  i know that some were sent away some years ago  but i took up this post two years back and i cannot comment on those circumstances .     he added primly     i have no knowledge whatsoever of any goblins being dispossessed of their accommodation lately  as the chief constable appears to believe .      turning his back so the craning crowd could not easily see what was happening  vimes glared at him .     i congratulate you on your careful ignorance  mister stoner .     he then grabbed the prim lawyer by the neck and said     listen to me  you little shit .  what you tell me may strictly speaking be true  but you are a bloody stupid lawyer if you haven   t realized that a bunch of landowners cannot decide all by themselves that anything they want to do is the law .  if you want to keep in with both sides  mister stoner  and i imagine that you do  then you might find a moment in your busy schedule to tell your former employers that commander vimes knows all about them and commander vimes knows what to do about them .  i know who they are  mister stoner  because chief constable upshot has given me a list of names .      he gently released the pressure and said quietly     very soon this will be an unfortunate place for you  mister stoner .     then  turning  so that the crowd could see  he took the bewildered lawyer   s hand  shook it lavishly and said loudly     thank you very much for such valuable information  sir .  it   ll make my investigations a whole lot simpler  i can tell you .  and i   m sure that chief constable upshot will feel exactly the same way .  it would be a much easier life for all of us if other upstanding folk were so quick to assist the police with their inquiries .     he looked at the stricken lawyer and said more quietly     i am no judge  but some of those men have a certain look about them .  i know the sort  probably got more teeth than brain cells  and now  mister lawyer  they   re wondering how much you know and how much you   ve told me .  i wouldn   t stop to pack if i was you  and i hope you   ve got a fast horse .      the lawyer left at speed and  at a meaningful nod from feeney  so did the mob  more or less evaporating into the scenery  and vimes thought  another one snookered .  get the reds  get the colours  but sooner or later you   re after the black .   and now he was left with the company of only willikins and the chief constable  who looked around like someone realizing that he might not only have bitten off more than he could chew  but also more than he could lift .  he straightened up when he saw vimes looking at him .  it was time for a little reinforcement  so vimes walked over and slapped the lad on the back .     well  i don   t know  i   m sure .  well done  chief constable upshot  and this time i   m not laughing at you  feeney  i   m not making fun  i   m not talking you down  and i cannot believe that you are the lad i met only two days ago .  you stood up to them  right enough .  a bunch of dangerous idiots .  with a lawyer .         they shot an arrow at my old mum .  oh  they said they didn   t     cos they was hoping to frighten us off .  they said they had no arrows .  so i said  quick as a wink  well  you wouldn   t have any arrows now if you   d shot them at my old mum  would you .  so that proves it  i told them  i said  that   s logic  and they didn   t know what to say .         well  i   m at a loss for words myself  feeney  because it seems to me that i heard you say some more goblins were sent downriver yesterday .  how did you find that out .      feeney waved a thumb in the direction of the lock up and grinned .     here   s the key  sir  just you go and talk to our prisoner .  you   ll love it  sir  he was beside himself when he knew they were coming for him and he sang like a nightingale  didn   t he just .         generally  we say that they sing like a canary     said vimes  turning towards the stubby little building .      yes  sir  but this is a rural police station  sir  and i know my birds  sir  and he sang like a nightingale  right enough .  a beautiful watery cadence  sir  second only to the trill of the robin in my opinion  possibly occasioned by his being really  really scared  sir .  i   ll have to slosh a bucket in there in a minute .         well done again  feeney .  might i suggest at this time that you go in and see to your old mum .  she   ll be worried about you .  old mums do worry  you know .      wee mad arthur was impressed .  why hadn   t anybody told him about the craw step before .  well  it was only recently that he had learned that he was  by birth  a nac mac feegle instead of  as he had been given to understand  the child of peaceful  shoe making gnomes .  feegles did not wear shoes and neither were they peaceful .  like many people before and after  wee mad arthur had always thought that he was in the wrong life .   when the truth had fortuitously been uncovered  it all seemed to make sense .  he could be proud of being a nac mac feegle  albeit one who enjoyed the occasional visit to the ballet and could read a menu in quirmian and  for that matter  read at all .   he cruised above the warm blue skies of howondaland in great circles and enjoying himself no end .  the whole continent .  there were people on it  so he understood  but mostly what he was seeing from the air was either desert  mountain or  most of all  green jungle .  he allowed the albatross to drift on the thermals as his keen eyes searched for what he suspected might be there .  it was  in fact  not a thing  as such  but a concept  rectangular .  people who planted things liked rectangular .  it was orderly .  it made things easy .   and there it was .  right down there on the coast .  definitely rectangular and quite a lot of it .  after a brief meal of hardboiled egg he persuaded the bird to perch in a treetop .  jumping to the ground was no fearsome undertaking for one of feegle stock .   as evening began to fall  wee mad arthur walked through line after line of fragrant tobacco plants .  but also noticeably rectangular  in this land where geometry was rare  were the sheds  visible not far away .   he moved stealthily to begin with and increasingly more stealthily when he saw the pile  white and complex in the gloaming .  the whiteness consisted of bones .  small bones  not feegle but far too small for human  and then  when he investigated further  he saw the corpses .  one of them was still moving  more or less .   wee mad arthur recognized a goblin when he saw one .  there were enough people who did not like feegles for feegles not to be too snotty on the subject of goblins .  they were a damn nuisance  but even feegles would be happy to agree that so were they themselves .  and being a nuisance is not something you should die of .  in short  wee mad arthur recognized this situation as very bad .   he took a look at the one who was moving .  there were wounds all over it .  one leg was twisted back on itself and suppurating scars covered its body .  wee mad arthur knew death when he saw it and that was in the air right now .  he looked at the pleading in the goblin   s one remaining eye  took out his knife and ended its suffering .   while he was staring at this  a voice behind him said     and where the hell did you escape from .      wee mad arthur pointed to his badge  which on him was the size of a shield  and said     ankh morpork city watch  ye ken .      the burly human stared at him and said     there ain   t no law here  whatever you are  you little squirt .      as commander vimes always said in his occasional rousing speeches to his men  it was the mark of a good officer if he or she is able to improvise in unfamiliar circumstances .  wee mad arthur recalled the words very clearly .     nobody expects you to be a first class lawyer     vimes had said     but if you have evidence that suggests that your proposed action is  on the face of it  justified  then you should take it .      and then wee mad arthur  ticking off points in his head  thought  slavery is illegal .  i know it used to be done  but i don   t know anywhere it   s done any more .  the dwarfs don   t do it and neither do the trolls and i know that lord vetinari is dead against it .  he checked all this again to make certain that he had got it right  and then looked up at the scowling human and said     excuse me  sir .  what was that you just said to me .      the man smiled horribly  grasping the handle of his whip .     i said  there ain   t no law here  you rabid little skunk .      there was a pause and wee mad arthur glanced down at the dead goblin on the stinking bone filled midden .     guess again     he said .   as battles go  it was one of the most one sided  and that side belonged to wee mad arthur .  there were only a dozen or so guards on the plantation  because starving creatures in chains do not  as a rule  fight back .  and they never knew who they were fighting .  it was some kind of force that sped backwards and forwards across the ground and then up your trouser leg  leaving you in no heart whatsoever for fighting or  for that matter  anything else .   punches came out of nowhere .  those who ran were tripped .  those who didn   t were left unconscious .  it was  of course  an unfair fight .  it generally is if you are fighting even one nac mac feegle  even if you are a platoon .   afterwards  wee mad arthur found chains in some of the huts and carefully chained every recumbent guard .  only then did he open the other huts .   the iron door of the lock up slammed against the stone as vimes entered  nevertheless he was taking care where he placed his feet .   and mister flutter sang  he certainly sang .  vimes was in no ornithological position to judge the singing in terms of nightingale or robin equivalent  but even if he had sung like a frog it would not have mattered  because he sang about a moocher called benny no nose  who hung about as such men do in the hope of picking up unconsidered trifles and had traded a pair of boots        i don   t know where they came from  and no more do you  okay .         for a turkey the very evening before the nightmare began for ted .      well  sir     flutter told him .     you asked me about what happened years ago  see  and what with one thing and another  what might have happened yesterday didn   t cross my mind  if you see what i mean .  it was all so sudden like .  anyway  yeah  he said they   d coupled a tender behind a two oxen riverboat that very afternoon  and it smelled to him like goblins  him living near their cave in overhang  and you never forget that smell  or so he said to the dockmaster  a man known to one and all as wobbly no name  on account of him often walking funny when the drink is on him  and was told     yeah  they   re sending them down while the going is good  and you never saw them  and neither did i  understand .     someone must think it very important    cos stratford is on the boat .  someone must have stamped their foot about that because stratford  well  he don   t like boats .  don   t like water  come to that .  won   t travel on a boat at all if he can help it .      vimes didn   t whoop .  he didn   t even smile  he hoped     you made sure you didn   t if you could help it     but he gave himself a point for being civil to flutter .  you couldn   t get off feegle free after a charge of accessory to murder  but there were ways and ways of doing time  and if this all worked out as he hoped it would  flutter might find that time would pass comfortably  and even  perhaps  faster than usual .   he said     well  thank you  ted  i   ll look into it .  in the meantime  i   ll leave you in the capable hands of chief constable upshot  to whom a prisoner is as sacred as his dear old mum  trust me .     he pulled out the key to let himself out  and then paused as if an important point had just aimlessly struck him .     a two oxen boat .  does that go twice as fast .      and now flutter was a riverboat expert .     not really  but you can pull more load  even through the night  see .  now  your one ox boat has to stop overnight at a cattle landing  so as the beast can have its rations and a jolly good chew and some shut eye before dawn and there   s a cost in time and money  right there .      prisoner or not  ted was now a self styled lecturer to the unfortunately ignorant .     but with two oxen  well  one can be taking a bit of a rest while the other is keeping the boat moving .  i reckon there were three or four barges behind that one  not too much for one ox downstream at this time of year .     he sniffed .     i wanted to be an ox boat pilot  but of course  the bloody zoons   had got it sewn up .  i did do a season on one  mucking out and feeding  but i prefer turkeys .         and the name of the boat .     said vimes carefully .      oh  everybody knows it .  it   s the biggest on the river .  everybody knows the wonderful fanny .      internal monologues can play themselves out quite fast  and vimes   s went  let me think .  ah yes  almost certainly there was a captain who had a wife who was probably named francesca at birth  but that   s too much of a mouthful  and he named his boat after her because he loved her very much .  and there you have it .  there is no need to dwell on the subject  because there are only so many words  letters and syllables available to the tongue  and if you can   t come to terms with that then you might as well never get out of bed .  and so  having got his brain sorted out  he released the clamps on his silly embarrassed face reflex and said     thank you for your cooperation  ted  but if you had told us earlier we might have been able to catch the damn boat .      flutter looked at him in astonishment .     catch the fanny .  bless you  sir  a man with one leg could do that .  she   s a bulk carrier  not a streaker .  even going all night she won   t have got much past fender   s bend by now .  there are bends all the way  you see .  i reckon you never get more than half a mile without a bend .  and it   s full of rocks  too .  seriously  you have to zigzag so much on old treachery that you   re often crossing your own wake .      vimes nodded at this .     one last thing  ted .  remind me again     what exactly does mister stratford look like .         oh  you know the type  sir  sort of average .  dunno how old he is .  maybe twenty five .  maybe twenty .  sort of mousy hair .  no scars that show  amazingly .     ted looked embarrassed at this paucity of information and shrugged .     sort of average height  sir .     he scrabbled for details and gave up .     to tell you the truth  he sort of looks like everyone else  sir  that is until he gets angry        ted   s face lit up        and that  sir  is when he looks like stratford .      willikins was sitting on the bench under the chestnut tree with his hands resting peacefully on his knees .  he was good at it .  he had a talent for resting that had escaped vimes .  it must be a servant thing  vimes thought  if you don   t have anything to do  don   t do anything .  and right now he could do with a rest .  maybe evidence was going downstream even as he stood there  but by the sound of it at a speed that could almost be overtaken on foot .  regrettably sybil was right .  at his age you had to be sensible .  you sometimes had to catch your breath  while you still had some .  he sat down beside the man  and said     an interesting day  willikins .         indeed  yes  commander  and may i say that young constable upshot handled his responsibilities with great aplomb .  you have a talent for inspiring people  sir  if i may say so .      there was silence for a while  and then vimes said     well  of course  we were helped by the fact that some bloody fool actually let an arrow go .  you could see them thinking about what might happen if you   re one of the gang that killed a dear old lady .  that   s a kind of trouble you don   t get out of easily .  that opened them up .  and it was obviously a real stroke of luck for us     vimes added  without turning his head .  he let the silence continue as the storm raged in the distance  while  nearby  whatever it was that was chirruping in the bushes carried on doing so in the warm  sultry afternoon .      it puzzles me  though     he went on  as if a thought had only just crossed his mind .     if it was someone in the front of the crowd who had loosed his crossbow then surely i would have seen it  and if it was one towards the back then he would have to have been clever and skilful enough to sight through maybe a very narrow space .  that would be very clever shooting  willikins .      willikins was still staring placidly ahead .  vimes   s sideways glance spotted no hint of moisture on his brow .  then the gentleman   s gentleman said     i expect these country lads excel at trick shooting  commander .      vimes slapped him on the back and laughed .     well  that   s the funny thing  don   t you think .  i mean  did you see their gear .  it was low grade stuff  in my opinion  not well maintained  the kind of stuff that granddad brought back from some war  whereas that arrow  i recognized that evil little package as a custom made bolt for the burleigh and stronginthearm piecemaker mark ix  you remember .         i am afraid you will have to refresh my memory  commander .      vimes was beginning to enjoy himself and said     oh  you must .  only three of them were made  and two of them are still under wizard assisted lock and key in the company vaults and the other     surely you remember this .      is locked safely in that little vault that we made in the cellar in scoone avenue last year .  you and i poured concrete while sybil and the lad were out  and rubbed dirt all over the floor so that you had to know it was there in order to find it .  it   s a hanging matter for anyone to be found with one of them  according to vetinari  and the assassins    guild told the times that hanging would be a picnic compared with what would happen to anyone they found in possession of one of those .  i mean  think about it  can   t hardly tell it   s a crossbow .  silent  folds up and fits in a pocket in an instant  easily concealed and deadly in the hands of a skilled man  such as you or i .     vimes laughed again .     don   t be surprised  willikins  i recall your prowess with even a standard military bow during the war .  heavens know what someone like you could manage with the damn piecemaker .  i just wonder how one turned up out here in the country .  after all  feeney confiscated all the weapons he found  but maybe one of those chaps had hidden it in his boot .  what do you think .      willikins cleared his throat .     well  commander  if i may speak freely  i might surmise that there are many workers at burleigh and stronginthearm  which is one factor  and  of course  the directors of the most famous weapons producer on the plains might also have decided to hide away a few souvenirs before the range was banned  and who knows where they might have got to .  i can think of no other explanation .         well  of course you may be right     said vimes .     and while it   s a terrifying thought that one of these things might be out on the streets somewhere  i must admit that the idiot who used it really helped us out of a difficult situation .     he paused for a while and then said     have you had a pay rise lately  willikins .         i am entirely satisfied with my remuneration  commander .         it is entirely deserved  but to be on the safe side  i   d like you  as soon as we are back home  to check in the cellar just in case  will you .  because obviously  if there are more of those bloody things out there  i want to make certain that i   ve still got one too .     and as willikins turned away vimes continued     oh  and willikins  it   s a damn good job for you that feeney cannot put two and two together .      was that the faintest sigh of relief .  surely not .     i will expedite that as soon as we enter the building  commander  and i am certain that should you yourself want to go down there some time later to make a personal check  you will find it resting where it has always been .         i   m sure i shall  willikins  but i wonder if you could solve a problem for me .  i have to catch the wonderful fanny .     he added hurriedly     which is a boat  of course .         yes  sir  i am aware of the vessel in question .  remember that i   d already been here for some time before you and her ladyship arrived  and i happened to be near the river when she went upstream .  i recall the people pointed her out to me .  i was given to understand that she was going up to overhang to load up  probably with iron ore brought down from the dwarf mine  which rather surprised me  given that normally they smelt directly at their mines and export the bar stock  this being a more economical method  sir .         fascinating     said vimes     but i think that however slow it goes  i ought to get after her .      feeney was just emerging from the cottage .      i   ve heard about the     the boat  lad .  we should get going while it   s still light .      feeney actually saluted .     yes  i have that in hand  sir  but what about my prisoner .  i mean  my old mum could give him his meals and empty his bucket for him  won   t be the first time she   s had to do that sort of thing  but i don   t like leaving her by herself  right now  if you get my thinking .      vimes nodded .  back home he only had to snap his fingers for a watchman to become immediately available  but now     well  he had no choice .     willikins .         yes  commander .         willikins  against my better judgement and i dare say yours  i hereby appoint you to the rank of special constable and i command you to take the prisoner back to the hall and keep him under lock and key there .  even a bloody army would be mad to attack the hall with sybil in it .  but just in case  willikins  i can think of no man better suited to guard my family .      willikins beamed and saluted .     yes  sir  orders received and understood  sir .  you can depend on me  sir  only     er  well  when we get back to the city could you  er  please not let anyone know that i was a copper for a while .  i have friends  sir  dear friends who have known me for a long time and they would cut my ears off if they heard i was a copper .         well  far be it from me to whiten a man   s name against his will     said vimes .     do we have an understanding .  i   d be grateful if you could refrain from too much adventurishness .  just guard the prisoner and ensure that no harm comes to him .  if this means a little judicious harm has to come to someone else  i will regretfully accept the fact .      willikins looked solemn .     yes  sir  fully understood  sir .  my comb will not leave my pocket .      vimes sighed .     you have a great many things in your pockets  willikins .  ration their usage  man .  and by the way  please tell sybil and young sam that daddy is chasing the bad men and will see them again soon .      feeney looked from vimes to willikins .     glad that   s sorted out  gentlemen     he said  and smiled nervously .     now  if you   re ready  commander  we   ll just go along to the livery stable and pick up a couple of horses .     with that he began to walk smartly down to the village  leaving sam vimes no alternative but to follow .   vimes said     horses .         absolutely  commander .  from what i hear we should catch up with the fanny in an hour .  to tell you the truth  we could probably outrun it  but it   s best to be on the safe side  don   t you think .      feeney looked sheepish for a moment and then added     i don   t usually ride much  sir  but i   ll try not to disgrace myself in front of you .      vimes opened his mouth .  then vimes shut his mouth  trapping the words  lad  i   d rather ride a pig than a horse  if it   s all the same to you .  i mean  pigs just run along  but horses .  most of the time i   ve got nothing against horses  and then i come down very firmly against horses  and then i   m shot up in the air again so that once more i have nothing against horses  but i know that in half a second the whole damn thing starts again  and yes before you come out with the whole business of    it   s all right if you rise up when they go down    let me say that has never ever worked for me  because then i   m either above and a little behind the horse or against the horse so firmly that i   m really glad that sybil and i have decided to have only one child      feeney was  however  in keen and chattering form .     i expect there were a lot of horses at koom valley  eh  sir .      and vimes was stuck .     actually  lad  the trolls have no use for them and the dwarfs are said to eat them  on the quiet .         gosh  that must   ve been a blow to a fighting man like yourself  commander .      fighting man .  maybe  vimes thought  at least when no alternative presents itself  but how in the seven hells did you get the idea that i   m comfortable even looking at horses .  and why are we still walking towards some barn that is going to be full of the wretched things  stamping and snorting and dribbling and rolling their eyes backward like they do .  well  i   ll tell you why .  it   s because i   m too damn scared to tell feeney that i   m too damn scared .  hah  the story of my life  too much of a damn coward to be a coward .   now feeney pushed aside a heavy wooden gate  which  to vimes   s susceptible ear  creaked like a fresh gallows  and he groaned as they stepped through .  yes  it was a livery stable  and it made vimes liverish .  and there they were  the inevitable hangers on  bandy legged  no more than one button on their coats  and a certain suggestion of rat about the nose and wishbone about the legs .  you could have played crockett with them .  every one of them had a straw in his mouth  presumably because that   s what they lived on .  and  helplessly  vimes was introduced to men who knew they had heard of him  very big policeman certainly  while feeney painted a picture of him as just the sort of man who would insist on riding the swiftest beast that they had installed in the stalls .   two evil looking mounts were led out  and feeney generously brought the larger over to vimes .     there you go  sir .  back in the saddle again  eh .     he said  and handed him the reins .   while feeney was negotiating the hire  vimes felt something tug at his leg and he looked down into the grinning face of special constable stinky  who hissed     big trouble  fellow po leess maan colleague .  big trouble for a man scared of horses .  damn right .  hate horse  can smell fear .  you take me  po leess maan .  i fix .  no worry .  you need stinky anyway  yes .  you find frightened goblin .  panic panic panic .  but stinky say shut gob goblins  this man despite appearances not too much of an arsehole  yes indeed .      the wretched little goblin lowered his cracked voice still further  and added  so that vimes could barely hear it     and stinky never ever said anything about po leess maan   s shirt washing man and very cross bow  hey .  mister vimes .  there is no race so wretched that there is not something out there that cares for them  mister vimes .      the words hit vimes like a slap in the face .  had the little bugger said that .  had vimes really heard it .  the words had dropped into the conversation as if from somewhere else  somewhere very elsewhere .  he stared at stinky  who rattled his teeth at him cheerfully and swung himself dreadfully under the horse just as  on the other side of the yard  the brains trust of debating equestrian experts settled the negotiations with feeney .  the apparent boss spat on his hand and feeney  against all public safety procedures  spat on his hand and then shook hands and then money changed hands  and vimes hoped that it washed its hands .   then  in front of vimes  possibly to its own amazement  the horse knelt down .  vimes had only seen that in a circus  and everyone else acted as if they   d never seen it at all .   stinky had miraculously disappeared  but when incredulous eyes are watching  as the venerable philosopher ly tin weedle says  you have to do something or be considered  in the great scheme of things  a tit .  and so vimes went bow legged and shuffled along the horse as nonchalantly as he could  and made the strange clicking noise that he   d heard ostlers use for every command  and the horse got to its hooves  raising vimes as gently as a cradle to the astonishment and subsequent wild applause of the bandy legged throng  who clapped and said things like bless you  sir  you ought to get a job in a circus .  and at the same time feeney was all admiration  unfortunately .   the wind was blowing up  but there was still some daylight left  and vimes let the constable lead the way at a gentle trot  which indeed turned out to be gentle .      looks like rain coming in  commander  so i reckon we   ll take it a little gently until we get down past piper   s holding  and then round by the shallows at johnson   s neck  where we can canter around the melon plantation  and by then we should be able to see the fanny .  is that all right by you  sir .      sam vimes solemnly waited for a few seconds to give the impression that he had the faintest idea about the local landscape  and then said     well  yes  i think that should be about right  feeney .      stinky dragged himself up the horse   s mane  grinning again  and held up a large thumb  fortunately his own .   feeney gathered up the reins .     good  sir  then i think we   d better bustle .      it took vimes a little while to fully understand what was going on .  there was feeney  on his horse  there was the statutory clicking noise  and then no feeney  no horse  but quite a lot of dust in the distance and the cracked voice of stinky saying     hold on tight  mister po leess maan .     and then the horizon jumped towards him .  galloping was somehow not as bad as trotting  and he managed to more or less lie on the horse and hope that somebody knew what was going on .  stinky appeared to be in charge .   the track was quite wide and they thundered along it  trailing white dust  and then suddenly they were heading downwards while the land on vimes   s right was going up and the river was appearing behind some trees .  he knew already that it was a river that saw no point in hurrying .  after all  it was made up of water  and it is generally agreed that water has memory .  it knew the score  you evaporated  you floated around in a cloud until somebody organized everybody  and then you all fell down as rain .  it happened all the time .  there was no point in hurrying .  after your first splash  you   d seen it all before .   and so the river meandered .  even the ankh was faster     and while the ankh stank like a drain  it didn   t wobble slowly backwards and forwards  from one bank to the other  as old treachery did  as if uncertain about the whole water cycle business .  and as the river wiggled like a snake  so did the banks  which  in accordance with the general placid and unhurried landscape  were overgrown and thick with vegetation .   nevertheless  feeney kept up the pace  and vimes simply clung on  on the basis that horses probably didn   t wilfully try falling into water of their own accord .  he remained lying flat because the increasingly low branches and tangled foliage otherwise threatened to smite him off his mount like a fly .   ah yes  the flies .  the riverside bred them by the million .  he could feel them crawling over his hair until some leaf or twig swatted them off .  the likelihood of spotting the wonderful   boat without having one   s head smacked off seemed extremely little .   and yet here  suddenly  was a respite for vimes   s aching backside  the sand bar with a few logs marooned on it  and feeney just reining his horse to a stop .  vimes managed to get upright again  just in time  and both men slid to the ground .      very well done  commander .  you were born in the saddle  obviously .  good news .  can you smell that .      vimes sniffed  giving himself a noseful of flies and a very heavy stink of cattle dung .     hangs in the air  don   t it .     said feeney .     that   s the smell of a two oxen boat  right enough .  they muck out as they go  you know .      vimes looked at the turgid water .     i   m not surprised .     perhaps  he thought  this might be the time to have a little discussion with the kid .  he cleared his throat and looked blankly at the mud as he got his thoughts in order  a little trickle of water dribbled over the bar  and the horses shifted uneasily .      feeney  i don   t know what we   ll be getting into when we catch up with the boat  understand .  i don   t know if we can turn it round  or get the goblins out and then get them home overland  or if we   ll even have to ride it down all the way to the coast  but i   m in charge  do you understand .  i   m in charge because i am very used to people not wanting to see me in front of them  or even alive .         yessir     feeney began     but i think        vimes ploughed on .     i don   t know what we   re going to find  but i suspect that people who try to take over boats  even a floating dung machine like the fanny  probably get treated by the crew as pirates immediately  and so i   m going to give the orders and i want you to do exactly what i tell you  okay .      for a while it looked as though feeney was going to object  and then he simply nodded  patted his mount and waited  while another tiny wave splashed beside the horses .  the sudden silence of someone normally so talkative disconcerted vimes  and he said     are you waiting for something  feeney .      feeney nodded and said     i didn   t wish to interrupt you  commander  and as you say  you are in charge  but i was waiting until you said something i wanted to hear .         oh yes .  such as .         well  sir  to begin with i   d like to hear you say that it   s time to mount up and get out of here really fast because the water is rising and soon the alligators will wake up .      vimes looked around .  one of the logs  which he had so carelessly dismissed  was extending legs .  he landed on the back of his horse with the reins in his hand in little more than a second .      i   ll take that order as a given  then  shall i .     shouted feeney as he sped after vimes .   vimes did not attempt to slow down until he judged them high enough up the bank not to be of interest to anything that lived in water  and then waited for feeney to catch up .      all right  chief constable upshot  i   m still in charge  but i agree to respect your local knowledge .  will that satisfy you .  where is the water coming from .      it certainly was rising  when they had started out you would have needed a ruler to be certain that it was flowing at all  but now little waves were dancing after one another and a light rain was starting to fall .      it   s that storm coming up behind us     said feeney     but don   t worry  sir  all that means is that the fanny will tie up if it gets too strong .  then we can just climb on board .      the rain was falling faster now and vimes said     what happens if it decides to carry on .  it   s not too far off sundown  surely .         that won   t be a problem  commander  don   t you worry .     shouted feeney with infuriating cheeriness .     we   ll stay on the trails .  no water ever gets up that far .  besides  wherever she is  the fanny will have running lights on  red ones  oil lamps as a matter of fact .  so don   t worry     feeney finished .     if she   s still on the river we   ll find her  sir  one way or the other  and may i ask  sir  what your intentions are then .      vimes wasn   t certain  but no officer ever likes to say that  so instead he parried with a question himself .     mister feeney  you make this river sound like a picnic .  look over there .     he pointed across the river to a spot where the water spun and gurgled and was almost visibly rising as they stared at it .      oh     said feeney     you always get debris coming down old treachery .  the only time to worry is if you get a damn slam .    they only happen very rarely when circumstances are right  sir  and you can be sure the captain will have the fanny well out of any danger if one of those should happen .  besides  he can   t possibly navigate the river in bad weather at night  old treachery is full of snags and sand bars .  it would be suicidal  even for a pilot as good as mister sillitoe .      they rode on in silence  except for the terrible swirling and gurgling of dark waters down in the torrent below the bank .  only a little daylight remained now and it was a dirty orange  helped out occasionally by flashes of lightning  followed by stone cracking thunder .  in the woods on either side of the river trees lit and occasionally burned  which was  vimes thought  at least a help to navigation .  the rain was soaking his clothing now  and so he shouted in a voice which betrayed his belief that he would not like the answer to what he was about to ask     apropos of nothing  and just to pass the time  lad  would you tell me what exactly a damn slam is .      feeney   s voice was initially drowned by a thunder roll behind them  but on the next go he managed     it   s an occasional phenomenon caused by a storm getting stuck in the valley and the debris of the storm getting piled up in a certain way  sir         stinky scrambled up from who would dare to speculate where and up on to the horse   s head .  he glowed with a faint blue corpse light .  vimes reached out a finger to touch him and a tiny blue flame danced across his hand .  he knew it .     st ungulant   s fire     he said aloud  and wished that he was in a position to use it to light his last cigar  even if it was an exhalation of the corpses of the drowned .  sometimes you just needed a little tobacco .   feeney was staring at the blue light with an expression of such horror that vimes hardly dared to disturb him .  but he said     then what happens  lad .      lightning  with a sense for the dramatic moment  illuminated feeney   s face as he turned .     well  commander  the debris will build up and up and tangle until it   s one mass  and the river is building up so much behind it that sooner or later it   ll overcome the strength of the natural dam  which will plough down the river  mercilessly sweeping up or capsizing everything in its path  all the way to the sea  sir .  that   s why this river is called    old treachery    .         well  of course     said vimes     i   m a simple man from the city who doesn   t know very much about these things  but i take it that a build up of debris which ploughs its way downriver sweeping up or capsizing everything in its path all the way down to the sea is generally considered to be a bad thing .      there was a long drawn out creak behind them as another tree was hit by a flash .     yes  sir .  you left out the word    mercilessly     sir     said feeney  carefully .     i think we really should try to catch up with the fanny as quickly as possible .         i think you   re right  lad  and right now i suggest        whatever it was that stinky was doing  and whatever it was that stinky actually was  the horses were already becoming skittish to the point of bolting .  there was so much water in the air and so little light left that the difference between the river and the shore could only be judged by seeing which one you fell into .   and there was solid rain now  rain that blew from every direction  including upwards  and the symphony of dark destruction was punctuated by the sound of banks slipping inexorably into the churning water .  the horses were now frantic and direction had no meaning  and nor did warmth and the world was nothing but darkness  water  cold despair and two red eyes .   feeney saw them first and then vimes picked up the smell .  it was the rich  desperate smell of oxen getting really worried and was thick enough to stink its way out of the turmoil .  amazingly  the boat was still churning the water  making progress of sorts despite the fact that its trailing flotilla of barges was jack knifing  tangling and generally swishing across the river like the tail of an angry cat .      why didn   t she tie up somewhere .     shouted feeney to the storm .  it sounded like despair  but vimes dismounted  grabbed the sticky shape of stinky and slapped his horse on the rump .  it certainly stood a better chance by itself now than it did with him  after all .   and then for a moment his inner eyes looked at koom valley .  he had nearly died that day as water poured off the valley walls and thundered through the endless caves in the limestone  smacking him against the walls  banging him on the floors and ceilings and finally dropping him on a tiny beach of sand  in utter darkness .  and the darkness had been his friend  and vimes had floated on the face of the darkness  and there he had found enlightenment growing  and understood that fear and rage could be hammered into a sword  and the desire to once again read a book to a child could be forged into a shield and armour for a ragged dying castaway  who thereafter shook hands with kings .   after that  what could be frightening about rescuing goblins and who knew how many other people from a floundering boat on a black and treacherous river in thundering  streaming darkness .   he was running now along the squelching bank  water pouring down his neck .  but running wasn   t enough .  you had to think .  you thought that the pilot of the boat knew the river and knew the boat .  he could have moored at any time  couldn   t he .  and he hadn   t done so  but he clearly wasn   t a fool  because even having known the river for only a few hours  vimes could see that no fool would survive on it for more than a few journeys .  it was built to be a trap for the stupid .   on the other hand  if you were not stupid then being an ox boat pilot was a pretty good gig  you   d have prestige  respect  responsibility and a steady wage for a steady job  in addition to the envy of all the little boys on every landing stage .  sybil had told him all about them  with some enthusiasm  one evening .  so why  in such a decent position  would a man pilot such a valuable boat with a valuable cargo down a river on an evening that promised annihilation around every snake like bend when no blame would attach to mooring up for a while .   money .  no  vimes thought .  they call this river old treachery  and surely money wasn   t any good to you when you were sinking dreadfully in its muddy embrace .  besides  vimes knew men like that  and they tended to be proud  self reliant and impossible to bribe .  he probably wouldn   t jeopardize the boat  even if you held a knife to his throat   but traditionally the family comes too  the pilot was always working from home  wasn   t he .   and what would a desperate pilot do then .  what would he do if a knife was held to the throat of a wife  or a child .  what else could he do but sail on  trusting a lifetime of experience to see them all to safety .  and it wouldn   t be one unwelcome guest  no  because then you would try to run the boat heavily aground while you  muscles tensed  would rely on the confusion to leap at the fallen man and strangle him with your bare hands  but that would only work if he hadn   t brought along an ally .  and so then you stayed at the wheel  hoping and praying  and expecting  at any moment  the rumble of the damn slam .   feeney was sprinting along the bank after him now  and managed to pant     what are we going to do  sir .  seriously  what are we going to do .      vimes ignored feeney for a moment .  rain  boiling surf and fallen logs were enough to contend with  but he kept his eye on the line of barges .  right now there was a rhythm as they snaked back and forth  but it was constantly interrupted by bits of driftwood and whatever attempt at steering was happening along there in the wheelhouse .  every time the rearmost barge hit the bank there was a moment  one precious little moment  when a man might jump aboard  if that man were foolish .   so he jumped  and realized that a jump would have to beget another jump and failure to keep the rhythm would mean falling back into the torrent  but jumping on to the next barge  which was swinging and bucking in the swell  you just hoped that you didn   t get a foot stuck between the two of them  because two twenty five foot barges colliding as a sandwich with your foot in the middle would do more than just leave a bruise .  but stinky ran and jumped and pirouetted just ahead of him and vimes was quick enough to get the message  landing squarely on the next barge  and so  surprisingly  did feeney  who actually laughed  although you had to be within a foot of him to hear that .      well done  sir .  we did this when i was a lad     every boy did     the big ones were best         vimes had got his breath back after the first two jumps .  according to what feeney had told him  the wonderful fanny was a bulk carrier  big and slow  but it could take any load .  there could be anything in these barges  he thought  but there was no smell of goblins yet and there were two barges still to go and weather that was trying to get even worse .   with that thought  there was stinky again  who apparently could come and go without ever being seen either coming or going .  and he still glowed faintly .  vimes had to crouch to speak to him .     where are they  stinky .      the goblin farted  quite probably as a clown does  more for entertainment than relief .  clearly happy at the response  he cracked     number one barge .  easy to get to .  easy to feed .      vimes eyed the distance to the barge immediately behind the fanny .  surely there had to be some kind of walkway .  some means of getting into the barges so that the crew could access the cargo .  he turned again to feeney  dripping with rain and illumined by another flash of lightning .     how many crew  do you think .      even this close  feeney had to shout .     probably two men  or a man and boy  down below in what they call the cowshed .  along with the engineer  and generally a loadmaster or cargo captain .  sometimes a cook  if the captain   s wife doesn   t want to do the job  although mostly they do  and then one or two lads learning the business and acting as general lookouts and wharf rats .         is that all .  no guards .         no  sir  this ain   t the high seas .      two barges crashed together  sending up a plume of water that succeeded in at last filling vimes   s boots right to the top .  there was no point in emptying them  but he managed to growl through the storm     i   ve got news for you  lad .  the water   s getting higher .      he steeled himself for the jump on to the next erratic barge and wondered  even so  where are the people .  surely they don   t all want to die .  he waited and jumped again as the barge presented itself  but fell back heavily just in time to see his sword cartwheeling roguishly into the stormy water .  cursing  and struggling to keep his balance  he awaited the next opportunity to narrowly survive and this time succeed .  he leapt again and almost fell backwards between the crashing timbers but  balancing perilously  fell forward instead and fell on and right through a tarpaulin  into an indistinct face which cried     please .  please don   t kill me .  i   m just a complicated chicken farmer .  i   m not carrying any weapons .  i don   t even like killing chickens .      vimes had managed to land with his arms around a plump man who would have screamed again had vimes not clamped a hand over his mouth and hissed     this is the police  sir .  sorry for the inconvenience  sir  but who the hell are you and what is going on .  come on  there   s no time to waste .     he pushed the man further into the barge and a soggy darkness and a recognizable smell told sam vimes that whether the frantic speaker was complicated or not he wasn   t lying about the chickens .  from the clucking  feathery gloom in the wire baskets beyond  there emanated yet another smell  announcing that a large number of chickens  never the most stoical creatures at the best of times  were now very frightened .   the vague silhouette demanded     the police .  here .  pull the other leg  mate .  who do you think you are .  bloody commander vimes .      the barge bucked again and an errant egg spun out of the darkness and smacked into vimes   s face .  he wiped it off  or at least spread it around a bit  and said     well  well  sir  are you always this lucky .          his name was false  in full it was praise and salvation false  and inevitably  when you have a false name you will insist on explaining why  even when imminent watery death is not only staring you in the eye but also everywhere else  possibly including both your trouser legs .     you see  sir  my family originally came from klatch  and our name was thalassa but  of course  over a period of time people tend to mispronounce the way they        vimes interrupted him  because that was a more acceptable alternative to throttling him .     please  mister false  can you tell me what   s been happening on the fanny .         oh dear  it was terrible  it really was extremely terrible .  there was shouting and yelling and i   m sure i heard a woman screaming .  and now we keep hitting the bank  or at least that   s what it sounds like .  and the storm  sir  it   ll have us under in two shakes of a lamb   s tail  i   m certain of it .         and you didn   t go forward to see  mister false .     said vimes .   the man looked startled .     commander  i breed complicated chickens  sir  extremely complicated chickens .  i don   t know anything about fighting .  chickens never get all that aggressive .  i   m really sorry  sir  but i didn   t go to see in case i saw  sir  see .  and if i saw  sir  then i   m sure people would see me  sir  and since i reasoned that they would be people who were alive after other people might possibly be dead  sir  and maybe had a responsibility for said deaths  sir  i made certain that they didn   t see me  sir  if you see what i mean .  besides  i have no weapons  weak lungs and a wooden toe .  and i   m alive  at the moment .      in truth  vimes thought there was an inescapable logic to all this  so he said     don   t worry about it  mister false  i bet you   ve got enough to do with your complicated chickens .  so  no weapons at all  then .         i   m very sorry to disappoint you  commander  but i   m not a strong man .  it was all i could do to drag my toolbox on board .      vimes   s face stayed blank .     toolbox .  you have a toolbox .      mr false clutched the wall again as the barge bounced off something it shouldn   t have  and said     well  yes  of course .  if we manage to get off at quirm i   ve got a site that i must make ready for a hundred chicken houses  and if you want a job done properly these days then you have to do it yourself  right .         you   re telling an expert     said vimes as another crash sent them both staggering .     i wonder if i could take a look at this toolbox of yours .      there are times in the symphony of the world when its aural kaleidoscope of crashes  thunderbolts  screams and storms suddenly merges into one great hallelujah .  and the contents of the chicken farmer   s innocent toolbox  which contained nothing not made of ordinary iron and steel and wood  nevertheless gleamed in the eyes of commander sam vimes like the hosts of heaven .  mallets  hammers  saws  oh my .  there was even a large spiral awl .  what could willikins have managed with a toy like that .  hal le lu jah .  oh  and here was a crowbar .  vimes balanced it in his hand  and felt the street rise until it touched his feet .  the complicated chicken man had heard a woman screaming      vimes spun round as the tarpaulin was pushed aside and feeney dropped into the barge in a flurry of spray .     i know you didn   t give me the signal  commander  but i thought i   d better tell you the water is going down .      vimes saw mr false close his eyes and groan  but turned back to feeney and said     well  that   s a good thing  isn   t it .  the water .  going down .         no  it isn   t  sir .     yelled feeney .     it   s still raining hard and the water level is going down  and that means that upstream of us enough broken trees and bushes and mud and other junk are piling up to make a dam which is getting bigger and bigger and growing out sideways as the water builds up behind it  sir .  can you see what i mean .      vimes did .     damn slam .      feeney nodded .     damn right .  we have two choices  would you rather die on the river or under it .  what are your orders  please  sir .      another collision shook the barge  and vimes stared at darkness .  in this terrible twilight somebody was managing to stop this boat from foundering .  a woman had screamed and vimes had a crowbar .  almost absent mindedly he reached down into the open toolbox and picked up a sledgehammer  handing it to feeney .     there you go  lad .  i know you   ve got your official firewood  but things might get up close and personal .  chalk it up to the dreadful algebra of necessity  and try not to hit me with it .      he heard the voice of feeney saying  more frantically this time     what are we going to do  commander .      and vimes blinked and said     everything .      the wind caught the tarpaulin as vimes pulled it open  and it flapped off across the river  leaving the complicated chicken farmer living in hope and broken eggs .  they pulled themselves out into the darkness  their shadows dancing to the rhythm of the lightning .  how the hell was the pilot navigating in all this .  lamps up front .  surely they could do nothing on a night like this except show up the darkness .  but although there was a suspicion  at every bang and bounce  that the fanny was in real trouble  vimes could hear now the splashing of the paddle wheels like one solid dependable theme in the cacophony  a regular  reassuring sound .  it was making way .  there was some order in the world  but how could the pilot manage the chaos .  how could you steer when you couldn   t see .   feeney had explained in a hurry and vimes had expressed utter disbelief even faster .     it   s true  sir .  he knows every bend in the river  he knows the wind  he knows how fast we   re going and has a stopwatch and an hourglass in reserve .  he takes a turn when it   s time to take it .  okay  he   s shaving the banks a bit with the old fanny  but she   s pretty tough .      they jumped together on to the last barge and found a hatch that was locked .  however  a crowbar is a universal pass key .  and there  under the hatch  were goblins  tied hand and foot  every one  and they had been stacked like cabbages .  there were hundreds of them .  overwhelmed  vimes looked around for stinky  who turned out to be behind him .      okay  my friend  over to you .  we   ll cut them loose  certainly  but i wouldn   t mind a bit of reassurance that i won   t suddenly have a load of angry goblins twisting my head backwards and forwards to see which way would take it off  understand .      stinky  already as skinny as a skeleton  looked even thinner when he shrugged .  he pointed at the groaning heaps .     too sore  too stiff  too hungry  too        stinky looked closely at a goblin at the bottom of a pile and touched a flaccid hand     too dead to chase anyone  mister po leess maan .  hah .  but later  give food  give water and they chase .  oh  they chase like the buggery  you bet .  once i talk to them  oh you bet .  but i will say to them  po leess maan  him big arsehole  okay  but kind arsehole .  i will say to them  you whack him  i whack you on account that i po leess maan now .  special po leess maan stinky .      vimes considered that was the best valedictory he could expect in the circumstances .  just then feeney managed to lever the lid off a large drum  one of several rolling around on the deck .  immediately the terrible stench in the barge doubled in intensity  and he backed away with his hands over his mouth .  stinky  on the other hand  sniffed approvingly .     hot damn .  turkey gizzards .  food of the gods .  bastard murder voyage  but okay catering .      vimes stared at him .  well  okay  he thought  he hangs around near humans so he picks up a vocabulary  but maybe that is suspiciously clever .  perhaps miss beedle gave him language lessons .  or maybe he   s just some occult adventurer from hell knows where having fun at the expense of a hardworking copper .  not for the first time .   feeney was already cutting ropes  and vimes tried to resurrect as many goblins as he could in a hurry .  it was no errand for anyone with a concern for hygiene or even a notion of what the word meant     though after an hour in a storm on old treachery  it had no meaning anyway .  they staggered up  and fell down again  found their way to the upended barrel of dead turkey bits and stumbled over slippery decks to a sloshing and now half empty water trough that feeney had found and was filling by the simple expedient of sticking a bucket over the side .  they were coming back to life  mostly they were coming back to life .   the barge bounced off a bank again  and amid tumbling goblins vimes grabbed for a handhold .  half the entire barge was full of barrels which  if you sniffed anywhere near them  were certainly not full of sweet roses .  he braved the rocking deck again and said     i don   t think all this is for a little voyage to the seaside  do you .  there   s more barrels of stinking turkey entrails than this lot of poor devils could possibly get through in a week .  someone was expecting a long journey .  good grief .      the barge had smacked into something and  by the sound of breaking glass  that something had been smashed .  feeney stood up  holding on to a rope  and  wiping turkey gizzard off his coat  said     voyage  sir .  not journey  sir .  you wouldn   t need all this stuff if you   re travelling on land .  i reckon they   re bound for somewhere a long way away .         do you think it   ll be a holiday of sun  sea  surf and fun .     said vimes .      no  sir     said feeney     and they wouldn   t like it if it was  would they .  goblins like the dark .      vimes slapped him on the shoulder .     okay  chief constable upshot  don   t hit somebody who surrenders and  if a man drops his weapon  be a little bit wary of him until you   re certain he hasn   t got another one tucked away somewhere  right .  if in doubt  knock    em out .  and you know how to do that  use the old bang suck cling buck on them  eh .         yes  sir  that   s a recipe for shoe polish  sir  but i   ll bear it in mind .      vimes turned to stinky  who already looked slightly fatter than usual .     stinky  i don   t have the faintest idea what is going to happen next .  i can see your chums are starting to look alive  and so you   ve got the chance that we all get  sink or swim  and i can   t say better than that .  come on  let   s go  feeney .      this close  the wonderful fanny was now a rolling  creaking mess  half covered by flying weeds and sticks .  apart from the storm and the clanging and creaking of the mechanisms  it was silent .      okay     said feeney quietly     we   d better go in by the cattle door at the stern  sir  or as you would say     the back    .  it won   t be a difficult jump  there   s lots of handholds because the loadmaster has to come out here to see to the barges .  can you see that double door and the little wicket gate .  we go in that way .  there   ll likely be more cargo along the cattle ramp  because a loadmaster never wastes floor space  and then we go midships            that is to say    the middle of the ship    .     said vimes .   feeney smiled .     yes  sir  and watch out because it   s a mass of machinery .  you   ll see what i mean  because you   re smart .  take the wrong step and you could fall into a gear or on top of an ox  never a happy occasion .  it   s noisy  smelly and dangerous  so if there are many bandits on this boat i wouldn   t expect to find them there .      i would  vimes thought  our mr stratford is the kind of maniac who would want to keep going in suicidal circumstances .  why .  so that the cargo is a long way away before anyone knows about it .  and stratford works for lord rust and the rusts believe the world belongs to them .  we   re taking goblins somewhere  but they want to keep them alive     why .   the shock of another collision brought him back to the dreadful here and now  and he said     i   d expect to find any crew here being watched like hawks in case they put a spanner in the works .         oh  very smart  sir  very smart indeed .  there has to be some light in there for safety   s sake  but not much and all behind glass    cos of         feeney hesitated  so vimes suggested     fire  perhaps .  i   ve never known an engineer who doesn   t shove grease wherever he can .         oh  it   s not exactly the grease  sir  it   s the beasts .  the gas does build up  so it does .  and if the glass breaks  well  it   s regrettably spectacular .  two years ago the glorious peggy was blown out of the water for just such a reason .         do they eat the hang suck butt dog with turnips around here .         no  sir  not as far as i know  but bhangbhangduc fusion cookery is very popular on the boats  it   s true .  anyway  further on you   ll find the pilot   s cabin  the sleeping quarters and then the wheelhouse  which has very wide windows  which is another good reason to attack from behind .      refreshingly  it was a short leap with a good handhold at the end of it .  vimes had no worries about being heard .  the deck creaked under his feet as he crept inside the wonderful fanny and sidled towards the middle of the ship  or whatever the hell the real term for it was  but then she creaked everywhere  and all the time  and groaned  too .  the boat was so noisy that a sudden patch of silence might have drawn attention to itself .  and i   m looking for somebody who looks like everybody else  he thought  right up until he looks like the vicious killer he is .  well  that seems straightforward .   vimes was vaguely aware of huge wheels spinning frantically off to either side and chains travelling overhead and now  here  at the top of the flight of stairs  was somebody who clearly wasn   t where they should have been      it was a woman  with a small girl clinging to her dress .  they had been loosely tied to a creaking beam  and a small oil lamp overhead held them in the centre of its circle of light .  and this was probably because there was a man sitting a little way away from them on a stool  with a crossbow lying on his lap .   and here was a puzzle because a length of string had been tied to each of his legs .  one length of string ran across the floor and disappeared downwards into what was  to judge by the heat  the farmyard stink and the occasional bellow of troubled ungulate  the cowshed that vimes had just passed .  the other string disappeared forward towards the wheelhouse .   the woman spotted him and immediately clasped the child to her chest and very slowly put a finger to her lips .  he had to hope that the man hadn   t noticed  and did not have to hope that the woman realized that he was there to rescue her  not to add to her troubles .  that wasn   t necessary  but he did feel better that she was a lady fast on the uptake .  he held up a hand in front of feeney  but the lad was definitely future captain material  he hadn   t moved at all .  like vimes  he had become an observer .  and vimes observed  and let the dark rise up to assess the situation in its own inimitable way .  this wasn   t the summoning dark  or at least he fervently hoped not .  it was just his own human darkness and internal enemy  which knew his every thought  which knew that every time commander vimes dragged some vicious and inventive murderer to such mercy or justice as the law in its erratic wisdom determined  there was another vimes  a ghost vimes  whose urge to chop that creature into pieces on the spot had to be chained .  this  regrettably  was harder every time  and he wondered if one day that darkness would break out and claim its heritage  and he wouldn   t know     the brakes and chains and doors and locks in his head would have vanished and he wouldn   t know .   right now  as he looked at the frightened child  he feared that moment was coming closer .  possibly only the presence of feeney was holding the darkness at bay  the dreadful urge to do the hangman out of his entitlement of a dollar for the drop  thruppence for the rope and sixpence for his beer .  how easy it is to kill  yes  but not when a smart young copper who thinks you are a good guy is looking to you .  at home  the watch and his family surrounded vimes like a wall .  here the good guy was the good guy because he didn   t want anyone to see him being bad .  he did not want to be ashamed .  he did not want to be the darkness .   the bow was pointed at the two hostages and its holder had surely been told to fire if a leg pull sounded the alarm .  would he do it .  you needed to age a bit for the dark to start trickling in  although there were always one or two who were born as darkness on legs  who would kill for a pastime .  was he one .  even if he wasn   t  would he panic .  how light was the trigger .  could a sudden jerk set it off .   outside  the storm raged .  whether the water was going down or not didn   t seem all that important  given there was so much of the damn stuff around already .  the woman was watching him out of the corner of her eye .  oh well  every moment counted      timing his steps carefully  as if a footstep would be heard in all the thunder and creaking  vimes crept up to the unsuspecting guard  clamped both hands around his neck and jerked upwards .  the arrow thudded into the ceiling .      i don   t want anybody to get hurt .     vimes tried to say it in a friendly way  but went on     if you think you can pull strings  kid  then let me tell you that you   ll run out of gasp before i run out of squeeze .  chief constable upshot  grab that weapon and tie up this gentleman   s legs .  you may keep his weapon .  i know you like them .      he must have inadvertently decreased the pressure  for his captive said hoarsely     i don   t want to kill anybody  sir  please .  they gave me the bow and told me i was to fire if the boat stopped or i got a pull on the ropes .  do you think i   d do that  sir .  do you really think i   d do that .  i was only sitting here in case one of them came in .  please  sir  i never came along for anything like this .  it   s stratford  sir  he   s a total nutjob  sir  a bloody killer  he is .      there was a crash and the whole boat shook .  maybe the pilot   s stopwatch had let him down .     what   s your name  mister .         eddie  sir  eddie brassbound .  i   m just a water rat  sir .     the man was trembling .  vimes could see his hand shaking .  he turned to the woman with the child  who was being supported now by feeney  touched his forelock and flashed his carefully secreted badge .     madam  i   m commander vimes of the ankh morpork city watch .  has this man mishandled you or the little girl in any way .      the woman had barely moved .  she reminded him of the younger sybil  calm and collected and much more likely to fight than scream  but she wouldn   t fight until she was ready .     it was done pretty slick  commander  just when i was putting grace to bed .  the bastards came on as owners of some cargo and acted like decent boys until my husband said he reckoned the weather was going to get really bad .  i was in the galley  i heard a lot of yelling and then we were put down here .  personally  sir  i would deem it a favour if you killed every man jack of them  but life can   t be all fun .  as far as this one is concerned  well  he could have been less gentlemanly  so although i   d like you to throw him into the river i wouldn   t object if you refused to tie a heavy weight to his leg .      feeney laughed .     wouldn   t need weights  ma   am .  the river is having a party and we   re all guests .  i   m a pretty good swimmer  and i wouldn   t dare jump into what   s out there .      vimes grabbed brassbound and stared into his eyes .  after a moment he said     no  i know a killer   s eyes when i see them .  that doesn   t mean you ain   t a pirate  though  so we   re going to keep an eye on you  okay  so don   t try anything .  i   m trusting you .  heavens help you if i   m wrong .      brassbound opened his mouth to speak  but vimes added quickly     you could make your life a little easier and possibly longer  mister brassbound  if you were to tell me how many of your jolly parcel of rogues there are on the fanny .         don   t know  sir .  don   t know who   s still alive  see .      vimes looked at the woman as the boat gave a lurch .  it was a strange sensation     for a moment vimes felt almost weightless     and there was a commotion behind them in the cowshed among the great spinning wheels .  when he got his balance he managed to say     i take it that you are mrs sillitoe  madam .      she nodded .     yes  i am  commander     she said as the little girl clung more tightly to her .     i know my husband is still alive  because so are we     at the moment .     she stopped as another surge lifted the entire boat  then the fanny came down with a splash and a spine numbing thump  followed by the long drawn out bellow of a bullock who had had enough  and the start of a scream .   vimes  feeney and brassbound picked themselves up off the floor .  mrs sillitoe and her daughter were  amazingly  still vertical and mrs sillitoe wore a grim smile .     that sound you heard was one of the pirates dying  i   m extremely pleased to say .  that means everyone else in the cowshed is alive .  shall i tell you why .  he almost certainly didn   t hop .  those lifts and drops are little slams to me  somewhere behind us a damn slam is getting so big that bits of it are calving off and coming down all the way to us at speed  you see  raising the water level and dropping it again like a stone as they go past     and that   s when you have to know enough to dance to the rhythm .  because if you don   t dance to the rhythm of the slam you   ll dance with the devil soon enough .  a man went down there with a crossbow when the fighting started .  by the sound of it he wasn   t familiar with the dance .  i expect it was ten gallon charlie who got him when he was on the ground  poor lamb .  charlie is the bullock wrangler .  if he hits a man once  no one will ever have to hit him again .     mrs sillitoe said that in a matter of fact  satisfied voice .     if you want to try to steal from our riverboat you have to be prepared for some considerable inconvenience .      and i thought the city was on the tough side  vimes thought .  he noticed that a prudent feeney had rearmed the confiscated crossbow and said     i   m going below to make certain .  mrs sillitoe  how many other pirates do you think there are .         there were four that came aboard as owners of the cargo .     she began to tick them off on her fingers .     mister harrison the loadmaster got one of them  but another one stabbed him  the devil .  i know only one of them went down to the cowshed  and the other one helped this simpering little bastard rig up the ropes so that if anybody was left to try any funny business we were a hostage  and then went up to the wheelhouse .  i was told that we would be all right  provided my husband gets the cargo to quirm .     the little girl clung to her dress as the woman continued  her face wooden .     personally  i don   t believe it  but he hasn   t harmed my husband yet .  he   s counting  all the time he   s counting .  my husband is listening to old treachery and remembering .  trying to out think sixty miles of murderous water .  and if he dies  it wins  wherever you are            feeney  keep your crossbow pointing at this gentleman  will you .     said vimes .     and if he makes any movement whatsoever  up to and including trying to blow his nose  you have my full authority to shoot him somewhere where it will be seriously inconvenient .      he headed to the steps and nodded to feeney and mrs sillitoe  raised a finger and said     be with you in just one minute .     and hurried down into the hot and noisome heart of the wonderful fanny .  snooker  vimes thought .  knocking the balls until you have the right one right on cue .   he felt pressure on his feet surge as the vessel lifted  and instantly jumped into the air  landing neatly as the fanny slapped back down into the water .   he was confronted by a man who would surely make even willikins think twice .     you   d be ten gallons .  mrs sillitoe sent me down here .  i   m commander vimes  ankh morpork city watch .      and the man with a face like a troll and a body to match said     heard about you .  thought you were dead .         i generally look like this at the end of boat trips  mister gallons     said vimes .  then  pointing to an apparent corpse on the floor between them     what happened to him .         i fink he is dead     ten gallons leered .     i   ve never seen a man suffocated by his own nose before .      it was hard to hear anything down in the cowshed given the complaining of the oxen and the ominous whirring of overstressed gears  but vimes shouted     did he have a crossbow .      ten gallons nodded and fingers thicker than vimes   s wrist unhooked said weapon off a nail on the wall .     would come with you  mister  but it   s all the three of us can do to hold things together down here .     he spat .     ain   t really any hope anyway  the damn slam is right behind us .  see you on the other side  copper .      vimes nodded at him  examined the crossbow for a moment  made a little adjustment and  satisfied  climbed back up the steps .   vimes looked at the few people left on the wonderful fanny who weren   t pouring water on the backs of steaming oxen or trying to hold the boat in one piece and above water .  the shocks were indeed getting closer together  he was sure of it  and surely  once there was a big enough hole  the whole damn dam would give way .   all the occupants of the cabin except brassbound  who fell over  jumped together as yet another surge raised the boat .   there was a sharp intake of breath from feeney as vimes went over to the trembling brassbound  who had clearly realized that he was likely to be the unlucky winner of the first over the side contest .  and feeney actually groaned when vimes handed the man the recovered crossbow saying     i told you  chief constable  i know a killer when i see one and i need back up and i   m sure that our mister brassbound is very eager to get himself promptly on to the good side of the law right now  a decision that might well make him look better in court .  am i not right  mister brassbound .      the young man nodded fervently .   vimes added     i   d rather have you down here  feeney .  until i know exactly who is still on this tub  i   d like you to look after the ladies .  right now i   m not sure i know who   s alive and who   s dead .         the fanny is not a tub  commander     said mrs sillitoe sharply     but i   ll forgive you this one time .      vimes gave her a little salute as all but brassbound jumped and once again the idiot floundered .   vimes turned towards the stairs .     it   s going to be stratford up there with the pilot  isn   t it  mister brassbound .      another  bigger surge this time  and brassbound landed heavily .  he managed to get out     and he   s heard about you  you know how it is  and he   s determined to get down to the sea before you catch up with him .  he   s a killer  sir  a stone killer .  don   t give him a chance  sir  i beg you for all our sakes  and do it quickly for yours .     the air was electric  truly electric .  everything metal shook and jangled .     they say the dam is going to break pretty soon     said brassbound .      thank you for that  mister brassbound .  you sound like a sensible young man to me and i   ll say so to the authorities .      the worried young man   s face was wreathed in smiles as he said     and you   re the famous commander vimes  sir .  i   m glad to be at your back .      there were a lot of steps up to the wheelhouse .  the pilot was king and rode high over the river  monarch of all he surveyed even if  as now  rain hammered at the expensive glass windows as if it found such solid slabs of sky offensive .  vimes stepped inside quickly .  it was hardly worth shouting  given that the storm drowned out everything  but you had to be able to say that you   d said it     commander vimes  ankh morpork city watch .  statute of necessary action .     which didn   t exist  but he swore to himself that he would damn well get it enacted as soon as he got back  even if he had to call in favours from all over the world .  a lawman faced with a dreadful emergency should at least have some kind of figleaf to shove down the throats of the lawyers .   he could see the back of mr sillitoe   s head with his pilot   s cap .  the pilot paid vimes no attention  but a young man was standing looking at vimes in knock kneed  pants wetting horror .  the sword he had been carrying landed heavily on the deck .   brassbound was hopping from one foot to the other .     you   d better take care of him right now  commander  he   ll have a trick or two up his sleeve and no mistake .      vimes ignored this and carefully patted the young man down  freeing up one short knife  the sort a river rat might carry .  he used it to cut a length of rope and tied the man   s hands together behind him .     okay  mister stratford  we   re going downstairs .  though if you   d like to dive into the water first i won   t stop you .      and then the man spoke for the first time .     i ain   t stratford  sir     he said  pleading .     i   m squeezy mcintyre .  that   s stratford behind you with the crossbow pointing at you  sir .      the man formerly known as brassbound gave a chuckle as vimes turned .     oh my  oh my  the great commander vimes .  i   ll be damned if you ain   t as dumb as a pile of horseshit .  you know the eyes of a killer when you see them  do you .  well  i reckon i   ve killed maybe sixteen people  not including goblins  of course  they don   t count .      stratford sighted on vimes and grinned .     maybe it   s my boyish features  would you say .  what kind of bloody fool cares about the goblins  eh .  oh  they say they can talk  but you know how those little buggers can lie .     the tip of the crossbow drifted back and forwards hypnotically in stratford   s hands .     i   m curious  though .  i mean  i don   t like you  and sure as salvation i   m going to shoot you  but do me a favour and tell me what you saw in my eyes  okay .      squeezy took the opportunity to hop desperately down the steps just as vimes said  with a shrug     i saw a goblin girl being murdered .  what lies did she tell you .  i know the eyes of a murderer  mister stratford  oh i surely do  because i   ve looked into eyes like that many times .  and if i need reminding  i look into my shaving mirror .  oh  yes  i recognize your eyes and i   m interested to see what you   re going to do next  mister stratford .  though now i come to think about it  maybe it wasn   t sensible of me to give you that crossbow .  maybe i really am stupid  because i   m offering you the opportunity to surrender to me here and now and i   m doing it only once .      stratford stared with his mouth open and then said     hell  commander  i   ve got the drop on you  and you want me to surrender to you .  sorry  commander  but i   ll see you again in hell .      there was a space in the world for the crossbow to sing when the grinning stratford pulled the trigger .  unfortunately  the sound that it made approximated to the word thunk .  he stared at it .      i took the safety pin out and stamped it into the dung     said vimes .     you can   t fire it without the pin .  now  i expect you have a couple of knives about your person  and so if you fancy cutting your way out past me  then i   d be happy to accommodate you  although i   ll tell you that firstly you won   t succeed  and secondly  if you manage to get past a boy who grew up on the streets of ankh morpork there   s a man down there with a punch that can fell an elephant  and if you knife him you   ll just make him more annoyed        the surge this time was bigger than ever  and vimes banged his head on the cabin   s roof before coming down again in front of stratford and kicking him smartly in the official police officer method and also the groin .      oh  come on  mister stratford  don   t you have a reputation to keep up .  feared killer .  you should spend some time in the city  my lad  and i   ll make certain you do .     stratford fell backwards and vimes continued     and then you   ll hang  as is right and proper  but don   t worry     mister trooper does a nifty noose and they say it hardly hurts at all .  tell you what  just to get the adrenalin pumping  mister stratford  imagine i   m the goblin girl .  she begged for her life  mister stratford  remember that .  i do .  and so do you .  you fell down at the first surge  mister stratford .  river rats know what to do .  you didn   t  although i must say you   ve covered it very well .  whoops .      this was because stratford had indeed tried his hand with a knife .  vimes twisted his wrist and flung the blade down the stairs just as the glass in the wheelhouse smashed and a branch longer than vimes ploughed across the room  shedding leaves and dragging torrential rain and darkness behind it .   both the lamps had gone out and  as it turned out  so had stratford  hopefully through a shattered window  possibly to his death  but vimes wasn   t sure .  he would have preferred definitely .  but there was no time to fret about him  because now came another surge  and water poured in through the glassless windows .   vimes jerked open the little gate to the pilot   s deck and found mr sillitoe struggling up out of the pile of storm washed debris .  he was moaning     i   ve lost count  i   ve lost count .      vimes pulled him upwards and helped him into his big chair  where he banged on the arms in frustration .     and now i can   t see a damned thing in all this murk .  can   t count  can   t see  can   t steer .  won   t survive .         i can see  mister sillitoe     said vimes .     what do you want me to do .         you can .      vimes stared out at the homicidal river .     there   s a thundering great rock coming up on the left hand side .  should it be doing that .   looks like there   s a busted landing stage there .         ye gods .  that   s baker   s knob .  here  let me at the wheel .  how close is it now .         maybe fifty yards .         and you can see it in all this .  damn me  mister  you must have been born in a cave .  that means we ain   t that far from quirm now  a touch under nineteen miles .  you think you could stand lookout .  is my family okay .  that little snot threatened to harm them if i didn   t keep the fanny on schedule .     something big and heavy bounced off the roof and spun away into the night  and the pilot went on     gastric sillitoe  delighted to make your acquaintance  sir .     he stared ahead .     i   ve heard of you .  koom valley  right .  happy to have you aboard .         er  gastric .  whole tree spinning in current near left hand shore  ten yards ahead .  nothing much to see on right .      the wheel spun frantically again .     obliged to you  sir  and i surely hope you won   t take it amiss if i say that we generally talk about port and starboard .         wouldn   t know about that  gastric  never drank starboard .  mass of what looks like smashed logs ahead  forty yards  looks like small stuff  and i see a faint light high up on our right  can   t tell how far away .     vimes ducked and a jagged log bounced off the back of the wheelhouse .  beside him the pilot sounded as if he had got a grip on things now .      okay  commander  that would be jackson   s light  very welcome sight .  now i   ve found my bearings and an hourglass that ain   t busted  i   d be further in your debt if you   d go below and tell ten gallons to cut loose the barges .  there   s a chicken farmer on one of them .  best to get him on board before the dam breaks .         and hundreds of goblins  gastric .         pay them no mind  sir .  goblins is just goblins .      for a moment vimes stared into the darkness  and the darkness within the darkness  and it said to him     you   re having fun  aren   t you  commander .  this is sam vimes being sam vimes in the dark and the rain and the danger and because you   re a copper you   re not going to believe that stratford is dead until you see the corpse .  you know it .  some people take a devil of a lot of killing .  you know you saw him go out of the cabin  but there   s all kinds of ropes and handholds on the boat  and the bugger was wiry and limber  and you know  just as day follows night  that he   ll be back .  double jeopardy  commander vimes  all the pieces on the board  goblins to save  a murderer to catch     and all the time  when you remember  there is a wife and a little boy waiting for you to come back .         i always remember .         of course you do  commander vimes     the voice continued     of course you do .  but i know you  and sometimes a shadow passes every sun .  nevertheless  the darkness will always be yours  my tenacious friend .      and then reality either came back or went away and vimes was saying     we bring the goblins aboard  gastric  because they     yes  they are evidence in an important police investigation .      there was a further surge  and this time vimes landed up on the deck  which was a little bit softer now because of the ragged carpet of leaves and branches .  as he got up mister sillitoe said     police investigation  you say .  well  the fanny has always been a friend of the law but  well  sir  they stink like the pits of hell  and that   s the truth of it .  they   ll frighten the oxen something terrible .         do you think they aren   t frightened already .     said vimes .     er  small logjam ahead on the right .  all clear on the left .     he sniffed .     trust me  sir  by the smell of it they   re pretty nervous as it is .  can   t you just stop and tie us up to the bank .      sillitoe   s laugh was brittle .     sir  there are no banks now  none that i   d try to get to .  i know this river and it   s angry and there   s a damn slam coming .  can   t stop it any more than i could stop the storm .  you signed up for the long haul  commander  either we race the river or we fold our hands  pray to the gods and die right now .     he saluted .     nevertheless  i can see you   re a man  sir  who does what he sees needs doing  and  by hokey  i can   t argue with that .  you   ve done a man   s job as it is  commander vimes  and may the gods go with you .  may they go with all of us .      vimes ran down the steps  grabbing feeney in passing  and danced over the heaving floor to the cowshed .     come on  lad  it   s time to ditch the barges .  there   s too much of a drag .  mister ten gallons .  let   s get those doors open  shall we .  mister sillitoe has put me in charge down here .  if you want to argue  feel free .      the huge man didn   t even attempt an argument  and punched the doors open .   vimes swore .  mr sillitoe had been right .  there was roaring not far behind them and a river of lightning and blue fire was sweeping down the valley like a tide .  for a moment he was hypnotized  and then got a grip .     okay  feeney  you start getting the goblins on board and i   ll fetch our chicken farmer .  the bloody iron ore can sink for all i care .      in the glaring light of the damn slam vimes jumped twice to land on the barge from which was already coming the squawking of terrified birds .  water poured off him as he dragged open the hatch and shouted     mister false .  no  don   t start grabbing the chickens .  better off farmer with no chickens than a load of chickens with no farmer .  anyway  they   ll probably float  or fly  or something .      he coaxed the frightened man on to the next barge to find that it was still full of bewildered goblins .  feeney was looking out from the open door at the rear of the fanny  and above the roar and hissing vimes heard him shout     it   s mister ten gallons  sir .  he says no goblins .      vimes glanced behind them  and then turned back to feeney .     very well  mister feeney  keep an eye on the goblins    barge while i discuss matters with mister ten gallons  understand .      he flung mr false on to the deck of the fanny and looked around for ten gallons .  he shook his head .  what a copper that man would make if properly led by human beings .  he sighed .     mister ten gallons .  i told you  mister sillitoe has given me carte blanche .  can we discuss the matter of the goblins .      the giant growled     i ain   t got no cart and i don   t know no blanche  and i ain   t having no goblins on my deck  okay .      vimes nodded  poker faced  and looked exhaustedly at the deck .     is that your last word  mister ten gallons .         it damn well is .         okay  this is mine .      ten gallons went over backwards like a tree and began to sleep like a log .   the street never leaves you      and what the university of the street told you was that fighting was a science  the science of getting the opponent out of your face and face down on the ground with the maximum amount of speed and the minimum of effort .  after that  of course  you had a range of delightful possibilities and the leisure in which to consider them .  but if you wanted to fight fair  or at least more fair than most of the other street options  then you had to know how to punch  and what to punch and from precisely which angle to punch it .  of course  his treasured brass knuckles were an optional but helpful extra but  vimes thought as he tried to wring some blood back into his fingers  probably any court  after sight of ten gallons  would have forgiven vimes  even if he used a sledgehammer .   he looked at the brass knuckles .  they hadn   t even bent  good old ankh morpork know how .  the country may have the muscle but the city has got the technology  he thought  as he slipped them back in his pocket .      okay  mister feeney  let   s get them in  shall we .  find stinky  he   s the brains of the outfit .              possibly stinky was the brains of the outfit .  even at the end vimes was never certain just what stinky was .  but the goblins  spurred by his crunchy chattering  ran and leapt like ugly gazelles past vimes and into the boat .  he took one look at the growling death behind them  made the last jump into the boat and helped feeney shut and bolt the doors .  and that meant that now  with the ventilation gone  the bulls in the basement were getting nostrils full of goblin .  it wasn   t  vimes thought  all that bad when you got used to it     more alchemical than midden     but down below there was a lot of shouting and a jerk as the beasts tried to stampede inside their treadmill .   vimes ignored it  despite the shuddering of the boat  and shouted     let go of the barges  chief constable .  i hope you really do know how .      feeney nodded and opened the hatch in the floor .  spray blew in and stopped when he knelt down and stuck his hand into the hole .      takes quite a few turns before they drop  commander .  if i was you i   d be holding on to something when the iron ore goes .      vimes elbowed his way through the terrified goblins  pulled himself with care up into the wheelhouse again  and tapped gastric on the shoulder .     we   re dropping the barges any minute .     the pilot  still clinging to the wheel and squinting into the dark  gave a brief nod  nothing less than a scream would be heard in the wheelhouse now .  the wind and debris had smashed every window .   vimes looked out of the rear window and saw the great  floating  flying desolation of lightning laced wood  mud and tumbling rock closing in .  for a moment he thought he saw a naked marble lady tumbling with the debris and clutching her marble shift as if defending the remains of her modesty from the deluge .  he blinked and she was gone     perhaps he   d imagined it     he shouted     i hope you can swim  sir .     just as the damn slam caught up and the apparition called stratford dived through the window and was fielded neatly by vimes  to stratford   s great surprise .      do you think i   m a baby  mister stratford .  do you think that i don   t think .      stratford squirmed out of vimes   s grip  spun neatly and threw a punch which vimes very nearly dodged .  it was harder than he had expected  and  to give a devil his due  stratford knew how to defend and  perish the thought  was younger than vimes  much younger .  yes  you could tell the eyes of a murderer  at least after they had done more than three or so and got away with it .  their eyes held the expression some gods probably had .  but a killer in the process of trying to kill was always absorbed  constantly calculating  drawing upon some hideous strength .  if you cut their leg off they wouldn   t notice until they fell over .  tricks didn   t work  and the floor was slippery with the debris of half a forest .  as they kicked and punched their way back and forth across the wheelhouse deck  stratford was winning .  when had vimes last eaten  or had a decent drink of water  or slept properly .   and then from below was the cry    barges away .     and the wonderful fanny bucked like a thoroughbred  throwing both of the fighters to the floor  where vimes barely had room to kick and fend off blows .  water poured over them  filling the cabin to waist level  reducing vimes   s stamina to almost nothing .  stratford had his hands around his throat  and vimes   s world turned dark blue and full of chuckling water  banging against his ears .  he tried to think of young sam and sybil  but the water kept washing them away     except that the pressure was suddenly gone  and his body  deciding that his brain had at last gone on holiday  flailed upwards .   and there was stratford  kneeling in water that was falling away very fast  a matter probably of no concern to him now since he was holding his head and screaming  owing to the fact that suddenly there was stinky  spreadeagled on stratford   s head  reaching down and kicking and scratching anything that could be kicked  scratched or  to one lengthy scream  pulled .   his grace the duke of ankh  assisted by sir samuel vimes  with the help of commander vimes  got to his feet  with the last minute assistance of blackboard monitor vimes  and all of them coalesced into one man as he leapt across the shaking deck just too late to stop stratford pulling stinky     and a certain amount of hair     off his head  and throwing him to the streaming deck and stamping on him heavily .  there was no mistaking it .  he   d heard the crack of bones even while airborne  and so what hit stratford was the full force of the law  and its rage .   the street is old and cunning  but the street is always willing to learn and that is why vimes  in mid air  felt his legs unfold and the full majesty of the law hit stratford with the traditionally unstoppable one man he up down very sorry .  even vimes was surprised and wondered if he would be able to do it again .      we   re on the wave .     gastric shouted .     we   re on it  not under it .  we   re surfing all the way to quirm  commander .  there   s light ahead .  glory be .      vimes grunted as he wrapped the last of the rope from his pocket around the stunned stratford  tying him tightly to a stanchion .     sink or swim  you   re going to pay  mister stratford  from heaven  hell or high water  i don   t care which .      and then there was a creaking and a bellowing as the frantic oxen redoubled their attempts to escape the stench of the goblins immediately behind them  a surge skywards and  while it would be most poetic to say that the waters were on the face of the earth  in truth they were mostly on the face of samuel vimes .   vimes woke in damp and utter darkness with sand under his cheek .  some parts of his body reported for duty  others protested that they had a note from their mother .  after a while little insistent clues evolved  there was the sound of surf  the chatter of people and  for some reason  what sounded like the trumpeting of an elephant .   at this point something stuck a finger in one of his nostrils and pulled hard .     upsee daisy  mister po leess maan  otherwise you biggest pancake i ever seen .  upsee daisy .  save goblins .  big hero .  hooray .  everybody get clap .      it was a familiar voice  but it couldn   t have been stinky  because vimes had seen the little goblin completely crushed .  but vimes tried to pull himself up anyway and this was almost impossible because of the stinking fishy smelling debris that covered him like a shroud .  he couldn   t bring his arm around to swat whatever blasted thing it was that was still tugging at his nostril  but he did manage to at least raise himself enough to realize that there was a lot of debris on top of him .   he could make out what seemed like the thump of an elephant   s footfall  and in his state of comfortable hallucination wondered idly what an elephant was doing at the seaside  and how much care said elephant would take to avoid just another load of flotsam .  this thought crystallized just as the tugging at his nose stopped and the cracked voice shouted     rise and shine  mr vimes     cos here come jumbo .      vimes managed the champion press up of all time and sprang clear  dripping driftwood and barnacles  just as a foot the size of a dustbin thumped down where his head had been .      hooray  no flattery for mister vimes .      vimes looked down and saw  about half an inch from the family sized toenail of the elephant  who incidentally now wore an expression of some embarrassment  the figure of stinky bouncing up and down excitedly on the tip of its trunk .  other people had spotted vimes too  and were hurrying towards him  and it was with a terrifying relief that he spotted the distinctive helmets of the quirm city watch  which he had always thought were far too fussy and militaristic for proper coppers  but now viewed as shining beacons of sanity .   an officer with a captain   s helmet said     commander .  are you all right .  everyone thought you   d been washed away .      vimes tried to brush mud and sand off his torn shirt and managed to say     well  the lads back in ankh morpork gave me a bucket and spade for my holiday  so i thought i ought to try it out .  never mind about me  what about the fanny .  what about the people .         all fine  sir  as far as we can tell .  a few bangs and bruises  of course .  it was amazing  sir  the men who look after the elephants at quirm zoo saw it happen .  they take the creatures down to the surf in the morning to have a wash and a bit of a play before the crowds come along  and one said he saw the fanny go right over the top of the dock on the crest of the wave  sir  and it sort of settled down on the beach .  i had a look inside  and i   d say she   ll need a month or so in the boat yard  and the paddle wheels are smashed to blazes  but it   ll be the talk of the river for years .      by now an apologetic zookeeper was steering his charge away from vimes  allowing him to see a beach covered in damp rubbish and  he was surprisingly pleased to note  quite a large number of chickens  scratching busily for worms .  one of them  totally oblivious of vimes  scratched at some seaweed for a moment  hunkered down with a cross eyed expression  gurgled once or twice and then stood up  looking rather relieved .  he saw that it had left an egg on the sand .  at least he supposed it to be an egg .  it was square .  he picked it up and looked down at the chickens  and in his half hallucinating state said     well  that definitely looks complicated to me .      out on the surf the two oxen were standing nearly neck deep in the water  and perhaps it was only his imagination that led vimes to believe that the water around them was steaming .   and now more people were running and chickens were running away  and there was even ten gallons  and mrs sillitoe with her daughter  looking damp  and with blankets around them  but most importantly not looking dead .  vimes  who had been holding his breath for too long  breathed out .  he breathed out even further when ten gallons slapped him on the back  and mrs sillitoe gave him a kiss .     what about gastric .     he said .     and where   s feeney .      mrs sillitoe smiled .     they   re fine  commander vimes  as far we can tell .  they   re a bit battered  but sleeping it off .  no long term problems according to the medic .  i   m sure they   ll be fine  thanks to you .      she stood back as a quirmian officer handed vimes a mug of coffee .  it had sand in it  but never had sandy coffee tasted better .     all sorted out very well  you might say  sir .  we even made sure those damn goblins caught their boat .      never in the field of coffee making had so much of the stuff been sprayed so far and over so many .  vimes stared beyond the surf where  in the distance  a ship had left the port and was making good sail .  he said     fetch me acting captain haddock right now .      acting captain haddock arrived at a run six minutes later and vimes couldn   t help noticing that he had a bit of breakfast around the edge of his mouth .     our relationship with commandant fournier is cordial at the moment  is it not .     said vimes .   haddock grinned widely .     commander  when he gets down here you may have to try hard to stop him kissing you on both cheeks .  mrs sillitoe is his daughter .         was happy to be of assistance     said vimes  looking around absently     and so would you tell these gentlemen that i want a fast boat  one fast enough to catch that ship  and a decent squad of men to crew it  and i want them now  and while i   m waiting i   d like someone to get me a clean shirt and a bacon sandwich     without avec .         they have a pretty swift cutter  commander  for chasing smugglers .         good  and get me a cutlass .  i   ve always wanted to try one .     vimes thought for a moment and added     and make that another two bacon sandwiches .  and a lot more coffee .  and make that one more bacon sandwich .  and  haddock  if you can scavenge a bottle of merkel and stingbat   s very famous old brown sauce  i swear i   ll make you a full sergeant when your term here is up     cos any man who can find a proper down and dirty ankh morpork sauce in quirm  home of five hundred bloody types of mayonnaise  without getting his eye full of spit deserves to be a sergeant in anybody   s force .      and then  as whatever had been holding sam vimes up drained away  he fell gently backwards  dreaming of bacon sandwiches and brown sauce .   even constable haddock or  as he was now  acting captain haddock  would agree that he was not the sharpest knife in the box  but it was amazing  the things you could open with a blunt instrument .  as he hurried away on this prestigious errand he was stopped by one of the quirm officers  who said     hareng .    have you heard of a watchman called petit fou artour .         wee mad arthur .  yes  he   s one of our lads .         well  you had better come quickly  my friend  because he is in our watch house .  strong little fellow  isn   t he .  a few of the other officers had laughed at him  he said  but i believe that they have learned the error of their ways     the hard way  as it happened .  apparently he has been sent to find commandant vimes .      sam vimes awoke from a pig   s nightmare to find himself lying on a pile of sacks in a godown in the docks .  he was carefully lifted to his feet by acting constable haddock and led unsteadily to a crude table behind which was a chef presiding over the sizzling makings of a bacon sandwich  or rather several bacon sandwiches .     he screamed a bit     said haddock     when i insisted on no mayonnaise  but right now you can do no wrong here  commander .  and i have one unopened bottle of merkel and stingbat   s finest  sir  the only one in the city .  i   m afraid  however  that you   ll have to eat on the go  but the chef is packing the sandwiches in a hamper  with hot charcoal to keep them warm .  no time to hang about  sir .  the cutter will leave the dock in ten minutes .      a notebook was pushed under vimes   s nose .     what   s this .         your signature to my promotion to full sergeant  commander     said haddock carefully .     i hope you don   t mind  but you did promise .         good man     said vimes .     always write things down .      haddock looked proud .     i   ve also arranged to have on board a selection of cutlasses for your perusal  commander .      vimes struggled into his new shirt  and as his head appeared he said     i want you to come too  kipper .  you know your way around here better than me .  by the way  what did you do with the prisoner .      haddock said     what prisoner would that be  commander .      and for a moment vimes   s blood froze .     you didn   t find a man tied up anywhere on the fanny .      now haddock looked worried .     no  sir  no one by the time we got there .  the place was a mess  sir .  sorry  sir  we didn   t know .         no reason why you should   ve done .  sorry to shout  but if the quirm police think the sun is shining out of my arse then tell them they should be looking for a youngish looking individual known as stratford .  he   s a double murderer  at least     vicious and by now certainly armed .  tell them they   ll be doing everybody a favour if they keep guard on the boat  on the walking wounded and all the lads in your infirmary  and also they should send a clacks to pseudopolis yard right now to say that commander vimes requires that two members of the watch should hasten via golem horse to ramkin hall to keep guard over lady sybil and young sam .  i don   t want them to hang about  i know those things are bad news to ride  but stratford is a nut job     they must hurry .         excuse me  commander     said one of the quirm officers     we all speak pretty good morporkian here .  everybody here speaks morporkian .  if you hear us speaking quirmian it   s because we want to talk about you behind your back .  we salute you  commander vimes  we will send your clacks and search everywhere for your murderer and take great care of the wounded .  now  please hurry down to the dock .  the queen of quirm is pretty ancient  only one step away from being a hulk .  our cutter should catch up with it in a few hours .  shall we go .         come on  sir     said haddock     and wee mad arthur will brief you on the way .         wee mad arthur .         yes  commander .  apparently he got sent to foreign parts to do with this goblin business  flew back to ankh morpork and then got sent straight here to you .  he   s got a story to tell you and no mistake .         where is he .     said vimes .      they should be releasing him from custody right now  sir .  a laughable misunderstanding  no real harm done  all will be forgiven and all will probably heal  i   m sure .      vimes was wise enough to leave it at that .   of course  the seasickness didn   t help  but that didn   t begin to cut in until afterwards  when wee mad arthur had finished his breathless account .     and what did you find in the huts .     said vimes .      more goblins  sir  all shapes and sizes  little ones too .  most of them dead  the rest in a very bad way  in my opinion .  i did what i could for them  such as it was .  to tell ye the truth  sir  i think they were bewildered about everything  the poor wee devils  but there   s grub and water there of a sort and i don   t reckon those guards are going to move in a hurry  ye ken .     he made a face and added     really weird  those goblins .  i let them out and they just milled around  not knowing what the hell to do .  i mean  crivens  if it were me i   d be out of there like a shot and give those scunners a right good kicking in the fork while they was lying down .  as for the men  well  i kenned this was urgent and i could always fly back tomorrow and pour some water on them at least  but i thought the watch should know and so made haste back to ankh morpork and they told me where you   d gone on holiday  and lady sybil said you   d gone down that mucky old river  so all i had to do was fly down until i got to quirm and when i found a big awful terrible mess i kenned that was something to do with you  commander .      wee mad arthur hesitated .  he was never quite sure what vimes thought of him  given that the man considered feegles in general a nuisance .  when vimes was slow to reply  he asked     i hope i did what ye would have done  commander .      vimes looked at wee mad arthur as if he was seeing him for the first time .     no  constable  you did not do what i would have done  which is fortunate  because if you had  then you would be in front of me on a charge for using brutally excessive force in the execution of your duties .  however  you will get a medal and an official commendation for this  constable .  right now we   re chasing another ship that   s taking more goblins to that wretched place .  and although i imagine you must be very tired  i expect you   d like to come along for the ride .  incidentally  may i congratulate you personally  constable  for someone raised as a gnome you really have got the hang of the whole feegle business  haven   t you .  you beat up a dozen armed men single handed .         oh aye  sir     said wee mad arthur slyly     but it was nae fair  i had them outnumbered .  och  and by the way in some of them sheds there was all kinds of like alchemy stuff .  didn   t ken what it was  but ye might find it o    interest .         well spotted     said vimes .     why don   t you go down below and get a rest .         aye  i will sir  but as soon as i can i have to run an errand regarding sergeant colon  who is in a verra bad way indeed .     he looked at vimes   s blank expression and continued .     did ye nae know .  he got some goblin geegaw given tae him and it   s put some kind of fluence on him quite cruel  and he   s a screaming and a shouting and making oot like a goblin all day long according to sergeant littlebottom .  she   s moved him into the sanatorium .         sergeant colon .         aye  sir .  and according to captain angua we have to find a goblin cave to break the fluence  ye ken .  sounds a wee bitty weird to me  but half the watch is oot searching the place for goblins and they cannae find even one o    the poor wee beings  being as the wee beasties is hardly going tae advertise these days  if you are getting my meaning .     once again wee mad arthur looked at vimes .      sergeant colon .         that   s what i told you  sir .      the blood came back to vimes   s face as rational thought came back to his brain .     can he travel .     wee mad arthur shrugged .  ahead of them the queen of quirm seemed a little closer .     then if you please  constable  can you go back to the clacks at the quirm watch house and tell them to put fred on a coach to ramkin hall as soon as possible  okay .     he added     best if cheery comes with him  i should think .     and in his head he added  fred colon .  he hates anything non human  on the quiet .  and for now he left it at that  given what lay ahead  but thought  fred colon .  i wonder what kind of pots he would make .   behind him  wee mad arthur whistled a strange note and a seagull trailing the cutter in the vague hope of a free meal of fish entrails found a weight on its back and a voice in its ear saying     hello  beastie  my name is wee mad arthur .      vimes liked to have his feet on something solid  such as his boots  and he liked his boots to do likewise .  the sail of the queen of quirm now clearly visible  the cutter left the safety of the harbour and hit what is generally known as a moderate swell .  and commander vimes  the duke of ankh morpork  sir samuel vimes and  not least  blackboard monitor vimes  was definitely going to eat his bacon sandwiches and not throw up in front of other watchmen .   and he didn   t  and didn   t know how  although he did at one point think he detected  high in the rigging  the shape of a small goblin grinning down at him .  he put it down to the bacon sandwiches  which were valiantly trying to come back up  just as he valiantly kept them down .   stratford would have got on to that damn hulk  he was sure of it .  damn sure of it .  he would want paying  for one thing  and he wouldn   t want hanging .  vimes hesitated .  how sure of it should he be .  how much was he prepared to gamble on a hunch .  it was stratford after all .  he was smart and nasty  so you covered every angle  even though you knew that a smart man in a hurry could find a new angle for himself .   and so all the people who made up sam vimes walked backwards and forwards across the poop deck  or the scuppers or the starboard or whatever the damn slippery rocking wood he was standing on was called  veering between hope  nausea  despair  self doubt  nausea and the thrill of the chase and nausea  while the cutter seemed to hit the hard bits of every wave as it plunged onwards after the queen of quirm and justice .   the lieutenant came up to him and saluted  quite smartly  and said     commander  you have asked us to pursue the ship because it is carrying goblins  but i know of no law against taking goblins anywhere .         there ought to be a law  because there certainly is a crime  do you understand .     said vimes .  he patted the lieutenant on the shoulder and continued     congratulations .  this cutter of yours is actually travelling faster than the law .  lieutenant  the law will catch up .  goblins can speak  they have a society and i   ve heard one of them play music that would make a bronze statue burst into tears .  the process of modern policing is such that i   m certain that these have been taken from their home  and the ship that we   re following is taking them somewhere where they don   t want to go .  look  if you   re queasy about it  just help me get on that ship and i   ll sort things out by myself  okay .  and  besides  i believe our murderer could be on the boat as well .  but  it   s up to you  lieutenant .      vimes nodded towards the prow and added     we   re so close i can see the faces of their crew .  maybe you should tell me your intentions  lieutenant .      he felt a little sorry for the lad  but not too much .  he had taken the job  he had accepted the promotion and the money that went with it  hadn   t he .  any copper worth his truncheon would at least take a look at the queen now they   d come this far  wouldn   t they .      very well  commander     said the lieutenant .     i   m not sure of my bearings  but we will hail the queen and ask permission to come aboard .         no .  you don   t ask .  you tell them to stand by to be inspected by the police .  and if you   re not concerned about the goblins  then it is a fact that i am in pursuit of a murderer     vimes added .     the capital crime     one that we can   t ignore .      in fact  he could see the queen was already heaving two .    it was even hoisting a white flag  much to his surprise .   and her captain was waiting for them as the cutter drew alongside .  he had a look of resignation on his face  and said     we won   t make any trouble  officers .  i know it was a bloody stupid thing to do .  we   ve got the man you   re looking for  and we   re bringing him up now .  it   s not like we   re pirates  after all .  good morning  lieutenant perdix  sorry to put you to any trouble .      vimes turned to the lieutenant .     you know the captain .         oh yes  commander  captain murderer is well respected on this coast     said the lieutenant as the cutter gently kissed the queen .     smuggles  of course  they all do it .  it   s a sort of game .         but captain     murderer .     said vimes .   the lieutenant scrambled on to the queen   s deck with ease and gave vimes a hand up  saying     the murderers are a highly respected family in these parts .  to tell you the truth  commander  i think they rather like the name .  they   d object more to smuggler  i suspect .         we   re bringing the bloke up right now  lieutenant     said the captain     and he ain   t very happy .      vimes looked him up and down and said     i   m commander vimes  ankh morpork city watch  currently investigating at least two murders .      captain murderer   s eyes shut  and he put a hand over his mouth for a moment before saying  in a voice weeping with forlorn hope     that wouldn   t be that commander vimes  would it .         captain     murderer     produce for me the man i   m after  then i   m sure you   ll find me on a friendly footing .  do you get my meaning .      there was some shouting and thumping down below and several suggestions that somebody was getting kicked very hard .  eventually a man with a cloth tied round his face as a blindfold was half pushed and half dragged up on to the deck .     to tell you the truth i   ll be glad to see the back of him     said the captain  turning away .   vimes made sure the man was held fast by the sailors  and pulled down the mask .  he looked into bloodshot eyes for a moment and then  very calmly  said     lieutenant  will you please impound the queen of quirm and arrest the captain and first mate on a charge of kidnapping and possibly abduction of a number of persons  specifically mr jethro jefferson  also goblins to the number of fifty or more .  there may be other charges .         you can   t abduct goblins     said captain murderer .     goblins is cargo .      vimes let this one pass for the moment .  captain murderer would be orientated to the world as seen by commander vimes at commander vimes   s leisure .  for now he said to the lieutenant     i also suggest that you lock up the captain and first mate in the brig  if that is what it   s called  because when mister jefferson here has got his hands free i think he   s going to try to punch somebody   s lights out .  i   m sure this can all be sorted out  but someone   s going to suffer for this and it   s just a matter of deciding who it   s going to be .      he thought for a moment and then countermanded     no  i think that first i   ll talk to the captain  in the captain   s quarters .  kipper  i   d like you to come and take notes .  lots of notes .  good to see you  mister jefferson .  lieutenant  to the best of my knowledge mister jefferson is guilty of no crime other than being in possession of a hot temper .  but although he   s a man i   m very glad to find  he   s not the bastard i   m currently looking for .      it was  acting captain haddock thought  a good thing that he had a decent amount of room in his notebook         captain murderer  let me recap     said sam vimes after a while  idly swivelling in the captain   s chair  it squeaked .     some men unknown to you  but whom you decided to treat with respect because they had the right password  which is to say the password you used in your dealings with smugglers  with whom you have developed what i might call an understanding  delivered to you a man  bound and gagged  and told you to take said man to howondaland to  and i quote     cool his heels for a little while     and you have also told me that these men said to you that this was okay by the law .      the swivel chair under vimes squeaked once or twice as he twisted for dramatic effect  and he went on     captain murderer  i represent the law in ankh morpork  and you may be aware that a number of influential politicians throughout the world trust my judgement  and  captain murderer  i know of no law that makes kidnapping legal  but i   ll ask my colleague and an expert on quirm law whether he knows of any local edict that makes it legal to tie up somebody who has committed no crime and drag him on to a boat and send him to a questionable distant location against his will .      the swivel chair only had one chance to squeak again before lieutenant perdix said  ponderously     commander vimes  i know of no such change in the law  and therefore  captain murderer  i arrest you     and here the lieutenant placed a hand on the stricken captain   s shoulder     on a charge of kidnapping  aiding and abetting kidnapping  actual and possibly grievous bodily harm  and other charges that may arise in the course of our continued investigations .  in the meantime  upon its return to port  the queen of quirm is impounded and will  you may be sure  be inspected down to its gunwales .      vimes swivelled the chair again until his face was not visible to the downcast captain but could be clearly seen by the lieutenant  then winked at him and got a little nod in response .  he rotated the chair again and said     depriving an innocent man of his liberty even for a week  captain  is a very serious crime .  however  the lieutenant has told me that you are well thought of on this coast and in general are considered to be a model citizen .  personally  i don   t like a world in which small men who act out of fear  or even out of a misguided deference  get thrown into prison while big men  the instigators if not the perpetrators of crime  get off totally free .  i expect you don   t like that world either  eh .      captain murderer stared down at his sea boots as if he was expecting them to explode or perhaps break into song .  he managed to mutter     you   re right there  commander .         thank you  captain .  you   re a man of the world .  right now you need a friend  and i need names .  i need the names of the people who got you into this mess .  now  mister jefferson the blacksmith has told me that in all conscience he cannot say that he was particularly badly treated once he was in your illegal hospitality .  apparently he was reasonably well fed  given beer and a daily tot of rum and even provided with a number of back issues of the magazine girls  giggles and garters to while away his time .  he also wants names  captain murderer  and it may just be that if we had those names  all put down legally in an affidavit  he might just be persuaded to forget his imprisonment in exchange for a certain sum of money  to be negotiated  and a chance to go hand to hand  fair and square  no holds barred  with your first mate  whom he describes as a    bag of shite     a nautical term which i don   t pretend to understand .  apparently said man took pleasure in thumping him when he objected to his imprisonment  and mister jefferson would like  as it were  to settle the score .      vimes stood up and stretched his arms as if taking the cramp out of them .     of course  captain  this is all very irregular  especially since we have here our lieutenant  a decent  clean and upstanding young officer  but i suspect that if he brought the queen into dock and you in front of the authorities on a smuggling charge he might consider honour to be satisfied .  it would be a bit of a knock for you  but not one half as bad as being an accessory to kidnapping .  don   t you agree .     vimes went on  cheerfully     the lieutenant here will have got a feather in his chapeau and may put in a bon mot on your behalf  i suspect  what with you being an otherwise upstanding and  above all  helpful citizen .      vimes winked at lieutenant perdix .     i   m teaching this young man bad habits  captain  and so i suggest that you treat him as a friend  especially if at any time in the future he asks you any innocent questions to do with shipping movements and merchandise and other such concerns .  it   s up to you  captain murderer .  i think you know names  the names at least of the men you deal with  and also the name of their employer .  you want to tell me anything .      the boots shuffled .     look  commander  i don   t want to become enemies with powerful men  if you know what i mean .      vimes nodded  and leaned forward so that he could look the man in the eyes .     of course  i quite understand that  captain     he said quietly     and that is why you should give me the names .  the names  captain .  the names .  because  captain murderer  i understand you do not wish to upset influential men  and right now i have half a mind to have your ship impounded and destroyed because you were trafficking in living  breathing  intelligent  creative if somewhat grubby sapient creatures .  strictly speaking  i would get into trouble for authorizing this  but who knows .  the world can change quite quickly  and it   s changing quickly for you .     he slapped the captain on the back .     captain murderer  here and now i   d like you to think of me as a friend .      and vimes listened and the red balls bounced across the baize  cannoning off the coloured balls  and the law was being broken wholesale for the purpose of upholding the law .  how could you explain that to a layman .  how could you explain it to a lawyer .  how could he explain it to himself .  but it was all happening fast and you got on top of it or perished .  so you did your best and faced such music as anyone cared to play .   the queen of quirm docked that day  two and a half months earlier than expected  to the dismay  distress or possibly even delight of the wives of the crew .  the harbourmaster made a note of this  and also was intrigued by the fact that most of the crew after disembarkation immediately wandered along past the other ships in port to a quiet area of beach close to the repair yard where the somewhat battered wonderful fanny was already being pulled up the slipway .   walking alongside his boat  like a mother hen with one enormous chick  was captain sillitoe  nursing a plaster cast on his arm  he brightened up when he saw vimes .     well  sir  i have to hand it to you  by my halibut  so i must .  you played a man   s job in getting us safely home  sir .  i won   t forget it  and nor will my wife and daughter .      vimes looked up at the boat and hoped for the best .     she looks extremely battered to me  captain     i mean the boat  not your wife  of course .      but it appeared that the captain was determined on optimism .     we lost much of the gearing for the paddle wheels  but truth to tell she was long overdue for refit in any case .  but  my dear commander  we rode a damn slam  with all souls safe .  and  moreover   what the seven hells are they doing .      vimes had already heard the shrill notes of a flute  but he had to look down to see  marching resolutely across the beach  a large number of goblins .  at their head  and for the moment appearing bright blue  was stinky  playing an old and empty crab leg .  as he passed vimes he stopped playing long enough to say     no seaside rock for goblins .  hooray .  home again  home again  as fast as they can .  and them above as watches  they applaud .  and them what tries to stop  oh yes  constable stinky and his little chums  he find stinky will be worst nightmare .      vimes laughed .     what .  what do you mean .  a goblin with a badge .     he had to walk fast as he said that  because stinky was understandably dead set on getting the goblins out of there as soon as possible .      stinky don   t need no badges  fellow po leess maan .  stinky worst nightmare all by himself .  remember a little boy .  little boy open book .  and he see evil goblin  and i see nasty little boy .  good for us  little boy  that we were both right .      vimes watched them march away  speeding up until they reached the undergrowth at the edge of the dockyard  where they disappeared  and for a moment it occurred to vimes that even if he rushed forward and fished around for any trace of goblin he would not find one .  he was bewildered .  this didn   t matter very much  bewilderment was often a copper   s lot .  his job was to make sense of the world  and there were times when he wished that the world would meet him halfway .      are you feeling all right  commander .      vimes turned and looked at the serious face of lieutenant perdix .     well  i   m not certain when i last slept properly  but at least i can stay standing up .  and i have all the names and descriptions .     three names  and one  oh  what a name that was  that is if you trusted the word of someone happy to be called captain murderer .  well  the man was in his fifties  not a good age to have to run and hide .  no  murderer was not going to be a problem .  nor was jefferson  idiot firebrand though he was .  what jefferson had suspected  captain murderer knew .  but vimes  on the other hand  hadn   t demanded the chance to take a crack at the queen   s first mate  admittedly an unpleasant looking cove with a chin like a butcher   s boot .  he was swaggering towards them now  with the apprehensive captain murderer fussing along behind him .   vimes strolled up to the blacksmith .     come on  sir  murderer will pay you whatever it takes to keep the lieutenant happy  and keep his own boat .  chalk it up to experience  eh .         there   s still that bloody first mate     said the blacksmith .     the rest of the crew were civil enough but he   s a bullying bastard .         well     said vimes     here he is and so are you .  it   s man to man  and i   ll stay here to see fair play .  it   s an interesting day here .  we   re trying a different kind of law  one that   s quick and doesn   t have to trouble any lawyers .  so go on  he knows what you want  and so do you  mister jefferson .      other crewmen were congregating at this end of the beach .  vimes looked from face to face  all showing the working man   s intuition that a good bit of healthy violence might cheerfully be expected  and read the unspoken language .  the first mate did look like a man who made a lot of use of his fists and his temper  and so  vimes thought  there would probably be many among the crew who would like to see him given a little lesson     or even a great big one .  he beckoned both the men towards him .      gentlemen  this is a grudge match  you both know the score .  if i see a knife may the gods help him who holds it .  there is to be no murder here  saving you of course  captain  and in front of you all i give my word that i   ll stop the fight when i deem that one man has definitely had enough .  gentlemen  over to you .     and with this he stood back smartly .   neither man moved  but jefferson said     do you know the marquis of fantailer rules devised for the proper conduct for a bout of fisticuffs .      the first mate   s smile was evil .  he said     yus  i do .      vimes didn   t see  not actually see with his own eyes  what happened next  surely no one could  but it was agreed later that jefferson had spun around in a blur and laid the sailor flat .  the sound of his heavy body thumping down on the sand was all that broke the silence .   after one second  jefferson  massaging some blood back into his fist  looked down at the fallen giant and said     i don   t .     he turned and looked at vimes .     you know .  he deliberately pissed on the goblins in the hold .  bastard .      vimes tensed in case the fallen man had chums without a sense of humour  but in fact there was laughter .  after all  a big man had gone down heavy right enough  bang to rights  and that was a definite result in anybody   s money .     well done  mister jefferson  a fair fight if ever i saw one .  perhaps these gentlemen will take the first mate back to his ship for a lie down .      vimes delivered this as an instruction  which was instantly obeyed as one  but he added     if that   s all right by you  captain murderer .  good .  and now i think that you and i   ll go  in an entirely friendly way  along with the lieutenant here  to the quirm watch headquarters  where there will be a little matter of affidavits to sign .         i expect you will want to be leaving with some haste  commander     said the lieutenant as they strolled along the rue de wakening .      well  yes     said vimes .     i   m supposed to be on holiday .  i   ll pick up young feeney from the infirmary and find some way of getting back to the hall .      the lieutenant looked surprised .     and you don   t want to get back on the heels of the murderer as soon as possible  sir .         him .  i   ll see him soon enough  i have no doubt about that  but  you see  even he is not exactly the end of things .  do you play snooker down here .         well  i haven   t learned to play  but i understand the game  if that   s what you   re asking .         then you   ll know that the ultimate aim of the game is to sink the black  although you   ll hit all the other colours during the course of a frame  and you   ll bash the red ones again and again  sometimes making use of them to further your strategy .  well  i know where to find the black  and black can   t run .  the others .  the captain has helpfully given us names and descriptions .  if you wish to arrest them yourselves  for aiding and abetting the practice of trafficking sapient creatures for profit  then i leave that honour to the quirm constabulary .      he grinned .     as for me  after i have the affidavits i intend to go straight back to see my wife and little boy  who i have shamefully  no  desperately neglected over the past few days  and do you know what .  just as soon as i   ve got there  i   m going to bring them back down here .  my wife will enjoy the fresh air  and young sam will just love the elephants  oh  won   t he just .      the lieutenant brightened up .     may i suggest  then  that after dinner you take the overnight boat .  it will be the black eyed susan  quite speedy  like her namesake  according to popular legend .  she   s due to go upriver in  let me see  three quarters of an hour .  she   s very fast  doesn   t take much in the way of cargo so they gear her up high .  you   ll be home in the morning  how about that .  just time to get yourself smartened up  and if you like the idea then i will get one of the men to go and find the susan   s captain and make certain she doesn   t leave without you .      vimes smiled .     what   s the weather forecast .         clear skies  commander  and old treachery is as flat as a mill pond  scoured of every snag and boulder for the rest of the season .  it   s plain sailing from now on .         good evening  your grace .     the voice was somewhat familiar and vimes saw  sauntering down the boulevard  what at first seemed liked a man wearing a huge cummerbund until further swift forensic inspection showed that it was the hermit from the hall .  his beard was remarkably clean and wrapped around his body  as were two young ladies of the giggling persuasion .   vimes peered at him .     stump .  what are you doing down here .      this caused further giggling .      i   m on holiday  commander .  yes  indeed .  every man should have a holiday  sir .      vimes didn   t know what to say and so patted the man on the shoulder and said     knock yourself out  mister stump  and don   t forget the nourishing herbs .         i think i   m going to need them  commander         say what you like  the food in the quirm watch house canteen was pretty damn good  even if they did use a shade too much avec  thought vimes  avec on everything .   vimes  well fed and cleaned up and with some very important paperwork stuffed down the inside of his freshly laundered and immaculately ironed shirt  walked with chief constable upshot down the quayside towards the black eyed susan .  the lieutenant and two of the guards accompanied him to his cabin  where the dwarf butler demonstrated to him the cleanliness of the bed and the crispness of the sheets .      honoured to have you sleeping in them  commander .  you will find that the susan gives a very smooth ride  although she can sometimes bounce around a little  very much like her namesake  but least said  soonest mended .  and  of course  there is a berth next door for officer feeney .  you gentlemen might like to see the susan get under way  perhaps .      they did .  the susan had two oxen  just like the wonderful fanny  but with no heavy cargo and only about ten passengers she was the express of old treachery .  her paddle wheels  highly geared indeed  left a line of white water all down the valley behind her .      what happens now  commander .     said feeney  leaning on the rail as they watched quirm disappearing in the wake behind them .     i mean  what are we going to do next .      vimes was smoking a cigar with great pleasure .  somehow this seemed the time and the place .  snuff was all very well  but a good cigar had time and wisdom and personality .  he would be unhappy to see this one go .      i don   t need to do anything now     he said  turning to look at the sunset .  and i don   t often see sunsets these days either  he thought .  mostly i see midnights  and i don   t need to chase stratford  either .  i know him like i know myself .  he mentally paused  momentarily shocked at the implication .   aloud he continued     you saw those two quirmian officers get on the boat  didn   t you .  i arranged that .  they will  of course  make certain that we have an undisturbed voyage .  the crew have also been told that there may be some attempt by a murderer to board the boat .  according to the lieutenant  captain harbinger can vouch for all of his crew as having sailed with him loyally for many years .  personally  of course  i   ll make certain the door to my berth is locked  and i   d suggest you do the same thing  feeney .      greed is at the centre of this  greed and hellish poisons .  they   re both killers and greed is the worst  by a long way .  you know  usually when i   m talking to young officers such as yourself i say that in a certain type of case  you should always follow the money  you should ask     who stands to lose .  who stands to gain .        vimes regretfully tossed the butt of his cigar into the water .     but sometimes you should follow the arrogance     you should look for those who can   t believe that the law would ever catch them  who believe that they act out of a right that the rest of us do not have .  the job of the officer of the law is to let them know that they are wrong .      the sun was setting .     i do believe  commander vimes  that you have something in you that would turn the wheels of this boat all by itself if a man could but harness it .     said feeney admiringly .     and i remember reading somewhere that you would arrest the gods for doing it wrong .      vimes shook his head .     i   m sure i never said anything of the sort .  but law is order and order is law and it must be the highest thing .  the world runs on it  the heavens run on it and without order  lad  one second cannot follow another .      he could feel himself swaying .  lack of sleep can poison the mind  drive it in strange directions .  vimes felt feeney   s hand on his shoulder .     i   ll help you along to your cabin  commander .  it   s been a very long day .      vimes didn   t remember getting undressed and into bed  or rather into bunk  but he clearly had done so and  according to the little bits of white foam on the cabin   s tiny washbasin  he had cleaned his teeth as well .  he had slept the sleep of the dead except for the bit where bits fall off and you crumble into dust  and all he could recall was cool blackness and  rising now to the surface  a certainty  as if a message had been left in the blackness to await the return of thought .  he is after you  blackboard monitor vimes .  you know this because you recognize what was in his eyes .  you know that type .  they want to die from the day they are born  but something twists and so they kill instead .  he will find you  and so will i .  i hope the three of us meet in darkness .   as the message drained away vimes stared at the opposite wall  in which the door now opened  after a cursory knock  to reveal the steward bearing that which is guaranteed to frighten away all nightmares  to wit  a cup of hot tea .        no need to get up  commander     came the cheerful greeting of the steward  as he carefully placed the cup of tea in a little indentation that some foresighted person had designed into the tiny cabin so that said teacup would not slide around .     the captain would like to inform you that we   ll be docking in about twenty minutes  although of course you   ll be welcome to stay aboard and finish your breakfast while we clean the scuppers and take on fresh oxen and  of course  pick up mail and fodder and a few more passengers .  in the galley  i have today        and here the steward enthusiastically rattled off a menu of belly stuffing proportions  concluding triumphantly with    a bacon sandwich .      vimes cleared his throat and said gloomily     i don   t suppose you have any muesli  do you .     after all  sybil was only twenty minutes away .   the steward looked puzzled .     well  yes  we would have the ingredients  of course  but i didn   t peg you as a rabbit food man .      vimes thought about sybil again .     well  perhaps today my little nose is twitching .      luxurious though the cabin was  roomy it was not .  vimes managed to shave with a razor donated by the steward     with the compliments of the captain  commander     and a thoughtfully placed basin  soap  flannel and minute towel  which at least helped him to deal with the form of ablution his old mother had called    washing the bits that showed    .  he paid attention to them  nevertheless  taking some pains in the knowledge that this little wooden world would evaporate very soon and he would be back in the world of sam vimes  husband and father .  periodically  however  as he made himself respectable  he turned back to himself in the shaving mirror and said     fred colon .      the luxury cabin had turned out to be wonderful to sleep in  although so small that in reality it would only be suitable for a fastidious corpse .  but eventually  when every part of vimes he could reach had been decently  if erratically  scrubbed and the steward had brought him a hermit sized portion of fruits and nuts and grains  he looked around to see what he might have left behind and saw a face in the shaving mirror .  it was his own  although it must be said the phenomenon is not unusual in shaving mirrors .  the vimes in the mirror said     you know he doesn   t just want to kill you .  that wouldn   t be good enough for a bastard like that  not by a long way .  he wants to destroy you and will try everything until he does .         i know     said vimes  and added     you   re not a demon  are you .         absolutely not     said his mirror image .     i might be made up of your subconscious mind and a momentary case of muesli poisoning occasioned by a fermenting raisin .  watch where you walk  commander .  watch everywhere .     and then it was gone .   vimes stepped away from the mirror and turned around slowly .  it must have been my face  he said to himself  otherwise it would have been the other way round  wouldn   t it .   he walked down the gangway into reality and what turned out to be corporal nobby nobbs  beyond whom reality does not get much more real .      good to see you  mister vimes .  my word  you   re looking fit .  your holiday must be doing you a lot of good .  got any bags .     this was asked in the absolute certainty that vimes would have no bags  but a show of willing is always worth a try .      is everything all right .     said vimes  ignoring this .   nobby scratched his nose and a bit fell off .  oh yes  thought vimes  i   m back  all right .      well  the usual stuff that happens is happening  but we   re on top of it .  could i draw your attention to the hill over there .  they were very careful not to harm the trees  and lady sybil herself promised a lingering death to anyone who upset the goblins .      mystified  vimes scanned the skyline and saw hangman   s hill .     hells    bells .  it   s a clacks tower  it   s a bloody clacks tower .  sybil will go totally librarian about it .         as a matter of fact  mister vimes  lady sybil was all for it by the time she   d read all of captain carrot   s note .  he said this was no time for you to be out of touch .  you know that  sir  very persuasive officer  which is how come he got the clacks company to rush up here toot sweet with a temporary tower .  worked all night  so they did  and got it lined up on the grand trunk sweet as a nut .      this time nobby picked his nose  briefly inspected the contents for interest or value  then flicked them away and went on     only one thing  sir  the ankh morpork times wants to interview you about how you are a great hero what saved someone   s wonderful fanny        there was a pause while they waited for feeney to stop choking with laughter and get his breath back and then vimes said     corporal nobby nobbs  this here is chief constable upshot .  i call him chief constable because he   s the only law in these parts  that is until now .  this is his patch  and so you will respect it  okay .  who else came with you from the smoke .         sergeant detritus  mister vimes  but he   s up at the hall  guarding her ladyship and young sam with delicate surreptition .      a part of vimes had unknowingly been holding its breath .  detritus and willikins .  together they could face an army .  he shook himself .     but not fred colon .         no  mister vimes  as i understand it we were on our way when the second clacks came through  but i reckon that he   ll be here pretty soon .         gentlemen  i   m going home     said vimes     but  mister feeney  how soon will another boat go down to quirm .      feeney beamed .     you   re in luck  commander .  the roberta e .  biscuit will be going tomorrow morning .  just the job for what i think you might want .  big and slow  but you won   t mind that  because there   s gambling and entertainment .  lots of tourists on it  but don   t you worry  sir  your name is big on the river already .  trust me .  say the word and the captain of the biscuit will make certain that there   s a king size  i mean  sorry  commander size stateroom for you  how about that .      vimes opened his mouth to ask  is it expensive .  and shut it again with the embarrassed realization that the ramkin fortune could almost certainly buy every vessel on old treachery .   feeney  like the good copper he was becoming  noticed that slight moment of hesitation and said     your money won   t be good on the river  commander  believe me .  the saviour of the fanny won   t have to buy his own cigars or a stateroom anywhere along old treachery .      nobby nobbs was almost bent double with laughter and managed to choke out     the fanny .      vimes sighed .     nobby  her name was francesca  fanny for short .  understand .     it didn   t work with some people  it only just did with vimes .     and  nobby  i want you to wait here  and as soon as fred   s coach arrives you   re in charge of getting him up to the goblin cave on the hill  okay .         yes  mister vimes     said nobby  looking at his boots .      and  nobby  if you see a goblin who stinks like a latrine and glows slightly blue  well  that   s a fellow copper and don   t you forget it .      sybil was halfway down the lane as vimes quickly walked up it  and young sam was running ahead and cannoned into his father   s legs  throwing his arms around them as best he could .      dad .  i know how to milk a goat  dad .  you have to pull its tits  dad  they   re all wiggly .     vimes   s expression did not change as young sam went on .     and i   m learning to make cheese .  and i have some badger poo now  and some weasel poo  too .         my word  you have been busy     said vimes .     who told you the word    tits     lad .      young sam beamed .     that was willy the cowherd  dad .      vimes nodded .     i   ll have a little talk to you about that later  sam  but first i think i   ll have a word with willy the cowherd .     he lifted up young sam  ignoring a twinge in his back .     i hope that washing your hands played a part in these adventures .         i take care of that     said lady sybil  catching up .     honestly  sam  i let you out of my sight for hardly any time at all and here you are a hero  again .  really .  honestly  the whole river is talking about it .  fights on a riverboat .  maritime chases .  oh dear me  i don   t know where to put my face  so if you would be so kind as to let our child down carefully i   ll press said face mightily to yours .      when vimes surfaced for breath he growled     it is a real bloody clacks tower  isn   t it  yes .  and now the times have got hold of all this they   ll make out i   m some kind of hero  the damn fools .      with the suction released  lady sybil said     no  sam     well maybe a little of that  but you would be amazed at how fast news travels along the river .  apparently you were standing on the wheelhouse roof of the wonderful fanny fighting with a murderer  and he shot a crossbow at you and it bounced off .  i   m told there   s going to be a large artist   s impression in tomorrow   s paper .  once again  i won   t know where to put my face .     and then sybil couldn   t contain herself any more and burst out laughing .     frankly  sam  you may have anything you want for dinner tonight .      vimes leaned over and whispered  causing his wife to slap his hand and say     later  perhaps .      at this point  somewhat emboldened  vimes said     i couldn   t help noticing that the bridge is severely damaged .      sybil nodded .     oh  yes dear  a terrible storm  wasn   t it .  it took away the entire central arch and all of the three disgraces .    i remember them from my childhood .  my mother used to put her hand over my eyes when we crossed the bridge and so i took a keen interest in them  especially as one was scratching her bottom .     her smile brightened .     but don   t worry  sam  naked ladies are not difficult to come by .      vimes took comfort from her smile  and a tiny treacherous suspicion bubbled up once more .  he thought he had stamped it down  but the damn thing kept coming back .  and so he cleared his throat and said     sybil  you did discuss plans for my holiday with vetinari  didn   t you .      sybil looked surprised .     why yes  dear  of course .  after all  he is technically your superior .  only technically  of course .  i had a word with him on the subject at some charity do or other .  i can   t remember which right now as there   re always so many .  but there wasn   t any difficulty .  he said that it was high time you took a decent rest from your valiant activities .      vimes was wise enough not to utter the words that entered his mouth  and instead said  carefully     er  so he didn   t actually suggest that you came down to the shires .         to be honest  sam  it was quite some time ago  but we both have your best interests at heart  as you surely know .  we generally discussed the matter and that   s it  really .      vimes left it at that .  he would never know for sure .  and anyway  the ball had dropped .   later  samuel vimes  all of him  had a bath in the huge bathroom with his nose only just above the surface and came out feeling exactly the same man as before but at least a lot cleaner .  the affidavits were in the strongroom  and when the ramkins design a strongroom  it   s not a room that you   ll get into in a hurry  first you needed a combination  which opened a smaller but nevertheless dangerously efficient safe  simply to remove a key which then had to be inserted in locks hidden in three separate clocks in the hall and each key triggered a clockwork timing mechanism .  sybil told him that she had fond memories of her grandfather running splitarse  as the old man called it  down the main hall to get the key into the last lock before the clock controlling the first lock had run down and certainly before the guillotines dropped .  what we have we keep  vimes had thought as he tried it out .  well  they definitely meant it .  now  he dressed in clothes that didn   t smell of fish .  what next .   it was nice to have a walk with young sam again .  dad self consciously out for a walk with his lad  yes .  that was the picture .  regrettably  this picture included a distant prospect of sergeant detritus  who was merging with the landscape  a feat that a troll officer can achieve by simply removing his armour and sticking a geranium behind his ear  whereupon he becomes  being of a rocky and stony persuasion  pretty much part of the landscape without even trying .  usually the troll officers wore super sized versions of the standard issue armour  because a lot of the power of a copper consists in looking like a copper .    safety considerations didn   t matter  there were plenty of weapons which  if handled with skill  could go through steel armour  but all they would do to a naked troll was make him angry .   right now detritus was failing to maintain a low profile .  he was a bodyguard  that was the truth of it  and he was also carrying his piecemaker which could  as it were  do what it said on the box .  some weapons are called a saturday night special  detritus   s multi arrow crossbow would last you all week .  and somewhere  where vimes couldn   t see him  which meant that nobody else could either  there was willikins .  there was your picture  dad taking his lad for a walk in the presence of enough firepower to kill a platoon .  sybil had insisted  and that was that .  vimes himself being in danger was one thing  and sybil had accepted that right from the start  but young sam .  never .   as they strolled up hangman   s hill to see the new clacks tower  vimes told himself that stratford would not use a bow .  a bow was for expediency  but a killer     now a killer would want to be up close  where he could see .  stratford had killed the goblin girl and had gone on killing her long after she was dead .  he was a boy who liked his fun .  he would want vimes to know who was killing him .  vimes  vimes realized  knew killers too well for his own peace of mind .   as they arrived on the hill they were met by a grinning nobby  who saluted with a variation on the theme of smartness  but with some embarrassment  because he was not alone .  a young goblin woman was sitting next to him .  nobby hastily tried to shoo her away and she  apparently with reluctance  retired to a minimum safe distance  still looking adoringly at the corporal .   despite everything  vimes tried to suppress the urge to smile  and managed to turn it into a stiff look .      fraternising with the natives  are you  nobby .      young sam wandered over to the goblin girl and took hold of her hand  which was something he tended to do to any female that he met for the first time  a habit which his father considered would quite possibly open doors for him in later life .  the girl tried gently to pull her hand away  but young sam was a ferocious holder .   nobby looked embarrassed .     i ain   t fraternizing with her  mister vimes  she wants to fraternize with me .  she come out with the straw basket of little mushrooms and gives them to me  honestly .         are you sure they aren   t poisonous .      nobby looked blank .     don   t know  mister vimes .  i ate them anyway  very nice  very crunchy  slightly nutty you might say  and fred   s here now  sir .  this young lady        and to vimes   s surprise and approval nobby did not put inverted commas around the word lady        walked right up to him  took this weird shiny pot thing out of his hand  which was amazing because no one else could get it off of him  and there he was .  just like normal .  although i think we   re going to have to remind him about washing  and crapping only in the privy and so on .      vimes gave up .  it was true that every organization had to have its backbone  and therefore it stood to reason that there also would have to be some person who equated to the bits usually destined for dog food .  but nobby was loyal and lucky  and if there is anything that a policeman really needs  it   s luck .  maybe nobby had got lucky .      what are you doing up here  nobby .     he said .   nobby looked at vimes as if he was mad  and pointed to the wobbling temporary clacks tower .     have to check the clacks messages  mister vimes .  actually  young tony  who is the only one manning it  he sort of types them  and wraps them around a stone and they drops down  which is       there was a rattle on nobby   s helmet and he deftly caught a stone wrapped in a strip of paper before it hit the ground .     which is why i stand just here  mister vimes .     nobby unrolled the paper and announced     one double stateroom and one single on the roberta e .  biscuit  departing at   p . m .  tomorrow .  lucky you  mister vimes .  clacks .  what would we do without it  eh .      there was a shout from above     stand back  man coming down .     and vimes saw the whole structure of the clacks tower tremble as the young man carefully lowered himself from one spar to another  testing every one before putting his weight on it .  he dropped the last few feet and held out his hand to vimes .     pleased to meet you  sir samuel .  sorry it   s shaky  but we were still working on it last night .  a real rush job .  needs must when lord vetinari drives  you might say .  we   ll do it properly later if that   s okay by you .  i   ve got it lined up on a grand trunk tower  and they   ll bounce it to anywhere you want  plus a feed down to a clacks on your house  too .  of course you   ll have to have somebody manning this one to maintain the link  but from what i see that won   t be a problem .     the young man saluted vimes and added     best of luck to you  sir  and now i   m off to have my meal and a wash .      there was another clang on the helmet of nobby nobbs  and a wad of paper wrapped around a pebble fell at his feet .   the young clacksman picked it up proprietorially and read the message .     oh  it   s just an acknowledgement of service closure  confirming that i am standing down for a break .  my assistant typed it .  he didn   t really need to pass it on  but he is a conscientious little bugger and i have never seen such a quick study .  show him how to do something once and that   s enough .  reliable little devil as well .  and with those big hands he has no problem with the keyboard .      as the man strode off whistling down the hill  vimes jumped to a conclusion like a grasshopper .     stinky .  just you come down here  you little perisher .     he yelled .      right here  commander .     the little goblin was already standing almost between vimes   s boots .      you .  you .  you operating a clacks .  can you read .      stinky held out both large hands .     no  but can look  but can remember .  green man say     stinky  this pointy thing it called a    and stinky don   t need telling twice  and he say     this one  look like bum  he called b    .  good fun .     the cracked voice wheedled  but in a way that seemed to vimes to be full of cynical knowingness .     the goblin is useful  goblin is trustworthy  goblin is helpful .  goblin isn   t dead .      and it seemed to vimes that he was the only one hearing these words .  young sam had shuffled up to hold stinky   s hand  but had thought better of it .  under his breath  sam vimes said     what are you  stinky .         what are you  sam vimes .     stinky grinned .     hang  sam vimes .  hang together or hang separately .  above all  hang on .  hang  mister vimes .      vimes sighed .     i think it   s quite likely that i might     he said gloomily .  he looked around to find himself pinned in the gazes of young sam  nobby nobbs and the goblin girl who had been looking at nobby as if the little corporal was an adonis .  embarrassed  he shrugged and said     just a passing thought .              however you put it  fred colon was one of vimes   s oldest friends     and it was sobering to think that so was nobby nobbs .  vimes found the sergeant halfway down the goblin cave looking strangely pink  bemused  but nevertheless quite cheerful  possibly because he was eating a roasted rabbit like there was no tomorrow     which clearly had been the case for the rabbit .  cheery was watching him with some care from a distance  and when she saw vimes gave him a smile and a thumbs up sign  which was reassuring .   fred colon tried to salute  but had to think about it for a moment .     sorry about this  mister vimes  had some kind of nasty turn .  all a bit vague  really  and suddenly here i am among these people .      vimes held his breath and colon continued     very nice  very helpful  very generous  too .  they   ve been giving me all kinds of mushrooms  extremely tasty .  not very well versed in the trouser department  but i speak as i find .  makes a man think  i ain   t sure what  but it does .     he looked around with a strange fluorescence in his eyes .     nice in here  isn   t it .  nice and calm away from the maddening crowd .  wouldn   t mind staying here for a bit     nice .      sergeant colon stopped  flung the rabbit bones over his shoulder and reached down quickly into the mess of stones beside him .  he picked one up .  was it vimes   s imagination or did it twinkle for a moment as it once again turned into just a stone .      stay as long as you like  fred     said vimes .     i   ve got to go  but nobby   ll be around  and just about everybody else from the watch or so it seems .  stay as long as you like        he glanced at cheery littlebottom        but perhaps not too long .      more thoughts passed as young sam   s daily stroll progressed back down the hill and through the village  and when jiminy appeared at the doorway of the pub and gave vimes a little nod that spoke volumes  vimes   s passing thought was that an astute publican knows which way the wind is blowing and adjusts his sails accordingly .  no one knew better than he that no one knows where rumours come from and how they are spread  but the little convoy  even though it included nobby nobbs and the goblin girl  got smiles and nods where a week ago there would have been blank stares .  because the dreadful truth is that nobody wants to support the losing side .   when they reached ramkin hall again vimes found sybil in the rose garden  apparently deadheading  something that had to be done because it was on the list of things you had to do in the country whether you liked to do it or not .  she glanced up at her husband and then got on with what she was doing  and said quietly     you   ve been worrying people  haven   t you  sam .  lady rust popped in unexpectedly for a social visit  right after you left .     snip .  snip .  went the secateurs  furiously .      did you let her in .      snip .  snip .     of course .  of course .      there was another snip .  snip .     and i gave her tea and chocolate macaroons  too .  she may be an ignorant whey faced bitch who gives herself a title that is not rightfully hers  but there is such a thing as manners  when all is said and done .     snip .  snip .  snap .     i only did that because that one rather spoils the symmetry  honestly .  anyway  i had a lecture about maintaining standards  and banding together in defence of our culture  you know the sort of thing  it   s always just a code .      lady sybil leaned back with her secateurs poised  and regarded the rose bushes like a bloody handed revolutionary looking for his next aristocrat .     do you know what the bitch said .  she said     my dear  who cares what happens to a few trolls .  let them take drugs if they want to  that   s what i say .        eyes ablaze  sybil continued     and so i thought about sergeant detritus and how often he   s saved your life  and then there was young brick  that troll lad he adopted .  and it made me so angry that i nearly said something unrepeatable .  they think that i   m like them .  i hate that .  they just don   t get it .  they   ve got on well for years without ever having to think differently  and now they don   t know how .     snip .  snip .  crack .      you   ve just killed a rosebush  dear     said vimes  impressed .  it took a pretty good grip to push those blades through an inch of what looked like a small tree .      it was a brier  sam  wouldn   t ever do any good .         you could have given it a chance  perhaps .         sam vimes  you treasure your ignorance of gardening  so don   t start weaving a social hypothesis in front of an angry woman holding a blade .  there is a difference between plants and people .         do you think her husband sent her .     vimes said  standing back a little .     he is in the frame  you know  and i expect by the end of the day to be able to link him to smuggling  trafficking in goblins and certainly attempting to send jethro jefferson abroad to get him out of the way .  i know what happens to the goblins taken to howondaland and it   s not good for their health .  jefferson told me that rust was behind the eviction of the local goblins three years ago .  i   m hoping to get confirmation of this very shortly .  all in all  it   ll wipe the smile off his aristocratic face  at least .      the birds were singing and roses were pumping perfume into the air and lady sybil dropped the secateurs into her apron pocket .      it will shame old lord rust  you know .         don   t think i don   t know that     said vimes .     the old boy tried to warn me off when we first got here  which just about shows his talent as a tactician .  but i   ll say this for the old bastard  he is honourable  honest and straightforward .  it   s a shame that he is also pigheaded  stupid  and incompetent .  but you   re right  it   ll hurt him  although he must have killed so many soldiers by his own incompetence that shame should by now be second nature to him  an old friend as it were .     he sighed .     sybil  every time i have to arrest some twit who thought he could get away with swindling or extortion or blackmail  well  i know that there is probably going to be a family in difficulties  you understand .  i think about it .  it preys on my mind .  the trouble is  the idiots commit the crimes .  as it is  i   m trying to spare some of the hangers on in this case  provided their gratitude results in testimony .  i can stretch the law for the greater good  but that   s the end of it .      sybil nodded sadly  and then sniffed and said     can you smell smoke .      willikins  who had been standing patiently  said     corporal nobbs and his  ahem  young     lady wandered off into the shrubbery with young sam  your ladyship .  sergeant detritus accompanied them with what i now believe to be called        willikins savoured the word like a toffee     surreptition .      this last fact was testified to by the shrubbery itself  because no shrubbery  however large  could hide the fact that a troll had just walked through it .   there was a small  neat fire burning in the shrubbery  watched passively by detritus and young sam  and nervously by corporal nobbs  who was watching his new young lady cooking something on a spit .      oh  she   s cooking snails     said sybil  with every sign of approval .     what a provident young lady .         snails .     said vimes  shocked .      quite traditional in these parts  as a matter of fact     said sybil .     my father and his chums used to cook them up sometimes after a drinking session .  very wholesome  and full of vitamins and minerals  or so i understand .  apparently if you feed them on garlic they taste of garlic .      vimes shrugged .     i suppose that has to be better than them tasting of snails .      sybil pulled sam off to one side and said quietly     i think the goblin girl is the one that they call shine of the rainbow .  felicity says she   s very smart .         well  i don   t think she   ll get anywhere with nobby     said vimes .     he   s carrying a torch for verity pushpram .  you know  the fishmonger .      sybil whispered     she got engaged last month  sam .  to a lad who   s building up his own fishing fleet .     they stared through the leaves and tiptoed away .      but she   s a goblin .     said vimes  out of his depth .      and he is nobby nobbs  sam .  and she is quite attractive in a goblin sort of way  don   t you think .  and to be honest  i   m not sure that even nobby   s old mother knows what species her son is .  frankly  sam  it   s not our business .         but what if young sam eats snails .         sam  given what he   s already eaten in his short life i wouldn   t worry  if i was you .  i expect the girl knows what she   s doing  they generally do  sam  believe me .  besides  this is limestone country and there   s nothing poisonous for the snails to eat .  don   t worry  sam .         yes  but how will           don   t worry  sam .         yes  but i mean           don   t worry  sam .  there   s a troll and a dwarf in lobbin clout who have set up home together  so i   ve heard .  good for them  i say  it   s their business and definitely not ours .         yes  but           sam .      during the afternoon sam vimes worried .  he wrote dispatches and walked up to the new tower to send them .  goblins were sitting around the tower now  staring at it .  he tapped one of them on the shoulder  handed it the messages and watched it climb the tower as if it were horizontal .  a couple of minutes later it came down with a smudged confirmation of sending slip  which it handed to him along with a couple of other messages before sitting down to stare at the tower again .   he thought  you have lived your life in and around a cave in a hill and now here is this magical thing that sends words  right on your doorstep .  that   s got to command respect .  then he opened the two messages that had arrived for him  carefully folded up the papers and walked back down the hill  breathing carefully and taking care not to punch the air and whoop .   when vimes reached the cottage of the woman who  to young sam  would for ever be the poo lady  he stopped to hear the music .  it came and went  there were false starts  and then the world revolved as liquid sound called out of the window .  only then did he dare to knock at the door .   half an hour later  walking with the measured gait of the career copper  he proceeded to the lock up .  jethro jefferson was sitting on a stool outside .  he was wearing a badge .  feeney was learning fast .  the constabulary of the waterside owned precisely one badge  made of pot metal  and so pinned to the shirt of the blacksmith was a carefully cut out cardboard circle with  inscribed in pains taking handwriting  the words constable jefferson works for me .  be told .  signed  chief constable upshot .   there was a second  empty stool by the blacksmith  reflecting the doubling of the staff .  vimes sat down with a grunt .     how do you like being a copper  mister jefferson .         if you   re looking for feeney  commander  he   s on his lunch break .  and since you ask  i can   t say coppering sits very well with me  but maybe it   s the kind of thing that grows on you .  besides  the smithy is a bit quiet right now  and so   s the crime .     the blacksmith grinned .     no one wants me chasing them .  i hear things are happening  right .      vimes nodded .     when you see feeney  tell him that the quirm constabulary has picked up two men who apparently volunteered the information that they had shanghaied you  amongst other misdemeanours  and it seems they have a whole lot of other information that they are desperate to tell us in exchange for a certain amount of clemency .      jefferson growled .     give me five minutes with    em and i   ll show    em what clemency is .         you   re a copper now  jethro  so you don   t have to think like that     said vimes cheerfully .     besides  the balls are all lining up .      jefferson gave a hollow laugh  laden with malice .     i   d line their balls up for them     and just you see how far apart .  i was a kid when the first lot were taken and that bloody rust kid was there all right  yes indeed  urging everybody on and laughing at them poor goblins .  and when i ran out into the road to try and stop it  some of his chums gave me a right seeing to .  that was just after my dad died .  i was a bit innocent in those days  thought that some people were better than me  tipped me hat to gentry and so on  and then i took over the forge and if that don   t kill you it makes you strong .      and he winked  and vimes thought  you   ll do .  you   ll probably do .  you   ve got the fire .   vimes patted his shirt pocket and heard the reassuring rustle of paper .  he was rather proud of the note at the end of the clacks message  which was a personal one from the commandant in quirm .  it read     when they heard that you were on the case  sam  they were so chatty that we used up two pencils .      and then sam vimes went to the pub just as the men were coming in and sat in the corner nursing a pint of the beetroot juice with a touch of chilli  to help down a snack consisting of one pickled egg and one pickled onion nestling in a packet of crisps .  vimes did not know very much about gastronomy  but he knew what he liked .  and  as he sat there  he saw people talking to one another and looking at him  and then one of them walked slowly over  holding his hat in front of him in both hands as if in penitence .     name of hasty  sir  william hasty .  thatcher by trade  sir .      vimes moved his legs to make room and said     pleased to make your acquaintance  mister hasty .  what can i do for you .      mr hasty looked around at his fellows  and got that mixed assortment of waves and hoarse whispers that adds up to    get on with it .     reluctantly he turned back to vimes  cleared his throat  and said     well  sir  yes  of course we knew about the goblins and no one liked it much .  i mean they   re a bloody nuisance if you forget to lock your chicken coop and suchlike  but we didn   t like what was done  because it wasn   t     i mean  wasn   t right  not done like that  and some of us said we would suffer for it  come the finish  because if they could do that to goblins then what might they think they could do to real people  and some said real or not  it wasn   t right .  we   re just ordinary people  sir  tenants and similar  not big  not strong  not important  so who would listen to the likes of us .  i mean  what could we have done .      heads leaned a little forward  breaths were held  and vimes chewed the very last vinegary piece of crisp .  then he said  directing his gaze to the ceiling     you   ve all got weapons .  every man jack of you .  huge  dangerous  deadly weapons .  you could have done something .  you could have done anything .  you could have done everything .  but you didn   t  and i   m not sure but that in your shoes i might not have done anything  either .  yes .      hasty had held up a hand .     i   m sure we   re sorry  sir  but we don   t have weapons .         oh  dear me .  look around .  one of the things that you could have done was think .  it   s been a long day  gentlemen  it   s been a long week .  just remember  that   s all .  remember for next time .      in silence  vimes walked across to jiminy at the bar  noticing above the man a patch on the wall showing gleaming paint on the plaster .  for a moment vimes   s memory filled that space with a goblin   s head .  another little triumph .      jiminy  these gentlemen are drinking at my expense for the rest of the evening .  see they get home okay even if wheelbarrows have to be deployed .  i   ll send willikins down to settle with you in the morning .      only the sound of his boots broke the silence as he walked to the pub door and closed it gently behind him .  fifty yards up the road he smiled when he heard the cheering start .   the roberta e .  biscuit was  unlike the wonderful fanny  a boat that strutted its stuff .  it looked like a hogswatch decoration  and on one deck a small band was trying to play as hard as a large band .  waiting on the quayside  though  was a man wearing a hat that the captain of any fleet would desire .     welcome aboard  your grace  and of course your ladyship .  i   m captain o   farrell  master of the roberta .     then he looked down at young sam and said     want to take a turn at the wheel  young shaver .  that shall be arranged .  and i bet your daddy would like a turn  too .     the captain shook vimes   s hand industriously  saying     captain sillitoe had nothing but good things to say about you  sir  nothing but good things indeed .  and he hopes to see you again some day .  but in the meantime  it   s my duty  sir  to make you king .      the thoughts of sam vimes collided in their rush to get through first .  something about the word    king    was getting in the way .   still smiling  the captain said     that is to say king of the river  sir  a little honour that we bestow on those heroes who have taken on old treachery and bested him .  allow me to present you with this gold ish medal  sir .  it   s a small token  but show it to any captain on the river and you   ll be carried for free  sir  from the mountains to the sea if you so desire .      whipped to a frenzy by the oration  the crowd burst into loud applause and the band struck up with the old classic    surprised  aren   t you .      and bouquets of flowers were hurled into the air  and then picked up again carefully  because waste not  want not .  and the band played and the wheels turned and the water was whisked into a foam as the vimes family went down the river for a wonderful holiday .   young sam was allowed to stay up to see the dancing girls  although he didn   t see the point .  vimes  however  did .  and there was a conjuror and all the other entertainment people subject themselves to in the name of fun  although he did laugh a bit when the conjuror picked his pocket in order to put in the ace of spades and found himself holding the knife that sam had brought along just in case .  when you aren   t expecting it  that   s when you should expect it .   and the conjuror had not expected it and looked goggle eyed at vimes until he said     oh my  you   re him  aren   t you .  commander vimes himself .     and to vimes   s horror  he turned to the crowd with     a big hand  please  ladies and gentlemen  for the hero of the wonderful fanny .      in the end vimes had to take a bow  which meant obviously that young sam took a bow next to him  causing much moistening of female eyes throughout the restaurant .  and then the barman  who apparently didn   t know the score  created on the spot the    sam vimes     which sam later pretended to be embarrassed about when it became part of the repertoire in every drinking establishment on the plains  apart from  of course  those where the clientele tended to open their bottles with their teeth .    in fact  he was so overcome by the honour that he actually drank one of the cocktails and another afterwards as well  on the basis that sybil couldn   t really object in the circumstances .  then he sat signing beer mats and pieces of paper and chatting to people rather more loudly than he normally chatted until even the barman decided to call it a day and sybil towed her tipsy husband to bed .   and on the way to their suite he distinctly overheard one lady say to another in passing     who   s the new barman .  never seen him on this run before         the roberta e .  biscuit ploughed on into the night  the water leaving a temporary white trail behind her ample stern .  one ox had been led into the stable in the scuppers  leaving the other one to maintain some sensible headway while the pleasure cruise paddled towards the morning .  everyone except the pilot and the lookout was sleeping  drunk or otherwise prone .  the barman was nowhere to be seen  barmen come and go  after all     whoever notices the barman .  and in the corridor of staterooms a figure waited in the shadows  listening .  it listened for whispers  creaks and snores building up .   there was a snore  oh yes .  the shadow drifted along the dark corridor  the occasional betraying creak lost among the symphony of sounds made by any wooden boat under way .  there was a door .  there was a lock .  there was a gentle exploration  being the kind that portrays cunning and strength rather than actually having them .  there was a lockpick  a delicate movement of hinges  and the same movement again as the door was gently pushed shut from the inside .  there was a smile so unpleasant that it could almost be seen in the dark  especially by the dark assisted eye  and so there was a scream  instantly cut short        let me tell you how this is going to be     said sam vimes  as urgent sounds suddenly filled the corridor .  he leaned over the body spreadeagled on the floor .     you will be humanely handcuffed for the rest of this voyage  and you will be watched carefully by my valet willikins  who  apart from making a really good cocktail  is also not burdened by being a policeman .     he squeezed a little harder and went on in a conversational tone     every now and again i have to sack a decent copper for police brutality  and i do sack them  you may be sure of that  for doing what the average member of the public might do if they were brave enough and if they had seen the dying child  or the remains of the old woman .  they would do it to restore in their mind the balance of terror .     vimes squeezed again .     often the law treats them gently  if it worries about them at all  but a copper  now  he   s a lawman     certainly if he works for me     and that means his job stops at the arrest  mister stratford .  so what   s stopping me from squeezing the life out of a murderer who has broken into the room he thought would hold my little boy  with  oh dear me  such a lot of little knives .  why will i squeeze him only to unconsciousness  while despising myself for every fragment of breath i begrudge him .  i   ll tell you  mister  that what stands between you and sudden death right now is the law you don   t acknowledge .  and now i   m going to let you go  just in case you die on me  and i couldn   t have that .  however  i suggest you don   t try and make a run for it  because willikins is not bound by the same covenant as i am  and he is also quite merciless and very fond of young sam  who   s sleeping with his mother  i   m glad to say .  understand .  you picked the single room  didn   t you  where the little boy would be .  it   s lucky for you that i   m a bastard  mister stratford  because if you   d broken into the stateroom  where my wife  although i never dare tell her so  is snoring at least as loud as any man  you would have found that she has at her command a considerable amount of weaponry and  knowing the temper of the ramkins  she would have quite probably done things to you that would make willikins say     whoa  that   s going a bit too far .     what they have they keep  mister stratford .      vimes momentarily changed his grip .     and you must think i   m a bloody fool .  some bloke they reckoned was a great thinker once said     know yourself .     well  i know myself  mister stratford  i   m ashamed to say  right down to the depths  and because of that i know you  like i know my own face in the shaving mirror .  you   re just a bully who found it easier and easier and decided that everybody else wasn   t really a real person  not like you  and when you know that  there   s no crime too big  is there .  no crime you won   t do .  you might reflect that  while you   re going to hang  i   m quite certain that lord rust  your boss  will in all probability walk free .  did you really think he   d protect you .      the prostrate stratford mumbled something .      sorry  sir  didn   t quite catch that .         king   s evidence .     stratford blurted out .   vimes shook his head  even if stratford couldn   t see it .     mister stratford  you   re going to hang  whatever you say .  i   m not going to bargain with you .  you must surely realize that you have nothing to bargain with .  it   s that simple .      on the floor stratford growled     damn him .  i   ll tell you anyway .  i hate the smarmy bugger .  what do you want me to say .      it was a good job that he couldn   t see vimes   s face  and vimes merely said     however  i   m sure that lord vetinari will be very happy to hear anything that you have to say  sir .  he   s of a mercurial nature and i   m sure there is hanging or hanging .      slumped on the floor and wheezing  stratford said     everyone had that bloody cocktail  i saw them .  you had three  and everybody says you   re a lush .      there was laughter as the door came open  letting in a little light .     his grace had what you might call the virgin sam vimes     said willikins     no offence meant to the commander  ginger and chilli  a dash of cucumber juice and a lot of coconut milk .         and very tasty     said vimes .     take him away  willikins  will you  and if he tries anything you know what to do     you were born knowing what to do .      for a moment willikins touched his forelock and then said     thank you  commander  i appreciate the compliment .      and sam vimes finished his holiday .   of course it couldn   t be entirely fun  not with the clacks  not with people sending messages like     i don   t want to bother you  but this will only take a moment of your time         a great many people didn   t want to bother sam vimes  but with a great effort of will they somehow managed to overcome their distaste and do so nevertheless .  one of them  and this message did not contain an apology of any sort  came from havelock  lord vetinari  and read     we will talk about this .      that morning vimes hired a small boat with its captain and spent a happy time with young sam picking periwinkles off the rocks on one of the many small islands off the quirm coast  and then they gathered driftwood  made a fire  and boiled them and ate them with the help of a pin  racing to be the first to get one wiggly morsel out of its shell  and of course there was brown bread and butter and finally plenty of salt and vinegar  so that the periwinkles tasted of salt and vinegar rather than of periwinkles  which would be a disaster .     with the boys out of the way  sybil changed the world in her own quiet way  by sitting at the table in their apartment and writing  in the neat cursive script that she had been taught as a girl  a large number of clacks messages .  one of them was to the director of the royal opera house of which her ladyship was a major patron  another was to lord vetinari  and three more went to the secretary of the low king of the dwarfs  the secretary of diamond king of trolls and the secretary of lady margolotta of uberwald  ruler of all that country that was above ground .   but it didn   t stop there .  no sooner had the maid come back from carrying the first batch to the local tower at the top of the hill than she was sent spinning up there again with all the rest .  lady sybil was a ferocious writer of letters  and if there was any person of substance on the plains and beyond who didn   t get a letter from sybil that day  it was because their name had fallen out of her beautifully bound and obsessively updated little black book  which was  in fact  a delicate pink with tiny embroidered flowers on it  and a small phial of perfume .  nevertheless the only comparable weapon in the entire history of persuasion was probably the ballista .   in the afternoon lady sybil took tea with some of her girlfriends  all old girls from the quirm college for young ladies  and had a very satisfactory time talking about other people   s children while silently  driven by messages sleeting across the land with a precision and speed that no wizard would have contemplated  the world began to change its mind .   concurrently  vimes took young sam to the zoo  where he met the keepers  nearly all of whom had known somebody on the wonderful fanny and who opened every door to them  and nearly every cage .  the curator himself came along to witness this cheerful six year old who was methodically weighing giraffe poo on a pair of ancient snuff scales  dissecting it with a couple of old kitchen knives  and making notes in a notebook with a picture of a goblin on the front .  but for sam vimes the highlight was the elephant   s delivery that young sam had been looking forward to     just as the vimes party approached  jumbo obliged and his son was  almost literally  in a hog heaven .  not even the philatelist finding a rare reversed head blue triangle stamp in an unregarded secondhand stamp collection could have been happier than young sam toddling away with his steaming bucket .  young sam had seen the elephant .   and so had sam vimes .  the curator had said that young sam was incredibly gifted  and seemed to have a natural grasp of the disciplines of natural philosophy  a comment that caused sam   s father to nod wisely and hope for the best .   they rounded off the day with a visit to the funfair  where vimes gave the man a dollar for the ride on the upsy daisy machine and was given change for a quarter dollar .  when he objected the man swore at vimes  lashed out and was surprised to be caught in a grip of steel  marched through a cheering crowd and handed over to the nearest quirm copper  who saluted and asked if vimes could sign his helmet .  that was a small thing  but  as vimes always said  behind small things you often find big things .  he also won a coconut  a definite result  and young sam got a stick of rock with    quirm    all the way through  which stuck his teeth together  another memorable occasion .   in the middle of the night vimes  who had been listening to the pounding of the surf for some time  said     are you awake  dear .     and then  because this is how these things are done  raised his voice a little when he got no answer and repeated     are you awake  dear .         yes  sam .  i am now .      vimes stared at the ceiling .     i wonder if it   s all going to work .         of course it will .  people are very enthusiastic about it  you know  they   re intrigued .  and i   ve pulled more strings than an elephant   s corset .  it will work .  what about you .      there was a gecko on the ceiling  you didn   t get them in ankh morpork .  it looked at vimes with jewelled eyes .  he said     well  it   ll be more or less a standard procedure .     he shifted uneasily  and the gecko retreated to the corner of the room .     i   m a bit worried  though  some things i   ve done come within the law and one or two others are rather ad hoc  as it were .         you were just opening a way for the law to flow in  sam .  the end justifies the means .         i   m afraid a lot of bad men have used that to justify bad things  dear .      under the covers sybil   s hand reached out to touch his .     that   s no reason why one good man shouldn   t use it to justify a good thing .  don   t worry  sam .      woman   s logic  sam thought  everything is going to be all right because it ought to be all right .  the trouble is  reality is never as simple as that and doesn   t allow for paperwork .   vimes dozed comfortably for a while and then heard sybil say  in a whisper     he   s not going to escape  is he  sam .  you said he   s good with locks .         well  they have damn good locks on the cells here in quirm  there   s a guard watching him at all times and he   s going to be taken up to ankh morpork on their hurry up wagon under armed escort .  i can   t imagine the circumstances that would allow him to escape .  after all  the quirm lads want to do this one by the numbers .  i bet they   ll have shined up their armour until it looks like silver .  they   ll want to impress me  you see .  don   t worry  i   m certain nothing will go wrong .      they lay there  comfortable  and then vimes said     the curator of the zoo was very complimentary about young sam .      sleepily  sybil murmured     perhaps he   ll be another woolsthorpe  but maybe this time with the missing ingredient of common sense .         well  i don   t know what he   s going to be     said sam vimes     but i do know he   ll be good at it .         then he   ll be sam vimes     said sybil .     let   s get some sleep .      next day the family went home  which is to say that sybil and young sam went home to ankh morpork on a fast coach  after a small hiatus which led to young sam   s growing collection being removed from inside the coach and strapped to the roof  while sam vimes took the black eyed susan back to the hall  because there was still a matter of business to be concluded .  since he was a king of the river the pilot let him steer for part of the way  admittedly staring obsessively over his shoulder  just in case .  and vimes had fun  an infrequent event .  it is a strange thing to find yourself doing something you have apparently always wanted to do  when in fact up until that moment you had never known that you had always wanted to do it  or even what it was  but sam vimes  for a moment upon the world  was a riverboat pilot and was as happy as a cat full of sixpences .   that night he lay alone in the vastness of ramkin hall     except  of course  for the hundred or so servants     turning the events of the previous week over and over in his head  and especially his own actions during them .  time and again he cross examined himself mercilessly .  had he cheated .  not exactly .  had he misled .  not exactly .  had he acted as a policeman should .  well  now  that was the question  wasn   t it .   in the morning two young maids brought him his breakfast and vimes was amused to see that they were accompanied by a footman as a chaperone .  in a way he found that rather flattering .  then he went for a walk through the lovely countryside  listening to the liquid notes of the robin et cetera  he couldn   t remember the names of the others  but they were jolly good singers all the same  .   and as he walked he was aware of eyes upon him from every cottage and field .  one or two people came up to him  shook him frantically by the hand and ran away just as quickly  and it seemed to vimes that the world was dragging around after him .  nervousness was so saturating the atmosphere that he felt that any time soon he should shout    boo .     at the top of his voice .   but vimes was merely waiting     waiting for the evening .   the coaches started to arrive at ankh morpork   s opera house very early .  this was going to be an important occasion  it was said that not only would the patrician be there  but he would be accompanied by lady margolotta  ruler of all uberwald  plus the dwarf ambassador  and the black ruby viceroy of diamond king of trolls  who arrived in the city with almost as many courtiers  secretaries  bodyguards  chefs and advisers as had been brought by the ambassador from the dwarfs .   in an unsophisticated way  the people of ankh morpork were very sophisticated and the streets buzzed more busily than usual .  something like this was important .  great matters of state would be settled over the canap  s .  the fate of millions and suchlike would be most likely decided by a quiet word in a corner somewhere and thereafter the world would be a slightly different place  you see if it isn   t .   unless you had a gold edged invitation to the opera house that evening this was no occasion to be fashionably late  in case you were left fashionably standing fashionable at the back  craning unfashionably to see over the heads of other people .   towards sunset vimes lounged outside the lock up  happy to acknowledge the fraternal salute of the pilot of a small boat that sailed past .  then he strolled along the lane until he reached the pub and took a seat on the bench outside .  he took out his snuffbox  looked at it for a moment and decided that on an occasion like this sybil would have probably allowed him a cigar .   through the smoke of the first luxurious pull he stared at the village green and most especially at that pillar of what seemed to be broken wickerwork .  somehow  soundlessly  it was speaking to him  calling to him  just as it had when he had first seen it .  after a few more thoughtful puffs he wandered towards the pub door .  jiminy beamed at him from under the freshly painted sign of the commander   s arms  where he was enjoying the pint that the parsimonious publican drinks every day when cleaning the pipes .  it   s old beer  obviously  but what   s beer but liquid bread  eh .  and bread can   t do you no harm .      you look a bit preoccupied  commander     said the publican .     a mite pensive  as it were .      vimes nodded towards the tottering spire .     how important is that  my friend .      the barman glanced at the stack as if he couldn   t care less .     well  you know  it   s just a load of old wicker hurdles  that   s all .  they just stack them there after the annual sheep fair so they don   t get in the way .  a bit of a landmark  you might say  but not that much .         oh     said vimes .  he stared at the tower .  nothing really  then  but nevertheless it spoke to him .   vimes stared at the heap for a while and then followed jiminy into the bar .      how much brandy do you have in here .         not much call for it  but i   d say five or six bottles and a small barrel .     jiminy stared intently at vimes .  vimes knew jiminy for what he was  nothing else but a man who knew enough to always be on the winning side .   vimes puffed his cigar again .     put two of them aside for me  will you .  and you   d better make sure you   ve got good beer on tap  because pretty soon you   re going to have a lot of customers .      he left the barman bustling as he went back outside and he continued to stare  his mind elsewhere  and in many places .  of course it   ll work  he told himself .  they   ve all got watches and i know they   ll have synchronized them  even if they don   t know how to spell synchronize .  it   s a shout like any other  and i   ve trained most of them and i reckon that they know that if somebody says to them     do you know who i am .     they know enough to say     yes  you   re nicked .      and he smiled inwardly when he thought that among the officers drafted in from the city were two trolls  two vampires  a werewolf and a dwarf .  that   s what they probably call symbolic  he thought .  he pulled out his own watch again  just as the early seekers of an evening pint began to appear .  right about     now .   there was a huge jamming of coaches around the opera house as would be patrons  high or low  forsook their carriages and took to their feet  fighting their way through the throng that was seeking admission .  of course  it helped if you had a squad of trolls or dwarfs with you .   ankh morpork liked surprises  provided they didn   t involve the revenue .  the curtain was not due to go up for another hour  but that didn   t matter  because the important thing was to be there and even more importantly to be seen to be there  especially by the people you wanted to see .  whatever it was going to be it was going to be an occasion  and you would have been there and people would have seen you there and it was important and  therefore  so were you .   it would be a night to remember  even if the mysterious performance was an act to forget .  the really rich often put on these things out of vanity  but this one looked particularly mysterious and possibly a jolly good laugh if it fell on its face .   day was turning into night .  the pub was filling up  as were the drinkers  who had been told by jiminy that they were drinking courtesy of commander vimes  again .  and jiminy watched him carefully from the doorway as the shadows lengthened and vimes stood there  motionless  occasionally looking at his watch .   at last the lad everybody knew as young feeney turned up  with his arm still in its cast but  nevertheless  the old boys agreed amongst themselves  looking rather more grown up than they   d ever seen him before .  he was accompanied by jefferson the blacksmith  whom they regarded as a ticking bomb at the best of times  and he had a badge  just like feeney .  people overflowed from the pub as the two of them went up to vimes  and there was an unheard conversation .  they   d wondered why the blacksmith was carrying a megaphone  but now they watched him hand it to vimes  and feeney and the blacksmith walked back towards the pub and people parted like a wave to let them through .   vimes looked at his watch again .  more people were hurrying towards the green .  people with an instinct for the dramatic had run home to say that something was up and you   d better come and look .  and country people liked a spectacle  or even a serious death  just like city people .  they too liked to say     i was there     even if it came out as    i was there  ooh arr    .   vimes put his watch in his pocket for the last time  and raised the megaphone to his lips .      ladies and gentlemen .     the blacksmith had hammered out a pretty good loudhailer and the voice echoed across the green .     i have heard it said  ladies and gentlemen  that in the end all sins are forgiven .     out of the corner of his mouth he said  so that only feeney and the blacksmith could hear     we shall see .     and then he continued .     bad things have been done .  bad things have been ordered .  bad orders have been obeyed .  but they never will be again     will they  ladies and gentlemen .  because there needs to be a law  but before there is a law  there has to be a crime .      there was absolute silence in the gloom as he walked over the green to the tower and broke the two bottles of brandy on its woodwork  stepped back a little way and threw the glowing end of his cigar after them .   in the opera house the gossip faded and died as lady sybil stepped through the curtains and on to the stage .  she was a woman of  as they say  ample proportions  although she felt that some of them were more than ample .  however  she could afford the very best dressmakers and did indeed have the manner and poise that were the symbol of her class  or at least the class she had been born into  and so she stepped out front of curtain and applause broke out and grew .  when she judged that it had gone on long enough she made a little gesture which magically silenced the auditorium .   lady sybil had exactly the right voice for these occasions .  somehow she could make everybody think she was talking just to them .  she said     my lord patrician  lady margolotta  your grace the viceroy  ambassadors  ladies and gentlemen  i am so touched you have all decided to come along to my little twilight soir  e  especially since i have been rather naughty and have been very sparing of information .     lady sybil took a deep breath  which caused several elderly gentlemen near the front of the audience to very nearly burst into tears .        i have been privileged recently to find a musician beyond compare  and without more ado i will let you into this wonderful secret .  can we have the house lights down  jeffrey .  good .  ladies and gentlemen  i am honoured to be able to present to you tonight tears of the mushroom playing her own composition  the    twilight serenade    .  i hope you will like it  and  in fact  i know that you will .      lady sybil stepped back as the curtains dragged themselves aside  and took a chair next to tears of the mushroom  who was seated obediently at her concert harp .   beneath the seemingly impregnable composure  sybil   s heart was bouncing like a flamenco dancer .  a low light     that had been the thing .  the girl shouldn   t be able to see the thousands out there .  sybil had taken her in hand  fearful that sudden exposure to the massed gaze of ankh morpork  far from her home  would have some terrible effect  but in fact it wasn   t working like that .  the girl had a curious tranquillity  as if she hadn   t realized that she should be in awe .  she smiled at sybil in her strange way and waited  with fingers poised  over the strings .  there was no sound but the susurration of people asking one another what the intense little figure they were seeing really was .  lady sybil smiled to herself .  by the time they realized  it would be too late .  she looked at her watch .   the flames were so high over the ramkin estate that the blaze could surely be seen all the way to ankh morpork  bet you a gallon of brandy and a brace of turbot  .  there was barely any wind and it stood there like a beacon .   vimes announced to the gathered throng     ladies and gentlemen  the area known as the shires is under the rule of law tonight  and by that i mean the proper law  the law that is written down for everybody to see  and even to be changed if enough people agree .  chief constable upshot and constable jefferson are currently acting with the backing of their colleagues in the ankh morpork city watch  who would like to be assured that their colleagues receive the respect that is due .  at this moment  a number of people from the shires are being courteously brought here  although possibly to their dismay .  some of them will be the people who call themselves your magistrates and they will be taken away and asked to explain to a lawyer by what right they have assumed that position .  if any one of you wants to argue with me  please come on and do so .  the law is there for the people  rather than the other way round .  when it is the other way round don   t hesitate to grab your weapons  understand .  the bar is still free  but before you stampede  there is one more thing .      vimes had to put the megaphone back to his mouth because the mention of    bar    and    free    in one breath has an invigorating effect on people .     right now  ladies and gentlemen  the goblins on hangman   s hill  and indeed all other goblins in this area  are under my protection and the protection of the law .  they are also subject to it  and i   ll see to it that they have their own police force .  it appears that they make natural clacks operators  so if they wish they can derive a revenue from so doing .  i   m paying to have that clacks tower made permanent .  you will benefit from it and so will they .  they won   t need to steal your chickens because they   ll buy them from you  and if they do pinch them  then that   s a crime and will be treated as such .  one law  ladies and gentlemen     one size fits all .      there was a cheer at this  as loud as any cheer in the vicinity of the prospect of a free bar can be .  of course  some of it might have been cheer at the fact that there was now some justice in the world  but on the whole it was quite likely that the bar won the day .  you didn   t have to be a cynic  you just had to understand people .   vimes walked slowly towards the brightly lit pub  although the chances of getting inside were small .  on the other hand  the chances of being given a hug by miss felicity beedle were exactly one hundred per cent  because that was what she was doing  while being watched sheepishly by the blacksmith .   he let go of her hand as she said     you are a great man  commander  and i hope they put up a statue to you .         oh dear  i hope not .  you only get a statue when you   re dead .      she laughed  but vimes said     listen  miss beedle  right now i don   t know if i   m facing a statue or the sack .  some of the ways i   ve acted have been quite lawful  and others have been somewhat     debatable .  i have an officer who can do with numbers what sergeant detritus can do with a hammer and he   s going through the records of the son of one of the most influential people in ankh morpork .  and at the same time experienced police officers have visited the home of every member on the list of local magistrates .  they are presenting them with a document  under my seal  informing them that they are no longer members of the self elected board of magistrates of the shires and reiterating that there may be formal charges to be made .  my justification for this ought to work  but now .  it   s probably going to be a case of who has the best lawyers .      the future  miss beedle  is somewhat uncertain  but i have to tell you that young sam  thanks to you  is probably going to be the world expert on poo .  i must tell you that his mother and i are very pleased and only hope he aspires to higher things .      there was already the rattle of wagons and coaches in the distance  the sound of pigeons coming home to roost .     i think i   ll soon have people to talk to  miss beedle  although i suspect that they   d rather not talk to me .         of course  commander .  can i say that the goblins seem very attached to your corporal nobbs .  they treat him as one of their own  in fact  and he seems to be very fond of shine of the rainbow  as she is of him .  you may be interested to know that the goblin name for him is breaking wind .      she did not appear to smile and vimes said     yes  very apt .  i   ve always thought of nobby as a draught extruder .  in fact  at my wife   s express suggestion i have breveted him to the rank of sergeant for his stay here  and i hope that he   ll assist the goblins to understand the benefits of the law     although  of course  the fusion might simply mean that people   s chickens will be more expertly stolen from now on .         oh  you are a joker  commander .      vimes   s expression had not changed and did not change now .     yes  aren   t i .      he turned to jefferson .     you know  things would have been a lot easier if you   d trusted me at the start .      the blacksmith shrugged .     why should i have trusted you .  you   re a nob .         do you trust me now .      the blacksmith   s gaze remained steady for longer than vimes could be happy with  but at last the man smiled and said     yeah  for now .      there was only one reply that vimes could conceivably deliver .  he smiled back and said     a policeman   s answer if ever i heard one .      as the couple strolled away there was a polite cough behind vimes .  he turned round and recognized the worried face of the colonel .     do you have a minute  commander .      oh dear  thought vimes .      may i first say  commander  that i firmly agree with what you are doing and heavens know it needed doing .     the colonel coughed again and said     you will not have any disagreement with me on that point .     vimes waited and he continued     my wife is a rather foolish woman who does appear to worship things like titles and  if i may say so  gives herself airs .  her father was a fisherman  an extremely good one  but do you know what .  i think she would rather die than have anyone know .      there was another pause  and in the red light vimes could see the shine on the old man   s face .     what is going to happen to her  commander .  at the moment  two polite young ladies in ankh morpork city watch uniform are standing guard over her in our house .  i don   t know if this helps very much  but the first thing she did when the arresting officers arrived was make them tea .  there is such a thing as good manners  you see .  is she going to prison .      vimes felt the urge to say     would you like her to .     but he choked it back  because of the tears .     it   s charles  isn   t it .      the colonel looked surprised .     as a matter of fact  commander  it   s chas to my friends .         am i one of them .     and vimes went on     other people will decide what has to be done here .  i   ve merely made certain that nobody can inadvertently leave before i   ve had a chance to talk to them all  do you understand .  i   m not the judge and nor would i be allowed to sit on a jury .  coppers aren   t .  and right now i   m not even certain what the penalty is for being stupid  vain and unthinking  although it does occur to me that if i was to put in prison every person guilty of these crimes we   d have to build about five hundred more .      speaking for myself     he continued     i   d like to see that murderers  if such i might find  are seen and dealt with as murderers  and the frightened and unthinking obedient also treated as they deserve .  and right now  sir  i   d just like to not be living in a world of bloody fools .  personally  i have no particular interest in seeing your wife in prison  although i have a suspicion that if she was put in the women   s wing of the tanty her horizon would be usefully expanded and i expect she   d be so bossy that she   d be running the place after a couple of weeks .         i do love her  you know     said the colonel .     we   ve been married for fifty five years .  i   m very sorry you   ve been troubled and  as i   ve said  i envy you your job .         i think  perhaps  i should envy her her husband     said vimes .     you know  colonel  i   ll be happy just for the truth to come out  preferably on page one of the ankh morpork times  if you understand me .         absolutely  commander .      vimes looked down at the man  who now looked rather relieved  and added     for what it   s worth  i suspect lord vetinari will make certain of his backing and possibly there will be some token punishments .  too many skeletons  you see  too many cupboards .  too many things around the world that maybe happened too long ago .  what in the world can you do if some copper is going to go around digging them up .  that   s called real politik  sir  and so i suspect that the world will go on and you will not be very long without the company of your wife  which should  if i   m any judge  mean that you can have more or less anything for dinner that you want for the next week .      the idea seemed to lift the colonel   s spirits .  the old man smiled .     do you know  commander  i   m sure that  if treated with respect  potted shrimps might turn out to be my bosom chums .      the colonel held out his hand and vimes took it  shook it and said     bon app  tit .      afterwards  there were several explanations about why the quirm wagon containing a very important prisoner overturned in the middle of the night and rolled down a very steep hill  coming to bits as it did so .  you could blame the dark  you could blame the fog  you could blame its speed and above all you could blame the express mail coach from ankh morpork that ran straight into it on the corner .   by the time the wounded were in any state to comprehend what had happened they were minus one prisoner  who appeared to have picked the lock of his shackles  and plus one guard whose throat had been cut .   it was dark  it was cold  it was foggy and  hunched together  the survivors waited until dawn .  after all  how could you find a man in darkness .   stratford was good at speed .  speed was always useful  and he stayed on the road that was just visible in the murk .  it didn   t really matter where he went  after all  he knew no one had ever given a description of him that helped .  it was a gift to be indescribable .   after a while  however  he was surprised and delighted to hear a horse trotting along the road behind him .  some brave traveller  he thought  and smiled in the fog and waited .  to his further surprise  the horse was reined to a halt a little way from him and the rider slid off .  stratford could barely make out a shape in the shimmering  water laden air .      my word .  the famous mister stratford     said a voice cheerfully  as the stranger strolled towards him .     and let me tell you right now  if you make any kind of move you   ll be so dead that the graveyards would have to run backwards .         i know you .  vimes sent you  after me .         oh  dear me no  sir     said willikins .     the commander doesn   t know i   m here at all  sir  and nor will he ever .  that is a certainty .  no  sir  i   m here  as it might be  out of a matter of professional pride .  by the way  sir  if you   re thinking of killing me and taking my horse i   d be most grateful if you   d try that right now .      stratford hesitated .  there was something about the voice that induced hesitation .  it was calm  friendly  and     worrying .   willikins strolled a little closer and there was a chuckle in his voice .     my word  sir  i   m a bit of a fighter myself  and when i heard about you chopping up that girl and that  i thought  goodness me  i thought .  and so the other day  when i had my day off in lieu     very important your day off in lieu  if you   re a working man     i took a trip up to overhang and learned a few things about you  and  my word  did i learn a few things .  you really scare people  eh .      stratford still hesitated .  this didn   t sound right .  the man had a straightforward and cheerful voice  like a man you didn   t know very well having a companionable chat in the pub  and stratford was used to people being very nervous when they spoke to him .      now  me     said willikins     i was raised by the street as a fighter and i fight dirty  you can depend on that  and i   ll fight anybody  but i never punched a girl     oh  except kinky elsie  who was always game for that sort of thing and had me by the i   m not going to mentions at the time and my hands were tied  in more ways than one  as it were  and so i had to give her a sharp nudge with my foot .  happy days .  but you .  you   re just a killer .  worthless .  a bully .  i fight because i might get killed and the other bloke might win  or maybe we   d both end up in the gutter  too weak to throw another punch  when  quite likely  we   d prop each other up and go to the pub for a drink and a wash .      he took another step closer .  stratford took a step back .     and you  mister stratford  set out to kill commander vimes   s little lad  or worse .  and do you know what is even worser .  i reckon that if you   d done so  the commander would have arrested you and dragged you to the nearest police station .  but inside he   d be cutting himself up with razorblades from top to bottom .  and he   d be doing that because the poor bugger is scared that he could be as bad as you .     willikins laughed .     truth is  mister stratford  from where i sit he   s a choirboy  he really is  but there has to be some justice in the world  you see  not necessarily law justice  but justice justice  and that   s why i am going to kill you .  although  because i   m a fair man  i   m going to give you a chance to kill me first .  that means one or other of us will die  so whatever happens the world is going to be a better place  eh .  call it     cleaning up .  i know you have a weapon because you   d have run if you didn   t  and so i reckon you have a blade from one of those poor buggers from quirm and i warrant that in all the confusion you probably stabbed him with it .         i did  too     said stratford .     and he was a copper and you   re just a butler .         very true     said willikins     and much older than you and heavier than you and slower than you  but still a bit spry .  what   ve you got to lose .      only the horse  steaming patiently in the mist  saw what happened next  and being a horse was in no position to articulate its thoughts on the matter .  had it been able to do so it would have given as its opinion that one human ran towards another human carrying a huge metal stick while the other human quite calmly put his hand into his breast pocket .  this was followed by a terrible scream  a gurgling noise and then silence .   willikins staggered to the side of the road and sat down on a stone  panting a little .  stratford certainly had been fast  no doubt about that .  he wiped his forehead with his sleeve  pulled out a packet of cigarettes and lit one  staring at nothing but the fog .  then he stood up  looked down at the shadow on the ground and said     but not fast enough .     then  like a good citizen  willikins went back to see if he could help the unlucky gentlemen of the law  who appeared to be in difficulties .  you should always help the gentlemen of the law .  where would we be without them .   the chief sub editor of the ankh morpork times really hated poetry .  he was a plain man and had devoted a large part of his career to keeping it out of his paper .  but they were a cunning bunch  poets  and could sneak it up on you when your back was turned .  and tonight  with the paper already so late that the lads downstairs were into overtime  he stared at the report just delivered by hand from knatchbull harrington  the paper   s music critic .  a man of whom he was deeply suspicious .  he turned to his deputy and waved the page angrily .        whence came it  that ethereal music .     see what i mean .  what   s wrong with    where did that music come from    .  bloody stupid introductory sentence in any case .  and what does ethereal mean  anyway .      the deputy sub hesitated .     i think it means runny .  could be wrong .      the chief sub editor stood in misery .     definitely poetry .      somebody had played some music that was very good .  apparently it made everybody amazed .  why didn   t that twit in his rather feminine purple silk shirts just write something like that .  after all  it said everything that you needed to know  didn   t it .  he took out his red pencil  and just as he was applying it to the wretched manuscript there was a sound on the metal staircase and mr de worde  the editor  staggered into the office  looking as if he had seen a ghost or  perhaps  a ghost had seen him .   he looked groggily at the two puzzled men and managed to say     did harrington send in his stuff .      the chief sub held out the offending stuff in front of him .     yes  guv  a load of rubbish in my opinion .      de worde grabbed it  read it with his lips moving and thrust it back at the man .     don   t you dare change a single word .  front page  bugsy  and i hope to hell that otto got an iconograph .         yessir  but  sir           and don   t bloody argue .     screamed de worde .     and now  if you   ll excuse me  i   ll be in my office .      he clattered on up the stairs while the sub editor and his deputy stood gloomily reading knatchbull harrington   s copy again .  it began   whence came it  that ethereal music  from what hidden grot or secret cell .  from what dark cave .  from what window into paradise .  we watched the tiny figure under the spotlight and the music poured over us  sometimes soothing  sometimes blessing  sometimes accusing .  every one of us confronting ghosts  demons and old memories .  the recital by tears of the mushroom  a young lady of the goblin persuasion  took but half an hour or  perhaps  it took a lifetime  and then it was over  to a silence which spread and grew and expanded until at last it exploded .  every single patron standing and clapping their hands raw  tears running down our faces .  we had been taken somewhere and brought back and we were different people  longing for another journey into paradise  no matter what hell we had to atone for on the way .   the chief sub and his deputy looked at each other with what knatchbull would certainly have called a    wild surmise    .  at last  the deputy sub editor ventured     i think he liked it .      three days passed .  they were busy days for vimes .  he had to get back into the swing again  although  to tell the truth  it was a case of getting out of one swing and into another one  while they were both swinging .  so much paperwork to read .  so much paperwork to push away .  so much paperwork to delegate .  so much paperwork to pretend he hadn   t received and might have been eaten by the gargoyles .   but today  in the oblong office  lord vetinari was close to ranting .  admittedly you needed to know him very well to realize this .  he drummed his fingers on the table .     snarkenfaugister .  i   m sure she makes these things up .      drumknott carefully put a cup of coffee on his master   s desk .     alas  sir  there really is such a word .  in nothingfjord it means a maker of small but necessary items such as  for example  spills and very small clothes pegs for indoor use and half sized cocktail sticks for people who don   t drink long drinks .  the term could be considered of historical interest  because my research this morning turned up the fact that the last known snarkenfaugister died twenty seven years ago in a freak pencil sharpener accident .  as a matter of fact  i gather that your crossword adversary herself does actually come from nothingfjord .         ah .  there you have it .  all those long winters sitting around the stove .  such terrible patience .  but she runs the pet shop in pellicool steps .  dog collars .  cat biscuits .  mealworms .  such deviousness .  such subterfuge .  such a vocabulary .  snarkenfaugister .         well  sir  she is now the chief crossword compiler for the times  and i suppose those things go with the territory .      lord vetinari calmed down .     one down  one across .  she has won and i am cross .  and  as you know  i am very rarely cross  drumknott .  a calm if cynical detachment is generally my forte .  i can change the fate of nations but am thwarted at every turn by an apparently blameless lady who compiles crosswords .      drumknott nodded .     indeed  sir  but on that note  if you will permit me to extend that note a little  may i remind you that commander vimes is waiting in the other room .         indeed .  show him in  by all means .      vimes marched in  saluted very nearly smartly  and stood to attention .      ah  your grace  it is good to see you back at last .  how went your holidays  apart from lawless actions  ad hoc activities  fights  chases on both land and sea and indeed fresh water  unauthorized expenditure and  of course  farting in the halls of the mighty .      vimes   s gaze was steady and just above the patrician   s eye line .     point of detail  my lord  didn   t fart  may have picked nose inadvertently .         the exigencies of the service  i assume .     said lord vetinari wryly .     vimes  you have caused a considerable amount of paperwork to cross my desk in the last few days .  in some cases the writers wanted your head on a plate  others were more circumspect because the writers were in mortal dread of a prison cell .  can i make one thing perfectly clear  your grace  the law cannot operate retrospectively .  if it did  none of us would be safe .      lord rust junior may have done  indeed has done many bad things  but making slaves of goblins under current law cannot be one of them .  however  as i suspect  the recent revelations about his additional activities have done his reputation a considerable amount of no good .  you might not know this  vimes  but in society this sort of thing can be worse than a prison sentence  possibly worse than a death .  young gravid is a man with not many friends right now .  i hope that will give you some pleasure .      vimes said nothing  but he thought  the ball dropped .   vetinari glared at him and said     i have here an eloquent missive from lord rust senior  pleading for the life of  if not the freedom of  his son  who he fully admits has trodden the family honour into the mud .     lord vetinari held up a hand .     his lordship is an old man and so  vimes  if your next remark was going to be something on the lines of even further then i suggest you deploy a little charity .  his lordship is anxious to avoid a scandal .  apart from that  may i have your views .         yes .  the scandal has already taken place  sir  more than once     said vimes coldly .     he trafficked in living  breathing and thinking people .  many of them died .         once again  vimes  i have to tell you that laws cannot be made retrospectively .         that may be so     said vimes     but what about the troll kids  who took that damn rubbish .  are you going to ask the diamond king if they should be retrospective .         i can assure you  vimes  that the laws will be upheld  and since you ask  right now i am having to negotiate with the king  who is demanding  demanding of me     me  vimes     that young lord rust be handed over for questioning regarding the manufacture and distribution of absolutely deadly troll narcotics .  of course  under troll law the wretched man would be put to death  and i am saddened to say that at this moment in the complex world of human  troll and dwarven politics  i feel that that might have some long term repercussions  making it an unfortunate option for this city .  i have to negotiate this problem  and  believe me  it   s going to take a lot of quid for the pro quo .  and it   s only nine thirty in the morning .      vimes   s knuckles reddened .     they are living creatures who can talk and think and have songs and names  and he treated them like some kind of disposable tools .         indeed  vimes  but  as i have indicated  goblins have always been considered a kind of vermin .  however  ankh morpork  the kingdom of the low king and also that of the diamond king  uberwald  lancre and all the independent cities of the plain are passing a law to the effect that goblins will henceforth be considered as sapient beings  equal to  if not the same as  trolls and dwarfs and humans and werewolves  et cetera et cetera  answerable to what we have agreed to call    the common law    and also protected by it .  that means killing one would be a capital crime .  you have won  commander  you have won .  because of a song  commander .  oh  and of course other efforts  but it was your wife who got most of the ambassadors to her little amusement which  i may say  vimes  was eloquence personified .  though frankly  vimes  i find myself shamed .  one spends one   s life scheming  negotiating  giving and taking and greasing such wheels as squeak  and in general doing one   s best to stop this battered old world from exploding into pieces .  and now  because of a piece of music  vimes  a piece of music  some very powerful states have agreed to work together to heal the problems of another autonomous state and  almost as collateral  turn some animals into people at a stroke .  can you imagine that  vimes .  in what world could that possibly happen .  all because of a song at twilight  vimes .  all because of a song .  it was a thing of strangely tinkling tones and unbelievable cadences which somehow found its way into our souls  reminding some of us that we have some .  lady sybil is worth a dozen diplomats .  you are a lucky man  commander .      vimes opened his mouth to speak  but vetinari interrupted .     and also a bloody fool  a bloody  headstrong fool .  the law must start with a crime .  i understand  but don   t condone .     vetinari picked the letter off his desk .     lord rust asks that his son be given a moderately short sentence  subsequent to which he be allowed to emigrate to fourecks  to start a new life .  since the man was deeply involved in smuggling the fine will be harsh .      he held up a hand .     no  hear me out  after all  i am the tyrant in this vicinity .     vetinari slumped into his chair  wiped his brow and said     and i have already lost my temper with an otherwise inoffensive sweet lady who compiles crossword puzzles for the times .  however  vimes  lord rust refers to you as a man of honour and probity and astonishing integrity and vigilance .  moreover  he is disinheriting his son  which means upon his death his title will devolve to his daughter regina  a ferocious woman  very difficult and hot headed .  and that  vimes  creates another problem for me .  his lordship is extremely frail and  frankly  i was looking forward to dealing with the son  who is an ignorant  arrogant  pompous idiot  but his sister .  she is smart .     and then  almost to himself  lord vetinari added     but at least she doesn   t compile crosswords     now you may speak  commander .         there was a murder     said vimes sullenly .   vetinari sighed hugely .     no  vimes .  there was a slaughter .  do you not understand .  at that point goblins were vermin and no  do not shout at me .  at this very moment in palaces and chancelleries all over the world goblins are becoming as human as you or i  but that was then .  i would like you to be fully aware that the reason that stratford would have gone to the tender mercies of mister trooper is that he and his ruffians boarded the enormous fanny   yes  what is it .      vetinari looked round as drumknott tapped him on the shoulder .  there was a muffled whispering before vetinari cleared his throat and said     of course  i meant the wonderful fanny     and he did not exactly meet vimes   s gaze as he continued .     that was an act of piracy and the good people of quirm  where the     boat in question was registered  are all in favour of the death penalty for that kind of thing .  i am aware of his manifold other crimes but  alas  you can only hang a man once     although  as it turned out  apparently mister stratford was mortally wounded in a collision three nights ago  being thrown some distance from the wreckage with a surgically cut throat .  convenient  don   t you think .         don   t you dare look at me like that  sir .         heavens  i wouldn   t accuse you  commander  i was just wondering if you knew of any other person with a grudge against the corpse .         nosir     said vimes  pulling himself to attention .      you know  vimes  sometimes your expression becomes so wooden that i think i could make a table out of it .  just tell me this  did you give any instructions .      how does he do it .  thought vimes .  how .  out loud he said     i don   t know what you are talking about  sir  but if what i suspect to be true is so  then the answer is no .  if there was any foul play that night it wasn   t by my order .  i wanted to see stratford on the gallows .  that   s legal .     and he thought  i am never going to broach the subject with willikins .   vetinari   s eyebrows rose as vimes went on     but his lordship   s wretched son is being allowed to go on a long holiday full of sun  sea  surf and sand and economically priced wines .     he slammed his fist on the desk and vetinari looked pointedly at it until vimes took it away .     are you going to leave it at that .         it has been known  as people put it  for the leopard to change its shorts .  all of us hope for a little redemption  whether we deserve it or not .  we will keep an eye on the young fool  you can be certain of that .         oh  you   re sending the dark clerks after him .         vimes  the dark clerks are a myth  as everybody knows .  to tell you the truth  some flunkey from our embassy down there will pay attention to his progress .  and now the world is a better place  commander .  you have no understanding  vimes  no understanding at all of the deals  stratagems and unseen expedients by which some of us make shift to see that it remains that way .  do not seek perfection .  none exists .  all we can do is strive .  understand this  commander  because from where i sit you have no alternative .  and remember  for this week   s work you will be remembered .  lord rust may not like it but news travels fast .  the truth will be known and written down in the history books .     vetinari gave a wan smile .     it will  i shall see to it .  and  slightly better than before  the world will continue to turn .      vetinari picked up yet another piece of paper  appearing to glance at it  and said     you may go  commander  in the knowledge that i  for so many reasons  envy you .  my regards to your good lady .      vimes looked at drumknott .  the man   s face so assiduously betrayed nothing that it betrayed everything .   vetinari pulled a file towards him and picked up his pen .     don   t let me detain you  commander .      an hour later lord vetinari was sitting at his desk with his fingers steepled  apparently lost in thought  staring at the ceiling  and  to drumknott   s surprise  occasionally waving his hand as if conducting some hidden music .  drumknott knew enough not to disturb him  but at last he dared to say     it was a most memorable recital  wasn   t it  sir .      vetinari ceased being the invisible conductor and said  brightly     yes  it was  wasn   t it .  they say that the eyes of some paintings can follow you around the room  a fact that i doubt  but i am wondering whether some music can follow you for ever .     he appeared to pull himself together and continued     on the whole  the rust dynasty  though not exactly empowered with brains  tends to be an honourable and patriotic bunch  by and large  am i not right  drumknott .      drumknott meticulously and unnecessarily tidied some paperwork and said     it is indeed so .  young gravid is a regrettable exception .         do you think him beyond redemption .     said vetinari .      quite likely not     said drumknott  carefully folding a pen wiper .     however  arachne is working in fourecks at the moment as a filing clerk in our embassy .  she pleaded for the position because she   s particularly attracted by venomous spiders .         well  i suppose every girl should have a hobby     said vetinari .     and are there a lot of them in fourecks .         the place is positively overwhelmed  i am given to understand  sir  and apparently arachne already has a large selection of them .      vetinari said nothing  but remained sitting with eyes closed .   drumknott cleared his throat .     they do say  sir  that in the end all sins are forgiven .      reluctantly  havelock  lord vetinari tore his recollection away from the wondrous music that he longed to hear again .     not all  drumknott  not all .      in bed that night in scoone avenue  listening to the absence of owls and nightjars  vimes said     you know  dear  i   ll have to go back to the shires soon .  feeney is a good lad but they need a proper headquarters and the right kind of guidance and that doesn   t mean just nobby nobbs and fred colon .      sybil turned over .     oh  i don   t know  sam .  fred and nobby aren   t as bad as all that and might be all that   s needed right now .  i mean  they   re coppers  but they amble about extremely slowly and on the whole it   s good to see them around .  right now you   ve got two young men full of vim and vigour and if you don   t want to upset things it might just be that  in that bewildered place  they should be backed up by slow and steady  don   t you think .         you are  as always  right  my dear .         besides  i   ve seen fred  and having to rethink his world view has clearly shaken him a little .         he   ll get over it     said vimes .     once you get past the stupid fred there is  against all expectations  a decent man there .      sybil sighed .     yes  sam  but that decent man needs a holiday out in the sunshine away from the smoke and the grime and the terrible spells .         but they   re the best bits .     said vimes  laughing .      no  he needs a holiday .  everybody needs a holiday  sam  even you .         i   ve just had one  dear  thank you .         no  you had a few days interspersed with fighting and floods and murders and i don   t know what else .  look at your desk  make certain everybody is on their toes  and then we   ll go down there for another week  do you hear me  sam vimes .            the exchange scheme with the quirm gendarmerie was working very well  they were getting instruction on policing    la vimes  while the food in the pseudopolis yard canteen had been improved out of all recognition by captain emile  even though he used far too much avec .     and thenceforth would be glad to get a gentle second place in almost every domestic decision .  lady sybil took the view that her darling husband   s word was law for the city watch while  in her own case  it was a polite suggestion to be graciously considered .     apart  that is  from the line of artistically naked ladies along its parapets .  they were holding urns  urns is art .     it was tricky  to vimes all men were equal but  well  obviously a sergeant wasn   t as equal as a captain and a captain wasn   t as equal as a commander and as for corporal nobby nobbs     well  nobody could be the equal of corporal nobby nobbs .     metal  in the circumstances  would not be appropriate     or safe .     not to mention blackboard monitor vimes  a figure of note in dwarfish society .     willikins was an excellent butler and or gentleman   s gentleman when the occasion required it  but in a long career he had also been an enthusiastic street fighter  and knew enough never to turn his back on anybody who could possibly have a weapon on them .     later on vimes pondered willikins    accurate grasp of the plural noun in the circumstances  but there you were  if someone hung around in houses with lots of books in them  some of it rubbed off just as  come to think of it  it had on vimes .     more than once watchmen had found handwritten suicide notes which on careful examination weren   t in the right handwriting .      saddle pork was invented some time around the year of the stoat by reverend joseph    causality    robinson  rector of all saints and three sinners in the parish of lower overhang .  as far as can be determined from notes made by his contemporaries  the game may be considered an amalgam of spillikins  halma and brandy .  no known rules exist  if  indeed  there ever really were any .      sybil had explained to vimes that in the country one dresses at least a decade earlier than in the city  hence the bustle  and  for vimes  a pair of breeches  the ancient ones with trap doors front and rear and a slightly distressing smell all over .      see dr bentley purchase  the vicar is coming to tea and one hundred and twenty seven other warnings of social embarrassment  unseen university press  .      it was all a mystery to vimes  who was absolutely sure that it was impossible to tell the difference between a chicken fart and a turkey fart  but there were those who professed to be able to do so  and he was glad that such people had chosen this outlet for their puzzling inclinations rather than  for example  fill their sink with human skulls  collected in the high street .      because he wasn   t allowed much time talking .      the fourth gumption to run the tobacco house and snuff mill felt that his surname lacked prestige  and for some reason chose the name    bewilderforce        which did indeed become prestigious owing to the success of his tobacco enterprise  which was extremely well thought of by the gentry and others .  and thereafter there was at least one bewilderforce in every generation of the line  although girls were generally named bewildred  .      a glint is  in fact  a visual tinkle .      this is  of course  absolutely true .      the colons had survived a long and happy marriage by having as little to do with each other as possible .  this was achieved by the expedient of his working the night shift when she was working days  and vice versa .  they had agreed this on the basis that anything else would have spoiled the romance .      strictly speaking  the sexuality of any given dwarf remained a secret between him  or  as it might be  her  and his or  as it might be  her mother  until they decided to tell someone else about it  although generally you could work it out by observing dwarfs closely and spotting the ones who were drinking sherry or light white wine .  regrettably  this didn   t always work with dwarf policemen  because like all policemen everywhere they would drink anything strong enough to help them forget what they   d had to deal with that day .      according to dwarf lore the universe was written into being by tak  who also wrote its lores .  all writing is sacred to the dwarfs .      however that might be rendered in a language that at its best sounded like a man jumping up and down on a very large packet of crisps .      regrettably  constable upshot was overly hopeful  in ankh morpork the mice and the cockroaches had decided to forget their differences and gang up on the humans .      which were  in fact  a permanency in any case .      wee mad arthur was  as a feegle  a very economical watchman to have  given that  size for size  he ate in a year what human watchmen ate in a week  although it had to be admitted he could drink  size for size  more alcohol in a week than any human watchman could drink in a year .      the first two being common theft and public indecency .      a race of freshwater mariners found everywhere in and around the sto plains .  they are said to be incapable of lying  although this piece of information has been provided by the zoons themselves  causing  as it were  a philosophical conundrum .  certainly it is maintained that they find the concept of a lie so difficult to understand that the few among them who have mastered the technique are venerated and given high office in zoon society .      technically  the violent surge of water on old treachery was written down in technical manuals as a dam slam  but anyone who has experienced one learns to swear  hence the subtle change of name .      constable haddock   s immediate nickname when he joined the force was kipper  because policemen   s minds worked that way .      or three or four  as far as vimes the landlubber was concerned .      the sound of the gentle rattle of china cup on china saucer drives away all demons  a little known fact .      the three disgraces were apparently the daughters of blind io  but you know how people talk   they were nudicia  pulchritudia and voluptia .      that is to say  something bigger than he in fact is  which will turn very nasty if you think you can give this copper in front of you now a seeing to because you are afloat to the tonsils on beer .      or  perhaps  somebody else   s .      for those unfamiliar with them  periwinkles  like cockles and whelks  might be considered the snot of the sea .      it had been said by someone years before that to see sybil ramkin   s upholstered bosom rise and fall was to understand the history of empires .       epilogue   and three months later sam vimes went on holiday again  and this time he was allowed to steer the black eyed susan all the way to quirm  hardly hitting anything important  and was so happy that they had to find another cat full of sixpences for him to be as happy as .   he was amazed at how much fun a holiday could be  but not so amazed as he was eight months after that when he and sybil were invited to be guests at the wedding of ms emily gordon to the eldest son of sir abuthknott makewar  owner of the famous makewar pottery manufactory and incidentally the inventor of makewar   s crispy nuts  the breakfast cereal of champions  without whose nourishing roughage the bowels of ankh morpork would be more congested than was good for them .  the vimeses    wedding present was a silver egg coddler  sybil being of the view that you can   t go wrong with a coddled egg .   and vimes was gratified when he noticed at the ceremony that one of the gordon daughters was wearing a spanking new nurse   s uniform  and three others were sporting some quite fabulous and also  to sybil   s great glee  quite scandalous bonnets from the new gordon bonnets range .   there was an apology from the axe wielding hermione  who  according to her mother  was detained in the woods dealing with a very large and troublesome pinus  which caused vimes   s face to go blank until sybil nudged him and pointed out that pinus strobus was the official name for the white pine .   but most of all  later that year  vimes was totally amazed to find that the bestselling novel taking the ankh morpork literary world by storm was dedicated to commander samuel vimes .   the title of the book was pride and extreme prejudice .
