the backward look  isaac asimov   the backward look  was purchased by george scithers  and appeared in the september      issue of asimov s  with an interior illustration by jack gaughan .   a good case could be made for the proposition that the late isaac asimov was the most famous sf writer of the last half of the twentieth century .  he was the author of almost five hundred books  including some of the best known novels in the genre  i  robot and the foundation trilogy  for example   his last several novels kept him solidly on the nationwide bestseller lists throughout the   s  he won two nebulas and two hugos  plus the prestigious grandmaster nebula  he wrote an enormous number of nonfiction books on a bewilderingly large range of topics  everything from the bible to shakespeare  and his many books on scientific matters made him perhaps the best known scientific popularizer of our time  his nonfiction articles appeared everywhere from omni to tv guide  he was one of the most sought after speakers in the country  and appeared on most of the late night and afternoon talk shows of his day  and even did television commercials and he was also the only sf writer famous enough to have had an sf magazine named after him  asimov s science fiction magazine .  a mere sampling ofasimov s other books  even restricting ourselves to science fiction alone  would include the stars like dust  the currents of space  the gods themselves  foundation s edge  the robots of dawn  robots and empire  foundation s earth  and two expansions of famous asimov short stories into novel form  the ugly little boy and nightfall  written in collaboration with robert silverberg .  his most recent fiction titles include the novel forward the foundation  and the posthumous collections gold and fantasy .   asimov was almost as well known in the mystery field as he was in sf  for novels such as murder at the aba as well as for the long running series of stories about that club of suave amateur investigators  the black widowers .  he was also one of the most successful practitioners of the art of blending sf and mystery  with his series of stories about sf armchair detective wendell urth  as well as what are perhaps still the two most successful hybrid sf mys tery novels ever written  the caves of steel and the naked sun  featuring the robot detective r .  daneel olivaw .   here he shows us once again the truth of that old saying  don t look back  you don t know what may be gaining on you  .  .  .   if emmanuel rubin knew how not to be didactic  he never exercised that knowledge .    when you write a short story   he said   you had better know the ending first .  the end of a story is only the end to a reader .  to a writer  it s the beginning .  if you don t know exactly where you re going every minute that you re writing  you ll never get there or anywhere .    thomas trumbull s young guest at this particular monthly banquet of the black widowers seemed all eyes as he watched rubin s straggly gray beard quiver and his thick lensed glasses glint  and all ears as he listened to rubin s firm  de cibelic voice .   the guest himself was clearly in the early twenties  quite thin  with a somewhat bulging forehead and a rather diminutive chin .  his clothing almost glistened in its freshness  as though he had broken out a brand new costume for the great occasion .  his name was milton peterborough .   he said  a small quiver in his voice   does that mean you have to write an outline  mr .  rubin .     no   said rubin  emphatically .   you can if you want to  but i never do .  you don t have to know the exact road you re going to take .  you have to know your destination  that s all .  once that s the case  any road will take you there .  as you write you are continually looking backward from that known destination  and it s that backward look that guides you .    mario gonzalo  who was quickly and carefully drawing a caricature of the guest  making his eyes incredibly large and filling them with a childlike innocence  said   come on  manny  that sort of tight plotting might fit your cockamamie mysteries  but a real writer deals with character  doesn t he .  he creates people  and they behave in accordance with their characters  and that guides the story  probably to the surprise of the author .    rubin turned slowly and said   if you re talking about long  invertebrate novels  mario assuming you re talking about anything at all it s possible for an experienced or gifted writer to meander along and produce something passable .  but you can always tell the i don t know where i m going but i m going book .  even if you forgive it its amorphous character for the sake of its virtues  you have to forgive it  and that s a strain and a drawback .  a tightly plotted story with everything fitting together neatly is  on the other hand  the noblest work of literature .  it may be bad  but it never need ask forgiveness .  the backward look    at the other end of the room  geoffrey avalon glanced with resignation at rubin and said   i think it was a mistake  tom  to tell manny at the start that the young man was an aspiring writer .  it brings out the worst in him  or at any rate the longest winded .   he stirred the ice in his drink with his forefinger and brought his dark eyebrows together forbiddingly .    actually   said thomas trumbull  his lined face uncharacteristically placid     the kid wanted to meet manny .  he admired his stories  god knows why .  well  he s the son of a friend of mine and a nice youngster and i thought i d expose him to the seamy side of life by bringing him here .    avalon said   it won t hurt us to be exposed to youth now and then  either .  but i hate being exposed to rubin s theories of literature .  henry .    the quiet and smoothly efficient waiter  who served at all the black widowers  banquets  was at his side at once without seeming to have moved in order to have achieved that .     yes  sir .     henry   said avalon   what are these strange manifestations .      henry said   tonight we will have a buffet dinner .  the chef has prepared a variety of indian and pakistani dishes .     with curry .     rather heavy on the curry  sir .  it was mr .  trumbull s special request .    trumbull flared under avalon s accusing eye .   i wanted curry and i m the host .     and manny won t eat it and will be unbearable .    trumbull shrugged .   rubin was not entirely unbearable but he was loud  and only roger halsted seemed unaffected by the rubinian tirade against all things indian .  he said   a buffet is a good idea   patted his lips with his napkin and went back for a third help ing of everything  with a beatific smile on his face .   trumbull said   roger  if you don t stop eating  we ll start the grilling session over your chewing .     go ahead   said halsted  cheerfully .   i don t mind .     you will later tonight   said rubin   when your stomach wall burns through .    trumbull said   and you re going to start the grilling .     if you don t mind my talking with my mouth full   said halsted .    get started  then .    halsted said thickly   how do you justify your existence  milton  .     i can t   said peterborough   a little breathlessly .   maybe after i get my degrees .     what s your school and major .      columbia and chemistry .     chemistry .   said halsted .   i would have thought it was english .  didn t i gather during the cocktail hour that you were an aspiring writer .     anyone is allowed to be an aspiring writer   said peterborough  .    aspiring   said rubin  darkly .    and what do you want to write .   said halsted .   peterborough hesitated and said  with a trace of defensive ness in his voice   well  i ve always been a science fiction fan .  since i was nine  anyway .     oh  god   muttered rubin  his eyes rolling upward in mute appeal .   gonzalo said instantly   science fiction .  that s what your friend isaac asimov writes  isn t it  manny .     he s not my friend   said rubin .   he clings to me out of helpless admiration .    trumbull raised his voice .   will you two stop having a private conversation .  go on  roger .     have you written any science fiction .     i ve tried  but i haven t submitted anything .  i m going to  though .  i have to .     why do you have to .     i made a bet .     what kind .     well   said peterborough   helplessly .   it s rather complicated and embarrassing .     we don t mind the complications   said halsted   and we ll try not to be embarrassed .     well   said peterborough   and there appeared on his face something that had not been seen at the black widowers banquets for years  a richly tinted blush   there s this girl .  i m sort of era i like her  but i don t think she likes me  but i like her anyway .  the trouble is she goes for a basketball player  a real idiot six foot five to his eyebrows and nothing above .    peterborough shook his head and continued   i don t have much going for me .  i can t impress her with chemistry  but she s an english lit major  so i showed her some of my stories .  she asked me if i had ever sold anything  and i said no .  but then i said i intended to write something and sell it  and she laughed .    that bothered me  and i thought of something .  it seems that lester del rey     rubin interposed .   who .     lester del rey .  he s a science fiction writer .     another one of those .   said rubin .   never heard of him .     well  he s no asimov   admitted peterborough    but he s all right .  anyway  the way he got started was once when he read a science fiction story and thought it was terrible .  he said to his girl   hell  i can write something better than that   and she said   i dare you   and he did and sold it .    so when this girl laughed  i said   i ll bet i write one and sell it   and she said   i ll bet you don t   and i said   i ll bet you a date against five dollars .  if i sell the story  you go with me to a dinner and dance on a night of my choosing .   and she agreed .    so i ve just got to write the story now  because she said she d go out with me if i wrote the story and she liked it  even if it didn t sell which may mean she likes me more than i think .    james drake  who had been listening thoughtfully  brushed his gray stub of a mustache with one finger and said   or that she s quite confident that you won t even write the story .     i will   said peterborough  .    then go ahead   said rubin .    there s a catch .  i can write the story  i know .  i ve got some good stuff .  i even know the ending so i can give it that backward look you mentioned  mr .  rubin .  what i don t have is a motive .     a motive .   said rubin .   i thought you were writing a science fiction story .     yes  mr .  rubin  but it s a science fiction mystery  and i need a motive .  i have the modus operandi of the killing  and the way of killing but i don t know the why of the killing .  i thought  though  if i came here  i could discuss it with you .     you could what .   said rubin  lifting his head .    especially you  mr .  rubin .  i ve read your mystery stories i don t read science fiction exclusively and i think they re great .  you re always so good with motivation .  i thought you could help me out .    rubin was breathing hard and gave every appearance of believing that that breath was flame .  he had made his dinner very much out of rice and salad  plus  out of sheer famishing  two helpings of coupe aux marrons  and he was in no mood for even such sweet reason as he was  on occasion  observed to possess .   he said   let me get it straight  joe college  .  you ve made a bet .  you re going to get a chance at a girl  or such chance as you can make of it  by writing a story she likes and maybe selling it and now you want to win the bet and cheat the girl by having me write the story for you .  is that the way it is .     no  sir   said peterborough   urgently   that s not the way it is .  i ll write it .  i just want help with the motive .     and except for that  you ll write it   said rubin .   how about having me dictate the story to you .  you can still write it .  you can copy it out in your own handwriting .     that s not the same at all .       yes   it is  young man  and you can stop right there .  either write the story yourself or tell the girl you can t .    milton peterborough looked about helplessly .   trumbull said     damn it  manny  why so much on the high horse .  i ve heard you say a million times that ideas are a dime a dozen  that it s the writing that s hard .  give him an idea  then  he ll still have the hard part to do .     i won t   said rubin  pushing himself away from the table and crossing his arms .   if the rest of you have an atrophied sense of ethics  go ahead and give him ideas if you know how .    trumbull said   all right  i can settle this by fiat since i m the host  but i ll throw it open to a vote .  how many favor helping the kid if we can .    he held up his hand  and so did gonzalo and drake .   avalon cleared his throat a little uncertainly .   i m afraid i ve got to side with manny .  it would be cheating the girl   he said .   halsted said   as a teacher  i ve got to disapprove of outside help on a test .     tie vote   said rubin .   what are you going to do  tom .    trumbull said   we haven t all voted .  henry is a black widower and his vote will break the tie .  henry .    henry paused a brief moment .   my honorary position  sir  scarcely gives me the right to     you are not an honorary black widower  henry .  you are a black widower .  decide .    rubin said   remember  henry  you are the epitome of honest men .  where do you stand on cheating a girl .     no electioneering   said trumbull  .   go ahead  henry .    henry s face wrinkled into a rare frown .   i have never laid claim to extraordinary honesty  but if i did  i might treat this as a special case .  juliet told romeo   at lovers  perjuries they say jove laughs .   might we stretch a point .     i m surprised  henry   said rubin .   henry said     i am perhaps swayed by the fact that i do not view this matter as lying between the young man and the young woman .  rather it lies between a bookish young man and an athlete .  we are all bookish men  and  in our time  we may each have lost a young woman to an athlete .  i am embarrassed to say that i have .  surely  then    rubin said   well  i haven t .  i ve never lost a girl to   he paused a moment in sudden thought  then said in an altered tone   well  it s irrelevant .  all right  if i m outvoted  i m outvoted .  so what s the story  peterborough  .    peterborough  s face was flushed and there was a trickle of perspiration at one temple .  he said   i won t tell you any of the story i ve been planning except the barest essentials of the point i need help on .  i don t want anything more than the minimum .  i wouldn t want that  even  if this didn t mean  so much   he ran down .   rubin said  with surprising quietness   go on .  don t worry about it .  we understand .    peterborough said   thanks .  i appreciate it .  i ve got two men  call them murderer and victim .  i ve worked out the way murderer does it and how he gets caught and i won t say a word about that .  murderer and victim are both eclipse buffs .    avalon interrupted .   are you an eclipse buff  mr .  peterborough .     yes  sir  i am .  i have friends who go to every eclipse anywhere in the world even if it s only a five percenter  but i can t afford that and don t have the time .  i go to those i can reach .  i ve got a telescope and photographic equipment .    avalon said   good .  it helps  when one is going to talk about eclipses  if one knows something about them .  trying to write on a subject concerning which one is ignorant is a sure prescription for failure .    gonzalo said   is the woman you re interested in an eclipse buff .     no   said peterborough  .   i wish she were .     you know   said gonzalo   if she doesn t share your interests  you might try finding someone who does .    peterborough shook his head .   i don t think it works that way  mr .  gonzalo .     it sure doesn t   said trumbull  .   shut up  mario  and let him talk .    peterborough said   murderer and victim are both taking eclipse photographs  and  against all expectations  victim  who is the underdog  the born loser  takes the better photograph  and murderer  unable to endure this  decides to kill victim .  from there on  i have no trouble .    rubin said   then you have your motive .  what s your problem .      the trouble is what kind of a better photograph .  an eclipse photograph is an eclipse photograph .  some are better than others  but  assuming that both photographers are competent  not that much better .  not a murder s worth better .    rubin shrugged .   you can build the story in such a way as to make even a small difference murder worthy but i admit that would take an experienced hand .  drop the eclipse .  try something else .     i can t .  the whole business of the murder  the weapon and the detection depends on photography and eclipses .  so it has to stay .    drake said softly   what makes it a science fiction story  young man .     i haven t explained that  have i .  i m trying to tell as little as possible about the story .  for what i m doing  i need advanced computers and science fictional photographic gimmickry .  one of the two characters i m not sure which  takes a photograph of the eclipse from a stratospheric jet .     in that case  why not go whole hog .   said gonzalo .   if it s going to go science fictional .  .  .  look  let me tell you how i see it .  murderer and victim are eclipse buffs and murderer is the better man so make it murderer who s on that plane  and taking the best eclipse photograph ever seen  using some new photographic gimmick he s invented .  then have victim  against all expectation  beat him out .  victim goes to the moon and takes the eclipse photograph there .  murderer is furious at being beaten  goes blind with rage and there you are .    rubin said energetically   an eclipse photo on the moon .     why not .   said gonzalo  offended .   we can get to the moon right now so we can certainly do it in a science fiction story .  and there s a vacuum on the moon  right .  there s no air .  you don t have to be a scientist to know that .  and you get a better picture without air .  you get a sharper picture .  isn t that right  milton .    peterborough said   yes  but    rubin overrode him .   mario   he said   listen carefully .  an eclipse of the sun takes place when the moon gets exactly between the sun and the earth .  observers on earth then see the sun blacked out because the opaque body of the moon is squarely in front of it .  we on earth are in the moon s shadow .  now if you re on the moon   his voice grew harsh   how the hell can you be in the moon s shadow .    avalon said   not so fast  manny  an eclipse is an eclipse is an eclipse .  there is such a thing as a lunar eclipse  when the earth gets between the sun and the moon .  the moon is in the earth s shadow in that case and the whole moon gets dark .    the way i see it  then  is that murderer takes a beautiful photograph of an eclipse on earth  with the moon moving in front of the sun .  he has advanced equipment that he has invented himself so that no one can possibly take a better photo of the moon in front of the sun .  victim  however  goes him one better by taking an even more impressive photograph of an eclipse on the moon  where  as mario says  there is no air  with the earth moving in front of the sun .    peterborough mumbled   not the same thing .     it sure isn t   said halsted  who had pushed his coffee cup to one side and was doing some quick figuring .   as seen from earth  the moon and the sun have the same apparent width  almost exactly .  pure coincidence  of course  no astronomical necessity at all .  in fact  eons past  the moon was closer and appeared larger  and eons future  the moon will be well  never mind .  the fact is that the earth is larger than the moon  and from the moon you see the earth at the same distance that you see the moon when you re standing on earth .  the earth in the moon s sky is therefore as much larger than the moon in appearance as it is in actuality .  do you get that .     no   said gonzalo  flatly .   halsted looked annoyed .   well  then  don t get it .  take my word for it .  the earth in the moon s sky is about    as wide in appearance as the moon is in earth s sky .  that means the earth in the moon s sky is also that much bigger than the sun  because the sun looks just the same from the moon as from the earth .     so what s the difference .   said gonzalo .   if the earth is bigger  it gets in the way of the sun that much better .     no   said halsted .   the whole point about the eclipse is that the moon just fits over the sun .  it hides the bright circle of the gleaming sun and allows its corona that is  its upper atmosphere to shine all about the hidden sun .  the corona gleams out in every direction with the light of the full moon and does so in beautifully delicate curves and streamers .    on the other hand  if you get a large body like the earth in front of the sun  it covers up the shining sphere and the corona as well .  you don t see anything .    avalon said   that s assuming the earth goes squarely in front of the sun .  when you see the eclipse before or after midpoint  at least part of the corona will stick beyond the earth s sphere .    peterborough said   part isn t the whole .  it wouldn t be the same thing .    there was a short silence  and then drake said   i hope you don t mind if a fellow chemist tries his hand at this  young man .  i m trying to picture the earth in the sky  getting in the way of the sun .  and if we do that  then there s this to consider  the earth has an atmosphere and the moon has not .    when the moon moves in front of the sun  as viewed from the earth  the moon s surface is sharp against the sun .  when the earth moves in front of the sun  as viewed from the moon  the earth s boundary is fuzzy and the sun shines through earth s atmosphere .  does that make a difference that you can use in the story .     well   said peterborough    i ve thought of that  actually .  even when the sun is completely behind the earth  its light is refracted through the earth s atmosphere on every side  and a red orange light penetrates it and reaches the moon .  it s as though the moon can see a sunset all around the earth .  and that s not just theory .  when there s a total eclipse of the moon  you can usually see the moon as a dull brick red circle of light .  it gleams in earth s sunset atmosphere .      as the eclipse  as viewed from the moon  progresses  that side of the atmosphere that has just passed over the sun is brighter  but grows gradually dimmer while the other side grows brighter .  at eclipse mid point  if you are viewing it from a part of the moon which sees both earth and sun centered with respect to each other  the red orange ring is evenly bright all the way around assuming there isn t too much in the way of clouds in earth s atmosphere at the time .    drake said   well  for god s sake  isn t that a sufficiently spectacular sight for victim to photograph .  the earth would be a black hole in the sky  with a thin orange rim all around .  it would be      no  sir   said peterborough  .   it isn t the same thing .  it s too dull .  it would be just a red orange ring .  once the photograph is taken the first time  that would be it .  it wouldn t be like the infinitely varying corona .    trumbull said   let me try .  you want the corona visible all around  is that it  milton  .      yes  sir .     stop me if i m wrong  but in my reading  i ve been given to understand that the sky is blue because light is scattered by the atmosphere .  on the moon  where there is no atmosphere  the sky is black .  the stars  which on earth are washed out by the scattered light of our blue sky  would not be washed out in the moon s airless sky .  they would be visible .     yes  though i suspect the sun s glare would make them hard to see .    trumbull said   that s not important .  all you would have to do is cut an opaque circle of metal and hold it up in the air at the proper distance from your photographic equipment in order to just block out the sun s blazing disc .  you can t do that on earth  because even if you blocked out the sun  the scattered light of the sky obscures the corona .  on the moon  there s no scattered light in the sky and the corona would shine out .    peterborough said   in theory  that s possible .  in fact  it can even be done on earth on mountain tops  making use of a coronagraph .  it still wouldn t be the real thing  though  for it s not just a matter of light scattered by the atmosphere .  there s light scattered and reflected by the ground .      the lunar surface would be very brightly lit up and light would be coming in from every angle .  the photographs you would take would not be good ones .  you see  the reason the moon does the good job it does here on earth is that its shadow doesn t just fall on the telescope and camera .  it falls on all the surrounding landscape .  the shadow of the moon can  under ideal conditions  be     miles wide and cover        square miles of the earth s surface .  usually  it s considerably smaller than that  but generally it s enough to cover the immediate landscape that is  if it happens to be a total eclipse .    trumbull said   a bigger opaque object  then     it would have to be quite big and quite far away   said peterborough    to achieve the effect .  that would be too cumbersome .    halsted said   wait  i think i have it .  you would need something big for the purpose  all right .  suppose there were spherical space settlements in the moon s orbit .  if victim is in a spaceship and gets the space settlement between himself and the sun  that would be exactly what he wants .  he could arrange to be close enough to have the shadow which  of course  is conical and narrows to a point if you get far enough away to be just thick enough to enclose his entire ship .  there would be no world surface to reflect light  and there you are .    peterborough said  uneasily   i hadn t thought of that .  it s possible .    halsted grinned  and a flush of pleasure mounted to the hairline he had once had .   that s it  then .    peterborough said   i don t want to be troublesome  but  but if we introduce the space motif  it s going to create some problems in the rest of the story .  it s sort of important that everything stay on or near the earth and yet that there be something so startling and unexpected that it would    he paused and rubin completed the sentence for him   so startling and unexpected that it would drive murderer to rage and vengeance .     yes .     well   said rubin   since i m the master of mystery here  i think i can work it out for you without leaving earth very far behind  just as soon as i get some points straightened out .  you said that murderer is taking the photographs from a plane .  why .     oh .  that s because the moon s shadow  when it falls on earth  moves quickly up to      miles an hour or about   .   miles a second .  if you re standing in one place on earth  the longest possible duration of a total eclipse is seven minutes and then the shadow has moved beyond you .  that s when the earth is as deep into the moon s shadow as it ever gets .  when the earth isn t as deep in and is nearer the final point of the shadow  the total eclipse may last only a couple of minutes  or even only a few seconds .  in fact  more than half the time  the moon s shadow during an eclipse doesn t reach the  earth s surface at all  and when the moon is squarely in front of the sun  the sun overlaps it on all sides .  that s an  annular eclipse  and enough sunlight then slips past the moon to wash out everything .  an annular eclipse is no good at all .     but in the airplane .   prompted rubin .    in an airplane  you can race along with the shadow and make the total eclipse last for an hour or more even if it would only endure a very short time on one position on earth .  you have a great deal more time to take photographs and make scientific observations .  that s not science fictional  it s done right now .     can you take very good pictures from the plane .   asked rubin .   does it allow a steady enough basis for photography .     in my story   said peterborough    i ve got a computer guiding the plane  allowing for wind movements  and keeping it perfectly steady .  that s one of the places where the science fiction comes in .     still  the moon s shadow eventually leaves the earth s surface altogether  doesn t it .     yes  the eclipse track covers a fixed portion of the earth s surface  and it has an overall starting point and an overall ending point .     exactly   said rubin .   now murderer is confident that his photographs taken from the stratosphere are going to include the best views of an eclipse ever seen  but he doesn t count on victim s having a spaceship .  don t worry  there s no need to leave earth very far .  it s just that the spaceship follows the moon s shadow after it leaves the earth .  victim has a still longer chance to take photographs  a steadier base  and no atmospheric interference whatever .  murderer is hoist on his own petard for he sees that poor simp  victim  do exactly what he does but go him one better .  he snaps and becomes a killer .    gonzalo waved both arms in the air in excitement .   wait .  wait .  we can do even better than that .  listen  what about that annular eclipse you mentioned a while ago .  you said the shadow doesn t reach the earth .     it doesn t reach the surface .  that s right .     how high off the surface is it .     that depends .  under extreme conditions  the end point of the shadow could miss the earth by hundreds of miles .     yes   said gonzalo   but could that end point miss earth by  say  ten miles .     oh  sure .     would it still be annular  and no good .     that s right   said peterborough  .   the moon would come just barely short of covering the sun .  there would be just the thinnest sliver of sun around the moon  and that would give enough light to spoil things .  if you took photographs  you d miss the prominences  the flares  and the corona .     but what if you went ten miles up into the atmosphere .   said gonzalo .   then you d see it total  wouldn t you .     if you were in the right spot  yes .     there it is  then .  one of those annular eclipses comes along  and murderer thinks he ll pull a fast one .  he gets into his stratoplane  goes ten miles up to get into the point of the shadow or just over it  and follows it along .  he s going to make a total eclipse out of an annular one and victim  the usual loser  does the same thing  except he uses a spaceship and follows it out into space and gets better pictures .  what can get old murderer more torn up than having him play his ace and getting trumped .    avalon nodded his head .   good  mario .  that is an improvement .    rubin looked as if he had unexpectedly bitten into a lemon .   i hate to say it  mario     you don t have to say it  manny   said gonzalo .   i see it all over you .  there you are  kid .  write the story .    peterborough said  with a sigh   yes  i suppose that is the best that can be done .     you don t sound overjoyed   said gonzalo .    i was hoping for something more uh outrageous  but i don t think it exists .  if none of you could think up anything     may i interrupt  sir .   said henry .    huh .  oh no  i don t want any more coffee  waiter   said peterborough   absently .    no  sir .  i mean  concerning the eclipse .    trumbull said   henry s a member of the club  martin .  he broke the tie on the matter of the discussion .  remember .     peterborough put a hand to his forehead .   oh  sure .  ask away uh henry .      actually  sir  would the photographs be that much better in a vacuum than in the thin air of the stratosphere .  would the difference in quality be enough to result in murder  unless murderer was a close approach to a homicidal maniac .     that s the thing   said peterborough   nodding .   that s what bothers me .  that s why i keep saying i need a motive .  these differences in quality of photos aren t big enough .     let us consider  then   said henry   mr .  rubin s dictum that in telling a story one should look backward .     i know the ending   said peterborough  .   i have the backward look .     i mean it in another sense that of deliberately looking in the other direction  the unaccustomed direction .  in an eclipse  we always look at the moon just the moon in a lunar eclipse  and the moon covering the sun in a solar eclipse and that s what we take photographs of .  what if we take a backward look at the earth .     what s to see on earth  henry .   asked gonzalo .    when the moon moves into the earth s shadow  it is always in the full phase and it is usually completely darkened .  what happens to the earth when it moves into the moon s shadow .  it certainly doesn t darken completely .     no   said peterborough emphatically .   the moon s shadow is thinner and shorter than the earth s  and the earth itself is larger than the moon .  even when earth passes as deeply as it can into the moon s shadow  only a tiny bit of the earth is darkened  a little dot of darkness that makes up  at most  about       of the earth s circle of light .       could you see it from the moon .    asked henry .    if you knew where to look and especially if you had a good pair of binoculars .  you would see it start small  move west to east across the face of the earth  getting bigger  then smaller  and then vanish .  interesting  but certainly not spectacular .     not from the moon  sir   said henry .   now suppose we reverse the positions of the characters .  it is victim who has the airplane and who can get a photograph from the stratosphere .  it is murderer who intends to trump his opponent s ace by taking a better photograph from space a marginally better photograph .  suppose  though  that victim  against all expectations  from his airplane over trumps murderer in his spaceship .    avalon said   how can he do that  henry .     victim  in his plane  suddenly realizes he needn t look at the moon .  he looks backward at the ground and sees the moon s shadow  racing toward him .  the moon s shadow is just a dark dot when seen from the moon  it s just the coming of temporary night as seen from the earth s surface but from a plane in the stratosphere  it is a racing circle of darkness moving at      miles an hour  swallowing up the land and sea and clouds  for that matter as it goes .  the plane can move ahead of it  and it is no longer necessary to take single snapshots .  a movie camera can produce the most dramatic film .  in this way  murderer  having fully expected to outdo victim  finds that victim has captured world attention even though he had only an airplane to murderer s spaceship .    gonzalo broke into loud applause  and trumbull said   right on .   even rubin smiled and nodded .   as for peterborough   he fired up at once saying   sure .  and the approaching shadow would have a thin red rim  for at the moment the shadow overtakes you  the red prominences cast their light unmasked by the sun s white light .  that s it  henry .  the backward look does it .  if i write this one properly  i don t care even if it doesn t sell .  i won t care even   his voice shook   if uh she doesn t like it and doesn t go out with me .  the story is more important .    henry smiled gently and said   i m glad to hear that  sir .  a writer should always have a proper sense of priorities .
