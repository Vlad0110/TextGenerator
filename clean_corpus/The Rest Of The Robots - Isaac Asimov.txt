i the coming of the robots robot al    goes astray victory unintentional  ii the laws of robotics first law let s get together  iii susan calvin satisfaction guaranteed risk lenny galley slave  robot al    goes astray  jonathan quell s eyes crinkled worriedly behind their rimless glasses as he charged through the door labeled  general manager .   he slapped the folded paper in his hands upon the desk and panted   look at that  boss .   sam tobe juggled the cigar in his mouth from one cheek to the other  and looked .  his hand went to his unshaven jaw and rasped along it .   hell .   he exploded .   what are they talking about .    they say we sent out five al robots   quell explained  quite unnecessarily .   we sent six   said tobe .   sure  six .  but they only got five at the other end .  they sent out the serial numbers and al    is missing .   tobe s chair went over backward as he heaved his thick bulk upright and went through the door as if he were on greased wheels .  it was five hours after that with the plant pulled apart from assembly rooms to vacuum chambers  with every one of the plant s two hundred employees put through the third degree mill that a sweating  disheveled tobe sent an emergency message to the central plant at schenectady .  and at the central plant  a sudden explosion of near panic took place .  for the first time in the history of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation  a robot had escaped to the outer world .  it wasn t so much that the law forbade the presence of any robot on earth outside a licensed factory of the corporation .  laws could always be squared .  what was much more to the point was the statement made by one of the research mathematicians .  he said   that robot was created to run a disinto on the moon .  its positronic brain was equipped for a lunar environment  and only a lunar environment .  on earth it s going to receive seventy five umptillion sense impressions for which it was never prepared .  there s no telling what its reactions will be .  no telling .   and he wiped a forehead that had suddenly gone wet  with the back of his hand .  within the hour a stratoplane had left for the virginia plant .  the instructions were simple .   get that robot  and get it fast .    al    was confused .  in fact  confusion was the only impression his delicate positronic brain retained .  it had started when he had found himself in these strange surroundings .  how it had come about  he no longer knew .  everything was mixed up .  there was green underfoot  and brown shafts rose all about him with more green on top .  and the sky was blue where it should have been black .  the sun was all right  round and yellow and hot but where was the powdery pumice rock underfoot  where were the huge clifflike crater rings .  there was only the green below and the blue above .  the sounds that surrounded him were all strange .  he had passed through running water that had reached his waist .  it was blue and cold and wet .  and when he passed people  as he did  occasionally  they were without the space suits they should have been wearing .  when they saw him  they shouted and ran .  one man had leveled a gun at him and the bullet had whistled past his head and then that man had run too .  he had no idea of how long he had been wandering before he finally stumbled upon randolph payne s shack two miles out in the woods from the town of hannaford .  randolph payne himself a screwdriver in one hand  a pipe in the other and a battered ruin of a vacuum cleaner between his knees squatted outside the doorway .  payne was humming at the time  for he was a naturally happy go lucky soul when at his shack .  he had a more respectable dwelling place back in hannaford  but that dwelling place was pretty largely occupied by his wife  a fact which he silently but sincerely regretted .  perhaps  then  there was a sense of relief and freedom at such times as he found himself able to retire to his  special deluxe doghouse  where he could smoke in peace and attend to his hobby of reservicing household appliances .  it wasn t much of a hobby  but sometimes someone would bring out a radio or an alarm clock and the money he would get paid for juggling its insides was the only money he ever got that didn t pass in driblets through his spouse s niggardly hands .  this vacuum cleaner  for instance  would bring in an easy six bits .  at the thought he broke into song  raised his eyes  and broke into a sweat .  the song choked off  the eyes popped  and the sweat became more intense .  he tried to stand up as a preliminary to running like hell but he couldn t get his legs to cooperate .  and then al    had squatted down next to him and said   say  why did all the rest of them run .   payne knew quite well why they all ran  but the gurgle that issued from his diaphragm didn t show it .  he tried to inch away from the robot .  al    continued in an aggrieved tone   one of them even took a shot at me .  an inch lower and he would have scratched my shoulder plate .    m must have b been a nut   stammered payne .   that s possible .   the robot s voice grew more confidential .   listen  what s wrong with everything .   payne looked hurriedly about .  it had struck him that the robot spoke in a remarkably mild tone for one so heavily and brutally metallic in appearance .  it also struck him that he had heard somewhere that robots were mentally incapable of harming human beings .  he relaxed a bit .   there s nothing wrong with anything .    isn t there .   al    eyed him accusingly .   you re all wrong .  where s your space suit .    i haven t got any .    then why aren t you dead .   that stopped payne   well i don t know .    see .   said the robot triumphantly   there s something wrong with everything .  where s mount copernicus .  where s lunar station    .  and where s my disinto .  i want to get to work  i do .   he seemed perturbed  and his voice shook as he continued .   i ve been going about for hours trying to get someone to tell me where my disinto is  but they all run away .  by now i m probably  way behind schedule and the sectional executive will be as sore as blazes .  this is a fine situation .   slowly payne unscrambled the stew in which his brain found itself and said   listen  what do they call you .    my serial number is al    .   all right  al is good enough for me .  now  al  if you re looking for lunar station     that s on the moon  see .   al    nodded his head ponderously .   sure .  but i ve been looking for it    but it s on the moon .  this isn t the moon .   it was the robot s turn to become confused .  he watched payne for a speculative moment and then said slowly   what do you mean this isn t the moon .  of course it s the moon .  because if it isn t the moon  what is it  huh .  answer me that .   payne made a funny sound in his throat and breathed hard .  he pointed a finger at the robot and shook it .   look   he said and then the brilliant idea of the century struck him  and he finished with a strangled  wow .   al    eyed him censoriously .   that isn t an answer .  i think i have a right to a civil answer if i ask a civil question .   payne wasn t listening .  he was still marveling at himself .  why  it was as plain as day .  this robot was one built for the moon that had somehow gotten loose on earth .  naturally it would be all mixed up  because its positronic brain had been geared exclusively for a lunar environment  making its earthly surroundings entirely meaningless .  and now if he could only keep the robot here until he could get in touch with the men at the factory in petersboro .  why  robots were worth money .  the cheapest cost          he had once heard  and some of them ran into millions .  think of the reward .  man  oh  man  think of the reward .  and every cent for himself .  not as much as a quarter of a snifter of a plugged nickel for mirandy .  jumpin  tootin  blazes  no .  he rose to his feet at last .   al   he said   you and i are buddies .  pals .  i love you like a brother .   he thrust out a hand .   shake .   the robot swallowed up the offered hand in a metal paw and squeezed it gently .  he didn t quite understand .   does that mean you ll tell me how to get to lunar station    .   payne was a trifle disconcerted .   .  n no  not exactly .  as a matter of fact  i like you so much  i want you to stay here with me awhile .    oh no  i can t do that .  i ve got to get to work .   he shook his head .   how would you like to be falling behind your quota hour by hour and minute by minute .  i want to work .  i ve got to work .   payne thought sourly that there was no accounting for tastes  and said   all right  then  i ll explain something to you because i can see from the looks of you that you re an intelligent person .  i ve had orders from your sectional executive  and he wants me to keep you here for a while .  till he sends for you  in fact .    what for .   asked al    suspiciously .   i can t say .  it s secret government stuff .   payne prayed  inwardly and fervently  that the robot would swallow this .  some robots were clever  he knew  but this looked like one of the early models .  while payne prayed  al    considered .  the robot s brain  adjusted to the handling of a disinto on the moon  was not at its best when engaged in abstract thought  but just the same  ever since he had gotten lost  al    had found his thought processes becoming stranger .  the alien surroundings did something to him .  his next remark was almost shrewd .  he said slyly   what s my sectional executive s name .   payne gulped and thought rapidly .    al   he said in a pained fashion   you hurt me with this suspicion .  i can t tell you his name .  the trees have ears .   al    inspected the tree next to him stolidly and said   they have not .    i know .  what i mean is that spies are all around .    spies .    yes .  you know  bad people who want to destroy lunar station    .    what for .    because they re bad .  and they want to destroy you  and that s why you ve got to stay here for a while  so they can t find you .    but but i ve got to have a disinto .  i mustn t fall behind my quota .    you will have .  you will have   payne promised earnestly  and just as earnestly damned the robot s one track mind .   they re going to send one out tomorrow .  yeah  tomorrow .   that would leave plenty of time to get the men from the factory out here and collect beautiful green heaps of hundred dollar bills .  but al    grew only the more stubborn under the distressing impingement of the strange world all about him upon his thinking mechanism .   no   he said .   i ve got to have a disinto now .   stiffly he straightened his joints  jerking erect .   i d better look for it some more .   payne swarmed after and grabbed a cold  hard elbow .   listen   he squealed .   you ve got to stay   and something in the robot s mind clicked .  all the strangeness surrounding him collected itself into one globule .  exploded  and left a brain ticking with a curiously increased efficiency .  he whirled on payne .   i tell you what .  i can build a disinto right here and then i can work it .   payne paused doubtfully .   i don t think i can build one .   he wondered if it would do any good to pretend he could .   that s all right .   al    could almost feel the positronic paths of his brain weaving into a new pattern  and experienced a strange exhilaration .   i can build one .   he looked into payne s deluxe doghouse and said .   you ve got all the material here that i need .   randolph payne surveyed the junk with which his shack was filled  eviscerated radios  a topless refrigerator  rusty automobile engines  a broken down gas range  several miles of frayed wire  and  taking it all together  fifty tons or thereabouts of the most heterogeneous mass of old metal as ever caused a junkman to sniff disdainfully .   have i .   he said weakly .   two hours later  two things happened practically simultaneously .  the first was that sam tobe of the petersboro branch of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation received a visiphone call from one randolph payne of hannaford .  it concerned the missing robot  and tobe  with a deep throated snarl  broke connection halfway through and ordered all subsequent calls to be rerouted to the sixth assistant vice president in charge of buttonholes .  this was not really unreasonable of tobe .  during the past week  although robot al    had dropped from sight completely  reports had flooded in from all over the union as to the robot s whereabouts .  as many as fourteen a day came usually from fourteen different states .  tobe was almighty tired of it  to say nothing of being half crazy on general principles .  there was even talk of a congressional investigation  though every reputable roboticist and mathematical physicist on earth swore the robot was harmless .   in his state of mind  then  it is not surprising that it took three hours for the general manager to pause and consider just exactly how it was that this randolph payne had known that the robot was slated for lunar station     and  for that matter  how he had known that the robot s serial number was al    .  those details had not been given out by the company .  he kept on considering for about a minute and a half and then swung into action .  however  during the three hours between the call and the action  the second event took place .  randolph payne  having correctly diagnosed the abrupt break in his call as being due to general skepticism on the part of the plant official  returned to his shack with a camera .  they couldn t very well argue with a photograph  and he d be hornswoggled if he d show them the real thing before they came across with the cash .  al    was busy with affairs of his own .  half of the contents of payne s shack was littered over about two acres of ground  and in the middle of it the robot squatted and fooled around with radio tubes  hunks of iron  copper wire  and general junk .  he paid no attention to payne  who  sprawling flat on his belly  focused his camera for a beautiful shot .  and at this point it was that lemuel oliver cooper turned the bend in the road and froze in his tracks as he took in the tableau .  the reason for his coming in the first place was an ailing electric toaster that had developed the annoying habit of throwing out pieces of bread forcefully  but thoroughly untoasted .  the reason for his leaving was more obvious .  he had come with a slow  mildly cheerful  spring morning saunter .  he left with a speed that would have caused any college track coach to raise his eyebrows and purse his lips approvingly .  there was no appreciable slackening of speed until cooper hurtled into sheriff saunders  office  minus hat and toaster  and brought himself up hard against the wall .  kindly hands lifted him  and for half a minute he tried speaking before he had actually calmed down to the point of breathing with  of course  no result .  they gave him whisky and fanned him and when he did speak  it came out something like this    monster seven feet tall shack all busted up poor rannie payne   and so on .  they got the story out of him gradually  how there was a huge metal monster  seven feet tall  maybe even eight or nine  out at randolph payne s shack  how randolph payne himself was on his stomach  a  poor  bleeding  mangled corpse   how the monster was then busily engaged in wrecking the shack out of sheer destructiveness  how it had turned on lemuel oliver cooper  and how he  cooper  had made his escape by half a hair .  sheriff saunders hitched his belt tighter about his portly middle and said   it s that there machine man that got away from the petersboro factory .  we got warning on it last saturday .  hey  jake  you get every man in hannaford county that can shoot and slap a deputy s badge on him .  get them here at noon .  and listen  jake  before you do that  just drop in at the widow payne s place and lip her the bad news gentle like .   it is reported that miranda payne  upon being acquainted with events  paused only to make sure that her husband s insurance policy was safe  and to make a few pithy remarks concerning her foolishness in not having had him take out double the amount  before breaking out into as prolonged and heart wringing a wail of grief as ever became a respectable widow .   it was some hours later that randolph payne unaware of his horrible mutilation and death viewed the completed negatives of his snapshots with satisfaction .  as a series of portraits of a robot at work  they left nothing to the imagination .  they might have been labeled   robot gazing thoughtfully at vacuum tube    robot splicing two wires    robot wielding screwdriver    robot taking refrigerator apart with great violence   and so on .  as there now remained only the routine of making the prints themselves  he stepped out from beyond the curtain of the improvised darkroom for a bit of a smoke and a chat with al    .  in doing so  he was blissfully unaware that the neighboring woods were verminous with nervous farmers armed with anything from an old colonial relic of a blunderbuss to the portable machine gun carried by the sheriff himself .  nor  for that matter  had he any inkling of the fact that half a dozen roboticists  under the leadership of sam tobe  were smoking down the highway from petersboro at better than a hundred and twenty miles an hour for the sole purpose of having the pleasure and honor of his acquaintance .  so while things were jittering toward a climax  randolph payne sighed with self satisfaction  lighted a match upon the seat of his pants  puffed away at his pipe  and looked at al    with amusement .  it had been apparent for quite some time that the robot was more than slightly lunatic .  randolph payne was himself an expert at homemade contraptions  having built several that could not have been exposed to daylight without searing the eyeballs of all beholders  but he had never even conceived of anything approaching the monstrosity that al    was concocting .  it would have made the rube goldbergs of the day die in convulsions of envy .  it would have made picasso  if he could have lived to witness it  quit art in the sheer knowledge that he had been hopelessly surpassed .  it would have soured the milk in the udders of any cow within half a mile .  in fact  it was gruesome .  from a rusty and massive iron base that faintly resembled something payne had once seen attached to a secondhand tractor  it rose upward in rakish  drunken swerves through a bewildering mess of wires  wheels  tubes  and nameless horrors without number  ending in a megaphone arrangement that looked decidedly sinister .  payne had the impulse to peek in the megaphone part  but refrained .  he had seen far more sensible machines explode suddenly and with violence .  he said   hey  al .   the robot looked up .  he had been lying flat on his stomach  teasing a thin sliver of metal into place .   what do you want  payne .    what is this .   he asked it in the tone of one referring to something foul and decomposing  held gingerly between two ten foot poles .   it s the disinto i m making so i can start to work .  it s an improvement on the standard model .   the robot rose  dusted his knees clankingly  and looked at it proudly .  payne shuddered .  an  improvement  .  no wonder they hid the original in caverns on the moon .  poor satellite .  poor dead satellite .  he had always wanted to know what a fate worse than death was .  now he knew .   will it work .   he asked .     sure .    how do you know .    it s got to .  i made it  didn t i .  i only need one thing now .  got a flashlight .    somewhere  i guess .   payne vanished into the shack and returned almost immediately .  the robot unscrewed the bottom and set to work .  in five minutes he had finished .  he stepped back and said   all set .  now i get to work .  you may watch if you want to .   a pause  while payne tried to appreciate the magnanimity of the offer .   is it safe .    a baby could handle it .    oh .   payne grinned weakly and got behind the thickest tree in the vicinity .   go ahead   he said   i have the utmost confidence in you .   al    pointed to the nightmarish junk pile and said   watch .   his hands set to work   the embattled farmers of hannaford county  virginia  weaved up upon payne s shack in a slowly tightening circle .  with the blood of their heroic colonial forebears pounding their veins and goose flesh trickling up and down their spines they crept from tree to tree .  sheriff saunders spread the word .   fire when i give the signal and aim at the eyes .   jacob linker lank jake to his friends  and sheriff s deputy to himself edged close .   you think maybe this machine man has skedaddled .   he did not quite manage to suppress the tone of wistful hopefulness in his voice .   dunno   grunted the sheriff .   guess not  though .  we woulda come across him in the woods if he had  and we haven t .    but it s awful quiet  and it appears to me as if we re getting close to payne s place .   the reminder wasn t necessary .  sheriff saunders had a lump in his throat so big it had to be swallowed in three installments .   get back   he ordered   and keep your finger on the trigger .   they were at the rim of the clearing now  and sheriff saunders closed his eyes and stuck the corner of one out from behind the tree .  seeing nothing  he paused  then tried again  eyes open this time .  results were  naturally  better .  to be exact  he saw one huge machine man  back toward him  bending over one soul curdling  hiccupy contraption of uncertain origin and less certain purpose .  the only item he missed was the quivering figure of randolph payne  embracing the tree next but three to the nor  nor west .  sheriff saunders stepped out into the open and raised his machine gun .  the robot  still presenting a broad metal back  said in a loud voice to person or persons unknown  watchl  and as the sheriff opened his mouth to signal a general order to fire  metal fingers compressed a switch .  there exists no adequate description of what occurred afterward  in spite of the presence of seventy eyewitnesses .  in the days  months  and years to come not one of those seventy ever had a word to say about the few seconds after the sheriff had opened his mouth to give the firing order .  when questioned about it  they merely turned apple green and staggered away .  it is plain from circumstantial evidence .  however .  that .  in a general way .  what did occur was this .  sheriff saunders opened his mouth  al    pulled a switch .  the disinto worked  and seventy five trees  two barns  three cows and the top three quarters of duckbill mountain whiffed into rarefied atmosphere .  they became  so to speak  one with the snows of yesteryear .  sheriff saunders  mouth remained open for an indefinite interval thereafter  but nothing neither firing orders nor anything else issued therefrom .  and then  and then  there was a stirring in the air  a multiple ro o o oshing sound  a series of purple streaks through the atmosphere radiating away from randolph payne s shack as the center  and of the members of the posse  not a sign .  there were various guns scattered about the vicinity  including the sheriff s patented nickel plated  extra rapid fire  guaranteed no clog  portable machine gun .  there were about fifty hats  a few half chomped cigars  and some odds and ends that had come loose in the excitement but of actual human beings there was none .  except for lank jake  not one of those human beings came within human ken for three days  and the exception in his favor came about because he was interrupted in his comet flight by the half dozen men from the petersboro factory  who were charging into the wood at a pretty fair speed of their own .  it was sam tobe who stopped him  catching lank jake s head skillfully in the pit of his stomach .  when he caught his breath .  tobe asked .   where s randolph payne s place .   lank jake allowed his eyes to unglaze for just a moment .   brother   he said   just you follow the direction i ain t going .   and with that  miraculously  he was gone .  there was a shrinking dot dodging trees on the horizon that might have been he  but sam tobe wouldn t have sworn to it .  that takes care of the posse  but there still remains randolph payne  whose reactions took something of a different form .  for randolph payne  the five second interval after the pulling of the switch and the disappearance of duckbill mountain was a total blank .  at the start he had been peering through the thick underbrush from behind the bottom of the trees  at the end he was swinging wildly from one of the topmost branches .  the same impulse that had driven the posse horizontally had driven him vertically .  as to how he had covered the fifty feet from roots to top whether he had climbed  jumped  or flown he did not know  and he didn t give a particle of never mind .  what he did know was that property had been destroyed by a robot temporarily in his possession .  all visions of rewards vanished and were replaced by trembling nightmares of hostile citizenry  shrieking lynch mobs  lawsuits  murder charges  and what mirandy payne would say .  mostly what mirandy payne would say .  he was yelling wildly and hoarsely   hey  you robot  you smash that thing  do you hear .  smash it good .  you forget i ever had anything to do with it .  you re a stranger to me  see .  you don t ever say a word about it .  forget it  you hear .   he didn t expect his orders to do any good  it was only reflex action .  what he didn t know was that a robot always obeys a human order except where carrying it out involves danger to another human .  al     therefore  calmly and methodically proceeded to demolish his disinto into rubble and flinders .  just as he was stamping the last cubic inch under foot  sam tobe and his contingent arrived  and randolph payne  sensing that the real owners of the robot had come  dropped out of the tree head first and made for regions unknown feet first .  he did not wait for his reward .   austin wilde  robotical engineer  turned to sam tobe and said   did you get anything out of the robot .   tobe shook his head and snarled deep in his throat .   nothing .  not one thing .  he s forgotten everything that s happened since he left the factory .  he must have gotten orders to forget  or it couldn t have left him so blank .  what was that pile of junk he d been fooling with .    just that .  a pile of junk .  but it must have been a disinto before he smashed it  and i d like to kill the fellow who ordered him to smash it by slow torture  if possible .  look at this .   they were part of the way up the slopes of what had been duck bill mountain at that point  to be exact  where the top had been sheered off  and wilde put his hand down upon the perfect flatness that cut through both soil and rock .   what a disinto   he said .   it took the mountain right off its base .    what made him build it .   wilde shrugged .   i don t know .  some factor in his environment there s no way of knowing what reacted upon his moon type positronic brain to produce a disinto out of junk .  it s a billion to one against our ever stumbling upon that factor again now that the robot himself has forgotten .  we ll never have that disinto .    never mind .  the important thing is that we have the robot .    the hell you say .   there was poignant regret in wilde s voice .   have you ever had anything to do with the disintos on the moon .  they eat up energy like so many electronic hogs and won t even begin to run until you ve built up a potential of better than a million volts .  but this disinto worked differently .  i went through the rubbish with a microscope  and would you like to see the only source of power of any kind that i found .    what was it .    just this .  and we ll never know how he did it .   and austin wilde held up the source of power that had enabled a disinto to chew up a mountain in half a second two flashlight batteries .   victory unintentional  the spaceship leaked  as the saying goes  like a sieve .  it was supposed to .  in fact  that was the whole idea .  the result  of course  was that during the journey from ganymede to jupiter  the ship was crammed just as full as it could be with the very hardest space vacuum .  and since the ship also lacked heating devices  this space vacuum was at normal temperature  which is a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .  this  also  was according to plan .  little things like the absence of heat and air didn t annoy anyone at all on the particular spaceship .  the first near vacuum wisps of jovian atmosphere began percolating into the ship several thousand miles above the jovian surface .  it was practically all hydrogen  though perhaps a careful gas analysis might have located a trace of helium as well .  the pressure gauges began creeping skyward .  that creep continued at an accelerating pace as the ship dropped downward in a jupiter circling spiral .  the pointers of successive gauges  each designed for progressively higher pressures  began to move until they reached the neighborhood of a million or so atmospheres  where figures lost most of their meaning .  the temperature  as recorded by thermocouples  rose slowly and erratically  and finally steadied at about seventy below zero  centigrade .  the ship moved slowly toward the end  plowing its way heavily through a maze of gas molecules that crowded together so closely that hydrogen itself was squeezed to the density of a liquid .  ammonia vapor  drawn from the incredibly vast oceans of that liquid  saturated the horrible atmosphere .  the wind  which had begun a thousand miles higher  had risen to a pitch inadequately described as a hurricane .  it was quite plain long before the ship landed on a fairly large jovian island  perhaps seven times the size of asia  that jupiter was not a very pleasant world .  and yet the three members of the crew thought it was .  they were quite convinced it was .  but then  the three members of the crew were not exactly human .  and neither were they exactly jovian .  they were simply robots  designed on earth for jupiter .  zz three said   it appears to be a rather desolate place .   zz two joined him and regarded the wind blasted landscape somberly .   there are structures of some sort in the distance   he said   which are obviously artificial .  i suggest we wait for the inhabitants to come to us .   across the room zz one listened  but made no reply .  he was the first constructed of the three  and half experimental .  consequently he spoke a little less frequently than his two companions .  the wait was not long .  an air vessel of queer design swooped overhead .  more followed .  and then a line of ground vehicles approached  took position  and disgorged organisms .  along with these organisms came various inanimate accessories that might have been weapons .  some of these were borne by a single jovian  some by several  and some advanced under their own power  with jovians perhaps inside .  the robots couldn t tell .  zz three said   they re all around us now .  the logical peaceful gesture would be to come out in the open .  agreed .   it was  and zz one shoved open the heavy door  which was not double or  for that matter  particularly airtight .  their appearance through the door was the signal for an excited stir among the surrounding jovians .  things were done to several of the very largest of the inanimate accessories  and zz three became aware of a temperature rise on the outer rind of his beryllium iridium bronze body .  he glanced at zz two .   do you feel it .  they re aiming heat energy at us  i believe .   zz two indicated his surprise .   i wonder why .    definitely a heat ray of some sort .  look at that .   one of the rays had been jarred out of alignment for some undiscernible cause  and its line of radiation intersected a brook of sparkling pure ammonia  which promptly boiled furiously .  three turned to zz one   make a note of this  one  will you .    sure .   it was to zz one that the routine secretarial work fell  and his method of taking a note was to make a mental addition to the accurate memory scroll within him .  he had already gathered the hour by hour record of every important instrument on board ship during the trip to jupiter .  he added agreeably   what reason shall i put for the reaction .  the human masters would probably enjoy knowing .    no reason .  or better   three corrected himself   no apparent reason .  you might say the maximum temperature of the ray was about plus thirty  centigrade .   two interrupted   shall we try communicating .    it would be a waste of time   said three .   there can t be more than a very few jovians who know the radio click code that s been developed between jupiter and ganymede .  they ll have to send for one  and when he comes  he ll establish contact soon enough .  meanwhile let s watch them .  i don t understand their actions  i tell you frankly .   nor did understanding come immediately .  heat radiation ceased  and other instruments were brought to the forefront and put into play .  several capsules fell at the feet of the watching robots  dropping rapidly and forcefully under jupiter s gravity .  they popped open and a blue liquid exuded  forming pools which proceeded to shrink rapidly by evaporation .  the nightmare wind whipped the vapors away and where those vapors went  jovians scrambled out of the way .  one was too slow  threshed about wildly  and became very limp and still .  zz two bent  dabbed a finger in one of the pools and stared at the dripping liquid .   i think this is oxygen   he said .   oxygen  all right   agreed three .   this becomes stranger and stranger .  it must certainly be a dangerous practice  for i would say that oxygen is poisonous to the creatures .  one of them died .   there was a pause  and then zz one  whose greater simplicity led at times to an increased directness of thought  said heavily   it might be that these strange creatures in a rather childish way are attempting to destroy us .   and two  struck by the suggestion  answered   you know  one  i think you re right .   there had been a slight lull in jovian activity and now a new structure was brought up .  it possessed a slender rod that pointed skyward through the impenetrable jovian murk .  it stood in that starkly incredible wind with a rigidity that plainly indicated remarkable structural strength .  from its tip came a cracking and then a bash that lit up the depths of the atmosphere into a gray fog .  for a moment the robots were bathed in clinging radiance and then three said thoughtfully   high tension electricity .  quite respectable power  too .  one  i think you re right .  after all  the human masters have told us that these creatures seek to destroy all humanity  and organisms possessing such insane viciousness as to harbor a thought of harm against a human being  his voice trembled at the thought  would scarcely scruple at attempting to destroy us .    it s a shame to have such distorted minds   said zz one .   poor fellows .    i find it a very saddening thought   admitted two .   let s go back to the ship .  we ve seen enough for now .   they did so  and settled down to wait .  as zz three said  jupiter was a roomy planet  and it might take time for jovian transportation to bring a radio code expert to the ship .  however  patience is a cheap commodity to robots .  as a matter of fact  jupiter turned on its axis three times  according to chronometer  before the expert arrived .  the rising and setting of the sun made no difference  of course  to the dead darkness at the bottom of three thousand miles of liquid dense gas  so that one could not speak of day and night .  but then  neither jovian nor robot saw by visible light radiation and that didn t matter .  through this thirty hour interval the surrounding jovians continued their attack with a patience and persevering relentlessness concerning which robot zz one made a good many mental notes .  the ship was assaulted by as many varieties of forces as there were hours  and the robots observed every attack attentively  analyzing such weapons as they recognized .  they by no means recognized all .  but the human masters had built well .  it had taken fifteen years to construct the ship and the robots  and their essentials could be expressed in a single phrase  raw strength .  the attack spent itself uselessly and neither ship nor robot seemed the worse for it .  three said   this atmosphere handicaps them  i think .  they can t use atomic disruptors  since they would only tear a hole in that soupy air and blow themselves up .    they haven t used high explosives either   said two   which is well .  they couldn t have hurt us  naturally  but it would have thrown us about a bit .    high explosives are out of the question .  you can t have an explosive without gas expansion and gas just can t expand in this atmosphere .    it s a very good atmosphere   muttered one .   i like it .   which was natural  because he was built for it .  the zz robots were the first robots ever turned out by the united states robots and mechanical men corporation that were not even faintly human in appearance .  they were low and squat  with a center of gravity less than a foot above ground level .  they had six legs apiece  stumpy and thick  designed to lift tons against two and a half times normal earth gravity .  their reflexes were that many times earth normal speed  to make up for the gravity .  and they were composed of a berylliam iridium bronze alloy that was proof against any known corrosive agent  also any known destructive agent short of a thousand megaton atomic disruptor  under any conditions whatsoever .  to dispense with further description  they were indestructible  and so impressively powerful that they were the only robots ever built on whom the roboticists of the corporation had never quite had the nerve to pin a serial number nickname .  one bright young fellow had suggested sissy one  two  and three but not in a very loud voice  and the suggestion was never repeated .  the last hours of the wait were spent in a puzzled discussion to find a possible description of a jovian s appearance .  zz one had made a note of their possession of tentacles and of their radial symmetry and there he had struck .  two and three did their best  but couldn t help .   you can t very well describe anything   three declared finally   without a standard of reference .  these creatures are like nothing i know of completely outside the postitronic paths of my brain .  it s like trying to describe gamma light to a robot unequipped for gamma ray reception .   it was just at that time that the weapon barrage ceased once more .  the robots turned their attention to outside the ship .  a group of jovians were advancing in curiously uneven fashion  but no amount of careful watching could determine the exact method of their locomotion .  how they used their tentacles was uncertain .  at times the organisms took on a remarkable slithering motion  and then they moved at great speed  perhaps with the wind s help  for they were moving downwind .  the robots stepped out to meet the jovians  who halted ten feet away .  both sides remained silent and motionless .  zz two said   they must be watching us  but i don t know how .  do either of you see any photosensitive organs .    i can t say   grunted three in response .   i don t see anything about them that makes sense at all .   there was a sudden metallic clicking from among the jovian group and zz one said delightedly   it s the radio code .  they ve got the communications expert here .   it was  and they had .  the complicated dot dash system that over a period of twenty five years had been laboriously developed by the beings of jupiter and the earthmen of ganymede into a remarkably flexible means of communication was finally being put into practice at close range .  one jovian remained in the forefront now  the others having fallen back .  it was he that was speaking .  the clicking said   where are you from .   zz three  as the most mentally advanced  naturally assumed spokesmanship for the robot group .   we are from jupiter s satellite  ganymede .   the jovian continued   what do you want .    information .  we have come to study your world and to bring back our findings .  if we could have your cooperation   the jovian clicking interrupted .   you must be destroyed .   zz three paused and said in a thoughtful aside to his two companions   exactly the attitude the human masters said they would take .  they are very unusual .   returning to his clicking  he asked simply   why .   the jovian evidently considered certain questions too obnoxious to be answered .  he said   if you leave within a single period of revolution  we will spare you  until such time as we emerge from our world to destroy the un jovian vermin of ganymede .    i would like to point out   said three   that we of ganymede and the inner planets   the jovian interrupted   our astronomy knows of the sun and of our four satellites .  there are no inner planets .   three conceded the point wearily   we of ganymede  then .  we have no designs on jupiter .  we re prepared to offer friendship .  for twenty five years your people communicated freely with the human beings of ganymede .  is there any reason to make sudden war upon the humans .    for twenty five years   was the cold response   we assumed the inhabitants of ganymede to be jovians .  when we found out they were not  and that we had been treating lower animals on the scale of jovian intelligences  we were bound to take steps to wipe out the dishonor .   slowly and forcefully he finished   we of jupiter will suffer the existence of no vermin .   the jovian was backing away in some fashion  tacking against the wind  and the interview was evidently over .  the robots retreated inside the ship .  zz two said   it looks bad  doesn t it .   he continued thoughtfully   it is as the human masters said .  they possess an ultimately developed superiority complex  combined with an extreme intolerance for anyone or anything that disturbs that complex .    the intolerance   observed three   is the natural consequence of the complex .  the trouble is that their intolerance has teeth in it .  they have weapons  and their science is great .    i am not surprised now   burst out zz one   that we were specifically instructed to disregard jovian orders .  they are horrible  intolerant  pseudo superior beings .   he added emphatically  with robotical loyalty and faith   no human master could ever be like that .    that  though true  is beside the point   said three .   the fact remains that the human masters are in terrible danger .  this is a gigantic world and these jovians are greater in numbers and resources by a hundred times or more than the humans of the entire terrestrial empire .  if they can ever develop the force field to the point where they can use it as a spaceship hull  as the human masters have already done  they will overrun the system at will .  the question remains as to how far they have advanced in that direction  what other weapons they have  what preparations they are making  and so on .  to return with that information is our function  of course  and we had better decide on our next step .    it may be difficult   said two .   the jovians won t help us .   which  at the moment  was rather an understatement .  three thought awhile .   it seems to me that we need only wait   he observed .   they have tried to destroy us for thirty hours now and haven t succeeded .  certainly they have done their best .  now a superiority complex always involves the eternal necessity of saving face  and the ultimatum given us proves it in this case .  they would never allow us to leave if they could destroy us .  but if we don t leave  then rather than admit they cannot force us away  they will surely pretend that they are willing  for their own purposes  to have us stay .   once again they waited .  the day passed .  the weapon barrage did not resume .  the robots did not leave .  the bluff was called .  and now the robots faced the jovian radio code expert once again .  if the zz models had been equipped with a sense of humor  they would have enjoyed themselves immensely .  as it was  they felt merely a solemn sense of satisfaction .  the jovian said   it has been our decision that you will be allowed to remain for a very short time  so that you see our power for yourself .  you shall then return to ganymede to inform your companion vermin of the disastrous end to which they will unfailingly come within a solar revolution .   zz one made a mental note that a jovian revolution took twelve earthly years .  three replied casually   thank you .  may we accompany you to the nearest town .  there are many things we would like to learn .   he added as an afterthought   our ship is not to be touched  of course .   he said this as a request  not as a threat  for no zz model was ever pugnacious .  all capacity for even the slightest annoyance had been carefully barred in their construction .  with robots as vastly powerful as the zz s  unfailing good temper was essential for safety during the years of testing on earth .  the jovian said   we are not interested in your verminous ship .  no jovian will pollute himself by approaching it .  you may accompany us  but you must on no account approach closer than ten feet to any jovian  or you will be instantly destroyed .    stuck up  aren t they .   observed two in a genial whisper  as they plowed into the wind .  the town was a port on the shores of an incredible ammonia lake .  the external wind whipped furious  frothy waves that shot across the liquid surface at the hectic rate enforced by the gravity .  the port itself was neither large nor impressive and it seemed fairly evident that most of the construction was underground .   what is the population of this place .   asked three .  the jovian replied   it is a small town of ten million .    i see .  make a note of that  one .   zz one did so mechanically  and then turned once more to the lake  at which he had been staring in fascination .  he pulled at three s elbow .   say  do you suppose they have fish here .    what difference does it make .    i think we ought to know .  the human masters ordered us to find out everything we could .   of the robots  one was the simplest and  consequently  the one who took orders in the most literal fashion .  two said   let one go and look if he likes .  it won t do any harm if we let the kid have his fun .    all right .  there s no real objection if he doesn t waste his time .  fish aren t what we came for but go ahead  one .   zz one made off in great excitement and slogged rapidly down the beach  plunging into the ammonia with a splash .  the jovians watched attentively .  they had understood none of the previous conversation  of course .  the radio code expert clicked out   it is apparent that your companion has decided to abandon life in despair at our greatness .   three said in surprise   nothing of the sort .  he wants to investigate the living organisms  if any  that live in the ammonia .   he added apologetically   our friend is very curious at times  and he isn t quite as bright as we are  though that is only his misfortune .  we understand that and try to humor him whenever we can .   there was a long pause  and the jovian observed   he will drown .   three replied casually   no danger of that .  we don t drown .  may we enter the town as soon as he returns .   at that moment there was a spurt of liquid several hundred feet out in the lake .  it sprayed upward wildly and then hurtled down in a wind driven mist .  another spurt and another  then a wild white foaming that formed a trail toward shore  gradually quieting as it approached .  the two robots watched this in amazement  and the utter lack of motion on the part of the jovians indicated that they were watching as well .  then the head of zz one broke the surface and he made his slow way out on to dry land .  but something followed him .  some organism of gigantic size that seemed nothing but fangs  claws  and spines .  then they saw that it wasn t following him under its own power  but was being dragged across the beach by zz one .  there was a significant flabbiness about it .  zz one approached rather timidly and took communication into his own hands .  he tapped out a message to the jovian in agitated fashion .   i am very sorry this happened  but the thing attacked me .  i was merely taking notes on it .  it is not a valuable creature  i hope .   he was not answered immediately  for at the first appearance of the monster there had been a wild break in the jovian ranks .  these reformed slowly  and cautious observation having proven the creator to be indeed dead  order was restored .  some of the bolder were curiously prodding the body .  zz three said humbly   i hope you will pardon our friend .  he is sometimes clumsy .  we have absolutely no intention of harming any jovian creature .    he attacked me   explained one .   he bit at me without provocation .  see .   and he displayed a two foot fang that ended in a jagged break .   he broke it on my shoulder and almost left a scratch .  i just slapped it a bit to send it away  and it died .  i m sorry .   the jovian finally spoke  and his code clicking was a rather stuttery affair .   it is a wild creature  rarely found so close to shore  but the lake is deep just here .   three said  still anxiously   if you can use it for food  we are only too glad    no .  we can get food for ourselves without the help of verm without the help of others .  eat it yourselves .   at that zz one heaved the creature up and back into the sea  with an easy motion of one arm .  three said casually   thank you for your kind offer  but we have no use for food .  we don t eat  of course .   escorted by two hundred or so armed jovians  the robots passed down a series of ramps into the underground city .  if  above the surface  the city had looked small and unimpressive  then from beneath it took on the appearance of a vast megalopolis .  they were ushered into ground cars that were operated by remote control for no honest  self respecting jovian would risk his superiority by placing himself in the same car with vermin and driven at frightful speed to the center of the town .  they saw enough to decide that it extended fifty miles from end to end and reached downward into jupiter s crust at least eight miles .  zz two did not sound happy as he said   if this is a sample of jovian development then we shall not have a hopeful report to bring back to the human masters .  after all  we landed on the vast surface of jupiter at random  with the chances a thousand to one against coming near any really concentrated center of population .  this must be  as the code expert says  a mere town .    ten million jovians   said three abstractedly .   total population must be in the trillions  which is high  very high  even for jupiter .  they probably have a completely urban civilization  which means that their scientific development must be tremendous .  if they have force fields   three had no neck  for in the interest of strength the heads of the zz models were riveted firmly onto the torso  with the delicate positronic brains protected by three separate layers in inch thick iridium alloy .  but if he had had one  he would have shaken his head dolefully .  they had stopped now in a cleared space .  everywhere about them they could see avenues and structures crowded with jovians  as curious as any terrestrial crowd would have been in similar circumstances .  the code expert approached .   it is time now for me to retire until the next period of activity .  we have gone so far as to arrange quarters for you at great inconvenience to ourselves for  of course  the structure will have to be pulled down and rebuilt afterward .  nevertheless  you will be allowed to sleep for a space .   zz three waved an arm in deprecation and tapped out   we thank you but you must not trouble yourself .  we don t mind remaining right here .  if you want to sleep and rest  by all means do .  we ll wait for you .  as for us   casually   we don t sleep .   the jovian said nothing  though if it had had a face  the expression upon it might have been interesting .  it left  and the robots remained in the car  with squads of well armed jovians  frequently replaced  surrounding them as guards .  it was hours before the ranks of those guards parted to allow the code expert to return .  along with him were other jovians  whom he introduced .   there are with me two officials of the central government who have graciously consented to speak with you .   one of the officials evidently knew the code  for his clicking interrupted the code expert sharply .  he addressed the robots   vermin .  emerge from the ground car that we may look at you .   the robots were only too willing to comply  so while three and two vaulted over the right side of the car  zz one dashed through the left side .  the word through is used advisedly  for since he neglected to work the mechanism that lowered a section of side so that one might exit  he carried that side  plus two wheels and an axle  along with him .  the car collapsed  and zz one stood staring at the ruins in embarrassed silence .  at last he clicked out gently   i m very sorry .  i hope it wasn t an expensive car .   zz two added apologetically   our companion is often clumsy .  you must excuse him   and zz three made a halfhearted attempt to put the car back together again .  zz one made another effort to excuse himself .   the material of the car was rather flimsy .  you see .   he lifted a square yard sheet of three inch thick  metal hard plastic in both hands and exerted a bit of pressure .  the sheet promptly snapped in two .   i should have made allowances   he admitted .  the jovian government official said in slightly less sharp fashion   the car would have had to be destroyed anyway  after being polluted by your presence .   he paused  then   creatures .  we jovians lack vulgar curiosity concerning lower animals  but our scientists seek facts .    we re right with you   replied three cheerfully .   so do we .   the jovian ignored him .   you lack the mass sensitive organ  apparently .  how is it that you are aware of distant objects .   three grew interested .   do you mean your people are directly sensitive to mass .    i am not here to answer your questions  your impudent questions  about us .    i take it then that objects of low specific mass would be transparent to you  even in the absence of radiation .   he turned to two   that s how they see .  their atmosphere is as transparent as space to them .   the jovian clicking began once more   you will answer my first question immediately  or my patience will end and i will order you destroyed .   three said at once   we are energy sensitive  jovian .  we can adjust ourselves to the entire electromagnetic scale at will .  at present  our long distance sight is due to radio wave radiation that we emit ourselves  and at close range we see by   he paused  and said to two   there isn t any code word for gamma ray  is there .    not that i know of   two answered .  three continued to the jovian   at close range we see by other radiation for which there is no code word .    of what is your body composed .   demanded the jovian .  two whispered   he probably asks that because his mass sensitivity can t penetrate past our skin .  high density  you know .  ought we to tell him .   three replied uncertainly   our human masters didn t particularly say we were to keep anything secret .   in radio code  to the jovian he said   we are mostly iridium .  for the rest  copper  tin  a little beryllium  and a scattering of other substances .   the jovians fell back and by the obscure writhing of various portions of their thoroughly indescribable bodies gave the impression that they were in animated conversation  although they made no sound .  and then the official returned .   beings of ganymede .  it has been decided to show you through some of our factories that we may exhibit a tiny part of our great achievements .  we will then allow you to return so that you may spread despair among the other verm the other beings of the outer world .   three said to two   note the effect of their psychology .  they must hammer home their superiority .  it s still a matter of saving face .   and in radio code   we thank you for the opportunity .   but the face saving was efficient  as the robots realized soon enough .  the demonstration became a tour  and the tour a grand exhibition .  the jovians displayed everything  explained everything  answered all questions eagerly  and zz one made hundreds of despairing notes .  the war potential of that single so called unimportant town was greater by several times than that of all ganymede .  ten more such towns would outproduce all the terrestrial empire .  yet ten more such towns would not be the fingernail fragment of the strength all jupiter must be able to exert .  three turned as one nudged him .   what is it .   zz one said seriously    f they have force fields  the human masters are lost  aren t they .    i m afraid so .  why do you ask .    because the jovians aren t showing us through the right wing of this factory .  it might be that force fields are being developed there .  they would be wanting to keep it secret if they were .  we d better find out .  it s the main point  you know .   three regarded one somberly .   perhaps you re right .  it s no use ignoring anything .   they were in a huge steel mill now  watching hundred foot beams of ammonia resistant silicon steel alloy being turned out twenty to the second .  three asked quietly   what does that wing contain .   the government official inquired of those in charge of the factory and explained   that is the section of great heat .  various processes require huge temperatures which life cannot bear  and they must all be handled indirectly .   he led the way to a partition from which heat could be felt to radiate and indicated a small round area of transparent material .  it was one of a row of such  through which the foggy red light of lines of glowing forges could be made out through the soupy atmosphere .  zz one fastened a look of suspicion on the jovian and clicked out   would it be all right if i went in and looked around .  i am very interested in this .   three said   you re being childish  one .  they re telling the truth .  oh well  nose around if you must .  but don t take too long  we ve got to move on .   the jovian said   you have no understanding of the heat involved .  you will die .    oh no   explained one casually .   heat doesn t bother us .   there was a jovian conference  and then a scene of scurrying confusion as the life of the factory was geared to this unusual emergency .  screens of heat absorbent material were set up  and then a door dropped open  a door that had never before budged while the forges were working .  zz one entered and the door closed behind him .  jovian officials crowded to the transparent areas to watch .  zz one walked to the nearest forge and tapped the outside .  since he was too short to see into it comfortably  he tipped the forge until the molten metal licked at the lip of the container .  he peered at it curiously  then dipped his hand in and stirred it awhile to test the consistency .  having done this  he withdrew his hand  shook off some of the fiery metallic droplets and wiped the rest on one of his six thighs .  slowly he went down the line of forges  then signified his desire to leave .  the jovians retired to a great distance when he came out of the door and played a stream of ammonia on him  which hissed  bubbled and steamed until he was brought to bearable temperature once more .  zz one ignored the ammonia shower and said   they were telling the truth .  no force fields .   three began   you see   but one interrupted impatiently   but there s no use delaying .  the human masters instructed us to find out everything and that s that .   he turned to the jovian and clicked out  without the slightest hesitation   listen  has jovian science developed force fields .   bluntness was  of course  one of the natural consequences of one s less well developed mental powers .  two and three knew that  so they refrained from expressing disapproval of the remark .  the jovian official relaxed slowly from his strangely stiffened attitude  which had somehow given the impression that he had been staring stupidly at one s hand the one he had dipped into the molten metal .  the jovian said slowly   force fields .  that  then  is your main object of curiosity .    yes   said one with emphasis .  there was a sudden and patent gain in confidence on the jovian s part  for the clicking grew sharper .   then come  vermin .   whereupon three said to two   we re vermin again  i see  which sounds as if there s bad news ahead .   and two gloomily agreed .  it was to the very edge of the city that they were now led  to the portion which on earth would have been termed the suburbs  and into one of a series of closely integrated structures  which might have corresponded vaguely to a terrestrial university .  there were no explanations  however  and none was asked for .  the jovian official led the way rapidly  and the robots followed with the grim conviction that the worst was just about to happen .  it was zz one who stopped before an opened wall section after the rest had passed on .   what s this .   he wanted to know .  the room was equipped with narrow  low benches  along which jovians manipulated rows of strange devices  of which strong  inch long electromagnets formed the principal feature .   what s this .   asked one again .  the jovian turned back and exhibited impatience .   this is a students  biological laboratory .  there s nothing there to interest you .    but what are they doing .    they are studying microscopic life .  haven t you ever seen a microscope before .   three interrupted in explanation   he has  but not that type .  our microscopes are meant for energy sensitive organs and work by refraction of radiant energy .  your microscopes evidently work on a mass expansion basis .  rather ingenious .   zz one said   would it be all right if i inspected some of your specimens .    of what use will that be .  you cannot use our microscopes because of your sensory limitations and it will simply force us to discard such specimens as you approach for no decent reason .    but i don t need a microscope   explained one  with surprise .   i can easily adjust myself for microscopic vision .   he strode to the nearest bench  while the students in the room crowded to the corner in an attempt to avoid contamination .  zz one shoved a microscope aside and inspected the slide carefully .  he backed away  puzzled  then tried another .  .  . a third .  .  . a fourth .  he came back and addressed the jovian .   those are supposed to be alive  aren t they .  i mean those little worm things .   the jovian said   certainly .    that s strange  when i look at them  they die .   three exclaimed sharply and said to his two companions   we ve forgotten our gamma ray radiation .  let s get out of here  one  or we ll kill every bit of microscopic life in the room .   he turned to the jovian   i m afraid that our presence is fatal to weaker forms of life .  we had better leave .  we hope the specimens are not too difficult to replace .  and  while we re about it  you had better not stay too near us  or our radiation may affect you adversely .  you feel all right so far  don t you .   he asked .  the jovian led the way onward in proud silence  but it was to be noticed that thereafter he doubled the distance he had hitherto kept between himself and them .  nothing more was said until the robots found themselves in a vast room .  in the very center of it huge ingots of metal rested unsupported in mid air or  rather  supported by nothing visible against mighty jovian gravity .  the jovian clicked   there is your force field in ultimate form  as recently perfected .  within that bubble is a vacuum  so that it is supporting the full weight of our atmosphere plus an amount of metal equivalent to two large spaceships .  what do you say to that .    that space travel now becomes a possibility for you   said three .   definitely .  no metal or plastic has the strength to hold our atmosphere against a vacuum  but a force field can  and a force field bubble will be our spaceship .  within the year we will be turning them out by the hundreds of thousands .  then we will swarm down upon ganymede to destroy the verminous so called intelligences that attempt to dispute our dominion of the universe .    the human beings of ganymede have never attempted   began three  in mild expostulation .   silence .   snapped the jovian .   return now and tell them what you ve seen .  their own feeble force fields  such as the one your ship is equipped with  will not stand against us  for our smallest ship will be a hundred times the size and power of yours .   three said   then there s nothing more to do and we will return  as you say  with the information .  if you could lead us back to our ship  we ll say good by .  but by the way  just as a matter for the record  there s something you don t understand .  the humans of ganymede have force fields  of course  but our particular ship isn t equipped with one .  we don t need any .   the robot turned away and motioned his companions to follow .  for a moment they did not speak  then zz one muttered dejectedly   can t we try to destroy this place .    it won t help   said three .   they d get us by weight of numbers .  it s no use .  in an earthly decade the human masters will be finished .  it is impossible to stand against jupiter .  there s just too much of it .  as long as jovians were tied to the surface  the humans were safe .  but now that they have force fields .  all we can do is to bring the news .  by the preparation of hiding places  some few may survive for a short while .   the city was behind them .  they were out on the open plain by the lake  with their ship a dark spot on the horizon  when the jovian spoke suddenly   creatures  you say you have no force field .   three replied without interest   we don t need one .    how then does your ship stand the vacuum of space without exploding because of the atmospheric pressure within .   and he moved a tentacle as if in mute gesture at the jovian atmosphere that was weighing down upon them with a force of twenty million pounds to the square inch .   well   explained three   that s simple .  our ship isn t airtight .  pressures equalize within and without .    even in space .  a vacuum in your ship .  you lie .    you re welcome to inspect our ship .  it has no force field and it isn t airtight .  what s marvelous about that .  we don t breathe .  our energy is obtained through direct atomic power .  the presence or absence of air pressure makes little difference to us and we re quite at home in a vacuum .    but absolute zero .    it doesn t matter .  we regulate our own heat .  we re not interested in outside temperatures .   he paused .   well  we can make our own way back to the ship .  good by .  we ll give the humans of ganymede your message  war to the end .   but the jovian said   wait .  i ll be back .   he turned and went toward the city .  the robots stared  and then waited in silence .  it was three hours before he returned and when he did  it was in breathless haste .  he stopped within the usual ten feet of the robots  but then began inching his way forward in a curious groveling fashion .  he did not speak until his rubbery gray skin was almost touching them  and then the radio code sounded  subdued and respectful .   honored sirs  i have been in communication with the head of our central government  who is now aware of all the facts  and i can assure you that jupiter desires only peace    i beg your pardon .   asked three blankly .  the jovian drove on hastily .   we are ready to resume communication with ganymede and will gladly promise to make no attempt to venture into space .  our force field will be used only on the jovian surface .    but   three began .   our government will be glad to receive any other representatives our honorable human brothers of ganymede would care to send .  if your honors will now condescend to swear peace   a scaly tentacle swung out toward them and three  quite dazed  grasped it .  two and one did likewise as two more were extended to them .  the jovian said solemnly   there is then eternal peace between jupiter and ganymede .   the spaceship which leaked like a sieve was out in space again .  the pressure and temperature were once more at zero  and the robots watched the huge but steadily shrinking globe that was jupiter .   they re definitely sincere   said zz two   and it s very gratifying  this complete about face  but i don t get it .    it is my idea   observed zz one   that the jovians came to their senses just in time and realized the incredible evil involved in the thought of harm to a human master .  that would be only natural .   zz three sighed and said   look  it s all a matter of psychology .  those jovians had a superiority complex a mile thick and when they couldn t destroy us  they were bound to save face .  all their exhibitions  all their explanations  were simply a form of braggadocio  designed to impress us into the proper state of humiliation before their power and superiority .    i see all that   interrupted two   but   three went on   but it worked the wrong way .  all they did was to prove to themselves that we were stronger  that we didn t drown  that we didn t eat or sleep  that molten metal didn t hurt us .  even our very presence was fatal to jovian life .  their last trump was the force field .  and when they found out that we didn t need them at all  and could live in a vacuum at absolute zero  they broke .   he paused and added philosophically   when a superiority complex like that breaks  it breaks all the way .   the other two considered that  and then two said   but it still doesn t make sense .  why should they care what we can or can t do .  we re only robots .  we re not the ones they have to fight .    and that s the whole point  two   said three softly .   it s only after we left jupiter that i thought of it .  do you know that through an oversight  quite unintentionally  we neglected to tell them we were only robots .    they never asked us   said one .   exactly .  so they thought we were human beings and that all the other human beings were like us .   he looked once more at jupiter  thoughtfully .   no wonder they decided to quit .    first law  mike donovan looked at his empty beer mug  felt bored  and decided he had listened long enough .  he said  loudly   if we re going to talk about unusual robots  i once knew one that disobeyed the first law .   and since that was completely impossible  everyone stopped talking and turned to look at donovan .  donovan regretted his big mouth at once and changed the subject .   i heard a good one yesterday   he said  conversationally   about   macfarlane in the chair next to donovan s said   you mean you knew a robot that harmed a human being .   that was what disobedience to first law meant  of course .   in a way   said donovan .   i say i heard one about    tell us about it   ordered macfarlane .  some of the others banged their beer mugs on the table .  donovan made the best of it .   it happened on titan about ten years ago   he said  thinking rapidly .   yes  it was in twenty five .  we had just recently received a shipment of three new model robots  specially designed for titan .  they were the first of the ma models .  we called them emma one  two and three .   he snapped his fingers for another beer and stared earnestly after the waiter .  let s see  what came next .  macfarlane said   i ve been in robotics half my life  mike .  i never heard of an ma serial order .    that s because they took the ma s off the assembly lines immediately after after what i m going to tell you .  don t you remember .    no .   donovan continued hastily .   we put the robots to work at once .  you see  until then  the base had been entirely useless during the stormy season  which lasts eighty percent of titan s revolution about saturn .  during the terrific snows  you couldn t find the base if it were only a hundred yards away .  compasses aren t any use  because titan hasn t any magnetic field .   the virtue of these ma robots  however  was that they were equipped with vibro detectors of a new design so that they could make a beeline for the base through anything  and that meant mining could become a through the revolution affair .  and don t say a word  mac .  the vibro detectors were taken off the market also  and that s why you haven t heard of them .   donovan coughed .   military secret  you understand .   he went on .   the robots worked fine during the first stormy season  then at the start of the calm season  emma two began acting up .  she kept wandering off into corners and under bales and had to be coaxed out .  finally she wandered off base altogether and didn t come back .  we decided there had been a flaw in her manufacture and got along with the other two .  still  it meant we were shorthanded  or short roboted anyway  so when toward the end of the calm season  someone had to go to kornsk  i volunteered to chance it without a robot .  it seemed safe enough  the storms weren t due for two days and i d be back in twenty hours at the outside .   i was on the way back a good ten miles from base when the wind started blowing and the air thickening .  i landed my air car immediately before the wind could smash it  pointed myself toward the base and started running .  i could run the distance in the low gravity all right  but could i run a straight line .  that was the question .  my air supply was ample and my suit heat coils were satisfactory  but ten miles in a titanian storm is infinity .   then  when the snow streams changed everything to a dark  gooey twilight  with even saturn dimmed out and the sun only a pale pimple  i stopped short and leaned against the wind .  there was a little dark object right ahead of me .  i could barely make it out but i knew what it was .  it was a storm pup  the only living thing that could stand a titanian storm  and the most vicious living thing anywhere .  i knew my space suit wouldn t protect me  once it made for me  and in the bad light  i had to wait for a point blank aim or i didn t dare shoot .  one miss and he would be at me .   i backed away slowly and the shadow followed .  it closed in and i was raising my blaster  with a prayer  when a bigger shadow loomed over me suddenly  and i yodeled with relief .  it was emma two  the missing ma robot .  i never stopped to wonder what had happened to it or worry why it had .  i just howled   emma  baby  get that storm pup  and then get me back to base .    it just looked at me as if it hadn t heard and called out   master  don t shoot .  don t shoot .    it made for that storm pup at a dead run .     get that damned pup  emma   i shouted .  it got the pup  all right .  it scooped it right up and kept on going .  i yelled myself hoarse but it never came back .  it left me to die in the storm .    donovan paused dramatically   of course  you know the first law  a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  well  emma two just ran off with that storm pup and left me to die .  it broke first law .   luckily  i pulled through safely .  half an hour later  the storm died down .  it had been a premature gust  and a temporary one .  that happens sometimes .  i hot footed it for base and the storms really broke next day .  emma two returned two hours after i did  and  of course  the mystery was then explained and the ma models were taken off the market immediately .    and just what   demanded macfarlane   was the explanation .   donovan regarded him seriously .   it s true i was a human being in danger of death  mac  but to that robot there was something else that came first  even before me  before the first law .  don t forget these robots were of the ma series and this particular ma robot had been searching out private nooks for some time before disappearing .  it was as though it expected something special and private to happen to it .  apparently  something special had .   donovan s eyes turned upward reverently and his voice trembled .   that storm pup was no storm pup .  we named it emma junior when emma two brought it back .  emma two had to protect it from my gun .  what is even first law compared with the holy ties of mother love .    let s get together  a kind of peace had endured for a century and people had forgotten what anything else was like .  they would scarcely have known how to react had they discovered that a kind of war had finally come .  certainly  elias lynn  chief of the bureau of robotics  wasn t sure how he ought to react when he finally found out .  the bureau of robotics was headquartered in cheyenne  in line with the century old trend toward decentralization  and lynn stared dubiously at the young security officer from washington who had brought the news .  elias lynn was a large man  almost charmingly homely  with pale blue eyes that bulged a bit .  men weren t usually comfortable under the stare of those eyes  but the security officer remained calm .  lynn decided that his first reaction ought to be incredulity .  hell  it was incredulity .  he just didn t believe it .  he eased himself back in his chair and said   how certain is the information .   the security officer  who had introduced himself as ralph g .  breckenridge and had presented credentials to match  had the softness of youth about him  full lips  plump cheeks that flushed easily  and guileless eyes .  his clothing was out of line with cheyenne but it suited a universally air conditioned washington  where security  despite everything  was still centered .  breckenridge flushed and said   there s no doubt about it .    you people know all about them  i suppose   said lynn and was unable to keep a trace of sarcasm out of his tone .  he was not particularly aware of his use of a slightly stressed pronoun in his reference to the enemy  the equivalent of capitalization in print .  it was a cultural habit of this generation and the one preceding .  no one said the  east  or the  reds  or the  soviets  or the  russians  any more .  that would have been too confusing  since some of them weren t of the east  weren t reds  soviets  and especially not russians .  it was much simpler to say we and they  and much more precise .  travelers had frequently reported that they did the same in reverse .  over there  they were  we   in the appropriate language  and we were  they .   scarcely anyone gave thought to such things any more .  it was all quite comfortable and casual .  there was no hatred  even .  at the beginning  it had been called a cold war .  now it was only a game  almost a good natured game  with unspoken rules and a kind of decency about it .  lynn said abruptly   why should they want to disturb the situation .   he rose and stood staring at a wall map of the world  split into two regions with faint edgings of color .  an irregular portion on the left of the map was edged in a mild green .  a smaller  but just as irregular  portion on the right of the map was bordered in a washed out pink .  we and they .  the map hadn t changed much in a century .  the loss of formosa and the gain of east germany some eighty years before had been the last territorial switch of importance .  there had been another change  though  that was significant enough and that was in the colors .  two generations before  their territory had been a brooding  bloody red  ours a pure and undefiled white .  now there was a neutrality about the colors .  lynn had seen their maps and it was the same on their side .   they wouldn t do it   he said .   they are doing it    said breckenridge   and you had better accustom yourself to the fact .  of course  sir  i realize that it isn t pleasant to think that they may be that far ahead of us in robotics .   his eyes remained as guileless as ever  but the hidden knife edges of the words plunged deep  and lynn quivered at the impact .  of course  that would account for why the chief of robotics learned of this so late and through a security officer at that .  he had lost caste in the eyes of the government  if robotics had really failed in the struggle  lynn could expect no political mercy .  lynn said wearily   even if what you say is true  they re not far ahead of us .  we could build humanoid robots .    have we  sir .    yes .  as a matter of fact  we have built a few models for experimental purposes .    they were doing so ten years ago .  they ve made ten years  progress since .   lynn was disturbed .  he wondered if his incredulity concerning the whole business was really the result of wounded pride and fear for his job and reputation .  he was embarrassed by the possibility that this might be so  and yet he was forced into defense .  he said   look  young man  the stalemate between them and us was never perfect in every detail  you know .  they have always been ahead in one facet or another and we in some other facet or another .  if they re ahead of us right now in robotics  it s because they ve placed a greater proportion of their effort into robotics than we have .  and that means that some other branch of endeavor has received a greater share of our efforts than it has to theirs .  it would mean we re ahead in force field research or in hyperatomics  perhaps .   lynn felt distressed at his own statement that the stalemate wasn t perfect .  it was true enough  but that was the one great danger threatening the world .  the world depended on the stalemate being as perfect as possible .  if the small unevennesses that always existed overbalanced too far in one direction or the other almost at the beginning of what had been the cold war  both sides had developed thermonuclear weapons  and war became unthinkable .  competition switched from the military to the economic and psychological and had stayed there ever since .  but always there was the driving effort on each side to break the stalemate  to develop a parry for every possible thrust  to develop a thrust that could not be parried in time something that would make war possible again .  and that was not because either side wanted war so desperately  but because both were afraid that the other side would make the crucial discovery first .  for a hundred years each side had kept the struggle even .  and in the process  peace had been maintained for a hundred years while  as byproducts of the continuously intensive research  force fields had been produced and solar energy and insect control and robots .  each side was making a beginning in the understanding of mentalics  which was the name given to the biochemistry and biophysics of thought .  each side had its outposts on the moon and on mars .  mankind was advancing in giant strides under forced draft .  it was even necessary for both sides to be as decent and humane as possible among themselves  lest through cruelty and tyranny  friends be made for the other side .  it couldn t be that the stalemate would now be broken and that there would be war .  lynn said   i want to consult one of my men .  i want his opinion .   is he trustworthy .   lynn looked disgusted .   good lord  what man in robotics has not been investigated and cleared to death by your people .  yes  i vouch for him .  if you can t trust a man like humphrey carl laszlo  then we re in no position to face the kind of attack you say they are launching  no matter what else we do .    i ve heard of laszlo   said breckenridge .   good .  does he pass .    yes .    then  i ll have him in and we ll find out what he thinks about the possibility that robots could invade the u  . s . a .    not exactly   said breckenridge  softly .   you still don t accept the full truth .  find out what he thinks about the fact that robots have already invaded the u . s . a .   laszlo was the grandson of a hungarian who had broken through what had then been called the iron curtain  and he had a comfortable above suspicion feeling about himself because of it .  he was thick set and balding with a pugnacious look graven forever on his snub face  but his accent was clear harvard and he was almost excessively soft spoken .  to lynn  who was conscious that after years of administration he was no longer expert in the various phases of modem robotics  laszlo was a comforting receptacle for complete knowledge .  lynn felt better because of the man s mere presence .  lynn said   what do you think .   a scowl twisted laszlo s face ferociously .   that they re that far ahead of us .  completely incredible .  it would mean they ve produced humanoids that could not be told from humans at close quarters .  it would mean a considerable advance in robo mentalics .    you re personally involved   said breckenridge  coldly .   leaving professional pride out of account  exactly why is it impossible that they be ahead of us .   laszlo shrugged .   i assure you that i m well acquainted with their literature on robotics .  i know approximately where they are .    you know approximately where they want you to think they are  is what you really mean   corrected breckenridge .   have you ever visited the other side .    i haven t   said laszlo  shortly .   nor you  dr .  lynn .   lynn said   no  i haven t  either .   breckenridge said   has any robotics man visited the other side in twenty five years .   he asked the question with a kind of confidence that indicated he knew the answer .  for a matter of seconds  the atmosphere was heavy with thought .  discomfort crossed lazlo s broad face .  he said   as a matter of fact  they haven t held any conferences on robotics in a long time .    in twenty five years   said breckenridge .   isn t that significant .    maybe   said laszlo  reluctantly .   something else bothers me  though .  none of them have ever come to our conferences on robotics .  none that i can remember .    were they invited .   asked breckenridge .  lynn  staring and worried  interposed quickly   of course .   breckenridge said   do they refuse attendance to any other types of scientific conferences we hold .    i don t know   said laszlo .  he was pacing the floor now .   i haven t heard of any cases .  have you  chief .    no   said lynn .  breckenridge said   wouldn t you say it was as though they didn t want to be put in the position of having to return any such invitation .  or as though they were afraid one of their men might talk too much .   that was exactly how it seemed  and lynn felt a helpless conviction that security s story was true after all steal over him .  why else had there been no contact between sides on robotics .  there had been a cross fertilizing trickle of researchers moving in both directions on a strictly one for one basis for years  dating back to the days of eisenhower and krushchev .  there were a great many good motives for that  an honest appreciation of the supranational character of science  impulses of friendliness that are hard to wipe out completely in the individual human being  the desire to be exposed to a fresh and interesting outlook and to have your own slightly stale notions greeted by others as fresh and interesting .  the governments themselves were anxious that this continue .  there was always the obvious thought that by learning all you could and telling as little as you could  your own side would gain by the exchange .  but not in the case of robotics .  not there .  such a little thing to carry conviction .  and a thing  moreover  they had known all along .  lynn thought darkly  we ve taken the complacent way out .  because the other side had done nothing publicly on robotics  it had been tempting to sit back smugly and be comfortable in the assurance of superiority .  why hadn t it seemed possible  even likely  that they were hiding superior cards  a trump hand  for the proper time .  laszlo said shakenly   what do we do .   it was obvious that the same line of thought had carried the same conviction to him .   do .   parroted lynn .  it was hard to think right now of anything but the complete horror that came with conviction .  there were ten humanoid robots somewhere in the united states  each one carrying a fragment of a tc bomb .  tc .  the race for sheer horror in bombery had ended there .  tci total conversion .  the sun was no longer a synonym one could use .  total conversion made the sun a penny candle .  ten humanoids  each completely harmless in separation  could  by the simple act of coming together  exceed critical mass and lynn rose to his feet heavily  the dark pouches under his eyes  which ordinarily lent his ugly face a look of savage foreboding  more prominent than ever .   it s going to be up to us to figure out ways and means of telling a humanoid from a human and then finding the humanoids .    how quickly .   muttered laszlo .   not later than five minutes before they get together   barked lynn   and i don t know when that will be .   breckenridge nodded .   i m glad you re with us now  sir  i m to bring you back to washington for conference  you know .   lynn raised his eyebrows .   all right .   he wondered if  had he delayed longer in being convinced  he might not have been replaced forthwith if some other chief of the bureau of robotics might not be conferring in washington .  he suddenly wished earnestly that exactly that had come to pass .  the first presidential assistant was there  the secretary of science  the secretary of security  lynn himself  and breckenridge .  five of them sitting about a table in the dungeons of an underground fortress near washington .  presidential assistant jeffreys was an impressive man  handsome in a white haired and just a trifle jowly fashion  solid  thoughtful and as unobtrusive  politically  as a presidential assistant ought to be .  he spoke incisively .   there are three questions that face us as i see it .  first  when are the humanoids going to get together .  second  where are they going to get together .  third  how do we stop them before they get together .   secretary of science amberley nodded convulsively at that .  he had been dean of northwestern engineering before his appointment .  he was thin  sharp featured and noticeably edgy .  his forefinger traced slow circles on the table  as far as when they ll get together   he said .   i suppose it s definite that it won t be for some time .    why do you say that .   asked lynn sharply .   they ve been in the u . s .  at least a month already .  so security says .   lynn turned automatically to look at breckenridge  and secretary of security macalaster intercepted the glance .  macalaster said   the information is reliable .  don t let breckenridge s apparent youth fool you  dr .  lynn .  that s part of his value to us .  actually  he s thirty four and has been with the department for ten years .  he has been in moscow for nearly a year and without him  none of this terrible danger would be known to us .  as it is  we have most of the details .    not the crucial ones   said lynn .  macalaster of security smiled frostily .  his heavy chin and close set eyes were well known to the public but almost nothing else about him was .  he said   we are all finitely human  dr .  lynn .  agent breckenridge has done a great deal .   presidential assistant jeffreys cut in .   let us say we have a certain amount of time .  if action at the instant were necessary  it would have happened before this .  it seems likely that they are waiting for a specific time .  if we knew the place  perhaps the time would become self evident .   if they are going to tc a target  they will want to cripple us as much as possible  so it would seem that a major city would have to be it .  in any case  a major metropolis is the only target worth a tc bomb .  i think there are four possibilities  washington  as the administrative center  new york  as the financial center  and detroit and pittsburgh as the two chief industrial centers .   macalaster of security said   i vote for new york .  administration and industry have both been decentralized to the point where the destruction of anyone particular city won t prevent instant retaliation .    then why new york .   asked amberly of science  perhaps more sharply than he intended .   finance has been decentralized as well .    a question of morale .  it may be they intend to destroy our will to resist  to induce surrender by the sheer horror of the first blow .  the greatest destruction of human life would be in the new york metropolitan area    pretty cold blooded   muttered lynn .   i know   said macalaster of security   but they re capable of it  if they thought it would mean final victory at a stroke .  wouldn t we   presidential assistant jeffreys brushed back his white hair .   let s assume the worst .  let s assume that new york will be destroyed some time during the winter  preferably immediately after a serious blizzard when communications are at their worst and the disruption of utilities and food supplies in fringe areas will be most serious in their effect .  now  how do we stop them .   amberley of science could only say   finding ten men in two hundred and twenty million is an awfully small needle in an awfully large haystack .   jeffreys shook his head .   you have it wrong .  ten humanoids among two hundred twenty million humans .    no difference   said amberley of science .   we don t know that a humanoid can be differentiated from a human at sight .  probably not .   he looked at lynn .  they all did .  lynn said heavily   we in cheyenne couldn t make one that would pass as human in the daylight .    but they can   said macalaster of security   and not only physically .  we re sure of that .  they ve advanced mentalic procedures to the point where they can reel off the micro electronic pattern of the brain and focus it on the positronic pathways of the robot .   lynn stared .   are you implying that they can create the replica of a human being complete with personality and memory .    i am .    of specific human beings .    that s right .    is this also based on agent breckenridge s findings .    yes .  the evidence can t be disputed .   lynn bent his head in thought for a moment .  then he said   then ten men in the united states are not men but humanoids .  but the originals would have had to be available to them .  they couldn t be orientals  who would be too easy to spot  so they would have to be east europeans .  how would they be introduced into this country  then .  with the radar network over the entire world border as tight as a drum  how could they introduce any individual  human or humanoid  without our knowing it .   macalaster of security said   it can be done .  there are certain legitimate seepages across the border .  businessmen  pilots  even tourists .  they re watched  of course  on both sides .  still ten of them might have been kidnaped and used as models for humanoids .  the humanoids would then be sent back in their place .  since we wouldn t expect such a substitution  it would pass us by .  if they were americans to begin with  there would be no difficulty in their getting into this country .  it s as simple as that .    and even their friends and family could not tell the difference .    we must assume so .  believe me  we ve been waiting for any report that might imply sudden attacks of amnesia or troublesome changes in personality .  we ve checked on thousands .   amberley of science stared at his finger tips .   i think ordinary measures won t work .  the attack must come from the bureau of robotics and i depend on the chief of that bureau .   again eyes turned sharply  expectantly  on lynn .  lynn felt bitterness rise .  it seemed to him that this was what the conference came to and was intended for .  nothing that had been said had not been said before .  he was sure of that .  there was no solution to the problem  no pregnant suggestion .  it was a device for the record  a device on the part of men who gravely feared defeat and who wished the responsibility for it placed clearly and unequivocally on someone else .  and yet there was justice in it .  it was in robotics that we had fallen short .  and lynn was not lynn merely .  he was lynn of robotics and the responsibility had to be his .  he said   i will do what i can .   he spent a wakeful night and there was a haggardness about both body and soul when he sought and attained another interview with presidential assistant jeffreys the next morning .  breckenridge was there  and though lynn would have preferred a private conference  he could see the justice in the situation .  it was obvious that breckenridge had attained enormous influence with the government as a result of his successful intelligence work .  well  why not .  lynn said   sir  i am considering the possibility that we are hopping uselessly to enemy piping .    in what way .    i m sure that however impatient the public may grow at times  and however legislators sometimes find it expedient to talk  the government at least recognizes the world stalemate to be beneficial .  they must recognize it also .  ten humanoids with one tc bomb is a trivial way of breaking the stalemate .    the destruction of fifteen million human beings is scarcely trivial .    it is from the world power standpoint .  it would not so demoralize us to make us surrender or so cripple us as to convince us we could not win .  there would just be the same old planetary death war that both sides have avoided so long and so successfully .  and all they would have accomplished is to force us to fight minus one city .  it s not enough .    what do you suggest .   said jeffreys coldly .   that they do not have ten humanoids in our country .  that there is not a tc bomb waiting to get together .         agree that those things are here  but perhaps for some reason greater than just midwinter bomb madness .    such as .    it may be that the physical destruction resulting from the humanoids getting together is not the worst thing that can happen to us .  what about the moral and intellectual destruction that comes of their being here at all .  with all due respect to agent breckenridge  what if they intended for us to find out about the humanoids  what if the humanoids are never supposed to get together  but merely to remain separate in order to give us something to worry about .    why .    tell me this .  what measures have already been taken against the humanoids .  i suppose that security is going through the files of all citizens who have ever been across the border or close enough to it to make kidnapping possible .  i know  since macalaster mentioned it yesterday  that they are following up suspicious psychiatric cases .  what else .   jeffreys said   small x ray devices are being installed in key places in the large cities .  in the mass arenas  for instance    where ten humanoids might slip in among a hundred thousand spectators of a football game or an air polo match .    exactly .    and concert halls and churches .    we must start somewhere .  we can t do it all at once .    particularly when panic must be avoided   said lynn .   isn t that so .  it wouldn t do to have the public realize that at any unpredictable moment  some unpredictable city and its human contents would suddenly cease to exist .    i suppose that s obvious .  what are you driving at .   lynn said strenuously   that a growing fraction of our national effort will be diverted entirely into the nasty problem of what amberley called finding a very small needle in a very large haystack .  we ll be chasing our tails madly  while they increase their research lead to the point where we find we can no longer catch up  when we must surrender without the chance even of snapping our fingers in retaliation .   consider further that this news will leak out as more and more people become involved in our countermeasures and more and more people begin to guess what we re doing .  then what .  the panic might do us more harm than anyone tc bomb .   the presidential assistant said irritably   in heaven s name  man  what do you suggest we do  then .    nothing   said lynn .   call their bluff .  live as we have lived and gamble that they won t dare break the stalemate for the sake of a one bomb head start .    impossible .   said jeffreys .   completely impossible .  the welfare of all of us is very largely in my hands  and doing nothing is the one thing i cannot do .  i agree with you  perhaps  that x ray machines at sports arenas are a kind of skin deep measure that won t be effective  but it has to be done so that people  in the aftermath  do not come to the bitter conclusion that we tossed our country away for the sake of a subtle line of reasoning that encouraged donothingism .  in fact  our counter gambit will be active indeed .    in what way .   presidential assistant jeffreys looked at breckenridge .  the young security officer  hitherto calmly silent  said   it s no use talking about a possible future break in the stalemate when the stalemate is broken now .  it doesn t matter whether these humanoids explode or do not .  maybe they are only a bait to divert us  as you say .  but the fact remains that we are a quarter of a century behind in robotics  and that may be fatal .  what other advances in robotics will there be to surprise us if war does start .  the only answer is to divert our entire force immediately  now  into a crash program of robotics research  and the first problem is to find the humanoids .  call it an exercise in robotics  if you will  or call it the prevention of the death of fifteen million men  women and children .   lynn shook his head helplessly .   you can t .  you d be playing into their hands .  they want us lured into the one blind alley while they re free to advance in all other directions .   jeffreys said impatiently   that s your guess .  breckenridge has made his suggestion through channels and the government has approved  and we will begin with an all science conference .    all science .   breckenridge said   we have listed every important scientist of every branch of natural science .  they ll all be at cheyenne .  there will be only one point on the agenda  how to advance robotics .  the major specific subheading under that will be  how to develop a receiving device for the electromagnetic fields of the cerebral cortex that will be sufficiently delicate to distinguish between a protoplasmic human brain and a positronic humanoid brain .   jeffreys said   we had hoped you would be willing to be in charge of the conference .    i was not consulted in this .    obviously time was short  sir .  do you agree to be in charge .   lynn smiled briefly .  it was a matter of responsibility again .  the responsibility must be clearly that of lynn of robotics .  he had the feeling it would be breckenridge who would really be in charge .  but what could he do .  he said   i agree .   breckenridge and lynn returned together to cheyenne  where that evening laszlo listened with a sullen mistrust to lynn s description of coming events .  laszlo said   while you were gone  chief  i ve started putting five experimental models of humanoid structure through the testing procedures .  our men are on a twelve hour day  with three shifts overlapping .  if we ve got to arrange a conference  we re going to be crowded and red taped out of everything .  work will come to a halt .   breckenridge said   that will be only temporary .  you will gain more than you lose .   laszlo scowled .   a bunch of astrophysicists and geochemists around won t help a damn toward robotics .    views from specialists of other fields may be helpful .    are you sure .  how do we know that there is any way of detecting brain waves or that  even if we can  there is a way of differentiating human and humanoid by wave pattern .  who set up the project  anyway .    i did   said breckenridge .   you did .  are you a robotics man .   the young security agent said calmly   i have studied robotics .    that s not the same thing .    i ve had access to text material dealing with russian robotics in russian .  top secret material well in advance of anything you have here .   lynn said ruefully   he has us there  laszlo .    it was on the basis of that material   breckenridge went on   that i suggested this particular line of investigation .  it is reasonably certain that in copying off the electromagnetic pattern of a specific human mind into a specific positronic brain  a perfectly exact duplicate cannot be made .  for one thing  the most complicated positronic brain small enough to fit into a human sized skull is hundreds of times less complex than the human brain .  it can t pick up all the overtones  therefore  and there must be some way to take advantage of that fact .   laszlo looked impressed despite himself and lynn smiled grimly .  it was easy to resent breckenridge and the coming intrusion of several hundred scientists of nonrobotics specialties  but the problem itself was an intriguing one .  there was that consolation  at least .  it came to him quietly .  lynn found he had nothing to do but sit in his office alone  with an executive position that had grown merely titular .  perhaps that helped .  it gave him time to think  to picture the creative scientists of half the world converging on cheyenne .  it was breckenridge who  with cool efficiency  was handling the details of preparation .  there had been a kind of confidence in the way he said   let s get together and we ll lick them .   let s get together .  it came to lynn so quietly that anyone watching lynn at that moment might have seen his eyes blink slowly twice but surely nothing more .  he did what he had to do with a whirling detachment that kept him calm when he felt that  by all rights  he ought to be going mad .  he sought out breckenridge in the other s improvised quarters .  breckenridge was alone and frowning .   is anything wrong  sir .   lynn said wearily   everything s right  i think .  i ve invoked martial law .    what .    as chief of a division i can do so if i am of the opinion the situation warrants it .  over my division i can then be dictator .  chalk up one for the beauties of decentralization .    you will rescind that order immediately .   breckenridge took a step forward .   when washington hears this  you will be ruined .    i m ruined anyway .  do you think i don t realize that i ve been set up for the role of the greatest villain in american history  the man who let them break the stalemate .  i have nothing to lose and perhaps a great deal to gain .   he laughed a little wildly .   what a target the division of robotics will be  eh  breckenridge .  only a few thousand men to be killed by a tc bomb capable of wiping out three hundred square miles in one micro second .  but five hundred of those men would be our greatest scientists .  we would be in the peculiar position of having to fight a war with our brains shot out  or surrendering .  i think we d surrender .    but this is impossible .  lynn  do you hear me .  do you understand .  how could the humanoids pass our security provisions .  how could they get together .    but they are getting together .  we re helping them to do so .  we re ordering them to do so .  our scientists visit the other side  breckenridge .  they visit them regularly .  you made a point of how strange it was that no one in robotics did .  well  ten of those scientists are still there and in their place  ten humanoids are converging on cheyenne .    that s a ridiculous guess .    i think it s a good one  breckenridge .  but it wouldn t work unless we knew humanoids were in america so that we would call the conference in the first place .  quite a coincidence that you brought the news of the humanoids and suggested the conference and suggested the agenda and are running the show and know exactly which scientists were invited .  did you make sure the right ten were included .    dr .  lynn .   cried breckenridge in outrage .  he poised to rush forward .  lynn said   don t move .  i ve got a blaster here .  well just wait for the scientists to get here one by one .  one by one we ll x ray them .  one by one  we ll monitor them for radioactivity .  no two will get together without being checked  and if all five hundred are clear  i ll give you my blaster and surrender to you .  only i think we ll find the ten humanoids .  sit down  breckenridge .   they both sat .  lynn said   we wait .  when i m tired  laszlo will spell me .  we wait .   professor manuelo jiminez of the institute of higher studies of buenos aires exploded while the stratospheric jet on which he traveled was three miles above the amazon valley .  it was a simple chemical explosion but it was enough to destroy the plane .  dr .  herman liebowitz of m . i . t .  exploded in a monorail  killing twenty people and injuring a hundred others .  in similar manner  dr .  auguste marin of l  institut nucleonique of montreal and seven others died at various stages of their journey to cheyenne .  laszlo hurtled in  pale faced and stammering  with the first news of it .  it had only been two hours that lynn had sat there  facing breckenridge  blaster in hand .  laszlo said   i thought you were nuts  chief  but you were right .  they were humanoids .  they had to be .   he turned to stare with hate filled eyes at breckenridge .   only they were warned .  he warned them  and now there won t be one left intact .  not one to study .    god .   cried lynn and in a frenzy of haste thrust his blaster out toward breckenridge and fired .  the security man s neck vanished  the torso fell  the head dropped  thudded against the floor and rolled crookedly .  lynn moaned   i didn t understand  i thought he was a traitor .  nothing more .   and laszlo stood immobile  mouth open  for the moment incapable of speech .  lynn said wildly   sure  he warned them .  but how could he do so while sitting in that chair unless he were equipped with built in radio transmission .  don t you see it .  breckenridge had been in moscow .  the real breckenridge is still there .  oh my god  there were eleven of them .   laszlo managed a hoarse squeak .   why didn t he explode .    he was hanging on  i suppose  to make sure the others had received his message and were safely destroyed .  lord  lord  when you brought the news and i realized the truth  i couldn t shoot fast enough .  god knows by how few seconds i may have beaten him to it .   laszlo said shakily   at least  we ll have one to study .   he bent and put his fingers on the sticky fluid trickling out of the mangled remains at the neck end of the headless body .  not blood  but high grade machine oil .   satisfaction guaranteed  tony was tall and darkly handsome  with an incredibly patrician air drawn into every line of his unchangeable expression  and claire belmont regarded him through the crack in the door with a mixture of horror and dismay .   i can t  larry .  i just can t have him in the house .   feverishly  she was searching her paralyzed mind for a stronger way of putting it  some way that would make sense and settle things  but she could only end with a simple repetition .   well  i can t .   larry belmont regarded his wife stiffly  and there was that spark of impatience in his eyes that claire hated to see  since she felt her own incompetence mirrored in it .   we re committed  claire   he said   and i can t have you backing out now .  the company is sending me to washington on this basis  and it probably means a promotion .  it s perfectly safe and you know it .  what s your objection .   she frowned helplessly .   it just gives me the chills .  i couldn t bear him .    he s as human as you or i  almost .  so  no nonsense .  come  get out there .   his hand was in the small of her back  shoving  and she found herself in her own living room  shivering .  it was there  looking at her with a precise politeness  as though appraising his hostess to be of the next three weeks .  dr .  susan calvin was there  too  sitting stiffly in thin lipped abstraction .  she had the cold  faraway look of someone who has worked with machines so long that a little of the steel had entered the blood .   hello   crackled claire in general  and ineffectual  greeting .  but larry was busily saving the situation with a spurious gaiety .   here  claire  i want you to meet tony  a swell guy .  this is my wife  claire  tony  old boy .   larry s hand draped itself amiably over tony s shoulder  but tony remained unresponsive and expressionless under the pressure .  he said   how do you do  mrs .  belmont .   and claire jumped at tony s voice .  it was deep and mellow  smooth as the hair on his head or the skin on his face .  before she could stop herself  she said   oh  my you talk .    why not .  did you expect that i didn t .   but claire could only smile weakly .  she didn t really know what she had expected .  she looked away  then let him slide gently into the comer of her eye .  his hair was smooth and black  like polished plastic or was it really composed of separate hairs .  and was the even  olive skin of his hands and face continued on past the obscurement of his formally cut clothing .  she was lost in the shuddering wonder of it  and had to force her thoughts back into place to meet dr .  calvin s flat  unemotional voice .   mrs .  belmont  i hope you appreciate the importance of this experiment .  your husband tells me he has given you some of the background .  i would like to give you more  as the senior psychologist of the u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .   tony is a robot .  his actual designation on the company files is tn    but he will answer to tony .  he is not a mechanical monster  nor simply a calculating machine of the type that were developed during world war ii  fifty years ago .  he has an artificial brain nearly as complicated as our own .  it is an immense telephone switchboard on an atomic scale  so that billions of possible  telephone connections  can be compressed into an instrument that will fit inside a skull .   such brains are manufactured for each model of robot specifically .  each contains a precalculated set of connections so that each robot knows the english language to start with and enough of anything else that may be necessary to perform his job .   until now  u . s .  robots has confined its manufacturing activity to industrial models for use in places where human labor is impractical in deep mines  for instance  or in underwater work .  but we want to invade the city and the home .  to do so  we must get the ordinary man and woman to accept these robots without fear .  you understand that there is nothing to fear .    there isn t  claire   interposed larry earnestly .   take my word for it .  it s impossible for him to do any harm .  you know i wouldn t leave him with you otherwise .   claire cast a quick  secret glance at tony and lowered her voice .   what if i make him angry .    you needn t whisper   said dr .  calvin calmly .   he can t get angry with you  my dear .  i told you that the switchboard connections of his brain were predetermined .  well  the most important connection of all is what we call the first law of robotics   and it is merely this   no robot can harm a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   all robots are built so .  no robot can be forced in any way to do harm to any human .  so  you see  we need you and tony as a preliminary experiment for our own guidance  while your husband is in washington to arrange for government supervised legal tests .    you mean all this isn t legal .   larry cleared his throat .   not just yet  but it s all right .  he won t leave the house  and you mustn t let anyone see him .  that s all .  .  .  .  and  claire  i d stay with you  but i know too much about the robots .  we must have a completely inexperienced tester so that we can have severe conditions .  it s necessary .    oh  well   muttered claire .  then  as a thought struck her   but what does he do .    housework   said dr .  calvin shortly .  she got up to leave  and it was larry who saw her to the front door .  claire stayed behind drearily .  she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror above the mantelpiece  and looked away hastily .  she was very tired of her small  mousy face and her dim  unimaginative hair .  then she caught tony s eyes upon her and almost smiled before she remembered .  .  .  .  he was only a machine .   larry belmont was on his way to the airport when he caught a glimpse of gladys claffern .  she was the type of woman who seemed made to be seen in glimpses .  .  .  .  perfectly and precisely manufactured  dressed with thoughtful hand and eye  too gleaming to be stared at .  the little smile that preceded her and the faint scent that trailed her were a pair of beckoning fingers .  larry felt his stride break  he touched his hat  then hurried on .  as always he felt that vague anger .  if claire could only push her way into the claffern clique  it would help so much .  but what was the use .  claire .  the few times she had come face to face with gladys  the little fool had been tongue tied .  he had no illusions .  the testing of tony was his big chance  and it was in claire s hands .  how much safer it would be in the hands of someone like gladys claffern .   claire woke the second morning to the sound of a subdued knock on the bedroom door .  her mind clamored  then went icy .  she had avoided tony the first day  smiling thinly when she met him and brushing past with a wordless sound of apology .   is that you tony .    yes  mrs .  belmont .  may i enter .   she must have said yes  because he was in the room  quite suddenly and noiselessly .  her eyes and nose were simultaneously aware of the tray he was carrying .   breakfast .   she said .   if you please .   she wouldn t have dared to refuse  so she pushed herself slowly into a sitting position and received it  poached eggs  buttered toast  coffee .   i have brought the sugar and cream separately   said tony .   i expect to learn your preference with time  in this and in other things .   she waited .  tony  standing there straight and pliant as a metal rule  asked  after a moment   would you prefer to eat in privacy .    yes .  .  .  .  i mean  if you don t mind .    will you need help later in dressing .    oh  my  no .   she clutched frantically at the sheet  so that the coffee hovered at the edge of catastrophe .  she remained so  in rigor  then sank helplessly back against the pillow when the door closed him out of her sight again .  she got through breakfast somehow .  .  .  .  he was only a machine  and if it were only more visible that he were it wouldn t be so frightening .  or if his expression would change .  it just stayed there  nailed on .  you couldn t tell what went on behind those dark eyes and that smooth  olive skin stuff .  the coffee cup beat a faint castanet for a moment as she set it back  empty  on the tray .  then she realized that she had forgotten to add the sugar and cream after all  and she did so hate black coffee .  she burned a straight path from bedroom to kitchen after dressing .  it was her house  after all  and there wasn t anything frippy about her  but she liked her kitchen clean .  he should have waited for supervision .  .  .  .  but when she entered  she found a kitchen that might have been minted fire new from the factory the moment before .  v she stopped  stared  turned on her heel and nearly ran into tony .  she yelped .   may i help .   he asked .   tony   and she scraped the anger off the edges of her mind s panic   you must make some noise when you walk .  i can t have you stalking me  you know .  .  .  .  didn t you use this kitchen .    i did  mrs .  belmont .    it doesn t look it .    i cleaned up afterward .  isn t that customary .   claire opened her eyes wide .  after all  what could one say to that .  she opened the oven compartment that held the pots  took a quick  unseeing look at the metallic glitter inside  then said with a tremor   very good .  quite satisfactory .   if at the moment  he had beamed  if he had smiled  if he had quirked the corner of his mouth the slightest bit  she felt that she could have warmed to him .  but he remained an english lord in repose  as he said   thank you  mrs .  belmont .  would you come into the living room .   she did  and it struck her at once .   have you been polishing the furniture .    is it satisfactory  mrs .  belmont .    but when .  you didn t do it yesterday .    last night  of course .    you burned the lights all night .    oh  no .  that wouldn t have been necessary .  i ve a built in ultra violet source .  i can see in ultraviolet .  and  of course  i don t require sleep .   he did require admiration  though .  she realized that  then .  he had to know that he was pleasing her .  but she couldn t bring herself to supply that pleasure for him .  she could only say sourly   your kind will put ordinary houseworkers out of business .    there is work of much greater importance they can be put to in the world  once they are freed of drudgery .  after all  mrs .  belmont  things like myself can be manufactured .  but nothing yet can imitate the creativity and versatility of a human brain  like yours .   and though his face gave no hint  his voice was warmly surcharged with awe and admiration  so that claire flushed and muttered   my brain .  you can have it .   tony approached a little and said   you must be unhappy to say such a thing .  is there anything i can do .   for a moment  claire felt like laughing .  it was a ridiculous situation .  here was an animated carpet sweeper  dishwasher  furniture polisher  general factotum  rising from the factory table and offering his services as consoler and confidant .  yet she said suddenly  in a burst of woe and voice   mr .  belmont doesn t think i have a brain  if you must know .  .  .  .  and i suppose i haven t .   she couldn t cry in front of him .  she felt  for some reason  that she had the honor of the human race to support against this mere creation .   it s lately   she added .   it was all right when he was a student  when he was just starting .  but i can t be a big man s wife  and he s getting to be a big man .  he wants me to be a hostess and an entry into social life for him like g guh guh gladys claffern .   her nose was red  and she looked away .  but tony wasn t watching her .  his eyes wandered about the room .   i can help you run the house .    but it s no good   she said fiercely .   it needs a touch i can t give it .  i can only make it comfortable  i can t ever make it the kind they take pictures of for the home beautiful magazines .    do you want that kind .    does it do any good wanting .   tony s eyes were on her  full .   i could help .    do you know anything about interior decoration .    is it something a good housekeeper should know .    oh  yes .    then i have the potentialities of learning it .  can you get me books on the subject .   something started then .   claire  clutching her hat against the brawling liberties of the wind  had manipulated two fat volumes on the home arts back from the public library .  she watched tony as he opened one of them and flipped the pages .  it was the first time she had watched his fingers flicker at anything like fine work .  i don t see how they do it  she thought  and on a sudden impulse reached for his hand and pulled it toward herself .  tony did not resist  but let it lie limp for inspection .  she said   it s remarkable .  even your fingernails look natural .    that s deliberate  of course   said tony .  then  chattily   the skin is a flexible plastic  and the skeletal framework is a light metal alloy .  does that amuse you .    oh  no .   she lifted her reddened face .   i just feel a little embarrassed at sort of poking into your insides .  it s none of my business .  you don t ask me about mine .    my brain paths don t include that type of curiosity .  i can only act within my limitations  you know .   and claire felt something tighten inside her in the silence that followed .  why did she keep forgetting he was a machine .  now the thing itself had to remind her .  was she so starved for sympathy that she would even accept a robot as equal because he sympathized .  she noticed tony was still flipping the pages almost helplessly and there was a quick  shooting sense of relieved superiority within her .   you can t read  can you .   tony looked up at her  his voice calm  unreproachful .   i am reading  mrs .  belmont .    but   she pointed at the book in a meaningless gesture .   i am scanning the pages  if that s what you mean .  my sense of reading is photographic .   it was evening then  and when claire eventually went to bed tony was well into the second volume  sitting there in the dark  or what seemed dark to claire s limited eyes .  her last thought  the one that clamored at her just as her mind let go and tumbled  was a queer one .  she remembered his hand again  the touch of it .  it had been warm and soft  like a human being s .  how clever of the factory  she thought  and softly ebbed to sleep .   it was the library continuously  thereafter  for several days .  tony suggested the fields of study  which branched out quickly .  there were books on color matching and on cosmetics  on carpentry and on fashions  on art and on the history of costumes .  he turned the pages of each book before his solemn eyes  and  as quickly as he turned  he read  nor did he seem capable of forgetting .  before the end of the week  he had insisted on cutting her hair  introducing her to a new method of arranging it  adjusting her eyebrow line a bit and changing the shade of her powder and lipstick .  she had palpitated in nervous dread for half an hour under the delicate touch of his inhuman fingers and then looked in the mirror .   there is more that can be done   said tony   especially in clothes .  how do you find it for a beginning .   and she hadn t answered  not for quite a while .  not until she had absorbed the identity of the stranger in the glass and cooled the wonder at the beauty of it all .  then she had said chokingly  never once taking her eyes from the warming image   yes  tony  quite good for a beginning .   she said nothing of this in her letters to larry .  let him see it all at once .  and something in her realized that it wasn t only the surprise she would enjoy .  it was going to be a kind of revenge .   tony said one morning   it s time to start buying  and i m not allowed to leave the house .  if i write out exactly what we must have  can i trust you to get it .  we need drapery  and furniture fabric  wallpaper  carpeting  paint  clothing and any number of small things .    you can t get these things to your own specifications at a stroke s notice   said claire doubtfully .   you can get fairly close  if you go through the city and if money is no object .    but  tony  money is certainly an object .    not at all .  stop off at u . s .  robots in the first place .  i ll write a note for you .  you see dr .  calvin  and tell her that i said it was part of the experiment .    dr .  calvin  somehow  didn t frighten her as on that first evening .  with her new face and a new hat  she couldn t be quite the old claire .  the psychologist listened carefully  asked a few questions  nodded and then claire found herself walking out  armed with an unlimited charge account against the assets of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .  it is wonderful what money will do .  with a store s contents at her feet  a saleslady s dictum was not necessarily a voice from above  the uplifted eyebrow of a decorator was not anything like jove s thunder .  and once  when an exalted plumpness at one of the most lordly of the garment salons had insistently poohed her description of the wardrobe she must have with counterpronouncements in accents of the purest fifty seventh street french  she called up tony  then held the phone out to monsieur .   if you don t mind  voice firm  but fingers twisting a bit  i d like you to talk to my uh secretary .   pudgy proceeded to the phone with a solemn arm crooked behind his back .  he lifted the phone in two fingers and said delicately   yes .   a short pause  another  yes   then a much longer pause  a squeaky beginning of an objection that perished quickly  another pause  a very meek  yes   and the phone was restored to its cradle .   if madam will come with me   he said  hurt and distant   i will try to supply her needs .    just a second .   claire rushed back to the phone  and dialed again .   hello  tony .  i don t know what you said  but it worked .  thanks .  you re a   she struggled for the appropriate word  gave up and ended in a final little squeak    a a dear .   it was gladys claffern looking at her when she turned from the phone again .  a slightly amused and slightly amazed gladys claffern  looking at her out of a face tilted a bit to one side .   mrs .  belmont .   it all drained out of claire just like that .  she could only nod stupidly  like a marionette .  gladys smiled with an insolence you couldn t put your finger on .   i didn t know you shopped here .   as if the place had  in her eyes  definitely lost caste through the fact .   i don t  usually   said claire humbly .   and haven t you done something to your hair .  it s quite quaint .  .  .  .  oh  i hope you ll excuse me  but isn t your husband s name lawrence .  it seems to me that it s lawrence .   claire s teeth clenched  but she had to explain .  she had to .   tony is a friend of my husband s .  he s helping me select some things .    i understand .  and quite a dear about it  i imagine .   she passed on smiling  carrying the light and the warmth of the world with her .   claire did not question the fact that it was to tony that she turned for consolation .  ten days had cured her of reluctance .  and she could weep before him  weep and rage .   i was a complete f fool   she stormed  wrenching at her water togged handkerchief .   she does that to me .  i don t know why .  she just does .  i should have kicked her .  i should have knocked her down and stamped on her .    can you hate a human being so much .   asked tony  in puzzled softness .   that part of a human mind is closed to me .    oh  it isn t she   she moaned .   it s myself  i suppose .  she s everything i want to be on the outside  anyway .  .  .  .  and i can t be .   tony s voice was forceful and low in her ear .   you can be  mrs .  belmont .  you can be .  we have ten days yet  and in ten days the house will no longer be itself .  haven t we been planning that .    and how will that help me with her .    invite her here .  invite her friends .  have it the evening before i before i leave .  it will be a housewarming  in a way .    she won t come .    yes  she will .  she ll come to laugh .  .  .  .  and she won t be able to .    do you really think so .  oh  tony  do you think we can do it .   she had both his hands in hers .  .  .  .  and then  with her face flung aside   but what good would it be .  it won t be i  it will be you that s doing it .  i can t ride your back .    nobody lives in splendid singleness   whispered tony .   they ve put that knowledge in me .  what you  or anyone  see in gladys claffern is not just gladys claffern .  she rides the back of all that money and social position can bring .  she doesn t question that .  why should you .   .  .  .  and look at it this way  mrs .  belmont .  i am manufactured to obey  but the extent of my obedience is for myself to determine .  i can follow orders niggardly or liberally .  for you  it is liberal  because you are what i have been manufactured to see human beings as .  you are kind  friendly  unassuming .  mrs .  claffern  as you describe her  is not  and i wouldn t obey her as i would you .  so it is you  and not i  mrs .  belmont  that is doing all this .   he withdrew his hands from hers then  and claire looked at that expressionless face no one could read wondering .  she was suddenly frightened   again in a completely new way .  she swallowed nervously and stared at her hands  which were still tingling   with the pressure of his fingers .  she hadn t imagined it  his fingers had pressed hers  gently  tenderly  just before they moved away .  no .  its fingers  .  .  .  its fingers .  .  .  .  she ran to the bathroom and scrubbed her hands blindly  uselessly .   she was a bit shy of him the next day  watching him narrowly  waiting to see what might follow and for a while nothing did .  tony was working .  if there was any difficulty in technique in putting up wallpaper  or utilizing the quick drying paint  tony s activity did not show it .  his hands moved precisely  his fingers were deft and sure .  he worked all night .  she never heard him  but each morning was a new adventure .  she couldn t count the number of things that had been done  and by evening she was still finding new touches and another night had come .  she tried to help only once and her human clumsiness marred that .  he was in the next room  and she was hanging a picture in the spot marked by tony s mathematical eyes .  the little mark was there  the picture was there  and a revulsion against idleness was there .  but she was nervous  or the ladder was rickety .  it didn t matter .  she felt it going  and she cried out .  it tumbled without her  for tony  with far more than flesh and blood quickness  had been under her .  his calm  dark eyes said nothing at all  and his warm voice said only words .   are you hurt  mrs .  belmont .   she noticed for an instant that her falling hand must have mussed that sleek hair of his  because for the first time she could see for herself that it was composed of distinct strands fine black hairs .  and then  all at once  she was conscious of his arms about her shoulders and under her knees holding her tightly and warmly .  she pushed  and her scream was loud in her own ears .  she spent the rest of the day in her room  and thereafter she slept with a chair upended against the doorknob of her bedroom door .   she had sent out the invitations  and  as tony had said  they were accepted .  she had only to wait for the last evening .  it came  too  after the rest of them  in its proper place .  the house was scarcely her own .  she went through it one last time and every room had been changed .  she  herself  was in clothes she would never have dared wear before .  .  .  .  and when you put them on  you put on pride and confidence with them .  she tried a polite look of contemptuous amusement before the minor  and the mirror sneered back at her masterfully .  what would larry say .   .  .  .  it didn t matter  somehow .  the exciting days weren t coming with him .  they were leaving with tony .  now wasn t that strange .  she tried to recapture her mood of three weeks before and failed completely .   the clock shrieked eight at her in eight breathless installments  and she turned to tony .   they ll be here soon  tony .  you d better get into the basement .  we can t let them   she stared a moment  then said weakly   tony .   and more strongly   tony .   and nearly a scream   tony .   but his arms were around her now  his face was close to hers  the pressure of his embrace was relentless .  she heard his voice through a haze of emotional jumble .   claire   the voice said   there are many things i am not made to understand  and this must be one of them .  i am leaving tomorrow  and i don t want to .  i find that there is more in me than just a desire to please you .  isn t it strange .   his face was closer  his lips were warm  but with no breath behind them  for machines do not breathe .  they were almost on hers .   .  .  .  and the bell sounded .  for a moment  she struggled breathlessly  and then he was gone and nowhere in sight  and the bell was sounding again .  its intermittent shrillness was insistent .  the curtains on the front windows had been pulled open .  they had been closed fifteen minutes earlier .  she knew that .  they must have seen  then .  they must all have seen everything .   they came in so politely  all in a bunch the pack come to howl with their sharp  darting eyes piercing everywhere .  they had seen .  why else would gladys ask in her jabbingest manner after larry .  and claire was spurred to a desperate and reckless defiance .  yes  he is away .  he ll be back tomorrow  i suppose .  no  i haven t been lonely here myself .  not a bit .  i ve had an exciting time .  and she laughed at them .  why not .  what could they do .  larry would know the truth  if it ever came to him  the story of what they thought they saw .  but they didn t laugh .  she could read that in the fury in gladys claffern s eyes  in the false sparkle of her words  in her desire to leave early .  and as she parted with them  she caught one last  anonymous whisper disjointed .    .  .  .  never saw anything like  .  .  .  so handsome   and she knew what it was that had enabled her to finger snap them so .  let each cat mew  and let each cat know that she might be prettier than claire belmont  and grander  and richer but not one  not one  could have so handsome a lover .  and then she remembered again again again  that tony was a machine  and her skin crawled .   go away .  leave me be .   she cried to the empty room and ran to her bed .  she wept wakefully all that night and the next morning  almost before dawn  when the streets were empty  a car drew up to the house and took tony away .   lawrence belmont passed dr .  calvin s office  and  on impulse  knocked .  he found her with mathematician peter bogert  but did not hesitate on that account .  he said   claire tells me that u . s .  robots paid for all that was done at my house    yes   said dr .  calvin .   we ve written it off  as a valuable and necessary part of the experiment .  with your new position as associate engineer  you ll be able to keep it up  i think .    that s not what i m worried about .  with washington agreeing to the tests  we ll be able to get a tn model of our own by next year  i think .   he turned hesitantly  as though to go  and as hesitantly turned back again .   well  mr .  belmont .   asked dr .  calvin  after a pause .   i wonder   began larry .   i wonder what really happened there .  she  claire  i mean seems so different .  it s not just her looks though  frankly  i m amazed .   he laughed nervously .   it s her .  she s not my wife  really i can t explain it .    why try .  are you disappointed with any part of the change .    on the contrary .  but it s a little frightening  too  you see    i wouldn t worry  mr .  belmont .  your wife has handled herself very well .  frankly  i never expected to have the experiment yield such a thorough and complete test .  we know exactly what corrections must be made in the tn model  and the credit belongs entirely to mrs .  belmont .  if you want me to be very honest  i think your wife deserves your promotion more than you do .   larry flinched visibly at that .   as long as it s in the family   he murmured unconvincingly and left .   susan calvin looked after him   i think that hurt i hope .  .  .  .  have you read tony s report  peter .    thoroughly   said bogert .   and won t the tn   model need changes .    oh  you think so  too .   questioned calvin sharply .   what s your reasoning .   bogert frowned .   i don t need any .  it s obvious on the face of it that we can t have a robot loose which makes love to his mistress  if you don t mind the pun .    love .  peter  you sicken me .  you really don t understand .  that machine had to obey the first law .  he couldn t allow harm to come to a human being  and harm was coming to claire belmont through her own sense of inadequacy .  so he made love to her  since what woman would fail to appreciate the compliment of being able to stir passion in a machine in a cold  soulless machine .  and he opened the curtains that night deliberately  that the others might see and envy without any risk possible to claire s marriage .  i think it was clever of tony    do you .  what s the difference whether it was pretense or not  susan .  it still has its horrifying effect .  read the report again .  she avoided him .  she screamed when he held her .  she didn t sleep that last night in hysterics .  we can t have that .    peter  you re blind .  you re as blind as i was .  the tn model will be rebuilt entirely  but not for your reason .  quite otherwise  quite otherwise .  strange that i overlooked it in the first place   her eyes were opaquely thoughtful   but perhaps it reflects a shortcoming in myself .  you see  peter  machines can t fall in love  but even when it s hopeless and horrifying  women can .    risk  hyper base had lived for this day .  spaced about the gallery of the viewing room  in order and precedence strictly dictated by protocol  was a group of officials  scientists  technicians and others who could only be lumped under the general classification of  personnel .   in accordance with their separate temperaments they waited hopefully  uneasily  breathlessly  eagerly  or fearfully for this culmination of their efforts .  the hollowed interior of the asteroid known as hyper base had become for this day the center of a sphere of iron security that extended out for ten thousand miles .  no ship might enter that sphere and live .  no message might leave without scrutiny .  a hundred miles away  more or less  a small asteroid moved neatly in the orbit into which it had been urged a year before  an orbit that ringed hyper base in as perfect a circle as could be managed .  the asteroidlet s identity number was h     but no one on hyper base called it anything but it .    have you been out on it today .    the general s on it  blowing his top   and eventually the impersonal pronoun achieved the dignity of capitalization .   on it  unoccupied now as zero second approached  was the parsec  the only ship of its kind ever built in the history of man .  it lay  unmanned  ready for its takeoff into the inconceivable .  gerald black  who  as one of the bright young men in etherics engineering  rated a front row view  cracked his large knuckles  then wiped his sweating palms on his stained white smock and said sourly   why don t you bother the general  or her ladyship there .   nigel ronson  of interplanetary press  looked briefly across the gallery toward the glitter of major general richard kallner and the unremarkable woman at his side  scarcely visible in the glare of his dress uniform .  he said   i would .  except that i m interested in news .   ronson was short and plump .  he painstakingly wore his hair in a quarter inch bristle  his shirt collar open and his trouser leg ankle short  in faithful imitation of the newsmen who were stock characters on tv shows .  he was a capable reporter nevertheless .  black was stocky  and his dark hairline left little room for forehead  but his mind was as keen as his strong fingers were blunt .  he said   they ve got all the news .    nuts   said ronson .   kallner s got no body under that gold braid .  strip him and you ll find only a conveyer belt dribbling orders downward and shooting responsibility upward .   black found himself at the point of a grin but squeezed it down .  he said .   what about the madam doctor .    dr .  susan calvin of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .   intoned the reporter .   the lady with hyperspace where her heart ought to be and liquid helium in her eyes .  she d pass through the sun and come out the other end encased in frozen flame .   black came even closer to a grin .   how about director schloss  then .   ronson said glibly   he knows too much .  between spending his time fanning the feeble flicker of intelligence in his listener and dimming his own brains for fear of blinding said listener permanently by sheer force of brilliance  he ends up saying nothing .   black showed his teeth this time .   now suppose you tell me why you pick on me .    easy  doctor .  i looked at you and figured you re too ugly to be stupid and too smart to miss a possible opportunity at some good personal publicity .    remind me to knock you down someday .   said black .   what do you want to know .   the man from interplanetary press pointed into the pit and said   is that thing going to work .   black looked downward too  and felt a vague chill riffle over him like the thin night wind of mars .  the pit was one large television screen  divided in two .  one half was an over all view of it .  on it s pitted gray surface was the parse  glowing mutedly in the feeble sunlight .  the other half showed the control room of the parsec .  there was no life in that control room .  in the pilot s seat was an object the vague humanity of which did not for a moment obscure the fact that it was only a positronic robot .  black said   physically  mister  this will work .  that robot will leave and come back .  space .  how we succeeded with that part of it .  i watched it all .  i came here two weeks after i took my degree in etheric physics and i ve been here  barring leave and furloughs  ever since .  i was here when we sent the first piece of iron wire to jupiter s orbit and back through hyperspace and got back iron filings .  i was here when we sent white mice there and back and ended up with mincemeat .   we spent six months establishing an even hyperfield after that .  we had to wipe out lags of as little as tenths of thousandths of seconds from point to point in matter being subjected to hypertravel .  after that  the white mice started coming back intact .  i remember when we celebrated for a week because one white mouse came back alive and lived ten minutes before dying .  now they live as long as we can take proper care of them .   ronson said   great .   black looked at him obliquely .   i said  physically it will work .  those white mice that come back    well .    no minds .  not even little white mice type minds .  they won t eat .  they have to be force fed .  they won t mate .  they won t run .  they sit .  they sit .  they sit .  that s all .  we finally worked up to sending a chimpanzee .  it was pitiful .  it was too close to a man to make watching it bearable .  it came back a hunk of meat that could make crawling motions .  it could move its eyes and sometimes it would scrabble .  it whined and sat in its own wastes without the sense to move .  somebody shot it one day  and we were all grateful for that .  i tell you this  fella  nothing that ever went into hyperspace has come back with a mind .    is this for publication .     after this experiment  maybe .  they expect great things of it .   a comer of black s mouth lifted .   you don t .    with a robot at the controls .  no .   almost automatically black s mind went back to that interlude  some years back  in which he had been unwittingly responsible for the near loss of a robot .  he thought of the nestor robots that filled hyper base with smooth  ingrained knowledge and perfectionist shortcomings .  mat was the use of talking about robots .  he was not  by nature  a missionary .  but then ronson  filling the continuing silence with a bit of small talk  said  as he replaced the wad of gum in his mouth with a fresh piece   don t tell me you re anti robot .  i ve always heard that scientists are the one group that aren t anti robot .   black s patience snapped .  he said   that s true  and that s the trouble .  technology s gone robot happy .  any job has to have a robot  or the engineer in charge feels cheated .  you want a doorstop  buy a robot with a thick foot .  that s a serious thing .   he was speaking in a low  intense voice  shoving the words directly into ronson s ear .  ronson managed to extricate his arm .  he said   hey  i m no robot .  don t take it out on me .  i m a man .  homo sapiens .  you just broke an arm bone of mine .  isn t that proof .   having started  however  it took more than frivolity to stop black .  he said   do you know how much time was wasted on this setup .  we ve had a perfectly generalized robot built and we ve given it one order .  period .  i heard the order given .  i ve memorized it .  short and sweet .   seize the bar with a firm grip .  pull it toward you firmly .  firmly .  maintain your hold until the control board informs you that you have passed through hyperspace twice .    so at zero time  the robot will grab the control bar and pull it firmly toward himself .  his hands are heated to blood temperature .  once the control bar is in position  heat expansion completes contact and hyperfield is initiated .  if anything happens to his brain during the first trip through hyperspace  it doesn t matter .  all he needs to do is maintain position one microinstant and the ship will come back and the hyperfield will flip off .  nothing can go wrong .  then we study all its generalized reactions and see what  if anything  has gone wrong .   ronson looked blank .   this all makes sense to me .    does it .   asked black bitterly .   and what will you learn from a robot brain .  it s positronic  ours is cellular .  it s metal  ours is protein .  they re not the same .  there s no comparison .  yet i m convinced that on the basis of what they learn  or think they learn  from the robot  they ll send men into hyperspace .  poor devils .  look  it s not a question of dying .  it s coming back mindless .  if you d seen the chimpanzee  you d know what i mean .  death is clean and final .  the other thing   the reporter said   have you talked about this to anyone .   black said   yes .  they say what you said .  they say i m anti robot and that settles everything .   look at susan calvin there .  you can bet she isn t anti robot .  she came all the way from earth to watch this experiment .  if it had been a man at the controls  she wouldn t have bothered .  but what s the use .    hey   said ronson   don t stop now .  there s more .    more what .    more problems .  you ve explained the robot .  but why the security provisions all of a sudden .    huh .    come on .  suddenly i can t send dispatches .  suddenly ships can t come into the area .  what s going on .  this is just another experiment .  the public knows about hyperspace and what you boys are trying to do  so what s the big secret .   the backwash of anger was still seeping over black  anger against the robots  anger against susan calvin  anger at the memory of that little lost robot in his past .  there was some to spare  he found  for the irritating little newsman and his irritating little questions .  he said to himself  let s see how he takes it .  he said   you really want to know .    you bet .    all right .  we ve never initiated a hyperfield for any object a millionth as large as that ship  or to send anything a millionth as far .  that means that the hyperfield that will soon be initiated is some million million times as energetic as any we ve ever handled .  we re not sure what it can do .    what do you mean .    theory tells us that the ship will be neatly deposited out near sirius and neatly brought back here .  but how large a volume of space about the parsec will be carried with it .  it s hard to tell .  we don t know enough about hyperspace .  the asteroid on which the ship sits may go with it and  you know  if our calculations are even a little off  it may never be brought back here .  it may return  say  twenty billion miles away .  and there s a chance that more of space than just the asteroid may be shifted .    how much more .   demanded ronson .   we can t say .  there s an element of statistical uncertainty .  that s why no ships must approach too closely .  that s why we re keeping things quiet till the experiment is safely over .   ronson swallowed audibly .   supposing it reaches to hyper base .    there s a chance of it   said black with composure .   not much of a chance or director schloss wouldn t be here  i assure you .  still  there s a mathematical chance .   the newsman looked at his watch .   when does this all happen .    in about five minutes .  you re not nervous  are you .    no   said ronson  but he sat down blankly and asked no more questions .  black leaned outward over the railing .  the final minutes were ticking off .  the robot moved .  there was a mass sway of humanity forward at that sign of motion and the lights dimmed in order to sharpen and heighten the brightness of the scene below .  but so far it was only the first motion .  the hands of the robot approached the starting bar .  black waited for the final second when the robot would pull the bar toward himself .  black could imagine a number of possibilities  and all sprang nearly simultaneously to mind .  there would first be the short flicker that would indicate the departure through hyperspace and return .  even though the time interval was exceedingly short  return would not be to the precise starting position and there would be a flicker .  there always was .  then  when the ship returned  it might be found  perhaps  that the devices to even the field over the huge volume of the ship had proved inadequate .  the robot might be scrap steel .  the ship might be scrap steel .  or their calculations might be somewhat off and the ship might never return .  or worse still  hyper base might go with the ship and never return .  or  of course  all might be well .  the ship might flicker and be there in perfect shape .  the robot  with mind untouched  would get out of his seat and signal a successful completion of the first voyage of a man made object beyond the gravitational control of the sun .  the last minute was ticking off .  the last second came and the robot seized the starting bar and pulled it firmly toward himself   nothing .  no flicker .  nothing .  the parsec never left normal space .   major general kallner took off his officer s cap to mop his glistening forehead and in doing so exposed a bald head that would have aged him ten years in appearance if his drawn expression had not already done so .  nearly an hour had passed since the parsec s failure and nothing had been done .   how did it happen .  how did it happen .  i don t understand it .   dr .  mayer schloss  who at forty was the  grand old man  of the young science of hyperfield matrices  said hopelessly   there is nothing wrong with the basic theory .  i ll swear my life away on that .  there s a mechanical failure on the ship somewhere .  nothing more .   he had said that a dozen times .   i thought everything was tested .   that had been said too .   it was  sir  it was .  just the same   and that .  they sat staring at each other in kallner s office  which was now out of bounds for all personnel .  neither quite dared to look at the third person present .  susan calvin s thin lips and pale cheeks bore no expression .  she said coolly   you may console yourself with what i have told you before .  it is doubtful whether anything useful would have resulted .    this is not the time for the old argument   groaned schloss .   i am not arguing .  u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation will supply robots made up to specification to any legal purchaser for any legal use .  we did our part  however .  we informed you that we could not guarantee being able to draw conclusions with regard to the human brain from anything that happened to the positronic brain .  our responsibility ends there .  there is no argument .    great space   said general kallner  in a tone that made the expletive feeble indeed .   let s not discuss that .    what else was there to do .   muttered schloss  driven to the subject nevertheless .   until we know exactly what s happening to the mind in hyperspace we can t progress .  the robot s mind is at least capable of mathematical analysis .  it s a start  a beginning .  and until we try   he looked up wildly   but your robot isn t the point  dr .  calvin .  we re not worried about him or his positronic brain .  damn it  woman   his voice rose nearly to a scream .  the robopsychologist cut him to silence with a voice that scarcely raised itself from its level monotone .   no hysteria  man .  in my lifetime i have witnessed many crises and i have never seen one solved by hysteria .  i want answers to some questions .   schloss s full lips trembled and his deep set eyes seemed to retreat into their sockets and leave pits of shadow in their places .  he said harshly   are you trained in etheric engineering .    that is an irrelevant question .  i am chief robopsychologist of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation .  that is a positronic robot sitting at the controls of the parsec .  like all such robots  it is leased and not sold .  i have a right to demand information concerning any experiment in which such a robot is involved .    talk to her  schloss   barked general kallner .   she s she s all right .   dr .  calvin turned her pale eyes on the general  who had been present at the time of the affair of the lost robot and who therefore could be expected not to make the mistake of underestimating her .   schloss had been out on sick leave at the time  and hearsay is not as effective as personal experience .    thank you  general   she said .  schloss looked helplessly from one to the other and muttered   what do you want to know .    obviously my first question is  what is your problem if the robot is not .    but the problem is an obvious one .  the ship hasn t moved .  can t you see that .  are you blind .    i see quite well .  what i don t see is your obvious panic over some mechanical failure .  don t you people expect failure sometimes .   the general muttered   it s the expense .  the ship was hellishly expensive .  the world congress appropriations   he bogged down .   the ship s still there .  a slight overhaul and correction would involve no great trouble .   schloss had taken hold of himself .  the expression on his face was one of a man who had caught his soul in both hands  shaken it hard and set it on its feet .  his voice had even achieved a kind of patience .   dr .  calvin  when i say a mechanical failure  i mean something like a relay jammed by a speck of dust  a connection inhibited by a spot of grease  a transistor balked by a momentary heat expansion .  a dozen other things .  a hundred other things .  any of them can be quite temporary .  they can stop taking effect at any moment .    which means that at any moment the parsec may flash through hyperspace and back after all .    exactly .  now do you understand .    not at all .  wouldn t that be just what you want .   schloss made a motion that looked like the start of an effort to seize a double handful of hair and yank .  he said   you are not an etherics engineer .    does that tongue tie you  doctor .    we had the ship set   said schloss despairingly   to make a jump from a definite point in space relative to the center of gravity of the galaxy to another point .  the return was to be to the original point corrected for the motion of the solar system .  in the hour that has passed since the parsec should have moved  the solar system has shifted position .  the original parameters to which the hyperfield is adjusted no longer apply .  the ordinary laws of motion do not apply to hyperspace and it would take us a week of computation to calculate a new set of parameters .    you mean that if the ship moves now it will return to some unpredictable point thousands of miles away .    unpredictable .   schloss smiled hollowly .   yes  i should call it that .  the parsec might end up in the andromeda nebula or in the center of the sun .  in any case the odds are against our ever seeing it again .   susan calvin nodded .   the situation then is that if the ship disappears  as it may do at any moment  a few billion dollars of the taxpayers  money may be irretrievably gone  and it will be said through bungling .   major general kallner could not have winced more noticeably if he had been poked with a sharp pin in the fundament .  the robopsychologist went on   somehow  then  the ship s hyperfield mechanism must be put out of action  and that as soon as possible .  something will have to be unplugged or jerked loose or flicked off .   she was speaking half to herself .   it s not that simple   said schloss .   i can t explain it completely  since you re not an etherics expert .  it s like trying to break an ordinary electric circuit by slicing through high tension wire with garden shears .  it could be disastrous .  it would be disastrous .    do you mean that any attempt to shut off the mechanism would hurl the ship into hyperspace .    any random attempt would probably do so .  hyper forces are not limited by the speed of light .  it is very probable that they have no limit of velocity at all .  it makes things extremely difficult .  the only reasonable solution is to discover the nature of the failure and learn from that a safe way of disconnecting the field .    and how do you propose to do that  dr .  schloss .   schloss said   it seems to me that the only thing to do is to send one of our nestor robots    no .  don t be foolish   broke in susan calvin .  schloss said  freezingly   the nestors are acquainted with the problems of etherics engineering .  they will be ideally    out of the question .  you cannot use one of our positronic robots for such a purpose without my permission .  you do not have it and you shall not get it .    what is the alternative .    you must send one of your engineers .   schloss shook his head violently   impossible .  the risk involved is too great .  if we lose a ship and man    nevertheless  you may not use a nestor robot  or any robot .   the general said   i i must get in touch with earth .  this whole problem has to go to a higher level .   susan calvin said with asperity   i wouldn t just yet if i were you  general .  you will be throwing yourself on the government s mercy without a suggestion or plan of action of your own .  you will not come out very well  i am certain .    but what is there to do .   the general was using his handkerchief again .   send a man .  there is no alternative .   schloss had paled to a pasty gray .   it s easy to say  send a man .  but whom .    i ve been considering that problem .  isn t there a young man his name is black whom i met on the occasion of my previous visit to hyper base .    dr .  gerald black .    i think so .  yes .  he was a bachelor then .  is he still .    yes  i believe so .    i would suggest then that he be brought here  say  in fifteen minutes  and that meanwhile i have access to his records .   smoothly she had assumed authority in this situation  and neither kallner nor schloss made any attempt to dispute that authority with her .   black had seen susan calvin from a distance on this  her second visit to hyper base .  he had made no move to cut down the distance .  now that he had been called into her presence  he found himself staring at her with revulsion and distaste .  he scarcely noticed dr .  schloss and general kallner standing behind her .  he remembered the last time he had faced her thus  undergoing a cold dissection for the sake of a lost robot .  dr .  calvin s cool gray eyes were fixed steadily on his hot brown ones .   dr .  black   she said   i believe you understand the situation .   black said   i do .    something will have to be done .  the ship is too expensive to lose .  the bad publicity will probably mean the end of the project .   black nodded .   i ve been thinking that .    i hope you ve also thought that it will be necessary for someone to board the parsec  find out what s wrong  and uh deactivate it .   there was a moment s pause .  black said harshly   what fool would go .   kallner frowned and looked at schloss  who bit his lip and looked nowhere .  susan calvin said   there is  of course  the possibility of accidental activation of the hyperfield  in which case the ship may drive beyond all possible reach .  on the other hand  it may return somewhere within the solar system .  if so  no expense or effort will be spared to recover man and ship .   black said   idiot and ship .  just a correction .   susan calvin disregarded the comment .  she said   i have asked general kallner s permission to put it to you .  it is you who must go .   no pause at all here .  black said  in the flattest possible way   lady  i m not volunteering .    there are not a dozen men on hyper base with sufficient knowledge to have any chance at all of carrying this thing through successfully .  of those who have the knowledge  i ve selected you on the basis of our previous acquaintanceship .  you will bring to this task an understanding    look  i m not volunteering .    you have no choice .  surely you will face your responsibility .    my responsibility .  what makes it mine .    the fact that you are best fitted for the job .    do you know the risk .    i think i do   said susan calvin .   i know you don t .  you never saw that chimpanzee .  look  when i said  idiot and ship  i wasn t expressing an opinion .  i was telling you a fact .  i d risk my life if i had to .  not with pleasure  maybe  but i d risk it .  risking idiocy  a lifetime of animal mindlessness  is something i won t risk  that s all .   susan calvin glanced thoughtfully at the young engineer s sweating  angry face .  black shouted   send one of your robots  one of your ns   jobs .   the psychologist s eye reflected a kind of cold glitter .  she said with deliberation   yes  dr .  schloss suggested that .  but the ns   robots are leased by our firm  not sold .  they cost millions of dollars apiece  you know .  i represent the company and i have decided that they are too expensive to be risked in a matter such as this .   black lifted his hands .  they clenched and trembled close to his chest as though he were forcibly restraining them .   you re telling me you re saying you want me to go instead of a robot because i m more expendable .    it comes to that  yes .    dr .  calvin   said black   i d see you in hell first .    that statement might be almost literally true  dr .  black .  as general kallner will confirm  you are ordered to take this assignment .  you are under quasi military law here  i understand  and if you refuse an assignment  you can be court martialed .  a case like this will mean mercury prison and i believe that will be close enough to hell to make your statement uncomfortably accurate were i to visit you  though i probably would not .  on the other hand  if you agree to board the parsec and carry through this job  it will mean a great deal for your career .   black glared  red eyed  at her .  susan calvin said   give the man five minutes to think about this  general kallner  and get a ship ready .   two security guards escorted black out of the room .   gerald black felt cold .  his limbs moved as though they were not part of him .  it was as though he were watching himself from some remote  safe place  watching himself board a ship and make ready to leave for it and for the parsec .  he couldn t quite believe it .  he had bowed his head suddenly and said   i ll go .   but why .  he had never thought of himself as the hero type .  then why .  partly  of course  there was the threat of mercury prison .  partly it was the awful reluctance to appear a coward in the eyes of those who knew him  that deeper cowardice that was behind half the bravery in the world .  mostly  though  it was something else .  ronson of interplanetary press had stopped black momentarily as he was on his way to the ship .  black looked at ronson s bushed face and said .   what do you want .   ronson babbled .   listen .  when you get back  i want it exclusive .  i ll arrange any payment you want anything you want   black pushed him aside  sent him sprawling  and walked on .  the ship had a crew of two .  neither spoke to him .  their glances slid over and under and around him .  black didn t mind that .  they were scared spitless themselves and their ship was approaching the parsec like a kitten skittering sideways toward the first dog it had ever seen .  he could do without them .  there was only one face that he kept seeing .  the anxious expression of general kallner and the look of synthetic determination on schloss s face were momentary punctures on his consciousness .  they healed almost at once .  it was susan calvin s unruffled face that he saw .  her calm expressionlessness as he boarded the ship .  he stared into the blackness where hyper base had already disappeared into space  susan calvin .  doctor susan calvin .  robopsychologist susan calvin .  the robot that walks like a woman .  what were her three laws  he wondered .  first law  thou shalt protect the robot with all thy might and all thy heart and all thy soul .  second law  thou shalt hold the interests of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation holy provided it interfereth not with the first law .  third law  thou shalt give passing consideration to a human being provided it interfereth not with the first and second laws .  had she ever been young  he wondered savagely .  had she ever felt one honest emotion .  space .  how he wanted to do something something that would take that frozen look of nothing off her face .  and he would .  by the stars  he would .  let him but get out of this sane and he would see her smashed and her company with her and all the vile brood of robots with them .  it was that thought that was driving him more than fear of prison or desire for social prestige .  it was that thought that almost robbed him of fear altogether .  almost .  one of the pilots muttered at him  without looking   you can drop down from here .  it s half a mile under .   black said bitterly   aren t you landing .    strict orders not to .  the vibration of the landing might    what about the vibration of my landing .   the pilot said   i ve got my orders .   black said no more but climbed into his suit and waited for the inner lock to open .  a tool kit was welded firmly to the metal of the suit about his right thigh .  just as he stepped into the lock  the earpieces inside his helmet rumbled at him .   wish you luck  doctor .   it took a moment for him to realize that it came from the two men aboard ship  pausing in their eagerness to get out of that haunted volume of space to give him that much  anyway .   thanks   said black awkwardly  half resentfully .  and then he was out in space  tumbling slowly as the result of the slightly off center thrust of feet against outer lock .  he could see the parsec waiting for him  and by looking between his legs at the right moment of the tumble he could see the long hiss of the lateral jets of the ship that had brought him  as it turned to leave .  he was alone .  space  he was alone .  could any man in history ever have felt so alone .  would he know  he wondered sickly  if if anything happened .  would there be any moments of realization .  would he feel his mind fade and the light of reason and thought dim and blank out .  or would it happen suddenly  like the cut of a force knife .  in either case the thought of the chimpanzee  blank eyed  shivering with mindless terrors  was fresh within him .   the asteroid was twenty feet below him now .  it swam through space with an absolutely even motion .  barring human agency  no grain of sand upon it had as much as stirred through astronomical periods of time .  in the ultimate jarlessness of it  some small particle of grit encumbered a delicate working unit on board the parsec  or a speck of impure sludge in the fine oil that bathed some moving part had stopped it .  perhaps it required only a small vibration  a tiny tremor originating from the collision of mass and mass to unencumber that moving part  bringing it down along its appointed path  creating the hyperfield  blossoming it outward like an incredibly ripening rose .  his body was going to touch it and he drew his limbs together in his anxiety to  hit easy .   he did not want to touch the asteroid .  his skin crawled with intense aversion .  it came closer .  now now       nothing .  there was only the continuing touch of the asteroid  the uncanny moments of slowly mounting pressure that resulted from a mass of     pounds  himself plus suit  possessing full inertia but no weight to speak of .  black opened his eyes slowly and let the sight of stars enter .  the sun was a glowing marble  its brilliance muted by the polarizing shield over his faceplate .  the stars were correspondingly feeble but they made up the familiar arrangement .  with sun and constellations normal  he was still in the solar system .  he could even see hyper base  a small  dim crescent .  he stiffened in shock at the sudden voice in his ear .  it was schloss .  schloss said   we ve got you in view  dr .  black .  you are not alone .   black could have laughed at the phraseology  but he only said in a low  clear voice   clear off .  if you ll do that  you won t be distracting me .   a pause .  schloss s voice  more cajoling   if you care to report as you go along  it may relieve the tension .    you ll get information from me when i get back .  not before .   he said it bitterly  and bitterly his metal encased fingers moved to the control panel in his chest and blanked out the suit s radio .  they could talk into a vacuum now .  he had his own plans .  if he got out of this sane  it would be his show .  he got to his feet with infinite caution and stood on it .  he swayed a bit as involuntary muscular motions  tricked by the almost total lack of gravity into an endless series of overbalancings  pulled him this way and that .  on hyper base there was a pseudo gravitic field to hold them down .  black found that a portion of his mind was sufficiently detached to remember that and appreciate it in absentia .  the sun had disappeared behind a crag .  the stars wheeled visibly in time to the asteroid s one hour rotation period .  he could see the parsec from where he stood and now he moved toward it slowly  carefully tippy toe almost .   no vibration .  no vibration .  the words ran pleadingly through his mind .   before he was completely aware of the distance he had crossed  he was at the ship .  he was at the foot of the line of hand grips that led to the outer lock .  there he paused .  the ship looked quite normal .  or at least it looked normal except for the circle of steely knobs that girdled it one third of the way up  and a second circle two thirds of the way up .  at the moment  they must be straining to become the source poles of the hyperfield .  a strange desire to reach up and fondle one of them came over black .  it was one of those irrational impulses  like the momentary thought   what if i jumped .   that is almost inevitable when one stares down from a high building .  black took a deep breath and felt himself go clammy as he spread the fingers of both hands and then lightly  so lightly  put each hand flat against the side of the ship .   nothing .  he seized the lowest hand grip and pulled himself up  carefully .  he longed to be as experienced at null gravity manipulation as were the construction men .  you had to exert enough force to overcome inertia and then stop .  continue the pull a second too long and you would overbalance  careen into the side of the ship .  he climbed slowly  tippy fingers  his legs and hips swaying to the right as his left arm reached upward  to the left as his right arm reached upward .  a dozen rungs  and his fingers hovered over the contact that would open the outer lock .  the safety marker was a tiny green smear .  once again he hesitated .  this was the first use he would make of the ship s power .  his mind ran over the wiring diagrams and the force distributions .  if he pressed the contact  power would be siphoned off the micropile to pull open the massive slab of metal that was the outer lock .  well .  what was the use .  unless he had some idea as to what was wrong  there was no way of telling the effect of the power diversion .  he sighed and touched contact .  smoothly  with neither jar nor sound  a segment of the ship curled open .  black took one more look at the friendly constellations  they had not changed  and stepped into the softly illuminated cavity .  the outer lock closed behind him .  another contact now .  the inner lock had to be opened .  again he paused to consider .  air pressure within the ship would drop ever so slightly as the inner lock opened  and seconds would pass before the ship s electrolyzers could make up the loss .  well .  the bosch posterior plate  to name one item  was sensitive to pressure  but surely not this sensitive .  he sighed again  more softly  the skin of his fear was growing calloused  and touched the contact .  the inner lock opened .  he stepped into the pilot room of the parsec  and his heart jumped oddly when the first thing he saw was the visiplate  set for reception and powdered with stars .  he forced himself to look at them .   nothing .  cassiopeia was visible .  the constellations were normal and he was inside the parsec .  somehow he could feel the worst was over .  having come so far and remained within the solar system  having kept his mind so far  he felt something that was faintly like confidence begin to seep back .  there was an almost supernatural stillness about the parsec .  black had been in many ships in his life and there had always been the sounds of life  even if only the scuffing of a shoe or a cabin boy humming in the corridor .  here the very beating of his own heart seemed muffled to soundlessness .  the robot in the pilot s seat had its back to him .  it indicated by no response that it was aware of his having entered .  black bared his teeth in a savage grin and said sharply   release the bar .  stand up .   the sound of his voice was thunderous in the close quarters .  too late he dreaded the air vibrations his voice set up  but the stars on the visiplate remained unchanged .  the robot  of course  did not stir .  it could receive no sensations of any sort .  it could not even respond to the first law .  it was frozen in the unending middle of what should have been almost instantaneous process .  he remembered the orders it had been given .  they were open to no misunderstanding   seize the bar with a firm grip .  pull it toward you firmly .  firmly .  maintain your hold until the control board informs you that you have passed through hyperspace twice .   well  it had not yet passed through hyperspace once .  carefully  he moved closer to the robot .  it sat there with the bar pulled firmly back between its knees .  that brought the trigger mechanism almost into place .  the temperature of his metal hands then curled that trigger  thermocouple fashion  just sufficiently for contact to be made .  automatically black glanced at the thermometer reading set into the control board .  the robot s hands were at    centigrade  as they should be .  he thought sardonically  fine thing .  i m alone with this machine and i can t do anything about it .  what he would have liked to do was take a crowbar to it and smash it to filings .  he enjoyed the flavor of that thought .  he could see the horror on susan calvin s face  if any horror could creep through the ice  the horror of a smashed robot was it  .  like all positronic robots  this one shot was owned by u .  s .  robots  had been made there  had been tested there .  and having extracted what juice he could out of imaginary revenge  he sobered and looked about the ship .  after all  progress so far had been zero .   slowly  he removed his suit .  gently  he laid it on the rack .  gingerly  he walked from room to room  studying the large interlocking surfaces of the hyperatomic motor  following the cables  inspecting the field relays .  he touched nothing .  there were a dozen ways of deactivating the hyperfield  but each one would be ruinous unless he knew at least approximately where the error lay and let his exact course of procedure be guided by that .  he found himself back at the control panel and cried in exasperation at the grave stolidity of the robot s broad back   tell me  will you .  what s wrong .   there was the urge to attack the ship s machinery at random .  tear at it and get it over with .  he repressed the impulse firmly .  if it took him a week  he would deduce  somehow  the proper point of attack .  he owed that much to dr .  susan calvin and his plans for her .  he turned slowly on his heel and considered .  every part of the ship  from the engine itself to each individual two way toggle switch .  had been exhaustively checked and tested on hyper base .  it was almost impossible to believe that anything could go wrong .  there wasn t a thing on board ship well  yes  there was  of course .  the robot .  that had been tested at u .  s .  robots and they  blast their devils  hides  could be assumed to be competent .  what was it everyone always said  a robot can just naturally do a better job .  it was the normal assumption  based in part on u .  s .  robots  own advertising campaigns .  they could make a robot that would be better than a man for a given purpose .  not  as good as a man .   but  better than a man .   and as gerald black stared at the robot and thought that  his brows contracted under his low forehead and his look became compounded of astonishment and a wild hope .  he approached and circled the robot .  he stared at its arms holding the control bar in trigger position  holding it forever so  unless the ship jumped or the robot s own power supply gave out .  black breathed .   i bet .  i bet .   he stepped away  considered deeply  he said .   it s got to be .   he turned on ship s radio .  its carrier beam was already focused on hyper base .  he barked into the mouthpiece .   hey  schloss .   schloss was prompt in his answer .   great space .  black    never mind   said black crisply .   no speeches .  i just want to make sure you re watching .    yes  of course .  we all are .  look   but black turned off the radio .  he grinned with tight one sidedness at the tv camera inside the pilot room and chose a portion of the hyperfield mechanism that would be in view .  he didn t know how many people would be in the viewing room .  there might be only kallner  schloss and susan calvin .  there might be all personnel .  in any case  he would give them something to watch .  relay box     was adequate for the purpose  he decided .  it was located in a wall recess  coated over with a smooth cold seamed panel .  black reached into his tool kit and removed the splayed  blunt edged seamer .  he pushed his space suit farther back on the rack  having turned it to bring the tool kit in reach  and turned to the relay box .  ignoring a last tingle of uneasiness  black brought up the seamer  made contact at three separated points along the cold seam .  the tool s force field worked deftly and quickly  the handle growing a trifle warm in his hand as the surge of energy came and left .  the panel swung free .  he glanced quickly  almost involuntarily  at the ship s visiplate .  the stars were normal .  he  himself  felt normal .  that was the last bit of encouragement he needed .  he raised his foot and smashed his shoe down on the feather delicate mechanism within the recess .  there was a splinter of glass  a twisting of metal  and a tiny spray of mercury droplets black breathed heavily .  he turned on the radio once more .   still there  schloss .    yes  but    then i report the hyperfield on board the parsec to be deactivated .  come and get me .    gerald black felt no more the hero than when he had left for the parsec  but he found himself one just the same .  the men who had brought him to the small asteroid came to take him off .  they landed this time .  they clapped his back .  hyper base was a crowded mass of waiting personnel when the ship arrived  and black was cheered .  he waved at the throng and grinned  as was a hero s obligation  but he felt no triumph inside .  not yet .  only anticipation .  triumph would come later  when he met susan calvin .  he paused before descending from the ship .  he looked for her and did not see her .  general kallner was there  waiting  with all his soldierly stiffness restored and a bluff look of approval firmly plastered on his face .  mayer schloss smiled nervously at him .  ronson of interplanetary press waved frantically .  susan calvin was nowhere .  he brushed kallner and schloss aside when he landed .   i m going to wash and eat first .   he had no doubts but that  for the moment at least  he could dictate terms to the general or to anybody .  the security guards made a way for him .  he bathed and ate leisurely in enforced isolation  he himself being solely responsible for the enforcement .  then he called ronson of interplanetary and talked to him briefly .  he waited for the return call before he felt he could relax thoroughly .  it had all worked out so much better than he had expected .  the very failure of the ship had conspired perfectly with him .  finally he called the general s office and ordered a conference .  it was what it amounted to orders .  major general kallner all but said   yes  sir .    they were together again .  gerald black  kallner  schloss even susan calvin .  but it was black who was dominant now .  the robopsychologist  graven faced as ever  as unimpressed by triumph as by disaster  had nevertheless seemed by some subtle change of attitude to have relinquished the spotlight .  dr .  schloss nibbled a thumbnail and began by saying  cautiously   dr .  black  we are all very grateful for your bravery and success .   then  as though to institute a healthy deflation at once  he added   still  smashing the relay box with your heel was imprudent and well  it was an action that scarcely deserved success .   black said   it was an action that could scarcely have avoided success .  you see   this was bomb number one   by that time i knew what had gone wrong .   schloss rose to his feet .   you did .  are you sure .    go there yourself .  it s safe now .  i ll tell you what to look for .   schloss sat down again  slowly .  general kallner was enthusiastic .   why  this is the best yet  if true .    it s true   said black .  his eyes slid to susan calvin  who said nothing .  black was enjoying the sensation of power .  he released bomb number two by saying   it was the robot  of course .  did you hear that  dr .  calvin .   susan calvin spoke for the first time .   i hear it .  i rather expected it  as a matter of fact .  it was the only piece of equipment on board ship that had not been tested at hyper base .   for a moment black felt dashed .  he said   you said nothing of that .   dr .  calvin said   as dr .  schloss said several times  i am not an etherics expert .  my guess  and it was no more than that  might easily have been wrong .  i felt i had no right to prejudice you in advance of your mission .   black said   all right  did you happen to guess how it went wrong .    no  sir .    why  it was made better than a man .  that s what the trouble was .  isn t it strange that the trouble should rest with the very specialty of u .  s .  robots .  they make robots better than men  i understand .   he was slashing at her with words now but she did not rise to his bait .  instead  she sighed .   my dear dr .  black .  i am not responsible for the slogans of our sales promotion department .   black felt dashed again .  she wasn t an easy woman to handle  this calvin .  he said   your people built a robot to replace a man at the controls of the parsec .  he had to pull the control bar toward himself  place it in position and let the heat of his hands twist the trigger to make final contact .  simple enough  dr .  calvin .    simple enough  dr .  black .     and if the robot had been made no better than a man  he would have succeeded .  unfortunately  u .  s .  robots felt compelled to make it better than a man .  the robot was told to pull back the control bar firmly .  firmly .  the word was repeated  strengthened  emphasized .  so the robot did what it was told .  it pulled it back firmly .  there was only one trouble .  he was easily ten times stronger than the ordinary human being for whom the control bar was designed .     are you implying    i m saying the bar bent .  it bent back just enough to misplace the trigger .  when the heat of the robot s hand twisted the thermocouple  it did not make contact .   he grinned .   this isn t the failure of just one robot  dr .  calvin .  it s symbolic of the failure of the robot idea .    come now  dr .  black   said susan calvin icily   you re drowning logic in missionary psychology .  the robot was equipped with adequate understanding as well as with brute force .  had the men who gave it its orders used quantitative terms rather than the foolish adverb  firmly   this would not have happened .  had they said   apply a pull of fifty five pounds   all would have been well .    what you are saying   said black   is that the inadequacy of a robot must be made up for by the ingenuity and intelligence of a man .  i assure you that the people back on earth will look at it in that way and will not be in the mood to excuse u .  s .  robots for this fiasco .   major general kallner said quickly  with a return of authority to his voice   now wait  black  all that has happened is obviously classified information .    in fact   said schloss suddenly   your theory hasn t been checked yet .  we ll send a party to the ship and find out .  it may not be the robot at all .    you ll take care to make that discovery  will you .  i wonder if the people will believe an interested party .  besides which  i have one more thing to tell you .   he readied bomb number three and said   as of this moment  i m resigning from this man s project .  i m quitting .    why .   asked susan calvin .   because  as you said  dr .  calvin  i am a missionary   said black  smiling .   i have a mission .  i feel i owe it to the people of earth to tell them that the age of the robots has reached the point where human life is valued less than robot life .  it is now possible to order a man into danger because a robot is too precious to risk .  i believe earthmen should hear that .  many men have many reservations about robots as is .  u .  s .  robots has not yet succeeded in making it legally permissible to use robots on the planet earth itself .  i believe what i have to say  dr .  calvin  will complete the matter .  for this day s work  dr .  calvin  you and your company and your robots will be wiped off the face of the solar system .   he was forewarning her  black knew  he was forearming her  but he could not forego this scene .  he had lived for this very moment ever since he had first left for the parsec  and he could not give it up .  he all but gloated at the momentary glitter in susan calvin s pale eyes and at the faintest flush in her cheeks .  he thought  how do you feel now  madam scientist .  kallner said   you will not be permitted to resign  black  nor will you be permitted    how can you stop me  general .  i m a hero  haven t you heard .  and old mother earth will make much of its heroes .  it always has .  they ll want to hear from me and they ll believe anything i say .  and they won t like it if i m interfered with  at least not while i m a fresh  brand new hero .  i ve already talked to ronson of interplanetary press and told him i had something big for them  something that would rock every government official and science director right out of the chair plush  so interplanetary will be first in line  waiting to hear from me .  so what can you do except to have me shot .  and i think you d be worse off after that if you tried it .   black s revenge was complete .  he had spared no word .  he had hampered himself not in the least .  he rose to go .    one moment  dr .  black   said susan calvin .  her low voice carried authority .  black turned involuntarily  like a schoolboy at his teacher s voice  but he counteracted that gesture by a deliberately mocking   you have an explanation to make  i suppose .    not at all   she said primly .   you have explained for me  and quite well .  i chose you because i knew you would understand  though i thought you would understand sooner .  i had had contact with you before .  i knew you disliked robots and would  therefore  be under no illusions concerning them .  from your records  which i asked to see before you were given your assignment  i saw that you had expressed disapproval of this robot through hyperspace experiment .  your superiors held that against you  but i thought it a point in your favor .    what are you talking about  doctor  if you ll excuse my rudeness .    the fact that you should have understood why no robot could have been sent on this mission .  what was it you yourself said .  something about a robot s inadequacies having to be balanced by the ingenuity and intelligence of a man .  exactly so  young man  exactly so .  robots have no ingenuity .  their minds are finite and can be calculated to the last decimal .  that  in fact  is my job .   now if a robot is given an order  a precise order  he can follow it .  if the order is not precise  he cannot correct his own mistake without further orders .  isn t that what you reported concerning the robot on the ship .  how then can we send a robot to find a flaw in a mechanism when we cannot possibly give precise orders  since we know nothing about the flaw ourselves .   find out what s wrong  is not an order you can give to a robot  only to a man .  the human brain  so far at least  is beyond calculation .   black sat down abruptly and stared at the psychologist in dismay .  her words struck sharply on a substratum of understanding that had been larded over with emotion .  he found himself unable to refute her .  worse than that  a feeling of defeat encompassed him .  he said   you might have said this before i left .    i might have   agreed dr .  calvin   but i noticed your very natural fear for your sanity .  such an overwhelming concern would easily have hampered your efficiency as an investigator  and it occurred to me to let you think that my only motive in sending you was that i valued a robot more .  that  i thought  would make you angry  and anger  my dear dr .  black  is sometimes a very useful emotion .  at least  an angry man is never quite as afraid as he would be otherwise .  it worked out nicely  i think .   she folded her hands loosely in her lap and came as near a smile as she ever had in her life .  black said   i ll be damned .   susan calvin said   so now  if you ll take my advice  return to your job  accept your status as hero  and tell your reporter friend the details of your brave deed .  let that be the big news you promised him .   slowly  reluctantly  black nodded .  schloss looked relieved  kallner burst into a toothy smile .  they held out hands  not having said a word in all the time that susan calvin had spoken  and not saying a word now .  black took their hands and shook them with some reserve .  he said   it s your part that should be publicized  dr .  calvin .   susan calvin said icily   don t be a fool  young man .  this is my job .    lenny  united states robots and mechanical men corporation had a problem .  the problem was people .  peter bogert  senior mathematician  was on his way to assembly when he encountered alfred lanning  research director .  lanning was bending his ferocious white eyebrows together and staring down across the railing into the computer room .  on the floor below the balcony  a trickle of humanity of both sexes and various ages was looking about curiously  while a guide intoned a set speech about robotic computing .   this computer you see before you   he said   is the largest of its type in the world .  it contains five million three hundred thousand cryotrons and is capable of dealing simultaneously with over one hundred thousand variables .  with its help  u .  s .  robots is able to design with precision the positronic brains of new models .   the requirements are fed in on tape which is perforated by the action of this keyboard something like a very complicated typewriter or linotype machine  except that it does not deal with letters but with concepts .  statements are broken down into the symbolic logic equivalents and those in turn converted to perforation patterns .   the computer can  in less than one hour  present our scientists with a design for a brain which will give all the necessary positronic paths to make a robot .  .  .   alfred lanning looked up at last and noticed the other .   ah  peter   he said .  bogert raised both hands to smooth down his already perfectly smooth and glossy head of black hair .  he said   you don t look as though you think much of this  alfred .   lanning grunted .  the idea of public guided tours of u .  s .  robots was of fairly recent origin  and was supposed to serve a dual function .  on the one hand  the theory went  it allowed people to see robots at close quarters and counter their almost instinctive fear of the mechanical objects through increased familiarity .  and on the other hand  it was supposed to interest at least an occasional person in taking up robotics research as a life work .   you know i don t   lanning said finally .   once a week  work is disrupted .  considering the man hours lost  the return is insufficient .    still no rise in job applications  then .    oh  some  but only in the categories where the need isn t vital .  it s research men that are needed .  you know that .  the trouble is that with robots forbidden on earth itself  there s something unpopular about being a roboticist .    the damned frankenstein complex   said bogert  consciously imitating one of the other s pet phrases .  lanning missed the gentle jab .  he said   i ought to be used to it  but i never will .  you d think that by now every human being on earth would know that the three laws represented a perfect safeguard  that robots are simply not dangerous .  take this bunch .   he glowered down .   look at them .  most of them go through the robot assembly room for the thrill of fear  like riding a roller coaster .  then when they enter the room with the mec model damn it  peter  a mec model that will do nothing on god s green earth but take two steps forward  say  pleased to meet you  sir   shake hands  then take two steps back they back away and mothers snatch up their kids .  how do we expect to get brainwork out of such idiots .   bogert had no answer .  together  they stared down once again at the line of sightseers  now passing out of the computer room and into the positronic brain assembly section .  then they left .  they did not  as it turned out  observe mortimer w .  jacobson  age    who  to do him complete justice  meant no harm whatever .   in fact  it could not even be said to be mortimer s fault .  the day of the week on which the tour took place was known to all workers .  all devices in its path ought to have been carefully neutralized or locked  since it was unreasonable to expect human beings to withstand the temptation to handle knobs  keys  handles and pushbuttons .  in addition  the guide ought to have been very carefully on the watch for those who succumbed .  but  at the time  the guide had passed into the next room and mortimer was tailing the line .  he passed the keyboard on which instructions were fed into the computer .  he had no way of suspecting that the plans for a new robot design were being fed into it at that moment  or  being a good kid  he would have avoided the keyboard .  he had no way of knowing that  by what amounted to almost criminal negligence  a technician had not inactivated the keyboard .  so mortimer touched the keys at random as though he were playing a musical instrument .  he did not notice that a section of perforated tape stretched itself out of the instrument in another part of the room soundlessly  unobtrusively .  nor did the technician  when he returned  discover any signs of tampering .  he felt a little uneasy at noticing that the keyboard was live  but did not think to check .  after a few minutes  even his first trifling uneasiness was gone  and he continued feeding data into the computer .  as for mortimer  neither then  nor ever afterward  did he know what he had done .   the new lne model was designed for the mining of boron in the asteroid belt .  the boron hydrides were increasing in value yearly as primers for the proton micropiles that carried the ultimate load of power production on spaceships  and earth s own meager supply was running thin .  physically  that meant that the lne robots would have to be equipped with eyes sensitive to those lines prominent in the spectroscopic analysis of boron ores and the type of limbs most useful for the working up of ore to finished product .  as always  though  the mental equipment was the major problem .  the first lne positronic brain had been completed now .  it was the prototype and would join all other prototypes in u .  s .  robots  collection .  when finally tested  others would then be manufactured for leasing  never selling  to mining corporations .  lne prototype was complete now .  tall  straight  polished  it looked from outside like any of a number of not too specialized robot models .  the technician in charge  guided by the directions for testing in the handbook of robotics  said   how are you .   the indicated answer was to have been   i am well and ready to begin my functions .  i trust you are well  too   or some trivial modification thereof .  this first exchange served no purpose but to show that the robot could hear  understand a routine question  and make a routine reply congruent with what one would expect of a robotic attitude .  beginning from there  one could pass on to more complicated matters that would test the different laws and their interaction with the specialized knowledge of each particular model .  so the technician said   how are you .   he was instantly jolted by the nature of lne prototype s voice .  it had a quality like no robotic voice he had ever heard  and he had heard many  .  it formed syllables like the chimes of a low pitched celeste .  so surprising was this that it was only after several moments that the technician heard  in retrospect  the syllables that had been formed by those heavenly tones .  they were   da  da  da  goo .   the robot still stood tall and straight but its right hand crept upward and a finger went into its mouth .  the technician stared in absolute horror and bolted .  he locked the door behind him and  from another room  put in an emergency call to dr .  susan calvin .   dr .  susan calvin was u .  s .  robots   and  virtually  mankind s  only robopsychologist .  she did not have to go very far in her testing of lne prototype before she called very peremptorily for a transcript of the computer drawn plans of the positronic brain paths and the taped instructions that had directed them .  after some study  she  in turn  sent for bogert .  her iron gray hair was drawn severely back  her cold face  with its strong vertical lines marked off by the horizontal gash of the pale  thin lipped mouth  turned intensely upon him .   what is this  peter .   bogert studied the passages she pointed out with increasing stupefaction and said   good lord  susan  it makes no sense .    it most certainly doesn t .  how did it get into the instructions .   the technician in charge  called upon  swore in all sincerity that it was none of his doing  and that he could not account for it .  the computer checked out negative for all attempts at flaw finding .   the positronic brain   said susan calvin  thoughtfully   is past redemption .  so many of the higher functions have been cancelled out by these meaningless directions that the result is very like a human baby .   bogert looked surprised  and susan calvin took on a frozen attitude at once  as she always did at the least expressed or implied doubt of her word .  she said   we make every effort to make a robot as mentally like a man as possible .  eliminate what we call the adult functions and what is naturally left is a human infant  mentally speaking .  why do you look so surprised  peter .   lne prototype  who showed no signs of understanding any of the things that were going on around it  suddenly slipped into a sitting position and began a minute examination of its feet .  bogert stared at it .   it s a shame to have to dismantle the creature .  it s a handsome job .    dismantle it .   said the robopsychologist forcefully .   of course  susan .  what s the use of this thing .  good lord  if there s one object completely and abysmally useless it s a robot without a job it can perform .  you don t pretend there s a job this thing can do  do you .    no  of course not .    well  then .   susan calvin said  stubbornly   i want to conduct more tests .   bogert looked at her with a moment s impatience  then shrugged .  if there was one person at u .  s .  robots with whom it was useless to dispute  surely that was susan calvin .  robots were all she loved  and long association with them  it seemed to bogert  had deprived her of any appearance of humanity .  she was no more to be argued out of a decision than was a triggered micropile to be argued out of operating .   what s the use .   he breathed  then aloud  hastily   will you let us know when your tests are complete .    i will   she said .   come  lenny .    lne  thought bogert .  that becomes lenny .  inevitable .   susan calvin held out her hand but the robot only stared at it .  gently  the robopsychologist reached for the robot s hand and took it .  lenny rose smoothly to its feet  its mechanical coordination  at least  worked well  .  together they walked out  robot topping woman by two feet .  many eyes followed them curiously down the long corridors .   one wall of susan calvin s laboratory  the one opening directly off her private office  was covered with a highly magnified reproduction of a positronic path chart .  susan calvin had studied it with absorption for the better part of a month .  she was considering it now  carefully  tracing the blunted paths through their contortions .  behind her  lenny sat on the floor  moving its legs apart and together  crooning meaningless syllables to itself in a voice so beautiful that one could listen to the nonsense and be ravished .  susan calvin turned to the robot   lenny lenny   she repeated this patiently until finally lenny looked up and made an inquiring sound .  the robopsychologist allowed a glimmer of pleasure to cross her face fleetingly .  the robot s attention was being gained in progressively shorter intervals .  she said   raise your hand  lenny .  hand up .  hand up .   she raised her own hand as she said it  over and over .  lenny followed the movement with its eyes .  up  down  up  down .  then it made an abortive gesture with its own hand and chimed   eh uh .    very good  lenny   said susan calvin  gravely .   try it again .  hand up .   very gently  she reached out her own hand  took the robot s  and raised it  lowered it .   hand up .  hand up .   a voice from her office called and interrupted .   susan .   calvin halted with a tightening of her lips .   what is it  alfred .   the research director walked in  and looked at the chart on the wall and at the robot .   still at it .    i m at my work  yes .    well  you know  susan .  .  .   he took out a cigar  staring at it hard  and made as though to bite off the end .  in doing so  his eyes met the woman s stern look of disapproval  and he put the cigar away and began over .   well  you know  susan  the lne model is in production now .    so i ve heard .  is there something in connection with it you wish of me .    no o .  still  the mere fact that it is in production and is doing well means that working with this messed up specimen is useless .  shouldn t it be scrapped .    in short  alfred  you are annoyed that i am wasting my so valuable time .  feel relieved .  my time is not being wasted .  i am working with this robot .    but the work has no meaning .    i ll be the judge of that  alfred .   her voice was ominously quiet  and lanning thought it wiser to shift his ground .   will you tell me what meaning it has .  what are you doing with it right now  for instance .    i m trying to get it to raise its hand on the word of command .  i m trying to get it to imitate the sound of the word .   as though on cue  lenny said   eh uh and raised its hand waveringly .  lanning shook his head .   that voice is amazing .  how does it happen .   susan calvin said   i don t quite know .  its transmitter is a normal one .  it could speak normally  i m sure .  it doesn t  however  it speaks like this as a consequence of something in the positronic paths that i have not yet pinpointed .    well  pinpoint it  for heaven s sake .  speech like that might be useful .    oh  then there is some possible use in my studies on lenny .   lanning shrugged in embarrassment .   oh  well  it s a minor point .    i m sorry you don t see the major points  then   said susan calvin with asperity   which are much more important  but that s not my fault .  would you leave now  alfred  and let me go on with my work .    lanning got to his cigar  eventually  in bogert s office .  he said  sourly   that woman is growing more peculiar daily .   bogert understood perfectly .  in the u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation  there was only one  that woman .   he said   is she still scuffing about with that pseudo robot that lenny of hers .    trying to get it to talk  so help me .   bogert shrugged .   points up the company problem .  i mean  about getting qualified personnel for research .  if we had other robopsychologists  we could retire susan .  incidentally  i presume the directors  meeting scheduled for tomorrow is for the purpose of dealing with the procurement problem .   lanning nodded and looked at his cigar as though it didn t taste good .   yes .  quality  though  not quantity .  we ve raised wages until there s a steady stream of applicants those who are interested primarily in money .  the trick is to get those who are interested primarily in robotics a few more like susan calvin .    hell  no .  not like her .    well  not like her personally .  but you ll have to admit  peter  that she s single minded about robots .  she has no other interest in life .    i know .  and that s exactly what makes her so unbearable .   lanning nodded .  he had lost count of the many times it would have done his soul good to have fired susan calvin .  he had also lost count of the number of millions of dollars she had at one time or another saved the company .  she was a truly indispensable woman and would remain one until she died or until they could lick the problem of finding men and women of her own high caliber who were interested in robotics research .  he said   i think we ll cut down on the tour business .   peter shrugged .   if you say so .  but meanwhile  seriously  what do we do about susan .  she can easily tie herself up with lenny indefinitely .  you know how she is when she gets what she considers an interesting problem .    what can we do .   said lanning .   if we become too anxious to pull her off  she ll stay on out of feminine contrariness .  in the last analysis  we can t force her to do anything .   the dark haired mathematician smiled .   i wouldn t ever apply the adjective  feminine  to any part of her .    oh  well   said lanning  grumpily .   at least  it won t do anyone any actual harm .   in that  if in nothing else  he was wrong .  the emergency signal is always a tension making thing in any large industrial establishment .  such signals had sounded in the history of u .  s .  robots a dozen times for fire  flood  riot and insurrection .  but one thing had never occurred in all that time .  never had the particular signal indicating  robot out of control  sounded .  no one ever expected it to sound .  it was only installed at government insistence .    damn the frankenstein complex   lanning would mutter on those rare occasions when he thought of it .   now  finally  the shrill siren rose and fell at ten second intervals  and practically no worker from the president of the board of directors down to the newest janitor s assistant recognized the significance of the strange sound for a few moments .  after those moments passed  there was a massive convergence of armed guards and medical men to the indicated area of danger and u .  s .  robots was struck with paralysis .  charles randow  computing technician  was taken off to hospital level with a broken arm .  there was no other damage .  no other physical damage .   but the moral damage   roared lanning   is beyond estimation .   susan calvin faced him  murderously calm .   you will do nothing to lenny .  nothing .  do you understand .    do you understand  susan .   that thing has hurt a human being .  it has broken first law .  don t you know what first law is .    you will do nothing to lenny .    for god s sake  susan  do i have to tell you first law .  a robot may not harm a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  our entire position depends on the fact that first law is rigidly observed by all robots of all types .  if the public should hear  and they will hear  that there was an exception  even one exception  we might be forced to close down altogether .  our only chance of survival would be to announce at once that the robot involved had been destroyed  explain the circumstances  and hope that the public can be convinced that it will never happen again .    i would like to find out exactly what happened   said susan calvin .   i was not present at the time and i would like to know exactly what the randow boy was doing in my laboratories without my permission .    the important thing that happened   said lanning   is obvious .  your robot struck randow and the damn fool flashed the  robot out of control  button and made a case of it .  but your robot struck him and inflicted damage to the extent of a broken arm .  the truth is your lenny is so distorted it lacks first law and it must be destroyed .    it does not lack first law .  i have studied its brainpaths and know it does not lack it .    then how could it strike a man .   desperation turned him to sarcasm .   ask lenny .  surely you have taught it to speak by now .   susan calvin s cheeks bushed a painful pink .  she said   i prefer to interview the victim .  and in my absence  alfred  i want my offices sealed tight  with lenny inside .  i want no one to approach him .  if any harm comes to him while i am gone  this company will not see me again under any circumstances .    will you agree to its destruction  if it has broken first law .    yes   said susan calvin   because i know it hasn t .    charles randow lay in bed with his arm set and in a cast .  his major suffering was still from the shock of those few moments in which he thought a robot was advancing on him with murder in its positronic mind .  no other human had ever had such reason to fear direct robotic harm as he had had just then .  he had had a unique experience .  susan calvin and alfred lanning stood beside his bed now  peter bogert  who had met them on the way  was with them .  doctors and nurses had been shooed out .  susan calvin said   now what happened .   randow was daunted .  he muttered   the thing hit me in the arm .  it was coming at me .   calvin said   move further back in the story .  what were you doing in my laboratory without authorization .   the young computer swallowed  and the adam s apple in his thin neck bobbed noticeably .  he was high cheekboned and abnormally pale .  he said   we all knew about your robot .  the word is you were trying to teach it to talk like a musical instrument .  there were bets going as to whether it talked or not .  some said uh you could teach a gatepost to talk .    i suppose   said susan calvin  freezingly   that is meant as a compliment .  what did that have to do with you .    i was supposed to go in there and settle matters see if it would talk  you know .  we swiped a key to your place and i waited till you were gone and went in .  we had a lottery on who was to do it .  i lost .    then .    i tried to get it to talk and it hit me .    what do you mean  you tried to get it to talk .  how did you try .    i i asked it questions  but it wouldn t say anything  and i had to give the thing a fair shake  so i kind of yelled at it  and    and .   there was a long pause .  under susan calvin s unwavering stare  randow finally said   i tried to scare it into saying something .   he added defensively   i had to give the thing a fair shake .    how did you try to scare it .    i pretended to take a punch at it .    and it brushed your arm aside .    it hit my arm .    very well .  that s all .   to lanning and bogert  she said   come  gentlemen .   at the doorway  she turned back to randow .   i can settle the bets going around  if you are still interested .  lenny can speak a few words quite well .    they said nothing until they were in susan calvin s office .  its walls were lined with her books  some of which she had written herself .  it retained the patina of her own frigid  carefully ordered personality .  it had only one chair in it and she sat down .  lanning and bogert remained standing .  she said   lenny only defended itself .  that is the third law  a robot must protect its own existence .    except   said lanning forcefully   when this conflicts with the first or second laws .  complete the statement .  lenny had no right to defend itself in any way at the cost of harm  however minor  to a human being .    nor did it   shot back calvin   knowingly .  lenny has an aborted brain .  it had no way of knowing its own strength or the weakness of humans .  in brushing aside the threatening arm of a human being it could not know the bone would break .  in human terms  no moral blame can be attached to an individual who honestly cannot differentiate good and evil .   bogert interrupted  soothingly   now  susan  we don t blame .  we understand that lenny is the equivalent of a baby  humanly speaking  and we don t blame it .  but the public will .  u .  s .  robots will be closed down .    quite the opposite .  if you had the brains of a flea  peter  you would see that this is the opportunity u .  s .  robots is waiting for .  that this will solve its problems .   lanning hunched his white eyebrows low .  he said  softly   what problems  susan .    isn t the corporation concerned about maintaining our research personnel at the present heaven help us high level .    we certainly are .    well  what are you offering prospective researchers .  excitement .  novelty .  the thrill of piercing the unknown .  no .  you offer them salaries and the assurance of no problems .   bogert said   how do you mean  no problems .    are there problems .   shot back susan calvin .   what kind of robots do we turn out .  fully developed robots  fit for their tasks .  an industry tells us what it needs  a computer designs the brain  machinery forms the robot  and there it is  complete and done .  peter  some time ago  you asked me with reference to lenny what its use was .  what s the use  you said  of a robot that was not designed for any job .  now i ask you what s the use of a robot designed for only one job .  it begins and ends in the same place .  the lne models mine boron .  if beryllium is needed  they are useless .  if boron technology enters a new phase  they become useless .  a human being so designed would be sub human .  a robot so designed is sub robotic .    do you want a versatile robot .   asked lanning  incredulously .   why not .   demanded the robopsychologist .   why not .  i ve been handed a robot with a brain almost completely stultified .  i ve been teaching it  and you  alfred  asked me what was the use of that .  perhaps very little as far as lenny itself is concerned  since it will never progress beyond the five year old level on a human scale .  but what s the use in general .  a very great deal  if you consider it as a study in the abstract problem of learning how to teach robots .  i have learned ways to short circuit neighboring pathways in order to create new ones .  more study will yield better  more subtle and more efficient techniques of doing so .    well .    suppose you started with a positronic brain that had all the basic pathways carefully outlined but none of the secondaries .  suppose you then started creating secondaries .  you could sell basic robots designed for instruction  robots that could be modeled to a job  and then modeled to another  if necessary .  robots would become as versatile as human beings .  robots could learn .   they stared at her .  she said  impatiently   you still don t understand  do you .    i understand what you are saying   said lanning .   don t you understand that with a completely new field of research and completely new techniques to be developed  with a completely new area of the unknown to be penetrated  youngsters will feel a new urge to enter robotics .  try it and see .    may i point out   said bogert  smoothly   that this is dangerous .  beginning with ignorant robots such as lenny will mean that one could never trust first law exactly as turned out in lenny s case .    exactly .  advertise the fact .    advertise it .    of course .  broadcast the danger .  explain that you will set up a new research institute on the moon  if earth s population chooses not to allow this sort of thing to go on upon earth  but stress the danger to the possible applicants by all means .   lanning said   for god s sake  why .    because the spice of danger will add to the lure .  do you think nuclear technology involves no danger and spationautics no peril .  has your lure of absolute security been doing the trick for you .  has it helped you to cater to the frankenstein complex you all despise so .  try something else then  something that has worked in other fields .   there was a sound from beyond the door that led to calvin s personal laboratories .  it was the chiming sound of lenny .  the robopsychologist broke off instantly  listening .  she said   excuse me .  i think lenny is calling me .    can it call you .   said lanning .   i said i ve managed to teach it a few words .   she stepped toward the door  a little flustered .   if you will wait for me   they watched her leave and were silent for a moment .  then lanning said   do you think there s anything to what she says  peter .    just possibly  alfred   said bogert .   just possibly .  enough for us to bring the matter up at the directors  meeting and see what they say .  after all  the fat is in the fire .  a robot has harmed a human being and knowledge of it is public .  as susan says  we might as well try to turn the matter to our advantage .  of course  i distrust her motives in all this .    how do you mean .    even if all she has said is perfectly true  it is only rationalization as far as she is concerned .  her motive in all this is her desire to hold on to this robot .  if we pressed her   and the mathematician smiled at the incongruous literal meaning of the phrase   she would say it was to continue learning techniques of teaching robots  but i think she has found another use for lenny .  a rather unique one that would fit only susan of all women .    i don t get your drift .   bogert said   did you hear what the robot was calling .    well  no  i didn t quite   began lanning  when the door opened suddenly  and both men stopped talking at once .  susan calvin stepped in again  looking about uncertainly .   have either of you seen i m positive i had it somewhere about oh  there it is .   she ran to a corner of one bookcase and picked up an object of intricate metal webbery  dumbbell shaped and hollow  with variously shaped metal pieces inside each hollow  just too large to be able to fallout of the webbing .  as she picked it up  the metal pieces within moved and struck together  clicking pleasantly .  it struck lanning that the object was a kind of robotic version of a baby rattle .  as susan calvin opened the door again to pass through  lenny s voice chimed again from within .  this time  lanning heard it clearly as it spoke the words susan calvin had taught it .  in heavenly celeste like sounds  it called out   mommie  i want you .  i want you  mommie .   and the footsteps of susan calvin could be heard hurrying eagerly across the laboratory floor toward the only kind of baby she could ever have or love .   galley slave  the united states robots and mechanical men corporation  as defendants in the case  had influence enough to force a closed doors trial without a jury .  nor did northeastern university try hard to prevent it .  the trustees knew perfectly well how the public might react to any issue involving misbehavior of a robot  however rarefied that misbehavior might be .  they also had a clearly visualized notion of how an antirobot riot might become an antiscience riot without warning .  the government  as represented in this case by justice harlow shane  was equally anxious for a quiet end to this mess .  both u .  s .  robots and the academic world were bad people to antagonize .  justice shane said   since neither press  public nor jury is present  gentlemen  let us stand on as little ceremony as we can and get to the facts .   he smiled stiffly as he said this  perhaps without much hope that his request would be effective  and hitched at his robe so that he might sit more comfortably .  his face was pleasantly rubicund  his chin round and soft  his nose broad and his eyes light in color and wide set .  all in all  it was not a face with much judicial majesty and the judge knew it .  barnabas h .  goodfellow  professor of physics at northeastern u .   was sworn in first  taking the usual vow with an expression that made mincemeat of his name .  after the usual opening gambit questions  prosecution shoved his hands deep into his pockets and said   when was it  professor  that the matter of the possible employ of robot ez    was first brought to your attention  and how .   professor goodfellow s small and angular face set itself into an uneasy expression  scarcely more benevolent than the one it replaced .  he said   i have had professional contact and some social acquaintance with dr .  alfred lanning  director of research at u .  s .  robots .  i was inclined to listen with some tolerance then when i received a rather strange suggestion from him on the third of march of last year    of      .    that s right .    excuse me for interrupting .  please proceed .   the professor nodded frostily  scowled to fix the facts in his mind  and began to speak .   professor goodfellow looked at the robot with a certain uneasiness .  it had been carried into the basement supply room in a crate  in accordance with the regulations governing the shipment of robots from place to place on the earth s surface .  he knew it was coming  it wasn t that he was unprepared .  from the moment of dr .  lanning s first phone call on march    he had felt himself giving way to the other s persuasiveness  and now  as an inevitable result  he found himself face to face with a robot .  it looked uncommonly large as it stood within arm s reach .  alfred lanning cast a hard glance of his own at the robot  as though making certain it had not been damaged in transit .  then he turned his ferocious eyebrows and his mane of white hair in the professor s direction .   this is robot ez     first of its model to be available for public use .   he turned to the robot .   this is professor goodfellow  easy .   easy spoke impassively  but with such suddenness that the professor shied .   good afternoon  professor .   easy stood seven feet tall and had the general proportions of a man always the prime selling point of u .  s .  robots .  that and the possession of the basic patents on the positronic brain had given them an actual monopoly on robots and a near monopoly on computing machines in general .  the two men who had uncrated the robot had left now and the professor looked from lanning to the robot and back to lanning .   it is harmless  i m sure .   he didn t sound sure .   more harmless than i am   said lanning .   i could be goaded into striking you .  easy could not be .  you know the three laws of robotics  i presume .    yes  of course   said goodfellow .   they are built into the positronic patterns of the brain and must be observed .  the first law  the prime rule of robotic existence  safeguards the life and well being of all humans .   he paused  rubbed at his cheek  then added   it s something of which we would like to persuade all earth if we could .    it s just that he seems formidable .    granted .  but whatever he seems  you ll find that he is useful .    i m not sure in what way .  our conversations were not very helpful in that respect .  still  i agreed to look at the object and i m doing it .    we ll do more than look  professor .  have you brought a book .    i have .    may i see it .   professor goodfellow reached down without actually taking his eyes off the metal in human shape that confronted him .  from the briefcase at his feet  he withdrew a book .  lanning held out his hand for it and looked at the backstrip .   physical chemistry of electrolytes in solution .  fair enough  sir .  you selected this yourself  at random .  it was no suggestion of mine  this particular text .  am i right .    yes .   lanning passed the book to robot ez    .   the professor jumped a little .   no .  that s a valuable book .   lanning raised his eyebrows and they looked like shaggy coconut icing .  he said   easy has no intention of tearing the book in two as a feat of strength  i assure you .  it can handle a book as carefully as you or i .  go ahead  easy .    thank you  sir   said easy .  then  turning its metal bulk slightly  it added   with your permission  professor goodfellow .   the professor stared  then said   yes yes  of course .   with a slow and steady manipulation of metal fingers  easy turned the pages of the book  glancing at the left page  then the right  turning the page  glancing left  then right  turning the page and so on for minute after minute .  the sense of its power seemed to dwarf even the large cement walled room in which they stood and to reduce the two human watchers to something considerably less than life size .  goodfellow muttered   the light isn t very good .    it will do .   then  rather more sharply   but what is he doing .    patience  sir .   the last page was turned eventually .  lanning asked   well  easy .   the robot said   it is a most accurate book and there is little to which i can point .  on line    of page     the word  positive  is spelled p o i s t i v e .  the comma in line   of page    is superfluous  whereas one should have been used on line    of page    .  the plus sign in equation xiv   on page     should be a minus sign if it is to be consistent with the previous equations    wait .  wait .   cried the professor .   what is he doing .    doing .   echoed lanning in sudden irascibility .   why  man  he has already done it .  he has proofread that book .    proofread it .    yes .  in the short time it took him to turn those pages  he caught every mistake in spelling  grammar and punctuation .  he has noted errors in word order and detected inconsistencies .  and he will retain the information  letter perfect  indefinitely .   the professor s mouth was open .  he walked rapidly away from lanning and easy and as rapidly back .  he folded his arms across his chest and stared at them .  finally he said   you mean this is a proofreading robot .   lanning nodded .   among other things .    but why do you show it to me .    so that you might help me persuade the university to obtain it for use .    to read proof .    among other things   lanning repeated patiently .  the professor drew his pinched face together in a kind of sour disbelief .   but this is ridiculous .    why .    the university could never afford to buy this half ton it must weigh that at least this half ton proofreader .    proofreading is not all it will do .  it will prepare reports from outlines  fill out forms  serve as an accurate memory file  grade papers   all picayune .    lanning said   not at all  as i can show you in a moment .  but i think we can discuss this more comfortably in your office  if you have no objection .    no  of course not   began the professor mechanically and took a half step as though to turn .  then he snapped out   but the robot we can t take the robot .  really  doctor  you ll have to crate it up again .    time enough .  we can leave easy here .    unattended .    why not .  he knows he is to stay .  professor goodfellow  it is necessary to understand that a robot is far more reliable than a human being .    i would be responsible for any damage    there will be no damage .  i guarantee that .  look  it s after hours .  you expect no one here  i imagine  before tomorrow morning .  the truck and my two men are outside .  u .  s .  robots will take any responsibility that may arise .  none will .  call it a demonstration of the reliability of the robot .   the professor allowed himself to be led out of the storeroom .  nor did he look entirely comfortable in his own office  five stories up .  he dabbed at the line of droplets along the upper half of his forehead with a white handkerchief .   as you know very well  dr .  lanning  there are laws against the use of robots on earth s surface   he pointed out .   the laws  professor goodfellow  are not simple ones .  robots may not be used on public thoroughfares or within public edifices .  they may not be used on private grounds or within private structures except under certain restrictions that usually turn out to be prohibitive .  the university  however  is a large and privately owned institution that usually receives preferential treatment .  if the robot is used only in a specific room for only academic purposes  if certain other restrictions are observed and if the men and women having occasion to enter the room cooperate fully  we may remain within the law .    but all that trouble just to read proof .    the uses would be infinite .  professor .  robotic labor has so far been used only to relieve physical drudgery .  isn t there such a thing as mental drudgery .  when a professor capable of the most useful creative thought is forced to spend two weeks painfully checking the spelling of lines of print and i offer you a machine that can do it in thirty minutes  is that picayune .    but the price    the price need not bother you .  you cannot buy ez    .  u .  s .  robots does not sell its products .  but the university can lease ez    for a thousand dollars a year considerably less than the cost of a single microwave spectograph continuous recording attachment .   goodfellow looked stunned .  lanning followed up his advantage by saying   i only ask that you put it up to whatever group makes the decisions here .  i would be glad to speak to them if they want more information .    well   goodfellow said doubtfully   i can bring it up at next week s senate meeting .  i can t promise that will do any good  though .    naturally   said lanning .   the defense attorney was short and stubby and carried himself rather portentously  a stance that had the effect of accentuating his double chin .  he stared at professor goodfellow  once that witness had been handed over  and said   you agreed rather readily  did you not .   the professor said briskly   i suppose i was anxious to be rid of dr .  lanning .  i would have agreed to anything .    with the intention of forgetting about it after he left .    well    nevertheless  you did present the matter to a meeting of the executive board of the university senate .    yes  i did .    so that you agreed in good faith with dr .  lanning s suggestions .  you weren t just going along with a gag .  you actually agreed enthusiastically  did you not .    i merely followed ordinary procedures .    as a matter of fact  you weren t as upset about the robot as you now claim you were .  you know the three laws of robotics and you knew them at the time of your interview with dr .  lanning .    well  yes .    and you were perfectly willing to leave a robot at large and unattended .    dr .  lanning assured me    surely you would never have accepted his assurance if you had had the slightest doubt that the robot might be in the least dangerous .   the professor began frigidly   i had every faith in the word    that is all   said defense abruptly .  as professor goodfellow  more than a bit ruffled  stood down  justice shane leaned forward and said   since i am not a robotics man myself  i would appreciate knowing precisely what the three laws of robotics are .  would dr .  lanning quote them for the benefit of the court .   dr .  lanning looked startled .  he had been virtually bumping heads with the gray haired woman at his side .  he rose to his feet now and the woman looked up  too expressionlessly .  dr .  lanning said   very well  your honor .   he paused as though about to launch into an oration and said  with laborious clarity   first law  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  second law  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  third law  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .    i see   said the judge  taking rapid notes .   these laws are built into every robot  are they .    into every one .  that will be borne out by any roboticist .    and into robot ez    specifically .    yes  your honor .    you will probably be required to repeat those statements under oath .    i am ready to do so  your honor .   he sat down again .  dr .  susan calvin  robopsychologist in chief for u .  s .  robots  who was the gray haired woman sitting next to lanning  looked at her titular superior without favor  but then she showed favor to no human being .  she said   was goodfellow s testimony accurate  alfred .    essentially   muttered lanning .   he wasn t as nervous as all that about the robot and he was anxious enough to talk business with me when he heard the price .  but there doesn t seem to be any drastic distortion .   dr .  calvin said thoughtfully   it might have been wise to put the price higher than a thousand .    we were anxious to place easy .    i know .  too anxious  perhaps .  they ll try to make it look as though we had an ulterior motive .   lanning looked exasperated .   we did .  i admitted that at the university senate meeting .    they can make it look as if we had one beyond the one we admitted .   scott robertson  son of the founder of u .  s .  robots and still owner of a majority of the stock  leaned over from dr .  calvin s other side and said in a kind of explosive whisper   why can t you get easy to talk so we ll know where we re at .    you know he can t talk about it  mr .  robertson .    make him .  you re the psychologist  dr .  calvin .  make him .    if i m the psychologist  mr .  robertson   said susan calvin coldly   let me make the decisions .  my robot will not be made to do anything at the price of his well being .   robertson frowned and might have answered  but justice shane was tapping his gavel in a polite sort of way and they grudgingly fell silent .  francis j .  hart  head of the department of english and dean of graduate studies  was on the stand .  he was a plump man  meticulously dressed in dark clothing of a conservative cut  and possessing several strands of hair traversing the pink top of his cranium .  he sat well back in the witness chair with his hands folded neatly in his lap and displaying  from time to time  a tight lipped smile .  he said   my first connection with the matter of the robot ez    was on the occasion of the session of the university senate executive committee at which the subject was introduced by professor goodfellow .  thereafter  on the tenth of april of last year  we held a special meeting on the subject  during which i was in the chair .    were minutes kept of the meeting of the executive committee .  of the special meeting  that is .    well  no .  it was a rather unusual meeting .   the dean smiled briefly .   we thought it might remain confidential .    what transpired at the meeting .    dean hart was not entirely comfortable as chairman of that meeting .  nor did the other members assembled seem completely calm .  only dr .  lanning appeared at peace with himself .  his tall  gaunt figure and the shock of white hair that crowned him reminded hart of portraits he had seen of andrew jackson .  samples of the robot s work lay scattered along the central regions of the table and the reproduction of a graph drawn by the robot was now in the hands of professor minott of physical chemistry .  the chemist s lips were pursed in obvious approval .  hart cleared his throat and said   there seems no doubt that the robot can perform certain routine tasks with adequate competence .  i have gone over these  for instance  just before coming in and there is very little to find fault with .   he picked up a long sheet of printing  some three times as long as the average book page .  it was a sheet of galley proof  designed to be corrected by authors before the type was set up in page form .  along both of the wide margins of the galley were proofmarks  neat and superbly legible .  occasionally  a word of print was crossed out and a new word substituted in the margin in characters so fine and regular it might easily have been print itself .  some of the corrections were blue to indicate the original mistake had been the author s  a few in red  where the printer had been wrong .   actually   said lanning   there is less than very little to find fault with .  i should say there is nothing at all to find fault with  dr .  hart .  i m sure the corrections are perfect  insofar as the original manuscript was .  if the manuscript against which this galley was corrected was at fault in a matter of fact rather than of english  the robot is not competent to correct it .    we accept that .  however  the robot corrected word order on occasion and i don t think the rules of english are sufficiently hidebound for us to be sure that in each case the robot s choice was the correct one .    easy s positronic brain   said lanning  showing large teeth as he smiled   has been molded by the contents of all the standard works on the subject .  i m sure you cannot point to a case where the robot s choice was definitely the incorrect one .   professor minott looked up from the graph he still held .   the question in my mind  dr .  lanning  is why we need a robot at all  with all the difficulties in public relations that would entail .  the science of automation has surely reached the point where your company could design a machine  an ordinary computer of a type known and accepted by the public  that would correct galleys .    i am sure we could   said lanning stiffly   but such a machine would require that the galleys be translated into special symbols or  at the least  transcribed on tapes .  any corrections would emerge in symbols .  you would need to keep men employed translating words to symbols  symbols to words .  furthermore  such a computer could do no other job .  it couldn t prepare the graph you hold in your hand  for instance .   minott grunted .   lanning went on .   the hallmark of the positronic robot is its flexibility .  it can do a number of jobs .  it is designed like a man so that it can use all the tools and machines that have  after all  been designed to be used by a man .  it can talk to you and you can talk to it .  you can actually reason with it up to a point .  compared to even a simple robot  an ordinary computer with a non positronic brain is only a heavy adding machine .   goodfellow looked up and said   if we all talk and reason with the robot  what are the chances of our confusing it .  i suppose it doesn t have the capability of absorbing an infinite amount of data .    no  it hasn t .  but it should last five years with ordinary use .  it will know when it will require clearing  and the company will do the job without charge .    the company will .    yes .  the company reserves the right to service the robot outside the ordinary course of its duties .  it is one reason we retain control of our positronic robots and lease rather than sell them .  in the pursuit of its ordinary functions  any robot can be directed by any man .  outside its ordinary functions  a robot requires expert handling  and that we can give it .  for instance  any of you might clear an ez robot to an extent by telling it to forget this item or that .  but you would be almost certain to phrase the order in such a way as to cause it to forget too much or too little .  we would detect such tampering  because we have built in safeguards .  however  since there is no need for clearing the robot in its ordinary work  or for doing other useless things  this raises no problem .    dean hart touched his head as though to make sure his carefully cultivated strands lay evenly distributed and said   you are anxious to have us take the machine .  yet surely it is a losing proposition for u .  s .  robots .  one thousand a year is a ridiculously low price .  is it that you hope through this to rent other such machines to other universities at a more reasonable price .    certainly that s a fair hope   said lanning .   but even so  the number of machines you could rent would be limited .  i doubt if you could make it a paying proposition .   lanning put his elbows on the table and earnestly leaned forward .   let me put it bluntly  gentlemen .  robots cannot be used on earth  except in certain special cases  because of prejudice against them on the part of the public .  u .  s .  robots is a highly successful corporation with our extraterrestrial and spaceflight markets alone  to say nothing of our computer subsidiaries .  however  we are concerned with more than profits alone .  it is our firm belief that the use of robots on earth itself would mean a better life for all eventually  even if a certain amount of economic dislocation resulted at first .   the labor unions are naturally against us  but surely we may expect cooperation from the large universities .  the robot  easy  will help you by relieving you of scholastic drudgery by assuming  if you permit it  the role of galley slave for you .  other universities and research institutions will follow your lead  and if it works out  then perhaps other robots of other types may be placed and the public s objections to them broken down by stages .   minott murmured   today northeastern university  tomorrow the world .   angrily  lanning whispered to susan calvin   i wasn t nearly that eloquent and they weren t nearly that reluctant .  at a thousand a year  they were jumping to get easy .  professor minott told me he d never seen as beautiful a job as that graph he was holding and there was no mistake on the galley or anywhere else .  hart admitted it freely .   the severe vertical lines on dr .  calvin s face did not soften .   you should have demanded more money than they could pay  alfred  and let them beat you down .    maybe   he grumbled .  prosecution was not quite done with professor hart .   after dr .  lanning left  did you vote on whether to accept robot ez    .    yes  we did .    with what result .    in favor of acceptance  by majority vote .    what would you say influenced the vote .   defense objected immediately .  prosecution rephrased the question .   what influenced you  personally  in your individual vote .  you did vote in favor  i think .    i voted in favor  yes .  i did so largely because i was impressed by dr .  lanning s feeling that it was our duty as members of the world s intellectual leadership to allow robotics to help man in the solution of his problems .    in other words  dr .  lanning talked you into it .    that s his job .  he did it very well .    your witness .   defense strode up to the witness chair and surveyed professor hart for a long moment .  he said   in reality  you were all pretty eager to have robot ez    in your employ  weren t you .    we thought that if it could do the work  it might be useful .    if it could do the work .  i understand you examined the samples of robot ez    s original work with particular care on the day of the meeting which you have just described .    yes  i did .  since the machine s work dealt primarily with the handling of the english language  and since that is my field of competence  it seemed logical that i be the one chosen to examine the work .    very good .  was there anything on display on the table at the time of the meeting which was less than satisfactory .  i have all the material here as exhibits .  can you point to a single unsatisfactory item .    well    it s a simple question .  was there one single solitary unsatisfactory item .  you inspected it .  was there .   the english professor frowned .   there wasn t .    i also have some samples of work done by robot ez    during the course of his fourteen month employ at northeastern .  would you examine these and tell me if there is anything wrong with them in even one particular .   hart snapped   when he did make a mistake  it was a beauty .    answer my question   thundered defense   and only the question i am putting to you .  is there anything wrong with the material .   dean hart looked cautiously at each item .   well  nothing .    barring the matter concerning which we are here engaged .  do you know of any mistake on the part of ez    .    barring the matter for which this trial is being held  no .    defense cleared his throat as though to signal end of paragraph .  he said .   now about the vote concerning whether robot ez    was to be employed or not .  you said there was a majority in favor .  what was the actual vote .    thirteen to one  as i remember .    thirteen to one .  more than just a majority  wouldn t you say .    no  sir .  all the pedant in dean hart was aroused .   in the english language  the word  majority  means  more than half .   thirteen out of fourteen is a majority  nothing more .    but an almost unanimous one .    a majority all the same .   defense switched ground .   and who was the lone holdout .   dean hart looked acutely uncomfortable .   professor simon ninheimer .   defense pretended astonishment .   professor ninheimer .  the head of the department of sociology .    yes  sir .    the plaintiff .    yes  sir .   defense pursed his lips .   in other words  it turns out that the man bringing the action for payment of          damages against my client .  united states robots and mechanical men corporation was the one who from the beginning opposed the use of the robot although everyone else on the executive committee of the university senate was persuaded that it was a good idea .    he voted against the motion  as was his right .    you didn t mention in your description of the meeting any remarks made by professor ninheimer .  did he make any .    i think he spoke .    you think .    well  he did speak .    against using the robot .    yes .    was he violent about it .   dean hart paused .   he was vehement .   defense grew confidential .   how long have you known professor ninheimer  dean hart .    about twelve years .    reasonably well .    i should say so  yes .    knowing him  then  would you say he was the kind of man who might continue to bear resentment against a robot  all the more so because an adverse vote had   prosecution drowned out the remainder of the question with an indignant and vehement objection of his own .  defense motioned the witness down and justice shane called luncheon recess .   robertson mangled his sandwich .  the corporation would not founder for loss of three quarters of a million  but the loss would do it no particular good .  he was conscious  moreover  that there would be a much more costly long term setback in public relations .  he said sourly   why all this business about how easy got into the university .  what do they hope to gain .   the attorney for defense said quietly   a court action is like a chess game  mi .  robertson .  the winner is usually the one who can see more moves ahead  and my friend at the prosecutor s table is no beginner .  they can show damage  that s no problem .  their main effort lies in anticipating our defense .  they must be counting on us to try to show that easy couldn t possibly have committed the offense because of the laws of robotics .    all right   said robertson   that is our defense .  an absolutely airtight one .    to a robotics engineer .  not necessarily to a judge .  they re setting themselves up a position from which they can demonstrate that ez    was no ordinary robot .  it was the first of its type to be offered to the public .  it was an experimental model that needed field testing and the university was the only decent way to provide such testing .  that would look plausible in the light of dr .  lanning s strong efforts to place the robot and the willingness of u .  s .  robots to lease it for so little .  the prosecution would then argue that the field test proved easy to have been a failure .  now do you see the purpose of what s been going on .    but ez    was a perfectly good model   argued robertson .   it was the twenty seventh in production .    which is really a bad point   said defense somberly .   what was wrong with the first twenty six .  obviously something .  why shouldn t there be something wrong with the twenty seventh  too .    there was nothing wrong with the first twenty six except that they weren t complex enough for the task .  these were the first positronic brains of the sort to be constructed and it was rather hit and miss to begin with .  but the three laws held in all of them .  no robot is so imperfect that the three laws don t hold .    dr .  lanning has explained this to me  mr .  robertson  and i am willing to take his word for it .  the judge  however  may not be .  we are expecting a decision from an honest and intelligent man who knows no robotics and thus may be led astray .  for instance  if you or dr .  lanning or dr .  calvin were to say on the stand that any positronic brains were constructed  hit and miss   as you just did  prosecution would tear you apart in cross examination .  nothing would salvage our case .  so that s something to avoid .   robertson growled   if only easy would talk .   defense shrugged .   a robot is incompetent as a witness  so that would do us no good .    at least we d know some of the facts .  we d know how it came to do such a thing .   susan calvin fired up .  a dullish red touched her cheeks and her voice had a trace of warmth in it .   we know how easy came to do it .  it was ordered to .  i ve explained this to counsel and i ll explain it to you now .    ordered to by whom .   asked robertson in honest astonishment .   no one ever told him anything  he thought resentfully .  these research people considered themselves the owners of u .  s .  robots  by god .    by the plaintiff   said dr .  calvin .   in heaven s name  why .    i don t know why yet .  perhaps just that we might be sued  that he might gain some cash .   there were blue glints in her eyes as she said that .   then why doesn t easy say so .    isn t that obvious .  it s been ordered to keep quiet about the matter .    why should that be obvious .   demanded robertson truculently .   well  it s obvious to me .  robot psychology is my profession .  if easy will not answer questions about the matter directly  he will answer questions on the fringe of the matter .  by measuring increased hesitation in his answers as the central question is approached  by measuring the area of blankness and the intensity of counterpotentials set up  it is possible to tell with scientific precision that his troubles are the result of an order not to talk  with its strength based on first law .  in other words  he s been told that if he talks  harm will be done a human being .  presumably harm to the unspeakable professor ninheimer  the plaintiff  who  to the robot  would seem a human being .    well  then   said robertson   can t you explain that if he keeps quiet  harm will be done to u .  s .  robots .    u .  s .  robots is not a human being and the first law of robotics does not recognize a corporation as a person the way ordinary laws do .  besides  it would be dangerous to try to lift this particular sort of inhibition .  the person who laid it on could lift it off least dangerously  because the robot s motivations in that respect are centered on that person .  any other course   she shook her head and grew almost impassioned .   i won t let the robot be damaged .   lanning interrupted with the air of bringing sanity to the problem .   it seems to me that we have only to prove a robot incapable of the act of which easy is accused .  we can do that .    exactly   said defense  in annoyance .   you can do that .  the only witnesses capable of testifying to easy s condition and to the nature of easy s state of mind are employees of u .  s .  robots .  the judge can t possibly accept their testimony as unprejudiced .    how can he deny expert testimony .    by refusing to be convinced by it .  that s his right as the judge .  against the alternative that a man like professor ninheimer deliberately set about ruining his own reputation  even for a sizable sum of money  the judge isn t going to accept the technicalities of your engineers .  the judge is a man  after all .  if he has to choose between a man doing an impossible thing and a robot doing an impossible thing  he s quite likely to decide in favor of the man .    a man can do an impossible thing   said lanning   because we don t know all the complexities of the human mind and we don t know what  in a given human mind  is impossible and what is not .  we do know what is really impossible to a robot .    well  we ll see if we can t convince the judge of that   defense replied wearily .   if all you say is so   rumbled robertson   i don t see how you can .    we ll see .  it s good to know and be aware of the difficulties involved  but let s not be too downhearted .  i ve tried to look ahead a few moves in the chess game  too .   with a stately nod in the direction of the robopsychologist  he added   with the help of the good lady here .   lanning looked from one to the other and said   what the devil is this .   but the bailiff thrust his head into the room and announced somewhat breathlessly that the trial was about to resume .  they took their seats  examining the man who had started all the trouble .  simon ninheimer owned a fluffy head of sandy hair  a face that narrowed past a beaked nose toward a pointed chin  and a habit of sometimes hesitating before key words in his conversation that gave him an air of a seeker after an almost unbearable precision .  when he said   the sun rises in the uh east     one was certain he had given due consideration to the possibility that it might at some time rise in the west .  prosecution said   did you oppose employment of robot ez    by the university .    i did  sir .    why was that .    i did not feel that we understood the uh motives of u .  s .  robots thoroughly .  i mistrusted their anxiety to place the robot with us .    did you feel that it was capable of doing the work that it was allegedly designed to do .    i know for a fact that it was not .    would you state your reasons .    simon ninheimer s book  entitled social tensions involved in space flight and their resolution  had been eight years in the making .  ninheimer s search for precision was not confined to his habits of speech  and in a subject like sociology  almost inherently imprecise  it left him breathless .  even with the material in galley proofs  he felt no sense of completion .  rather the reverse  in fact .  staring at the long strips of print  he felt only the itch to tear the lines of type apart and rearrange them differently .  jim baker  instructor and soon to be assistant professor of sociology  found ninheimer  three days after the first batch of galleys had arrived from the printer  staring at the handful of paper in abstraction .  the galleys came in three copies  one for ninheimer to proofread  one for baker to proofread independently  and a third  marked  original   which was to receive the final corrections  a combination of those made by ninheimer and by baker  after a conference at which possible conflicts and disagreements were ironed out .  this had been their policy on the several papers on which they had collaborated in the past three years and it worked well .  baker  young and ingratiatingly soft voiced  had his own copies of the galleys in his hand .  he said eagerly   i ve done the first chapter and it contains some typographical beauts .    the first chapter always has them   said ninheimer distantly .   do you want to go over it now .   ninheimer brought his eyes to grave focus on baker .   i haven t done anything on the galleys  jim .  i don t think i ll bother .   baker looked confused .   not bother .   ninheimer pursed his lips .   i ve asked about the uh workload of the machine .  after all  he was originally uh promoted as a proofreader .  they ve set a schedule .    the machine .  you mean easy .    i believe that is the foolish name they gave it .    but  dr .  ninheimer  i thought you were staying clear of it    i seem to be the only one doing so .  perhaps i ought to take my share of the uh advantage .    oh .  well  i seem to have wasted time on this first chapter  then   said the younger man ruefully .   not wasted .  we can compare the machine s result with yours as a check .    if you want to  but    yes .    i doubt that we ll find anything wrong with easy s work .  it s supposed never to have made a mistake .    i dare say   said ninheimer dryly .   the first chapter was brought in again by baker four days later .  this time it was ninheimer s copy  fresh from the special annex that had been built to house easy and the equipment it used .  baker was jubilant .   dr .  ninheimer  it not only caught everything i caught it found a dozen errors i missed .  the whole thing took it twelve minutes .   ninheimer looked over the sheaf  with the neatly printed marks and symbols in the margins .  he said   it is not as complete as you and i would have made it .  we would have entered an insert on suzuki s work on the neurological effects of low gravity .    you mean his paper in sociological reviews .    of course .    well  you can t expect impossibilities of easy .  it can t read the literature for us .    i realize that .  as a matter of fact  i have prepared the insert .  i will see the machine and make certain it knows how to uh handle inserts .    it will know .    i prefer to make certain .   ninheimer had to make an appointment to see easy  and then could get nothing better than fifteen minutes in the late evening .  but the fifteen minutes turned out to be ample .  robot ez    understood the matter of inserts at once .  ninheimer found himself uncomfortable at close quarters with the robot for the first time .  almost automatically  as though it were human  he found himself asking   are you happy with your work .    most happy  professor ninheimer   said easy solemnly  the photocells that were its eyes gleaming their normal deep red .   you know me .    from the fact that you present me with additional material to include in the galleys  it follows that you are the author .  the author s name  of course  is at the head of each sheet of galley proof .    i see .  you make uh deductions  then .  tell me  he couldn t resist the question  what do you think of the book so far .   easy said   i find it very pleasant to work with .    pleasant .  that is an odd word for a uh a mechanism without emotion .  i ve been told you have no emotion .    the words of your book go in accordance with my circuits   easy explained .   they set up little or no counterpotentials .  it is in my brain paths to translate this mechanical fact into a word such as  pleasant .   the emotional context is fortuitous .    i see .  why do you find the book pleasant .    it deals with human beings  professor  and not with inorganic materials or mathematical symbols .  your book attempts to understand human beings and to help increase human happiness .    and this is what you try to do and so my book goes in accordance with your circuits .  is that it .    that is it  professor .   the fifteen minutes were up .  ninheimer left and went to the university library  which was on the point of closing .  he kept them open long enough to find an elementary text on robotics .  he took it home with him .  except for occasional insertion of late material  the galleys went to easy and from him to the publishers with little intervention from ninheimer at first and none at all later .  baker said  a little uneasily   it almost gives me a feeling of uselessness .    it should give you a feeling of having time to begin a new project   said ninheimer  without looking up from the notations he was making in the current issue of social science abstracts .   i m just not used to it .  i keep worrying about the galleys .  it s silly  i know .    it is .    the other day i got a couple of sheets before easy sent them off to    what .   ninheimer looked up  scowling .  the copy of abstracts slid shut .   did you disturb the machine at its work .    only for a minute .  everything was all right .  oh  it changed one word .  you referred to something as  criminal   it changed the word to  reckless .   it thought the second adjective fit in better with the context .   ninheimer grew thoughtful .   what did you think .    you know  i agreed with it .  i let it stand .   ninheimer turned in his swivel chair to face his young associate .   see here  i wish you wouldn t do this again .  if i am to use the machine  i wish the uh full advantage of it .  if i am to use it and lose your uh services anyway because you supervise it when the whole point is that it requires no supervision  i gain nothing .  do you see .    yes  dr .  ninheimer   said baker  subdued .  the advance copies of social tensions arrived in dr .  ninheimer s office on the eighth of may .  he looked through it briefly  flipping pages and pausing to read a paragraph here and there .  then he put his copies away .  as he explained later  he forgot about it .  for eight years  he had worked at it  but now  and for months in the past  other interests had engaged him while easy had taken the load of the book off his shoulders .  he did not even think to donate the usual complimentary copy to the university library .  even baker  who had thrown himself into work and had steered clear of the department head since receiving his rebuke at their last meeting  received no copy .  on the sixteenth of june that stage ended .  ninheimer received a phone call and stared at the image in the  plate with surprise .   speidell .  are you in town .    no  sir .  i m in cleveland .   speidell s voice trembled with emotion .   then why the call .    because i ve just been looking through your new book .  ninheimer  are you mad .  have you gone insane .    ninheimer stiffened .   is something uh wrong .   he asked in alarm .   wrong .  i refer you to page     .  what in blazes do you mean by interpreting my work as you do .  where in the paper cited do i make the claim that the criminal personality is nonexistent and that it is the law enforcement agencies that are the true criminals .  here  let me quote    wait .  wait .   cried ninheimer  trying to find the page .   let me see .  let me see .  .  . good god .    well .    speidell  i don t see how this could have happened .  i never wrote this .    but that s what s printed .  and that distortion isn t the worst .  you look at page     and imagine what ipatiev is going to do to you when he sees the hash you ve made of his findings .  look  ninheimer  the book is riddled with this sort of thing .  i don t know what you were thinking of but there s nothing to do but get the book off the market .  and you d better be prepared for extensive apologies at the next association meeting .    speidell  listen to me   but speidell had flashed off with a force that had the  plate glowing with after images for fifteen seconds .  it was then that ninheimer went through the book and began marking off passages with red ink .  he kept his temper remarkably well when he faced easy again  but his lips were pale .  he passed the book to easy and said   will you read the marked passages on pages               and     .   easy did so in four glances .   yes  professor ninheimer .    this is not as i had it in the original galleys .    no  sir .  it is not .    did you change it to read as it now does .    yes  sir .    why .    sir  the passages as they read in your version were most uncomplimentary to certain groups of human beings .  i felt it advisable to change the wording to avoid doing them harm .    how dared you do such a thing .    the first law  professor  does not let me  through any inaction  allow harm to come to human beings .  certainly  considering your reputation in the world of sociology and the wide circulation your book would receive among scholars  considerable harm would come to a number of the human beings you speak of .    but do you realize the harm that will come to me now .    it was necessary to choose the alternative with less harm .   professor ninheimer  shaking with fury  staggered away .  it was clear to him that u .  s .  robots would have to account to him for this .   there was some excitement at the defendants  table  which increased as prosecution drove the point home .   then robot ez    informed you that the reason for its action was based on the first law of robotics .    that is correct  sir .    that  in effect  it had no choice .    yes  sir .    it follows then that u .  s .  robots designed a robot that would of necessity rewrite books to accord with its own conceptions of what was right .  and yet they palmed it off as simple proofreader .  would you say that .   defense objected firmly at once  pointing out that the witness was being asked for a decision on a matter in which he had no competence .  the judged admonished prosecution in the usual terms  but there was no doubt that the exchange had sunk home not least upon the attorney for the defense .  defense asked for a short recess before beginning cross examination  using a legal technicality for the purpose that got him five minutes .  he leaned over toward susan calvin .   is it possible  dr .  calvin  that professor ninheimer is telling the truth and that easy was motivated by the first law .   calvin pressed her lips together  then said   no .  it isn t possible .  the last part of ninheimer s testimony is deliberate perjury .  easy is not designed to be able to judge matters at the stage of abstraction represented by an advanced textbook on sociology .  it would never be able to tell that certain groups of humans would be harmed by a phrase in such a book .  its mind is simply not built for that .    i suppose  though  that we can t prove this to a layman   said defense pessimistically .   no   admitted calvin .   the proof would be highly complex .  our way out is still what it was .  we must prove ninheimer is lying  and nothing he has said need change our plan of attack .    very well  dr .  calvin   said defense   i must accept your word in this .  we ll go on as planned .   in the courtroom  the judge s gavel rose and fell and dr .  ninheimer took the stand once more .  he smiled a little as one who feels his position to be impregnable and rather enjoys the prospect of countering a useless attack .  defense approached warily and began softly .   dr .  ninheimer  do you mean to say that you were completely unaware of these alleged changes in your manuscript until such time as dr .  speidell called you on the sixteenth of june .    that is correct  sir .    did you never look at the galleys after robot ez    had proofread them .    at first i did  but it seemed to me a useless task .  i relied on the claims of u .  s .  robots .  the absurd uh changes were made only in the last quarter of the book after the robot  i presume  had learned enough about sociology    never mind your presumptions .   said defense .   i understood your colleague  dr .  baker  saw the later galleys on at least one occasion .  do you remember testifying to that effect .    yes  sir .  as i said  he told me about seeing one page  and even there  the robot had changed a word .    again defense broke in .   don t you find it strange  sir  that after over a year of implacable hostility to the robot  after having voted against it in the first place and having refused to put it to any use whatever  you suddenly decided to put your book  your magnum opus  into its hands .    i don t find that strange .  i simply decided that i might as well use the machine .    and you were so confident of robot ez    all of a sudden that you didn t even bother to check your galleys .    i told you i was uh persuaded by u .  s .  robots  propaganda .    so persuaded that when your colleague  dr .  baker  attempted to check on the robot  you berated him soundly .    i didn t berate him .  i merely did not wish to have him uh waste his time .  at least  i thought then it was a waste of time .  i did not see the significance of that change in a word at the   defense said with heavy sarcasm   i have no doubt you were instructed to bring up that point in order that the word change be entered in the record   he altered his line to forestall objection and said   the point is that you were extremely angry with dr .  baker .    no  sir .  not angry .    you didn t give him a copy of your book when you received it .    simple forgetfulness .  i didn t give the library its copy  either .   ninheimer smiled cautiously .   professors are notoriously absentminded .   defense said   do you find it strange that  after more than a year of perfect work  robot ez    should go wrong on your book .  on a book  that is  which was written by you  who was  of all people  the most implacably hostile to the robot .    my book was the only sizable work dealing with mankind that it had to face .  the three laws of robotics took hold then .    several times  dr .  ninheimer   said defense   you have tried to sound like an expert on robotics .  apparently you suddenly grew interested in robotics and took out books on the subject from the library .  you testified to that effect  did you not .    one book  sir .  that was the result of what seems to me to have been uh natural curiosity .    and it enabled you to explain why the robot should  as you allege  have distorted your book .    yes  sir .    very convenient .  but are you sure your interest in robotics was not intended to enable you to manipulate the robot for your own purposes .   ninheimer flushed .   certainly not  sir .   defense s voice rose .   in fact  are you sure the alleged altered passages were not as you had them in the first place .   the sociologist half rose .   that s uh uh ridiculous .  i have the galleys   he had difficulty speaking and prosecution rose to insert smoothly   with your permission  your honor  i intend to introduce as evidence the set of galleys given by dr .  ninheimer to robot ez    and the set of galleys mailed by robot ez    to the publishers .  i will do so now if my esteemed colleague so desires  and will be willing to allow a recess in order that the two sets of galleys may be compared .    defense waved his hand impatiently .   that is not necessary .  my honored opponent can introduce those galleys whenever he chooses .  i m sure they will show whatever discrepancies are claimed by the plaintiff to exist .  what i would like to know of the witness  however  is whether he also has in his possession dr .  baker s galleys .    dr .  baker s galleys .   ninheimer frowned .  he was not yet quite master of himself .   yes  professor .  i mean dr .  baker s galleys .  you testified to the effect that dr .  baker had received a separate copy of the galleys .  i will have the clerk read your testimony if you are suddenly a selective type of amnesiac .  or is it just that professors are  as you say  notoriously absent minded .   ninheimer said   i remember dr .  baker s galleys .  they weren t necessary once the job was placed in the care of the proofreading machine    so you burned them .    no .  i put them in the waste basket .    burned them  dumped them what s the difference .  the point is you got rid of them .    there s nothing wrong   began ninheimer weakly .   nothing wrong .   thundered defense .   nothing wrong except that there is now no way we can check to see if  on certain crucial galley sheets  you might not have substituted a harmless blank one from dr .  baker s copy for a sheet in your own copy which you had deliberately mangled in such a way as to force the robot to   prosecution shouted a furious objection .  justice shane leaned forward  his round face doing its best to assume an expression of anger equivalent to the intensity of the emotion felt by the man .  the judge said   do you have any evidence  counselor  for the extraordinary statement you have just made .   defense said quietly   no direct evidence  your honor .  but i would like to point out that  viewed properly  the sudden conversion of the plaintiff from anti roboticism  his sudden interest in robotics  his refusal to check the galleys or to allow anyone else to check them  his careful neglect to allow anyone to see the book immediately after publication  all very clearly point    counselor   interrupted the judge impatiently   this is not the place for esoteric deductions .  the plaintiff is not on trial .  neither are you prosecuting him .  i forbid this line of attack and i can only point out that the desperation that must have induced you to do this cannot help but weaken your case .  if you have legitimate questions to ask  counselor  you may continue with your cross examination .  but i warn you against another such exhibition in this courtroom .    i have no further questions  your honor .   robertson whispered heatedly as counsel for the defense returned to his table   what good did that do  for god s sake .  the judge is dead set against you now .   defense replied calmly   but ninheimer is good and rattled .  and we ve set him up for tomorrow s move .  he ll be ripe .   susan calvin nodded gravely .   the rest of prosecution s case was mild in comparison .  dr .  baker was called and bore out most of ninheimer s testimony .  drs .  speidell and ipatiev were called  and they expounded most movingly on their shock and dismay at certain quoted passages in dr .  ninheimer s book .  both gave their professional opinion that dr .  ninheimer s professional reputation had been seriously impaired .  the galleys were introduced in evidence  as were copies of the finished book .  defense cross examined no more that day .  prosecution rested and the trial was recessed till the next morning .  defense made his first motion at the beginning of the proceedings on the second day .  he requested that robot ez    be admitted as a spectator to the proceedings .  prosecution objected at once and justice shane called both to the bench .  prosecution said hotly   this is obviously illegal .  a robot may not be in any edifice used by the general public .    this courtroom   pointed out defense   is closed to all but those having an immediate connection with the case .    a large machine of known erratic behavior would disturb my clients and my witnesses by its very presence .  it would make hash out of the proceedings .   the judge seemed inclined to agree .  he turned to defense and said rather unsympathetically   what are the reasons for your request .   defense said   it will be our contention that robot ez    could not possibly  by the nature of its construction  have behaved as it has been described as behaving .  it will be necessary to present a few demonstrations .   prosecution said   i don t see the point  your honor .  demonstrations conducted by men employed at u .  s .  robots are worth little as evidence when u .  s .  robots is the defendant .    your honor   said defense   the validity of any evidence is for you to decide  not for the prosecuting attorney .  at least  that is my understanding .   justice shane  his prerogatives encroached upon  said   your understanding is correct .  nevertheless  the presence of a robot here does raise important legal questions .    surely  your honor  nothing that should be allowed to override the requirements of justice .  if the robot is not present  we are prevented from presenting our only defense .   the judge considered .   there would be the question of transporting the robot here .    that is a problem with which u .  s .  robots has frequently been faced .  we have a truck parked outside the courtroom  constructed according to the laws governing the transportation of robots .  robot ez    is in a packing case inside with two men guarding it .  the doors to the truck are properly secured and all other necessary precautions have been taken .    you seem certain   said justice shane  in renewed ill temper   that judgment on this point will be in your favor .    not at all  your honor .  if it is not  we simply turn the truck about .  i have made no presumptions concerning your decision .   the judge nodded .   the request on the part of the defense is granted .   the crate was carried in on a large dolly and the two men who handled it opened it .  the courtroom was immersed in a dead silence .   susan calvin waited as the thick slabs of celluform went down  then held out one hand .   come  easy .   the robot looked in her direction and held out its large metal arm .  it towered over her by two feet but followed meekly  like a child in the clasp of its mother .  someone giggled nervously and choked it off at a hard glare from dr .  calvin .  easy seated itself carefully in a large chair brought by the bailiff  which creaked but held .  defense said   when it becomes necessary  your honor  we will prove that this is actually robot ez     the specific robot in the employ of northeastern university during the period of time with which we are concerned .    good   his honor said .   that will be necessary .  i  for one  have no idea how you can tell one robot from another .    and now   said defense   i would like to call my first witness to the stand .  professor simon ninheimer  please .   the clerk hesitated  looked at the judge .  justice shane asked  with visible surprise   you are calling the plaintiff as your witness .    yes  your honor .    i hope that you re aware that as long as he s your witness  you will be allowed none of the latitude you might exercise if you were cross examining an opposing witness .   defense said smoothly   my only purpose in all this is to arrive at the truth .  it will not be necessary to do more than ask a few polite questions .    well   said the judge dubiously   you re the one handling the case .  call the witness .   ninheimer took the stand and was informed that he was still under oath .  he looked more nervous than he had the day before  almost apprehensive .  but defense looked at him benignly .   now  professor ninheimer  you are suing my clients in the amount of          .    that is the uh sum .  yes .    that is a great deal of money .    i have suffered a great deal of harm .    surely not that much .  the material in question involves only a few passages in a book .  perhaps these were unfortunate passages  but after all  books sometimes appear with curious mistakes in them .   ninheimer s nostrils flared .   sir  this book was to have been the climax of my professional career .  instead  it makes me look like an incompetent scholar  a perverter of the views held by my honored friends and associates  and a believer of ridiculous and uh outmoded viewpoints .  my reputation is irretrievably shattered .  i can never hold up my head in any uh assemblage of scholars  regardless of the outcome of this trial .  i certainly cannot continue in my career  which has been the whole of my life .  the very purpose of my life has been uh aborted and destroyed .   defense made no attempt to interrupt the speech  but stared abstractedly at his fingernails as it went on .  he said very soothingly   but surely  professor ninheimer  at your present age  you could not hope to earn more than let us be generous  l o ooo during the remainder of your life .  yet you are asking the court to award you five times as much .    ninheimer said  with an even greater burst of emotion   it is not in my lifetime alone that i am ruined .  i do not know for how many generations i shall be pointed at by sociologists as a uh a fool or maniac .  my real achievements will be buried and ignored .  i am ruined not only until the day of my death  but for all time to come  because there will always be people who will not believe that a robot made those insertions   it was at this point that robot ez    rose to his feet .  susan calvin made no move to stop him .  she sat motionless  staring straight ahead .  defense sighed softly .  easy s melodious voice carried clearly .  it said   i would like to explain to everyone that i did insert certain passages in the galley proofs that seemed directly opposed to what had been there at first   even the prosecuting attorney was too startled at the spectacle of a seven foot robot rising to address the court to be able to demand the stopping of what was obviously a most irregular procedure .  when he could collect his wits  it was too late .  for ninheimer rose in the witness chair  his face working .  he shouted wildly   damn you  you were instructed to keep your mouth shut about   he ground to a choking halt  and easy was silent  too .  prosecution was on his feet now  demanding that a mistrial be declared .  justice shane banged his gavel desperately .   silence .  silence .  certainly there is every reason here to declare a mistrial  except that in the interests of justice i would like to have professor ninheimer complete his statement .  i distinctly heard him say to the robot that the robot had been instructed to keep its mouth shut about something .  there was no mention in your testimony  professor ninheimer  as to any instructions to the robot to keep silent about anything .   ninheimer stared wordlessly at the judge .  justice shane said   did you instruct robot ez    to keep silent about something .  and if so  about what .    your honor   began ninheimer hoarsely  and couldn t continue .  the judge s voice grew sharp .   did you  in fact  order the inserts in question to be made in the galleys and then order the robot to keep quiet about your part in this .   prosecution objected vigorously  but ninheimer shouted   oh  what s the use .  yes .  yes .  and he ran from the witness stand .  he was stopped at the door by the bailiff and sank hopelessly into one of the last rows of seats  head buried in both hands .  justice shane said   it is evident to me that robot ez    was brought here as a trick .  except for the fact that the trick served to prevent a serious miscarriage of justice  i would certainly hold attorney for the defense in contempt .  it is clear now  beyond any doubt  that the plaintiff has committed what is to me a completely inexplicable fraud since  apparently  he was knowingly ruining his career in the process   judgment  of course  was for the defendant .   dr .  susan calvin had herself announced at dr .  ninheimer s bachelor quarters in university hall .  the young engineer who had driven the car offered to go up with her  but she looked at him scornfully .   do you think he ll assault me .  wait down here .   ninheimer was in no mood to assault anyone .  he was packing  wasting no time  anxious to be away before the adverse conclusion of the trial became general knowledge .  he looked at calvin with a queerly defiant air and said   are you coming to warn me of a countersuit .  if so  it will get you nothing .  i have no money  no job  no future .  i can t even meet the costs of the trial .    if you re looking for sympathy   said calvin coldly   don t look for it here .  this was your doing .  however  there will be no countersuit  neither of you nor of the university .  we will even do what we can to keep you from going to prison for perjury .  we aren t vindictive .    oh  is that why i m not already in custody for forswearing myself .  i had wondered .  but then   he added bitterly   why should you be vindictive .  you have what you want now .    some of what we want  yes   said calvin .   the university will keep easy in its employ at a considerably higher rental fee .  furthermore  certain underground publicity concerning the trial will make it possible to place a few more of the ez models in other institutions without danger of a repetition of this trouble .    then why have you come to see me .    because i don t have all of what i want yet .  i want to know why you hate robots as you do .  even if you had won the case  your reputation would have been ruined .  the money you might have obtained could not have compensated for that .  would the satisfaction of your hatred for robots have done so .    are you interested in human minds  dr .  calvin .   asked ninheimer  with acid mockery .   insofar as their reactions concern the welfare of robots  yes .  for that reason  i have learned a little of human psychology .    enough of it to be able to trick met   that wasn t hard   said calvin  without pomposity .   the difficult thing was doing it in such a way as not to damage easy .    it is like you to be more concerned for a machine than for a man .   he looked at her with savage contempt .  it left her unmoved .   it merely seems so  professor ninheimer .  it is only by being concerned for robots that one can truly be concerned for twenty first century man .  you would understand this if you were a roboticist .    i have read enough robotics to know i don t want to be a roboticist .    pardon me  you have read a book on robotics .  it has taught you nothing .  you learned enough to know that you could order a robot to do many things  even to falsify a book  if you went about it properly .  you learned enough to know that you could not order him to forget something entirely without risking detection  but you thought you could order him into simple silence more safely .  you were wrong .    you guessed the truth from his silencer   it wasn t guessing .  you were an amateur and didn t know enough to cover your tracks completely .  my only problem was to prove the matter to the judge and you were kind enough to help us there  in your ignorance of the robotics you claim to despise .     is there any purpose in this discussion .   asked ninheimer wearily .   for me  yes   said susan calvin   because i want you to understand how completely you have misjudged robots .  you silenced easy by telling him that if he told anyone about your own distortion of the book  you would lose your job .  that set up a certain potential within easy toward silence  one that was strong enough to resist our efforts to break it down .  we would have damaged the brain if we had persisted .   on the witness stand  however  you yourself put up a higher counterpotential .  you said that because people would think that you  not a robot  had written the disputed passages in the book  you would lose far more than just your job .  you would lose your reputation  your standing  your respect  your reason for living .  you would lose the memory of you after death .  a new and higher potential was set up by you and easy talked .    oh  god   said ninheimer  turning his head away .  calvin was inexorable .  she said   do you understand why he talked .  it was not to accuse you  but to defend you .  it can be mathematically shown that he was about to assume full blame for your crime  to deny that you had anything to do with it .  the first law required that .  he was going to lie to damage himself to bring monetary harm to a corporation .  all that meant less to him than did the saving of you .  if you really understood robots and robotics  you would have let him talk .  but you did not understand  as i was sure you wouldn t  as i guaranteed to the defense attorney that you wouldn t .  you were certain  in your hatred of robots  that easy would act as a human being would act and defend itself at your expense .  so you flared out at him in panic and destroyed yourself .   ninheimer said with feeling   i hope some day your robots turn on you and kill you .    don t be foolish   said calvin .   now i want you to explain why you ve done all this .   ninheimer grinned a distorted  humorless grin .   i am to dissect my mind  am i  for your intellectual curiosity  in return for immunity from a charge of perjury .    put it that way if you like   said calvin emotionlessly .   but explain .    so that you can counter future anti robot attempts more efficiently .  with greater understanding .    i accept that .    you know   said ninheimer   i ll tell you just to watch it do you no good at all .  you can t understand human motivation .  you can only understand your damned machines because you re a machine yourself  with skin on .    he was breathing hard and there was no hesitation in his speech  no searching for precision .  it was as though he had no further use for precision .  he said   for two hundred and fifty years  the machine has been replacing man and destroying the handcraftsman .  pottery is spewed out of molds and presses .  works of art have been replaced by identical gimcracks stamped out on a die .  call it progress  if you wish .  the artist is restricted to abstractions  confined to the world of ideas .  he must design something in mind and then the machine does the rest .   do you suppose the potter is content with mental creation .  do you suppose the idea is enough .  that there is nothing in the feel of the clay itself  in watching the thing grow as hand and mind work together .  do you suppose the actual growth doesn t act as a feedback to modify and improve the idea .    you are not a potter   said dr .  calvin .   i am a creative artist .  i design and build articles and books .  there is more to it than the mere thinking of words and of putting them in the right order .  if that were all  there would be no pleasure in it  no return .   a book should take shape in the hands of the writer .  one must actually see the chapters grow and develop .  one must work and rework and watch the changes take place beyond the original concept even .  there is taking the galleys in hand and seeing how the sentences look in print and molding them again .  there are a hundred contacts between a man and his work at every stage of the game and the contact itself is pleasurable and repays a man for the work he puts into his creation more than anything else could .  your robot would take all that away .    so does a typewriter .  so does a printing press .  do you propose to return to the hand illumination of manuscripts .    typewriters and printing presses take away some  but your robot would deprive us of all .  your robot takes over the galleys .  soon it  or other robots  would take over the original writing  the searching of the sources  the checking and cross checking of passages  perhaps even the deduction of conclusions .  what would that leave the scholar .  one thing only the barren decisions concerning what orders to give the robot next .  i want to save the future generations of the world of scholarship from such a final hell .  that meant more to me than even my own reputation and so i set out to destroy u .  s .  robots by whatever means .    you were bound to fail   said susan calvin .   i was bound to try   said simon ninheimer .  calvin turned and left .  she did her best to feel no pang of sympathy for the broken man .  she did not entirely succeed .
