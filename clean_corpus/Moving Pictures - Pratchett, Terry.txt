terry pratchett      moving pictures      a novel of discworld        i would like to thank all the wonderful people who made this book possible .   thank you .  thank you .  thank you         watch     this is space .  it   s sometimes called the final frontier .    except that of course you can   t have a final frontier  because there   d be nothing for it to be a frontier to  but as frontiers go  it   s pretty penultimate      and against the wash of stars a nebula hangs  vast and black  one red giant gleaming like the madness of gods     and then the gleam is seen as the glint in a giant eye and it is eclipsed by the blink of an eyelid and the darkness moves a flipper and great a   tuin  star turtle  swims onward through the void .   on its back  four giant elephants .  on their shoulders  rimmed with water  glittering under its tiny orbiting sunlet  spinning majestically around the mountains at its frozen hub  lies the discworld  world and mirror of worlds .   nearly unreal .   reality is not digital  an on off state  but analog .  something gradual .  in other words  reality is a quality that things possess in the same way that they possess  say  weight .  some people are more real than others  for example .  it has been estimated that there are only about five hundred real people on any given planet  which is why they keep unexpectedly running into one another all the time .   the discworld is as unreal as it is possible to be while still being just real enough to exist .   and just real enough to be in real trouble .       about thirty miles turnwise of ankh morpork the surf boomed on the wind blown  seagrass waving  sand dune covered spit of land where the circle sea met the rim ocean .   the hill itself was visible for miles .  it wasn   t very high  but lay among the dunes like an upturned boat or a very unlucky whale  and was covered in scrub trees .  no rain fell here  if it could possibly avoid it .  although the wind sculpted the dunes around it  the low summit of the hill remained in an everlasting  ringing calm .   nothing but the sand had changed here in hundreds of years .   until now .   a crude hut of driftwood had been built on the long curve of the beach  although describing it as    built    was a slander on skilled crude hut builders throughout the ages  if the sea had simply been left to pile the wood up it might have done a better job .   and  inside  an old man had just died .      oh     he said .  he opened his eyes and looked around the interior of the hut .  he hadn   t seen it very clearly for the past ten years .   then he swung  if not his legs  then at least the memory of his legs off the pallet of sea heather and stood up .  then he went outside  into the diamond bright morning .  he was interested to see that he was still wearing a ghostly image of his ceremonial robe   stained and frayed  but still recognizable as having originally been a dark red plush with gold frogging   even though he was dead .  either your clothes died when you did  he thought  or maybe you just mentally dressed yourself from force of habit .   habit also led him to the pile of driftwood beside the hut .  when he tried to gather a few sticks  though  his hands passed through them .   he swore .   it was then that he noticed a figure standing by the water   s edge  looking out to sea .  it was leaning on a scythe .  the wind whipped at its black robes .   he started to hobble toward it  remembered he was dead  and began to stride .  he hadn   t stridden for decades  but it was amazing how it all came back to you .   before he was halfway to the dark figure  it spoke to him .   deccan ribobe  it said .      that   s me .      last keeper of the door .      well  i suppose so .      death hesitated .   you are or you aren   t  he said .   deccan scratched his nose .  of course  he thought  you have to be able to touch yourself .  otherwise you   d fall to bits .      technic   ly  a keeper has to be invested by the high priestess     he said .     and there ain   t been a high priestess for thousands o    years .  see  i just learned it all from old tento  who lived here before me .  he jus    said to me one day     deccan  it looks as though i   m dyin     so it   s up to you now     cos if there   s no one left that remembers properly it   ll all start happening again and you know what that means .     well  fair enough .  but that   s not what you   d call a proper investmenting  i   d say .      he looked up at the sandy hill .      there was jus    me and him     he said .     and then jus    me  remembering holy wood .  and now       he raised his hand to his mouth .      oo er     he said .   yes  said death .   it would be wrong to say a look of panic passed across deccan ribobe   s face  because at that moment it was several yards away and wearing a sort of fixed grin  as if it had seen the joke at last .  but his spirit was definitely worried .      see  the thing is     it said hastily     no one ever comes here  see  apart from the fishermen from the next bay  and they just leaves the fish and runs off on account of superstition and i couldn   t sort of go off to find an apprentice or somethin    because of keepin    the fires alight and doin    the chantin           yes .         it   s a terrible responsibility  bein    the only one able to do your job        yes  said death .      well  of course  i   m not telling you anything        no .         i mean  i was hopin    someone   d get shipwrecked or somethin     or come treasure huntin     and i could explain it like old tento explained it to me  teach    em the chants  get it all sorted out before i died        yes .      i s   pose there   s no chance that i could sort of        no .      thought not     said deccan despondently .   he looked at the waves crashing down on the shore .      used to be a big city down there  thousands of years ago     he said .     i mean  where the sea is .  when it   s stormy you can hear the ole temple bells ringin    under the sea .      i know .      i used to sit out here on windy nights  listenin    .  used to imagine all them dead people down there  ringin    the bells .      and now we must go .      ole tento said there was somethin    under the hill there that could make people do things .  put strange fancies in their    eads     said deccan  reluctantly following the stalking figure .     i never had any strange fancies .      but you were chanting  said death .  he snapped his fingers .   a horse ceased trying to graze the sparse dune grass and trotted up to death .  deccan was surprised to see that it left hoofprints in the sand .  he   d have expected sparks  or at least fused rock .      er     he said     can you tell me  er   what happens now .      death told him .      thought so     said deccan glumly .   up on the low hill the fire that had been burning all night collapsed in a shower of ash .  a few embers still glowed  though .   soon they would go out    .         .  .    .   they went out .  .    .  .            .   nothing happened for a whole day .  then  in a little hollow on the edge of the brooding hill  a few grains of sand shifted and left a tiny hole .   something emerged .  something invisible .  something joyful and selfish and marvelous .  something as intangible as an idea  which is exactly what it was .  a wild idea .   it was old in a way not measurable by any calendar known to man and what it had  right now  was memories and needs .  it remembered life  in other times and other universes .  it needed people .   it rose against the stars  changing shape  coiling like smoke .   there were lights on the horizon .   it liked lights .   it regarded them for a few seconds and then  like an invisible arrow  extended itself toward the city and sped away .   it liked action  too     and several weeks went past .       there   s a saying that all roads lead to ankh morpork  greatest of discworld cities .   at least  there   s a saying that there   s a saying that all roads lead to ankh morpork .   and it   s wrong .  all roads lead away from ankh morpork  but sometimes people just walk along them the wrong way .   poets long ago gave up trying to describe the city .  now the more cunning ones try to excuse it .  they say  well  maybe it is smelly  maybe it is overcrowded  maybe it is a bit like hell would be if they shut the fires off and stabled a herd of incontinent cows there for a year  but you must admit that it is full of sheer  vibrant  dynamic life .  and this is true  even though it is poets that are saying it .  but people who aren   t poets say  so what .  mattresses tend to be full of life too  and no one writes odes to them .  citizens hate living there and  if they have to move away on business or adventure or  more usually  until some statute of limitations runs out  can   t wait to get back so they can enjoy hating living there some more .  they put stickers on the backs of their carts saying    ankh morpork   loathe it or leave it .     they call it the big wahooni  after the fruit .     every so often a ruler of the city builds a wall around ankh morpork  ostensibly to keep enemies out .  but ankh morpork doesn   t fear enemies .  in fact it welcomes enemies  provided they are enemies with money to spend .    it has survived flood  fire  hordes  revolutions and dragons .  sometimes by accident  admittedly  but it has survived them .  the cheerful and irrecoverably venal spirit of the city has been proof against anything     until now .       boom .   the explosion removed the windows  the door and most of the chimney .   it was the sort of thing you expected in the street of alchemists .  the neighbors preferred explosions  which were at least identifiable and soon over .  they were better than the smells  which crept up on you .   explosions were part of the scenery  such as was left .   and this one was pretty good  even by the standards of local connoisseurs .  there was a deep red heart to the billowing black smoke which you didn   t often see .  the bits of semi molten brickwork were more molten than usual .  it was  they considered  quite impressive .   boom .   a minute or two after the explosion a figure lurched out of the ragged hole where the door had been .  it had no hair  and what clothes it still had were on fire .   it staggered up to the small crowd that was admiring the devastation and by chance laid a sooty hand on a hot meat pie and sausage in a bun salesman called cut me own throat dibbler  who had an almost magical ability to turn up wherever a sale might be made .      looking     it said  in a dreamy  stunned voice     f   r a word .  tip of my tongue .         blister .     volunteered throat .   he recovered his commercial senses .     after an experience like that     he added  proffering a pastry case full of so much reclaimed organic debris that it was very nearly sapient     what you need is to get a hot meat pie inside you           nonono .     s not blister .     s what you say when you   ve discovered something .  you goes running out into the street shoutin        said the smouldering figure urgently .        s   pecial word     it added  its brow creasing under the soot .   the crowd  reluctantly satisfied that there were going to be no more explosions  gathered around .  this might be nearly as good .      yeah  that   s right     said an elderly man  filling his pipe .      you runs out shouting    fire .  fire .        he looked triumphant .         s not that           or    help .     or           no  he   s right     said a woman with a basket of fish on her head .     there   s a special word .  it   s foreign .         right  right     said her neighbor .     special foreign word for people who   ve discovered something .  it was invented by some foreign bugger in his bath           well     said the pipe man  lighting it off the alchemist   s smouldering hat     i for one don   t see why people in this city need to go around shouting heathen lingo just    cos they   ve had a bath .  anyway  look at him .  he ain   t had a bath .  he needs a bath  yes  but he ain   t had one .  what   s he want to go around shouting foreign lingo for .  we   ve got perfectly satisfactory words for shoutin    .         like what .     said cut me own throat .   the pipe smoker hesitated .     well     he said     like      i   ve discovered something      or      hooray              no  i   m thinking about the bugger over tsort way  or somewhere .  he was in his bath and he had this idea for something  and he ran out down the street yelling .         yelling what .         dunno .  p   raps    give me a towel .            bet he   d be yellin    all right if he tried that sort of thing around here     said throat cheerfully .     now  ladies and gents  i have here some sausage in a bun that   d make your           eureka     said the soot colored one  swaying back and forth .      what about it .     said throat .      no  that   s the word .  eureka .     a worried grin spread across the black features .     it means    i have it .            have what .     said throat .      it .  at least  i had it .  octo cellulose .  amazing stuff .  had it in my hand .  but i held it too close to the fire     said the figure  in the perplexed tones of the nearly concussed .     v   ry important fact .  mus    make a note of it .  don   t let it get hot .  v   ry important .  mus    write down v   ry important fact .      he tottered back into the smoking ruins .   dibbler watched him go .      wonder what that was all about .     he said .  then he shrugged and raised his voice to a shout .     meat pies .  hot sausages .  inna bun .  so fresh the pig h   an   t noticed they   re gone .        the glittering  swirling idea from the hill had watched all this .  the alchemist didn   t even know it was there .  all he knew was that he was being unusually inventive today .   now it had spotted the pie merchant   s mind .   it knew that kind of mind .  it loved minds like that .  a mind that could sell nightmare pies could sell dreams .   it leaped .   on a hill far away the breeze stirred the cold  gray ash .   further down the hill  in a crack in a hollow between two rocks where a dwarf juniper bush struggled for a living  a little trickle of sand began to move .       boom .   a fine film of plaster dust drifted down onto the desk of mustrum ridcully  the new archchancellor of unseen university  just as he was trying to tie a particularly difficult fly .   he glanced out of the stained glass window .  a smoke cloud was rising over uptown morpork .      bursaar .      the bursar arrived within a few seconds  out of breath .  loud noises always upset him .      it   s the alchemists  master     he panted .      that   s the third time this week .  blasted firework merchants     muttered the archchancellor .      i   m afraid so  master     said the bursar .      what do they think they   re doing .         i really couldn   t say  master     said the bursar  getting his breath back .     alchemy has never interested me .  it   s altogether too   too           dangerous     said the archchancellor firmly .     lot of damn mixin    things up and saying  hey  what   ll happen if we add a drop of the yellow stuff  and then goin    around without yer eyebrows for a fortnight .         i was going to say impractical     said the bursar .     trying to do things the hard way when we have perfectly simple everyday magic available .         i thought they were trying to cure the philosopher   s stones  or somethin        said the archchancellor .     lot of damn nonsense  if you ask me .  anyway  i   m off .      as the archchancellor began to sidle out of the room the bursar hastily waved a handful of papers at him .      before you go  archchancellor     he said desperately     i wonder if you would just care to sign a few           not now  man     snapped the archchancellor .     got to see a man about a horse  what .         what .         right .     the door closed .   the bursar stared at it  and sighed .   unseen university had had many different kinds of archchancellor over the years .  big ones  small ones  cunning ones  slightly insane ones  extremely insane ones   they   d come  they   d served  in some cases not long enough for anyone to be able to complete the official painting to be hung in the great hall  and they   d died .  the senior wizard in a world of magic had the same prospects of long term employment as a pogo stick tester in a minefield .   however  from the bursar   s point of view this didn   t really have to matter .  the name might change occasionally  but what did matter was that there always was an archchancellor and the archchancellor   s most important job  as the bursar saw it  was to sign things  preferably  from the bursar   s point of view  without reading them first .   this one was different .  for one thing  he was hardly ever in  except to change out of his muddy clothes .  and he shouted at people .  usually at the bursar .   and yet  at the time  it had seemed a really good idea to elect an archchancellor who hadn   t set foot in the university in forty years .   there had been so much in fighting between the various orders of wizardry in recent years that  just for once  the senior wizards had agreed that what the university needed was a period of stability  so that they could get on with their scheming and intriguing in peace and quiet for a few months .  a search of the records turned up ridcully the brown who  after becoming a seventh level mage at the incredibly young age of twenty seven  had quit the university in order to look after his family   s estates deep in the country .   he looked ideal .      just the chap     they all said .     clean sweep .  new broom .  a country wizard .  back to the thingumajigs  the roots of wizardry .  jolly old boy with a pipe and twinkly eyes .  sort of chap who can tell one herb from another  roams the high forest with every beast his brother kind of thing .  sleeps under the stars  like as not .  knows what the wind is saying  we shouldn   t wonder .  got a name for all the trees  you can bank on it .  speaks to the birds  too .      a messenger had been sent .  ridcully the brown had sighed  cursed a bit  found his staff in the kitchen garden where it had been supporting a scarecrow  and had set out .      and if he   s any problem     the wizards had added  in the privacy of their own heads     anyone who talks to trees should be no trouble to get rid of .      and then he   d arrived  and it turned out that ridcully the brown did speak to the birds .  in fact he shouted at birds  and what he normally shouted was     winged you  yer bastard .      the beasts of the field and fowls of the air did know ridcully the brown .  they   d got so good at pattern recognition that  for a radius of about twenty miles around the ridcully estates  they   d run  hide or in desperate cases attack violently at the mere sight of a pointy hat .   within twelve hours of arriving  ridcully had installed a pack of hunting dragons in the butler   s pantry  fired his dreadful crossbow at the ravens on the ancient tower of art  drunk a dozen bottles of red wine  and rolled off to bed at two in the morning singing a song with words in it that some of the older and more forgetful wizards had to look up .   and then he got up at five o   clock to go duck hunting down in the marshes on the estuary .   and came back complaining that there wasn   t a good trout fishin    river for miles .   you couldn   t fish in the river ankh  you had to jump up and down on the hooks even to make them sink .    and he ordered beer with his breakfast .   and told jokes .   on the other hand  thought the bursar  at least he didn   t interfere with the actual running of the university .  ridcully the brown wasn   t the least interested in running anything except maybe a string of hounds .  if you couldn   t shoot arrows at it  hunt it or hook it  he couldn   t see much point in it .   beer at breakfast .  the bursar shuddered .  wizards weren   t at their best before noon  and breakfast in the great hall was a quiet  fragile occasion  broken only by coughs  the quiet shuffling of the servants  and the occasional groan .  people shouting for kidneys and black pudding and beer were a new phenomenon .   the only person not terrified of the ghastly man was old windle poons  who was one hundred and thirty years old and deaf and  while an expert on ancient magical writings  needed adequate notice and a good run up to deal with the present day .  he   d managed to absorb the fact that the new archchancellor was going to be one of those hedgerow and dickie bird chappies  it would take a week or two for him to grasp the change of events  and in the meantime he made polite and civilized conversation based on what little he could remember about nature and things .   on the lines of      i expect it must be a  mm  a change for you  mm  sleeping in a real bed  instead of under the  mm  stars .     and     these things  mm  here  are called knives and forks  mm .     and     this  mm  green stuff on the scrambled egg  mm  would it be parsley  do you think .      but since the new archchancellor never paid much attention to anything anyone said while he was eating  and poons never noticed that he wasn   t getting any answers  they got along quite well .   anyway  the bursar had other problems .   the alchemists  for one thing .  you couldn   t trust alchemists .  they were too serious minded .   boom .   and that was the last one .  whole days went by without being punctuated by small explosions .  the city settled down again  which was a foolish thing to do .   what the bursar failed to consider was that no more bangs doesn   t mean they   ve stopped doing it  whatever it is .  it just means they   re doing it right .       it was midnight .  the surf boomed on the beach  and made a phosphorescent glow in the night .  around the ancient hill  though  the sound seemed as dead as if it was arriving through several layers of velvet .   the hole in the sand was quite big now .   if you could put your ear to it  you might think you could hear applause .       it was still midnight .  a full moon glided above the smoke and fumes of ankh morpork  thankful that several thousand miles of sky lay between it and them .   the alchemists    guildhall was new .  it was always new .  it had been explosively demolished and rebuilt four times in the last two years  on the last occasion without a lecture and demonstration room in the hope that this might be a helpful move .   on this night a number of muffled figures entered the building in a surreptitious fashion .  after a few minutes the lights in a window on the top floor dimmed and went out .   well  nearly out .   something was happening up there .  a strange flickering filled the window  very briefly .  it was followed by a ragged cheering .   and there was a noise .  not a bang this time  but a strange mechanical purring  like a happy cat at the bottom of a tin drum .   it went clickaclickaclickaclicka   click .   it went on for several minutes  to a background of cheers .  and then a voice said      that   s all  folks .             that   s all what .     said the patrician of ankh morpork  next morning .   the man in front of him shivered with fear .      don   t know  lordship     he said .     they wouldn   t let me in .  they made me wait outside the door  lordship .      he twisted his fingers together nervously .  the patrician   s stare had him pinned .  it was a good stare  and one of the things it was good at was making people go on talking when they thought they had finished .   only the patrician knew how many spies he had in the city .  this particular one was a servant in the alchemists    guild .  he had once had the misfortune to come up before the patrician accused of malicious lingering  and had then chosen of his own free will to become a spy .        that   s all  lordship     he whined .     there was just this clicking noise and this sort of flickery glow under the door .  and  er  they said the daylight here was wrong .         wrong .  how .         er .  dunno  sir .  just wrong  they said .  they ought to go somewhere where it was better  they said .  uh .  and they told me to go and get them some food .      the patrician yawned .  there was something infinitely boring about the antics of alchemists .      indeed     he said .      but they   d had their supper only fifteen minutes before     the servant blurted out .      perhaps whatever they were doing makes people hungry     said the patrician .      yes  and the kitchen was all shut up for the night and i had to go and buy a tray of hot sausages in buns from throat dibbler .         indeed .     the patrician looked down at the paperwork on his desk .     thank you .  you may go .         you know what  lordship .  they liked them .  they actually liked them .          that the alchemists had a guild at all was remarkable .  wizards were just as uncooperative  but they also were by nature hierarchical and competitive .  they needed organization .  what was the good of being a wizard of the seventh level if you didn   t have six other levels to look down on and the eighth level to aspire to .  you needed other wizards to hate and despise .   whereas every alchemist was an alchemist alone  working in darkened rooms or hidden cellars and endlessly searching for the big casino   the philosopher   s stone  the elixir of life .  they tended to be thin  pink eyed men  with beards that weren   t really beards but more like groups of individual hairs clustering together for mutual protection  and many of them had that vague  unworldly expression that you get from spending too much time in the presence of boiling mercury .   it wasn   t that alchemists hated other alchemists .  they often didn   t notice them  or thought they were walruses .   and so their tiny  despised guild had never aspired to the powerful status of the guilds of  say  the thieves or the beggars or the assassins  but devoted itself instead to the aid of widows and families of those alchemists who had taken an overly relaxed attitude to potassium cyanide  for example  or had distilled some interesting fungi  drunk the result  and then stepped off the roof to play with the fairies .  there weren   t actually very many widows and orphans  of course  because alchemists found it difficult to relate to other people long enough  and generally if they ever managed to marry it was only to have someone to hold their crucibles .   by and large  the only skill the alchemists of ankh morpork had discovered so far was the ability to turn gold into less gold .   until now     now they were full of the nervous excitement of those who have found an unexpected fortune in their bank account and don   t know whether to draw people   s attention to it or simply take the lot and run .      the wizards aren   t going to like it     said one of them  a thin  hesitant man called lully .     they   re going to call it magic .  you know they get really pissed if they think you   re doing magic and you   re not a wizard .         there isn   t any magic involved     said thomas silverfish  the president of the guild .      there   s the imps .         that   s not magic .  that   s just ordinary occult .         well  there   s the salamanders .         perfectly normal natural history .  nothing wrong with that .         well  all right .  but they   ll call it magic .  you know what they   re like .      the alchemists nodded gloomily .      they   re reactionaries     said sendivoge  the guild secretary .     bloated thaumocrats .  and the other guilds  too .  what do they know about the march of progress .  what do they care .  they could have been doing something like this for years  but did they .  not them .  just think how we can make people   s lives so much   well  better .  the possibilities are immense .         educational     said silverfish .      historical     said lully .      and of course there   s entertainment     said peavie  the guild treasurer .  he was a small  nervous man .  most alchemists were nervous  in any case  it came from not knowing what the crucible of bubbling stuff they were experimenting with was going to do next .      well  yes .  obviously some entertainment     said silverfish .      some of the great historical dramas     said peavie .     just picture the scene .  you get some actors together  they act it just once  and people all over the disc will be able to see it as many times as they like .  a great saving in wages  by the way     he added .      but tastefully done     said silverfish .     we have a great responsibility to see that nothing is done which is in any way       his voice trailed off        you know   coarse .         they   ll stop us     said lully darkly .     i know those wizards .         i   ve been giving that some thought     said silverfish .      the light   s too bad here anyway .  we agreed .  we need clear skies .  and we need to be a long way away .  i think i know just the place .         you know  i can   t believe we   re doing this     said peavie .      a month ago it was just a mad idea .  and now it   s all worked .  it   s just like magic .  only not magical  if you see what i mean     he added quickly .      not just illusion  but real illusion     said lully .      i don   t know if anyone   s thought about this     said peavie      but this could make us a bit of money .  um .         but that isn   t important     said silverfish .      no .  no  of course not     muttered peavie .  he glanced at the others .      shall we watch it again .     he said  shyly .     i don   t mind turning the handle .  and  and   well  i know i haven   t contributed very much to this project  but i did come up with this  er  this stuff .      he pulled a very large bag from the pocket of his robe and dropped it on the table .  it fell over  and a few fluffy  white misshapen balls rolled out .   the alchemists stared at it .      what is it .     said lully .      well     said peavie  uncomfortably     what you do is  you take some corn  and you put it in  say  a number   crucible  with some cooking oil  you see  and then you put a plate or something on top of it  and when you heat it up it goes bang  i mean  not seriously bang  and when it   s stopped banging you take the plate off and it   s metamorphosed into these  er  things       he looked at their uncomprehending faces .     you can eat it     he mumbled apologetically .     if you put butter and salt on it  it tastes like salty butter .      silverfish reached out a chemical stained hand and cautiously selected a fluffy morsel .  he chewed it thoughtfully .      don   t really know why i did it     said peavie  blushing .      just sort of had an idea that it was right .      silverfish went on chewing .      tastes like cardboard     he said  after a while .      sorry     said peavie  trying to scoop the rest of the heap back into the sack .  silverfish laid a gentle hand on his arm .      mind you     he said  selecting another puffed morsel     it does have a certain something  doesn   t it .  they do seem right .  what did you say it   s called .         hasn   t really got a name     said peavie .     i just call it banged grains .      silverfish took another one .     funny how you want to go on eating them     he said .     sort of more ish .  banged grains .  right .  anyway   gentlemen  let us turn the handle one more time .      lully started to wind the film back into the unmagical lantern .      you were saying you knew a place where we could really build up the project and where the wizards wouldn   t bother us .     he said .   silverfish grabbed a handful of banged grains .      it   s along the coast a way     he said .     nice and sunny and no one ever goes there these days .  nothing there but some wind blown old forest and a temple and sand dunes .         a temple .  gods can get really pissed if you       peavie began .      look     said silverfish     the whole area   s been deserted for centuries .  there   s nothing there .  no people  no gods  no nothing .  just lots of sunlight and land  waiting for us .  it   s our chance  lads .  we   re not allowed to make magic  we can   t make gold  we can   t even make a living   so let   s make moving pictures .  let   s make history .      the alchemists sat back and looked more cheerful .      yeah     said lully .      oh .  right     said peavie .      here   s to moving pictures     said sendivoge  holding up a handful of banged grains .     how   d you hear about this place .         oh  i       silverfish stopped .  he looked puzzled .     don   t know     he said  eventually .     can   t   quite remember .  must have heard about it once and forgot it  and then it just popped into my head .  you know how these things happen .         yeah     said lully .     like with me and the film .  it was like i was remembering how to do it .  funny old tricks the mind can play .         yeah .         yeah .            s   n idea whose time has come  see .         yeah .         yeah .         that must be it .      a slightly worried silence settled over the table .  it was the sound of minds trying to put their mental fingers on something that was bothering them .   the air seemed to glitter .      what   s this place called .     said lully  eventually .      don   t know what it was called in the old days     said silverfish  leaning back and pulling the banged grains toward him .     these days they call it the holy wood .         holy wood     said lully .     sounds   familiar .      there was another silence while they thought about it .   it was broken by sendivoge .      oh  well     he said cheerfully     holy wood  here we come .         yeah     said silverfish  shaking his head as if to dislodge a disquieting thought .     funny thing  really .  i   ve got this feeling   that we   ve been going there   all this time .          several thousand miles under silverfish  great a   tuin the world turtle sculled dreamily on through the starry night .   reality is a curve .   that   s not the problem .  the problem is that there isn   t as much as there should be .  according to some of the more mystical texts in the stacks of the library of unseen university        the discworld   s premier college of wizardry and big dinners  whose collection of books is so massive that it distorts space and time        at least nine tenths of all the original reality ever created lies outside the multiverse  and since the multiverse by definition includes absolutely everything that is anything  this puts a bit of a strain on things .   outside the boundaries of the universes lie the raw realities  the could have beens  the might bes  the never weres  the wild ideas  all being created and uncreated chaotically like elements in fermenting supernovas .   just occasionally where the walls of the worlds have worn a bit thin  they can leak in .   and reality leaks out .   the effect is like one of those deep sea geysers of hot water  around which strange submarine creatures find enough warmth and food to make a brief  tiny oasis of existence in an environment where there shouldn   t be any existence at all .   the idea of holy wood leaked innocently and joyfully into the discworld .   and reality leaked out .   and was found .  for there are things outside  whose ability to sniff out tiny frail conglomerations of reality made the thing with the sharks and the trace of blood seem very boring indeed .   they began to gather .       a storm slid in across the sand dunes but  where it reached the low hill  the clouds seemed to curve away .  only a few drops of rain hit the parched soil  and the gale became nothing more than a faint breeze .   it blew sand over the long dead remains of a fire .   further down the slope  near a hole that was now big enough for  say  a badger  a small rock dislodged itself and rolled away .       a month went by quickly .  it didn   t want to hang around .       the bursar knocked respectfully at the archchancellor   s door and then opened it .   a crossbow bolt nailed his hat to the woodwork .   the archchancellor lowered the bow and glared at him .      bloody dangerous thing to do  wasn   t it .     he said .     you could have caused a nasty accident .      the bursar hadn   t got where he was today  or rather where he had been ten seconds ago  which was where a calm and self assured personality was  rather than where he was now  which was on the verge of a mild heart attack  without a tremendous ability to recover from unexpected upsets .   he unpinned his hat from the target chalked on the ancient woodwork .      no harm done     he said .  no voice could be as calm as that without tremendous effort .     you can barely see the hole .  why  er  are you shooting at the door  master .         use your common sense  man .  it   s dark outside and the damn walls are made of stone .  you don   t expect me to shoot at the damn walls .         ah     said the bursar .     the door is  er  five hundred years old  you know     he added  with finely tuned reproach .      looks it     said the archchancellor  bluntly .     damn great black thing .  what we need around here  man  is a lot less stone and wood and a bit more jolliness .  a few sportin    prints  yer know .  an ornament or two .         i shall see to it directly     lied the bursar smoothly .  he remembered the sheaf of papers under his arm .     in the meantime  master  perhaps you would care to           right     said the archchancellor  ramming his pointed hat on his head .     good man .  now  got a sick dragon to see to .  little devil hasn   t touched his tar oil for days .         your signature on one or two of       the bursar burbled hurriedly .      can   t be havin    with all that stuff     said the archchancellor  waving him away .     too much damn paper around here as it is .  and       he stared through the bursar  as if he had just remembered something .     saw a funny thing this mornin        he said .     saw a monkey in the quad .  bold as brass .         oh  yes     said the bursar  cheerfully .     that would be the librarian .         got a pet  has he .         no  you misunderstand me  archchancellor     said the bursar cheerfully .     that was the librarian .      the archchancellor stared at him .   the bursar   s smile began to glaze .      the librarian   s a monkey .      it took some time for the bursar to explain matters clearly  and then the archchancellor said     what yer tellin    me  then  is that this chap got himself turned into a monkey by magic .         an accident in the library  yes .  magical explosion .  one minute a human  next minute an orangutan .  and you mustn   t call him a monkey  master .  he   s an ape .         same damn difference  surely .         apparently not .  he gets very  er  aggressive if you call him a monkey .         he doesn   t stick his bottom at people  does he .      the bursar closed his eyes and shuddered .     no  master .  you   re thinking of baboons .         ah .     the archchancellor considered this .     haven   t got any of them workin    here  then .         no  master .  just the librarian  master .         can   t have it .  can   t have it  yer know .  can   t have damn great hairy things shambling around the place     said the archchancellor firmly .     get rid of him .         good grief  no .  he   s the best librarian we   ve ever had .  and tremendous value for money .         why .  what d   we pay him .         peanuts     said the bursar promptly .     besides  he   s the only one who knows how the library actually works .         turn him back  then .  no life for a man  bein    a monkey .         ape  archchancellor .  and he seems to prefer it  i   m afraid .         how d   yer know .     said the archchancellor suspiciously .      speaks  does he .      the bursar hesitated .  there was always this trouble with the librarian .  everyone had got so accustomed to him it was hard to remember a time when the library was not run by a yellow fanged ape with the strength of three men .  if the abnormal goes on long enough it becomes the normal .  it was just that  when you came to explain it to a third party  it sounded odd .  he coughed nervously .      he says    oook     archchancellor     he said .      and what   s that mean .         means    no     archchancellor .         and how does he say    yes     then .      the bursar had been dreading this .        oook     archchancellor     he said .      that was the same oook as the other oook .         oh  no .  no .  i assure you .  there   s a different inflection   i mean  when you get used to        the bursar shrugged .     i suppose we   ve just got into the way of understanding him  archchancellor .         well  at least he keeps himself fit     said the archchancellor nastily .     not like the rest of you fellows .  i went into the uncommon room this morning  and it was full of chaps snoring .         that would be the senior masters  master     said the bursar .     i would say they are supremely fit  myself .         fit .  the dean looks like a man who   s swallered a bed .         ah  but master     said the bursar  smiling indulgently      the word    fit     as i understand it  means    appropriate to a purpose     and i would say the body of the dean is supremely appropriate to the purpose of sitting around all day and eating big heavy meals .     the bursar permitted himself a little smile .   the archchancellor gave him a look so old fashioned it might have belonged to an ammonite .      that a joke .     he said  in the suspicious tones of someone who wouldn   t really understand the term    sense of humor    even if you sat down for an hour and explained it to him with diagrams .      i was just making an observation  master     said the bursar cautiously .   the archchancellor shook his head .     can   t stand jokes .  can   t stand chaps goin    round tryin    to be funny the whole time .  comes of spendin    too much time sitting indoors .  a few twenty mile runs and the dean   d be a different man .         well  yes     said the bursar .     he   d be dead .         he   d be healthy .         yes  but still dead .      the archchancellor irritably shuffled the papers on his desk .      slackness     he muttered .     far too much of it going on .  whole place gone to pot .  people goin    round sleepin    all day and turnin    into monkeys the whole time .  we never even thought of turnin    into a monkey when i was a student .     he looked up irritably .      what was it you wanted .     he snapped .      what .     said the bursar  unnerved .      you wanted me to do somethin     didn   t you .  you came in to ask me to do somethin    .  probably because i   m the only feller here not fast asleep or sittin    in a tree whoopin    every mornin        the archchancellor added .      er .  i think that   s gibbons  archchancellor .         what .  what .  do try and make some sense  man .      the bursar pulled himself together .  he didn   t see why he had to be treated like this .      in fact  i wanted to see you about one of the students  master     he said coldly .      students .     barked the archchancellor .      yes  master .  you know .  they   re the thinner ones with the pale faces .  because we   re a university .  they come with the whole thing  like rats           i thought we paid people to deal with    em .         the teaching staff .  yes .  but sometimes   well  i wonder  archchancellor  if you would care to look at these examination results            it was midnight   not the same midnight as before  but a very similar midnight .  old tom  the tongueless bell in the university bell tower  had just tolled its twelve sonorous silences .   rainclouds squeezed their last few drops over the city .  ankh morpork sprawled under a few damp stars  as real as a brick .   ponder stibbons  student wizard  put down his book and rubbed his face .      all right     he said .     ask me anything .  go on .  anything at all .      victor tugelbend  student wizard  picked up his battered copy of necrotelicomnicon discussed for students  with practical experiments and turned the pages at random .  he was lying on ponder   s bed .  at least  his shoulder blades were .  his body extended up the wall .  this is a perfectly normal position for a student taking his ease .      ok     he said .     right .  ok .  what  right  what is the name of the outer dimensional monster whose distinctive cry is    yerwhatyerwhatyerwhat    .         yob soddoth     said ponder promptly .      yeah .  how does the monster tshup aklathep  infernal star toad with a million young  torture its victims to death .         it   don   t tell me   it holds them down and shows them pictures of its children until their brains implode .         yep .  always wondered how that happens  myself     said victor  flicking through the pages .     i suppose after you   ve said    yes  he   s got your eyes    for the thousandth time you   re about ready to commit suicide in any case .         you know an awful lot  victor     said ponder admiringly .      i   m amazed you   re still a student .         er  yes     said victor .     er .  just unlucky at exams  i guess .         go on     said ponder     ask me one more .      victor opened the book again .   there was a moment   s silence .   then he said     where   s holy wood .      ponder shut his eyes and pounded his forehead .     hang on  hang on   don   t tell me       he opened his eyes .     what do you mean  where   s holy wood .     he added sharply .     i don   t remember anything about any holy wood .      victor stared down at the page .  there was nothing about any holy wood there .      i could have sworn i heard   i think my mind must be wandering     he finished lamely .     it must be all this revision .         yes .  it really gets to you  doesn   t it .  but it   ll be worth it  to be a wizard .         yes     said victor .     can   t wait .      ponder shut the book .      rain   s stopped .  let   s go over the wall     he said .     we deserve a drink .      victor waggled a finger .     just one drink  then .  got to keep sober     he said .     it   s finals tomorrow .  got to keep a clear head .         huh .     said ponder .   of course  it is very important to be sober when you take an exam .  many worthwhile careers in the street cleansing  fruit picking and subway guitar playing industries have been founded on a lack of understanding of this simple fact .   but victor had a special reason for keeping alert .   he might make a mistake  and pass .   his dead uncle had left him a small fortune not to be a wizard .  he hadn   t realized it when he   d drawn up the will  but that   s what the old man had done .  he thought he was helping his nephew through college  but victor tugelbend was a very bright young lad in an oblique sort of way and had reasoned thusly   what are the advantages and disadvantages of being a wizard .  well  you got a certain amount of prestige  but you were often in dangerous situations and certainly always at risk of being killed by a fellow mage .  he saw no future in being a well respected corpse .   on the other hand     what are the advantages and disadvantages of being a student wizard .  you got quite a lot of free time  a certain amount of license in matters like drinking a lot of ale and singing bawdy songs  no one tried to kill you much except in the ordinary  everyday ankh morpork way of things and  thanks to the legacy  you also got a modest but comfortable style of living .  of course  you didn   t get much in the way of prestige but at least you were alive to know this .   so victor had devoted a considerable amount of energy in studying firstly the terms of the will  the byzantine examination regulations of unseen university  and every examination paper of the last fifty years .   the pass mark in finals was    .   failing would be easy .  any idiot can fail .   victor   s uncle had been no fool .  one of the conditions of the legacy was that  should victor ever achieve a mark of less than     the money supply would dry up like thin spit on a hot stove .   he   d won  in a way .  few students had ever studied as hard as victor .  it was said that his knowledge of magic rivaled that of some of the top wizards .  he spent hours in a comfy chair in the library  reading grimoires .  he researched answer formats and exam techniques .  he listened to lectures until he could quote them by heart .  he was generally considered by the staff to be the brightest and certainly the busiest student for decades and  at every finals  he carefully and competently got a mark of    .   it was uncanny .       the archchancellor reached the last page .   eventually he said     ah .  i see .  feel sorry for the lad  do you .         i don   t think you quite see what i mean     said the bursar .      fairly obvious to me     said the archchancellor .     lad keeps coming within an ace of passin    .     he pulled out one of the papers .     anyway  it says here he passed three years ago .  got    .         yes  archchancellor .  but he appealed .         appealed .  against passin    .         he said he didn   t think the examiners had noticed that he got the allotropes of octiron wrong in question six .  he said he couldn   t live with his conscience .  he said it would haunt him for the rest of his days if he succeeded unfairly over better and more worthy students .  you   ll notice he got only    and    in the next two exams .         why   s that .         we think he was playing safe  master .      the archchancellor drummed his fingers on the desk .      can   t have this     he said .     can   t have someone goin    around almost bein    a wizard and laughin    at us up his  his   what   s it that people laugh up .         my feelings exactly     purred the bursar .      we should send him up     said the archchancellor firmly .      down  master     said the bursar .     sending him up would mean making spiteful and satirical comments about him .         yes .  good thinkin    .  let   s do that     said the archchancellor .      no  master     said the bursar patiently .     he   s sending us up  so we send him down .         right .  balance things up     said the archchancellor .  the bursar rolled his eyes .     or down     the archchancellor added .     so you want me to give him his marchin    orders  eh .  just send him along in the morning and           no  archchancellor .  we can   t do it just like that .         we can   t .  i thought we were in charge here .         yes  but you have to be extremely careful when dealing with master tugelbend .  he   s an expert on procedures .  so what i thought we could do is give him this paper in the finals tomorrow .      the archchancellor took the proferred document .  his lips moved silently as he read it .      just one question .         yes .  and he   ll either pass or fail .  i   d like to see him manage    percent on that .          in a sense which his tutors couldn   t quite define  much to their annoyance  victor tugelbend was also the laziest person in the history of the world .   not simply  ordinarily lazy .  ordinary laziness was merely the absence of effort .  victor had passed through there a long time ago  had gone straight through commonplace idleness and out on the far side .  he put more effort into avoiding work than most people put into hard labor .   he had never wanted to be a wizard .  he   d never wanted much  except perhaps to be left alone and not woken up until midday .  when he   d been small  people had said things like     and what do you want to be  little man .     and he   d said     i don   t know .  what have you got .      they didn   t let you get away with that sort of thing for very long .  it wasn   t enough to be what you were  you had to be working to be something else .   he   d tried .  for quite a long while he   d tried wanting to be a blacksmith  because that looked interesting and romantic .  but it also involved hard work and intractable bits of metal .  then he   d tried wanting to be an assassin  which looked dashing and romantic .  but it also involved hard work and  when you got right down to it  occasionally having to kill someone .  then he   d tried wanting to be an actor  which looked dramatic and romantic  but it had involved dusty tights  cramped lodgings and  to his amazement  hard work .   he   d allowed himself to be sent to the university because it was easier than not going .   he tended to smile a lot  in a faintly puzzled way .  this gave people the impression that he was slightly more intelligent than they were .  in fact  he was usually trying to work out what they had just said .   and he had a thin mustache  which in a certain light made him look debonair and  in another  made him look as though he had been drinking a thick chocolate milk shake .   he was quite proud of it .  when you became a wizard you were expected to stop shaving and grow a beard like a gorse bush .  very senior wizards looked capable of straining nourishment out of the air via their mustaches  like whales .   it was now half past one .  he was ambling back from the mended drum  the most determinedly disreputable of the city   s taverns .  victor tugelbend always gave the impression of ambling  even when he was running .   he was also quite sober and a bit surprised  therefore  to find himself in the plaza of broken moons .  he   d been heading for the little alley behind the university and the piece of wall with the conveniently spaced removable bricks where  for hundreds and hundreds of years  student wizards had quietly got around  or more precisely climbed over  unseen university   s curfew restrictions .   the plaza wasn   t on the route .   he turned to amble back the way he had come  and then stopped .  there was something unusual going on .   usually there   d be a storyteller there  or some musicians  or an entrepreneur looking for prospective buyers of such surplus ankh morpork landmarks as the tower of art or the brass bridge .   now there were just some people putting up a big screen  like a bedsheet stretched between poles .   he sauntered over to them .     what   re you doing .     he said amiably .      there   s going to be a performance .         oh .  acting     said victor  without much interest .   he mooched back through the damp darkness  but stopped when he heard a voice coming from the gloom between two buildings .   the voice said    help     quite quietly .   another voice said     just hand it over  right .      victor wandered closer  and squinted into the shadows .      hallo .     he said .     is everything all right .      there was a pause  and then a low voice said     you don   t know what   s good for you  kid .      he   s got a knife  victor thought .  he   s coming at me with a knife .  that means i   m either going to get stabbed or i   m going to have to run away  which is a real waste of energy .   people who didn   t apply themselves to the facts in hand might have thought that victor tugelbend would be fat and unhealthy .  in fact  he was undoubtedly the most athletically inclined student in the university .  having to haul around extra poundage was far too much effort  so he saw to it that he never put it on and he kept himself in trim because doing things with decent muscles was far less effort than trying to achieve things with bags of flab .   so he brought one hand around in a backhanded swipe .  it didn   t just connect  it lifted the mugger off his feet .   then he looked for the prospective victim  who was still cowering against the wall .      i hope you   re not hurt     he said .      don   t move .         i wasn   t going to     said victor .   the figure advanced from the shadows .  it had a package under one arm  and its hands were held in front of its face in an odd gesture  each forefinger and thumb extended at right angles and then fitted together  so that the man   s little weaselly eyes appeared to be looking out through a frame .   he   s probably warding off the evil eye  victor thought .  he looks like a wizard  with all those symbols on his dress .      amazing .     said the man  squinting through his fingers .      just turn your head slightly  will you .  great .  pity about the nose  but i expect we can do something about that .      he stepped forward and tried to put his arm around victor   s shoulders .     it   s lucky for you     he said     that you met me .         it is .     said victor  who had been thinking it was the other way around .      you   re just the type i   m looking for     said the man .      sorry     said victor .     i thought you were being robbed .         he was after this     said the man  patting the package under his arm .  it rang like a gong .     wouldn   t have done him any good  though .         not worth anything .     said victor .      priceless .         that   s all right then     said victor .   the man gave up trying to reach across both of victor   s shoulders  which were quite broad  and settled for just one of them .      but a lot of people would be disappointed     he said .      now  look .  you stand well .  good profile .  listen  lad  how would you like to be in moving pictures .         er     said victor .     no .  i don   t think so .      the man gaped at him .      you did hear what i said  didn   t you .     he said .     moving pictures .         yes .         everyone wants to be in moving pictures .         no  thanks     said victor  politely .     i   m sure it   s a worthwhile job  but moving pictures doesn   t sound very interesting to me .         i   m talking about moving pictures .         yes     said victor mildly .     i heard you .      the man shook his head .     well     he said     you   ve made my day .  first time in weeks i   ve met someone who isn   t desperate to get into moving pictures .  i thought everyone wanted to get into moving pictures .  i thought as soon as i saw you  he   ll be expecting a job in moving pictures for this night   s work .         thanks all the same     said victor .     but i don   t think i   d take to it .         well  i owe you something .     the little man fumbled in a pocket and produced a card .  victor took it .  it read       thomas silverfish    interesting and instructive kinematography  one and two reelers  nearly non explosive stock       holy wood         that   s if ever you change your mind     he said .     everyone in holy wood knows me .      victor stared at the card .     thank you     he said vaguely .     er .  are you a wizard .      silverfish glared at him .      whatever made you think that .     he snapped .      you   re wearing a dress with magic symbols           magic symbols .  look closely  boy .  these are certainly not the credulous symbols of a ridiculous and outmoded belief system .  these are the badges of an enlightened craft whose clear  new dawn is just   er  dawning .  magic symbols .     he finished  in tones of withering scorn .     and it   s a robe  not a dress     he added .   victor peered at the collection of stars and crescent moons and things .  the badges of an enlightened craft whose new dawn was just dawning looked just like the credulous symbols of a ridiculous and outmoded belief system to him  but this was probably not the time to say so .      sorry     he said again .     couldn   t see them clearly .         i   m an alchemist     said silverfish  only slightly mollified .      oh  lead into gold  that sort of thing     said victor .      not lead  lad .  light .  it doesn   t work with lead .  light into gold           really .     said victor politely  as silverfish started to set up a tripod in the middle of the plaza .   a small crowd was collecting .  a small crowd collected very easily in ankh morpork .  as a city  it had some of the most accomplished spectators in the universe .  they   d watch anything  especially if there was any possibility of anyone getting hurt in an amusing way .      why don   t you stay for the show .     said silverfish  and hurried off .   an alchemist .  well  everyone knew that alchemists were a little bit mad  thought victor .  it was perfectly normal .   who   d want to spend their time moving pictures .  most of them looked all right where they were .      sausages inna bun .  get them while they   re hot .     bellowed a voice by his ear .  he turned .      oh  hallo  mr .  dibbler     he said .      evening  lad .  want to get a nice hot sausage down you .      victor eyed the glistening tubes in the tray around dibbler   s neck .  they smelled appetizing .  they always did .  and then you bit into them  and learned once again that cut me own throat dibbler could find a use for bits of an animal that the animal didn   t know it had got .  dibbler had worked out that with enough fried onions and mustard people would eat anything .      special rate for students     dibbler whispered conspiratorially .     fifteen pence  and that   s cutting my own throat .     he flapped the frying pan lid strategically  raising a cloud of steam .   the piquant scent of fried onions did its wicked work .      just one  then     victor said warily .   dibbler flicked a sausage out of the pan and snatched it into a bun with the expertise of a frog snapping a mayfly .      you won   t live to regret it     he said cheerfully   victor nibbled a bit of onion .  that was safe enough .      what   s all this .     he said  jerking a thumb in the direction of the flapping screen .      some kind of entertainment     said dibbler .     hot sausages .  they   re lovely .     he lowered his voice again to its normal conspiratorial hiss .      all the rage in the other cities  i hear     he added .     some sort of moving pictures .  they   ve been trying to get it right before coming to ankh morpork .      they watched silverfish and a couple of associates fumble technically with the box on the tripod .  white light suddenly appeared at a circular orifice on the front of it  and illuminated the screen .  there was a half hearted cheer from the crowd .      oh     said victor .     i see .  is that all .  it   s just plain old shadow play .  that   s all it is .  my uncle used to do it to amuse me .  you know .  you kind of move your hands in front of the light and the shadows make a kind of silhouettey picture .         oh  yeah     said dibbler uncertainly .     like    big elephant     or    bald eagle .     my grandad used to do that sort of stuff .         mainly my uncle did    deformed rabbit        said victor .      he wasn   t very good at it  you see .  it used to get pretty embarrassing .  we   d all sit around desperately guessing things like    surprised hedgehog    or    rabid stoat    and he   d go off to bed in a sulk because we hadn   t guessed he was really doing    lord henry skipps and his men beating the trolls at the battle of pseudopolis .     i can   t see what   s so special about shadows on a screen .         from what i hear it   s not like that     said dibbler .     i sold one of the men a jumbo sausage special earlier on  and he said it   s all down to showing pictures very fast .  sticking lots of pictures together and showing them one after another .  very  very fast  he said .         not too fast     said victor severely .     you wouldn   t be able to see them go past if they were too fast .         he said that   s the whole secret  not seeing    em go past     said dibbler .     you have to see    em all at once  or something .         they   d all be blurred     said victor .     didn   t you ask him about that .         er  no     said dibbler .     point of fact  he had to rush off just then .  said he felt a bit odd .      victor looked thoughtfully at the remnant of his sausage in a bun and  as he did so  he was aware of being stared at in his turn .   he looked down .  there was a dog sitting by his feet .   it was small  bow legged and wiry  and basically gray but with patches of brown  white and black in outlying areas  and it was staring .   it was certainly the most penetrating stare victor had ever seen .  it wasn   t menacing or fawning .  it was just very slow and very thorough  as though the dog was memorizing details so that it could give a full description to the authorities later on .   when it was sure it had his full attention  it transferred its gaze to the sausage .   feeling wretched at being so cruel to a poor dumb animal  victor flicked the sausage downward .  the dog caught and swallowed it in one economical movement .   more people were drifting into the plaza now .  cut me own throat dibbler had wandered off and was doing a busy trade with those late night revelers who were too drunk to prevent optimism triumphing over experience  anyone who bought a meal at one a . m .  after a night   s reveling was probably going to be riotously ill anyway  so they might as well have something to show for it .   victor was gradually surrounded by a large crowd .  it didn   t consist solely of humans .  he recognized  a few feet away  the big rangy shape of detritus  an ancient troll well known to all the students as someone who found employment anywhere people needed to be thrown very hard out of places for money .  the troll noticed him  and tried to wink .  this involved closing both eyes  because detritus wasn   t good at complicated things .  it was widely believed that  if detritus could be taught to read and write sufficiently to sit down and do an intelligence test  he   d prove to be slightly less intelligent than the chair .   silverfish picked up a megaphone .      ladies and gentlemen     he said     you are privileged tonight to witness a turning point in the history of the century of       he lowered the megaphone and victor heard him whisper urgently to one of his assistants     what century is this .  is it .     and then raised the megaphone again and continued in the original plummily optimistic tones       century of the fruitbat .  no less than the birth of moving pictures .  pictures that move without magic .      he waited for the applause .  there wasn   t any .  the crowd just watched him .  you needed to do more than end your sentences with exclamation marks to get a around of applause from an ankh morpork crowd .   slightly dispirited  he went on     seeing is believing  they say .  but  ladies and gentlemen  you will not believe the evidence of your own eyes .  what you are about to witness is a triumph of natural science .  a marvel of the age .  a discovery of world  nay  dare i say  universe shaking proportions .               s got to be better than that bloody sausage  anyway     said a quiet voice by victor   s knee .         harnessing natural mechanisms to create illusion .  illusion  ladies and gentlemen  without recourse to magic .         victor let his gaze slide downward .  there was nothing down there but the little dog  industriously scratching itself .  it looked up slowly  and said    woof .            potential for learning .  the arts .  history .  i thank you  ladies and gentlemen .  ladies and gentlemen  you ain   t seen nothing yet .      there was another hopeful break for applause .   someone at the front of the crowd said     that   s right .  we ain   t .         yeah     said the woman next to him .     when   re you goin    to stop goin    on like that and get on with the shadow play .         that   s right     snapped a second woman .     do    deformed rabbit .     my kids always love that one .      victor looked away for a while  to lull the dog   s suspicions  and then turned and glared hard at it .   it was amiably watching the crowd  and apparently taking no notice of him .   victor poked an exploratory finger in his ear .  it must have been a trick of an echo  or something .  it wasn   t that the dog had gone    woof .      although that was practically unique in itself  most dogs in the universe never went    woof .      they had complicated barks like    whuuugh .     and    hwhoouf .     no  it was that it hadn   t in fact barked at all .  it had said    woof .      he shook his head  and looked back as silverfish climbed down from the screen and motioned to one of his assistants to start turning a handle at the side of the box .  there was a grinding noise that rose to a steady clicking .  vague shadows danced across the screen  and then     one of the last things victor remembered was a voice beside his knee saying     could have bin worse  mister .  i could have said    miaow .             holy wood dreams         and now it was now eight hours later .   a horribly overhung ponder stibbons looked guiltily at the empty desk beside him .  it was unlike victor to miss exams .  he always said he enjoyed the challenge .      get ready to turn over your papers     said the invigilator at the end of the hall .  the sixty chests of sixty prospective wizards tightened with dark  unbearable tension .  ponder fumbled anxiously with his lucky pen .   the wizard on the dais turned over the hourglass .     you may begin     he said .   several of the more smug students turned over their papers by snapping their fingers .  ponder hated them instantly .   he reached for his lucky inkwell  missed completely in his nervousness  and then knocked it over .  a small black flood rolled over his question paper .   panic and shame washed over him nearly as thoroughly .  he mopped the ink up with the hem of his robe  spreading it smoothly over the desk .  his lucky dried frog had been washed away .   hot with embarrassment  dripping black ink  he looked up in supplication at the presiding wizard and then cast his eyes imploringly at the empty desk beside him .   the wizard nodded .  ponder gratefully sidled across the aisle  waited until his heart had stopped thumping and then  very carefully  turned over the paper on the desk .   after ten seconds  and against all reason  he turned it over again just in case there had been a mistake and the rest of the questions had somehow been on the top side after all .   around him there was the intense silence of fifty nine minds creaking with sustained effort .   ponder turned the paper over again .   perhaps it was some mistake .  no   there was the university seal and the signature of the archchancellor and everything .  so perhaps it was some sort of special test .  perhaps they were watching him now to see what he   d do     he peered around furtively .  the other students seemed to be working hard .  perhaps it was a mistake after all .  yes .  the more he came to think about it  the more logical it seemed .  the archchancellor had probably signed the papers and then  when the clerks had been copying them out  one of them had got as far as the all important first question and then maybe had been called away or something  and no one had noticed  and it   d got put on victor   s desk  but now he wasn   t here and ponder had got it which meant  he decided  in a sudden rush of piety  that the gods must have wanted him to get it .  after all  it wasn   t his fault if some sort of error gave him a paper like this .  it was probably sacrilegious or something to ignore the opportunity .   they had to accept what you put down .  ponder hadn   t shared the room with the world   s greatest authority on examination procedures without learning a thing or two .   he looked again at the question     what is your name .      he answered it .   after a while he underlined it  several times  with his lucky ruler .   after a little while longer  to show willing  he wrote above it     the anser to questione one is      after a further ten minutes he ventured    which is what my name is    on the line below  and underlined it .   poor old victor will be really sorry he missed this  he thought .   i wonder where he is .       there was no road to holy wood yet .  anyone trying to get there would take the highway to quirm and  at some unmarked point out in the scrubby landscape  would turn off and strike out toward the sand dunes .  wild lavender and rosemary lined the banks .  there was no sound but the buzzing of bees and the distant song of a skylark  which only made the silence more obvious .   victor tugelbend left the road at the point where the bank had been broken down and flattened by the passage of many carts and  by the look of it  an increasing number of feet .   there were still many miles to go .  he trudged on .   somewhere at the back of his mind a tiny voice was saying things like    where am i .  why am i doing this .     and another part of him knew that he didn   t really have to do it at all .  like the hypnotist   s victim who knows they   re not really hypnotized and can snap out of it any time they like  but just happened not to feel like it right now  he let his feet be guided .   he wasn   t certain why .  he just knew that there was something that he had to be part of .  something that might never happen again .   some way behind  but catching up fast  was cut me own throat dibbler  trying to ride a horse .  he was not a natural horseman  and fell off occasionally  which was one reason why he hadn   t overtaken victor yet .  the other was that he had paused  before leaving the city  to sell his sausage in a bun business cheaply to a dwarf who could not believe his luck  after actually trying some of the sausages  would still not be able to believe his luck  .   something was calling dibbler  and it had a golden voice .   a long way behind throat  knuckles dragging in the sand  was detritus the troll .  it   s hard to be certain of what he was thinking  any more than it   s possible to tell what a homing pigeon is thinking .  he just knew that where he ought to be was not where he was .   and finally  even further down the road  was an eight horse wagon taking a load of lumber to holy wood .  its driver wasn   t thinking about anything very much  although he was slightly puzzled by an incident that occurred just as he was leaving ankh morpork in the darkness before dawn .  a voice from the gloom by the road had shouted    stop in the name of the city guard .     and he had stopped  and when nothing further had transpired he had looked around  and there was no one there .   the wagon rumbled past  revealing to the eye of the imaginative beholder the small figure of gaspode the wonder dog  trying to make himself comfortable among the balks of timber at the rear .  he was going to holy wood too .   and he also didn   t know why .   but he was determined to find out .       no one would have believed  in the final years of the century of the fruitbat  that discworld affairs were being watched keenly and impatiently by intelligences greater than man   s  or at least much nastier  that their affairs were being scrutinized and studied as a man with a three day appetite might study the all you can gobble for a dollar menu outside harga   s house of ribs     well  actually   most wizards would have believed it  if anyone had told them .   and the librarian would certainly have believed it .   and mrs .  marietta cosmopilite of   quirm street  ankh morpork  would have believed it  too .  but she believed the world was round  that a sprig of garlic in her underwear drawer kept away vampires  that it did you good to get out and have a laugh occasionally  that there was niceness in everyone if you only knew where to look  and that three horrible little dwarfs peered in at her undressing every night .         holy wood .         was nothing very much  yet .  just a hill by the sea  and on the other side of the hill  a lot of sand dunes .  it was that special sort of beautiful area which is only beautiful if you can leave after briefly admiring its beauty and go somewhere else where there are hot tubs and cold drinks .  actually staying there for any length of time is a penance .   nevertheless  there was a town there   just .  wooden shacks had been built wherever someone had dropped a load of timber  and they were crude  as if the builders had resented the time taken from something more important that they   d much rather be doing .  they were square plank boxes .   except for the front .   if you wanted to understand holy wood  victor said years afterward  you had to understand its buildings .   you   d see a box on the sand .  it   s have a roughly peaked roof  but that wasn   t important  because it never rained in holy wood .  there   d be cracks in the walls  stuffed with old rags .  the windows would be holes   glass was too fragile to cart all the way from ankh morpork .  and  from behind  the front was just like a huge wooden billboard  held up by a network of struts .   from the front  it was a fretted  carved  painted  ornate  baroque architectural extravaganza .  in ankh morpork  sensible men built their houses plain  so as not to attract attention  and kept the decoration for inside .  but holy wood wore its houses inside out .   victor walked up what passed for the main street in a daze .  he had woken up in the early hours out in the dunes .  why .  he   d decided to come to holy wood  but why .  he couldn   t remember .  all he could remember was that  at the time  it was the obvious thing to do .  there had been hundreds of good reasons .   if only he could remember one of them .   not that his mind had any room to review memories .  it was too busy being aware that he was very hungry and acutely thirsty .  his pockets had yielded a total of seven pence .  that wouldn   t buy a bowl of soup  let alone a good meal .   he needed a good meal .  things would look a lot clearer after a good meal .   he pushed through the crowds .  most of them seemed to be carpenters  but there were others  carrying carboys or mysterious boxes .  and everyone was moving very quickly and resolutely  bent on some powerful purpose of their own .   except him .   he trailed up the impromptu street  gawping at the houses  feeling like a stray grasshopper in an ant hill .  and there didn   t seem to        why don   t you look where you   re going .      he rebounded off a wall .  when he got his balance the other party in the collision had already whirred off into the crowd .  he stared for a moment and then ran desperately after her .      hey .     he said     sorry .  excuse me .  miss .      she stopped  and waited impatiently as he caught up .      well .     she said .   she was a foot shorter than him and her shape was doubtful since most of her was covered in a ridiculously frilly dress  although the dress wasn   t as ludicrous as the big blond wig full of ringlets .  and her face was white with make up apart from her eyes  which were heavily ringed in black .  the general effect was of a lampshade that hadn   t been getting much sleep lately .      well .     she repeated     hurry up .  they   re shooting again in five minutes .         er        she unbent slightly .     no  don   t tell me     she said .     you   ve just got here .  it   s all new to you .  you don   t know what to do .  you   re hungry .  you haven   t got any money .  right .         yes .  how did you know .         everyone starts like that .  and now you want to break into the clicks  right .         the clicks .      she rolled her eyes  deep within their black circles .      moving pictures .         oh       i do  he thought .  i didn   t know it but i do .  yes .  that   s why i came here .  why didn   t i think of that .     yes     he said .     yes  that   s what i want to do .  i want to  er  break in .  and how does one do that .         one waits forever and ever .  until one is noticed .     the girl looked him up and down with unconcealed contempt .      take up carpentry  why don   t you .  holy wood always needs good wood butchers .      and then she spun around and was gone  lost in a crowd of busy people .      er  thank you     victor called after her .     thank you .     he raised his voice and added     i hope your eyes get better .      he jingled the coins in his pocket .   well  carpentry was out .  it sounded too much like hard work .  he   d tried it once  and wood and him had soon reached an agreement   he wouldn   t touch it  and it wouldn   t split .   waiting forever and ever had its attractions  but you needed money to do it with .   his fingers closed around a small  unexpected rectangle .  he pulled it out and looked at it .   silverfish   s card .       no .    holy wood turned out to be a couple of shacks inside a high fence .  there was a queue at the gate .  it was made up of trolls  dwarfs and humans .  they looked as though they had been there for some time  in fact  some of them had such a naturally dispirited way of sagging while remaining upright that they might have been specially evolved descendants of the original prehistoric queuers .   at the gate was a large  heavy set man  who was eyeing the queue with the smug look of minor power wielders everywhere .      excuse me       victor began .      mister silverfish ain   t hiring anymore people this morning     said the man out of the corner of his mouth .     so scram .         but he said that if ever i was in           did i just say scram  friend .         yes  but        the door in the fence opened a fraction .  a small pale face poked out .      we need a troll and a coupla humans     it said .     one day  usual rates .     the gate shut again .   the man straightened up and cupped his scarred hands around his mouth .      right  you horrible lot .     he shouted .     you heard the man .     he ran his eyes over the line with the practiced gaze of a stock breeder .     you  you and you     he said  pointing .      excuse me     said victor helpfully     but i think that man over there was actually first in the        he was shoved out of the way .  the lucky three shuffled in .  he thought he saw the glint of coins changing hands .  then the gatekeeper turned an angry red face toward him .      you     he said     get to the end of the queue .  and stay there .      victor stared at him .  he stared at the gate .  he looked at the long line of dispirited people .      um  no     he said .     i don   t think so .  thanks all the same .         then beat it .      victor gave him a friendly smile .  he walked to the end of the fence  and followed it .  it turned  at the far end  into a narrow alley .   victor searched among the usual alley debris for a while until he found a piece of scrap paper .  then he rolled up his sleeves .  and only then did he inspect the fence carefully until he found a couple of loose boards that  with a bit of effort  let him through .   this brought him into an area stacked with lumber and piles of cloth .  there was no one around .   walking purposefully  in the knowledge that no one with their sleeves rolled up who walks purposefully with a piece of paper held conspicuously in their hand is ever challenged  he set out across the wood and canvas wonderland of interesting and instructive kinematography .   there were buildings painted on the back of other buildings .  there were trees that were trees  at the front  and just a mass of struts at the back .  there was a flurry of activity although  as far as victor could see  no one was actually producing anything .   he watched a man in a long black cloak  a black hat and a mustache like a yard brush tie a girl to one of the trees .  no one seemed interested in stopping him  even though she was struggling .  a couple of people were in fact watching disinterestedly  and there was a man standing behind a large box on a tripod  turning a handle .   she flung out an imploring arm and opened and shut her mouth soundlessly .   one of the watchers stood up  sorted through a stack of boards beside him  and held one up in front of the box .   it was black .  on it  in white  were the words    noe .  noe .      he walked away .  the villain twirled his mustache .  the man walked back with a board .  this time it said    ahar .  my proude beauty .      another of the seated watchers picked up a megaphone .      fine  fine     he said .     ok  take a five minutes break and then everyone back here for the big fight scene .      the villain untied the girl .  they wandered off .  the man stopped turning the handle  lit a cigarette  and then opened the top of the box .      everyone get that .     he said .   there was a chorus of squeaks .   victor walked over and tapped the megaphone man on his shoulder .      urgent message for mr .  silverfish .     he said .      he   s in the offices over there     said the man  jerking his thumb over his shoulder without looking around .      thank you .      the first shed he poked his head into contained nothing but rows of small cages stretching away into the gloom .  indistinct things hurled themselves against the bars and chittered at him .  he slammed the door hurriedly .   the next door revealed silverfish  standing in front of a desk covered with bits of glassware and drifts of paper .  he didn   t turn around .      just put it over there     he said absently .      it   s me  mr .  silverfish     said victor .   silverfish turned around and peered vaguely at him  as if it was victor   s fault that his name meant nothing .      yes .         i   ve come because of that job     said victor .     you know .         what job .  what should i know .     said silverfish .     how the hell did you get in here .         i broke into moving pictures     said victor .     but it   s nothing that a hammer and a few nails won   t put right .      panic bloomed on silverfish   s face .  victor pulled out the card and waved it in what he hoped was a reassuring way .      in ankh morpork .     he said .     a couple of nights ago .  you were being menaced .      realization dawned .     oh  yes     said silverfish faintly .     and you were the lad who was of some help .         and you said to come and see you if i wanted to move pictures     said victor .     i didn   t  then  but i do now .     he gave silverfish a bright smile .   but he thought  he   s going to try and wriggle out of it .  he   s regretting the offer .  he   s going to send me back to the queue .      well  of course     said silverfish     a lot of very talented people want to be in moving pictures .  we   re going to have sound any day now .  i mean  are you a carpenter .  any alchemical experience .  have you ever trained imps .  any good with your hands at all .         no     victor admitted .      can you sing .         a bit .  in the bath .  but not very well     victor conceded .      can you dance .         no .         swords .  do you know how to handle a sword .         a little     said victor .  he   d used one sometimes in the gym .  he   d never in fact fought an opponent  since wizards generally abhor exercise and the only other university resident who ever entered the place was the librarian  and then only to use the ropes and rings .  but victor had practiced an energetic and idiosyncratic technique in front of the mirror  and the mirror had never beaten him yet .      i see     said silverfish gloomily .     can   t sing .  can   t dance .  can handle a sword a little .         but i have saved your life twice     said victor .      twice .     snapped silverfish .      yes     said victor .  he took a deep breath .  this was going to be risky .     then     he said     and now .      there was a long pause .   then silverfish said     i really don   t think there   s any call for that .         i   m sorry  mr .  silverfish     victor pleaded .     i   m really not that kind of person but you did say and i   ve walked all this way and i haven   t got any money and i   m hungry and i   ll do anything you   ve got .  anything at all .  please .      silverfish looked at him doubtfully .      even acting .     he said .      pardon .         moving about and pretending to do things     said silverfish helpfully .      yes .         seems a shame  a bright  well educated lad like you     said silverfish .     what do you do .         i   m studying to be a w        victor began .  he remembered silverfish   s antipathy toward wizardry  and corrected himself     a clerk .         a waclerk .     said silverfish .      i don   t know if i   d be any good at acting  though     victor confessed .   silverfish looked surprised .     oh  you   ll be ok     he said .     it   s very hard to be bad at acting in moving pictures .      he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a dollar coin .      here     he said     go and get something to eat .      he looked victor up and down .      are you waiting for something .     he said .      well     said victor     i was hoping you could tell me what   s going on .         how do you mean .         a couple of nights ago i watched your  your click     he felt slightly proud of remembering the term     back in the city and suddenly i wanted to be here more than anything else .  i   ve never really wanted anything in my life before .      silverfish   s face broke into a relieved grin .      oh  that     he said .     that   s just the magic of holy wood .  not wizard   s magic     he added hastily     which is all superstition and mumbo jumbo .  no .  this is magic for ordinary people .  your mind is fizzing with all the possibilities .  i know mine was     he added .      yes     said victor uncertainly .     but how does it work .      silverfish   s face lit up .      you want to know .     he said .     you want to know how things work .         yes  i           you see  most people are so disappointing     silverfish said .     you show them something really wonderful like the picture box  and they just go    oh .     they never ask how it works .  mr .  bird .      the last word was a shout .  after a while a door opened on the far side of the shack and a man appeared .   he had a picture box on a strap around his neck .  assorted tools hung from his belt .  his hands were stained with chemical and he had no eyebrows  which victor was later to learn was a sure sign of someone who had been around octo cellulose for any length of time .  he also had his cap on back to front .      this is gaffer bird     beamed silverfish .     our head handleman .  gaffer  this is victor .  he   s going to act for us .         oh     said gaffer  looking at victor in the same way that a butcher might look at a carcass .     is he .         and he wants to know how things work .     said silverfish .   gaffer gave victor another jaundiced look .      string     he said gloomily .     it all works by string .  you   d be amazed how things   d fall to bits around here     he said     if it weren   t for me and my ball of string .      there was a sudden commotion from the box around his neck .  he thumped it with the flat of his hand .      you lot can cut that out     he said .  he nodded at victor .      they gets fractious if their routine is upset     he said .      what   s in the box .     said victor .   gaffer winked at silverfish .     i bet you   d like to know     he said .   victor remembered the caged things he   d seen in the shed .      they sound like common demons     he said cautiously .   gaffer gave him an approving look  such as might be given to a stupid dog who had just done a rather clever trick .      yeah  that   s right     he conceded .      but how do you stop them escaping .     said victor .   gaffer leered .     amazin    stuff  string     he said .       cut me own throat dibbler was one of those rare people with the ability to think in straight lines .   most people think in curves and zig zags .  for example  they start from a thought like  i wonder how i can become very rich  and then proceed along an uncertain course which includes thoughts like  i wonder what   s for supper  and  i wonder who i know who can lend me five dollars .   whereas throat was one of those people who could identify the thought at the other end of the process  in this case i am now very rich  draw a line between the two  and then think his way along it  slowly and patiently  until he got to the other end .   not that it worked .  there was always  he found  some small but vital flaw in the process .  it generally involved a strange reluctance on the part of people to buy what he had to sell .   but his life savings were now resting in a leather bag inside his jerkin .  he   d been in holy wood for a day .  he   d looked at its ramshackle organization  such as it was  with the eye of a lifelong salesman .  there seemed nowhere in it for him  but this wasn   t a problem .  there was always room at the top .   a day   s enquiries and careful observation had led him to interesting and instructive kinematography .  now he stood on the far side of the street  watching carefully .   he watched the queue .  he watched the man on the gate .  he reached a decision .   he strolled along the queue .  he had brains .  he knew he had brains .  what he needed now was muscle .  somewhere here there was bound to        aft   noon  mister dibbler .      that flat head  those rangy arms  that curling lower lip  that croaking voice that bespoke an iq the size of a walnut .  it added up to        it   s me .  detritus     said detritus .     fancy seein    you here  eh .      he gave dibbler a grin like a crack appearing in a vital bridge support .      hallo  detritus .  you working in films .     said dibbler .      not exactly working     said detritus  bashfully .   dibbler looked quietly at the troll  whose chipped fists were generally the final word in any street fight .      i call that disgusting     he said .  he pulled out his money bag and counted out five dollars .     how would you like to work for me  detritus .      detritus touched his jutting brow respectfully .      right you are  mr .  dibbler     he said .      just step this way .      dibbler strolled back up to the head of the queue .  the man at the door thrust out an arm to bar his way .      where d   you think you   re going  pal .     he said .      i have an appointment with mr .  silverfish     said dibbler .      and he knows about this  does he .     said the guard  in tones that suggested that he personally would not believe it even if he saw it written on the sky .      not yet     said dibbler .      well  my friend  in that case you can just get yourself to           detritus .         yes  mr .  dibbler .         hit this man .         right you are  mr .  dibbler .      detritus   s arm whirled around in a     degree arc with oblivion on the end of it .  the guard was lifted off his feet and smashed through the door  coming to a stop in its wreckage twenty feet away .  there was a cheer from the queue .   dibbler looked approvingly at the troll .  detritus was wearing nothing except a ragged loincloth which covered whatever it was that trolls felt it necessary to conceal .      very good  detritus .         right you are  mr .  dibbler .         but we shall have to see about getting you a suit     said dibbler .     now  please guard the gate .  don   t let anyone in .         right you are  mr .  dibbler .      two minutes later a small gray dog trotted through the troll   s short and bandy legs and hopped over the remains of the gate  but detritus didn   t do anything about this because everyone knew dogs weren   t anyone .          mr .  silverfish .     said dibbler .   silverfish  who had been cautiously crossing the studio with a box of fresh film stock  hesitated at the sight of a skinny figure bearing down on him like a long lost weasel .  dibbler   s expression was the expression worn by something long and sleek and white as it swims over the reef and into the warm shallow waters of the kiddies    paddling area .      yes .     said silverfish .     who   re you .  how did you get           dibbler   s the name     said dibbler .     but i   d like you to call me throat .      he clasped silverfish   s unresisting hand and then placed his other hand on the man   s shoulder and stepped forward  pumping the first hand vigorously .  the effect was of acute affability  and it meant that if silverfish backed away he would dislocate his own elbow .      and i   d just like you to know     dibbler went on     that we   re all incredibly impressed at what you boys are doing here .      silverfish watched his own hand being strenuously made friends with  and grinned uncertainly .      you are .     he ventured .      all this        dibbler released silverfish   s shoulder just long enough to expansively indicate the energetic chaos around them .     fantastic .     he said .     marvellous .  and that last thing of yours  what was it called now    .         high jinks at the store     said silverfish .     that   s the one where the thief steals the sausages and the shop keeper chases him .         yeah     said dibbler  his fixed smile glazing for only a second or two before becoming truly sincere again .     yeah .  that was it .  amazing .  true genius .  a beautifully sustained metaphor .         that cost us nearly twenty dollars  you know     said silverfish  with shy pride .     and another forty pence for the sausages  of course .         amazing .     said dibbler .     and it must have been seen by hundreds of people  yes .         thousands     said silverfish .   there was no analogy for dibbler   s grin now .  if it had managed to be any wider  the top of his head would have fallen off .      thousands .     he said .     really .  that many .  and of course they all pay you  oh  how much    .         oh  we just take up a collection at the moment     said silverfish .     just to cover costs while we   re still in the experimental stage  you understand .     he looked down .     i wonder     he added     could you stop shaking my hand now .      dibbler followed his gaze .     of course .     he said  and let go .  silverfish   s hand carried on going up and down for a while of its own accord  out of sheer muscular spasm .   dibbler was silent for a moment  his expression that of a man in deep communion with some inner god .  then he said     you know  thomas   may i call you thomas .    when i saw that masterpiece i thought  dibbler  behind all this is a creative artist              how did you know my name was              a creative artist  i thought  who should be free to pursue his muse instead of being burdened with all the fussy details of management  am i right .         well   it   s true that all this paperwork is a bit           my thoughts exactly     said dibbler     and i said  dibbler  you should go there right now and offer him your services .  you know .  administrate .  take the load off his shoulders .  let him get on with what he does best  am i right .  tom .         i  i  i  yes  of course  it   s true that my forte is really more in           right .  right .     said dibbler .     tom  i accept .      silverfish   s eyes were glassy .      er     he said .   dibbler punched him playfully on the shoulder .     just you show me the paperwork     he said     and then you can get right out there and do whatever it is you do so well .         er .  yes     said silverfish .   dibbler grasped him by both arms and gave him a thousand watts of integrity .      this is a proud moment for me     he said hoarsely .     i can   t tell you how much this means to me .  i can honestly say this is the happiest day of my life .  i want you to know that .  tommy .  sincerely .      the reverential silence was broken by a faint sniggering .   dibbler looked around slowly .  there was no one behind them apart from a small gray mongrel dog sitting in the shade of a heap of lumber .  it noticed his expression and put its head on one side .      woof .     it said .   cut me own throat dibbler looked around momentarily for something to throw  realized that this would be out of character  and turned back to the imprisoned silverfish .      you know     he said sincerely     it   s really lucky for me that i met you .          lunch in a tavern had cost victor the dollar plus a couple of pence .  it was a bowl of soup .  everything cost a lot  said the soup seller  because it all had to be brought a long way .  there weren   t any farms around holy wood .  anyway  who   d grow things when they could be making movies .   then he reported to gaffer for his screen test .   this consisted of standing still for a minute while the handleman watched him owlishly over the top of a picture box .  after the minute had passed gaffer said     right .  you   re a natural  kid .         but i didn   t do anything     said victor .     you just told me not to move .         yeah .  quite right .  that   s what we need .  people who know how to stand still     said gaffer .     none of this fancy acting like in the theater .         but you haven   t told me what the demons do in the box     said victor .      they do this     said gaffer  unclicking a couple of latches .  a row of tiny malevolent eyes glared out at victor .      these six demons here     he said  pointing cautiously to avoid the claws     look out through the little hole in the front of the box and paint pictures of what they see .  there has to be six of them  ok .  two to paint and four to blow on it to get it dry .  on account of the next picture coming down  see .  that   s because every time this handle here is turned  the strip of transparent membrane is wound down one notch for the next picture .     he turned the handle .  it went clickaclicka  and the imps gibbered .      what did they do that for .     said victor .      ah     said gaffer     that   s because the handle also drives this little wheel with whips on .  it   s the only way to get them to work fast enough .  he   s a lazy little devil  your average imp .  it   s all feedback  anyway .  the faster you turn the handle  the faster the film goes by  the faster they have to paint .  you got to get the speed just right .  very important job  handlemanning .         but isn   t it all rather  well  cruel .      gaffer looked surprised .     oh  no .  not really .  i gets a rest every half an hour .  guild of handlemen regulations .      he walked further along the bench  where another box stood with its back panel open .  this time a cageful of sluggish looking lizards blinked mournfully at victor .      we ain   t very happy with this     said gaffer     but it   s the best we can do .  your basic salamander  see  will lie in the desert all day  absorbing light  and when it   s frightened it excretes the light again .  self defense mechanism  it   s called .  so as the film goes past and the shutter here clicks backward and forward  their light goes out through the film and these lenses here and onto the screen .  basically very simple .         how do you make them frightened .     said victor .      you see this handle .         oh .      victor prodded the picture box thoughtfully .      well  all right     he said .     so you get lots of little pictures .  and you wind them fast .  so we ought to see a blur  but we don   t .         ah     said gaffer  tapping the side of his nose .     handlemen   s guild secret  that is .  handed down from initiate to initiate     he added importantly .   victor gave him a sharp look .     i thought people   d only been making movies for a few months     he said .   gaffer had the decency to look shifty .     well  ok  at the moment we   re more sort of handing it round     he admitted .     but give us a few years and we   ll soon be handing it down don   t touch that .      victor jerked his hand back guiltily from the pile of cans on the bench .      that   s actual film in there     said gaffer  pushing them gently to one side .     you got to be very careful with it .  you mustn   t get it too hot because it   s made of octo cellulose  and it don   t like sharp knocks either .         what happens to it  then .     said victor  staring at the cans .      who knows .  no one   s ever lived long enough to tell us .     gaffer looked at victor   s expression and grinned .      don   t worry about that     he said .     you   ll be in front of the moving picture box .         except that i don   t know how to act     said victor .      do you know how to do what you   re told .     said gaffer .      what .  well .  yes .  i suppose so .         that   s all you need  lad .  that   s all you need .  that and big muscles .      they stepped out into the searing sunlight and headed for silverfish   s shed .   which was occupied .   cut me own throat dibbler was meeting the movies .          what i thought     said dibbler     is that  well  look .  something like this .      he held up a card .   on it was written  in shaky handwriting       after thys perfromans  why notte visit  harga   s hous of ribs   for the best inne hawt cuisyne         what   s hawt cuisyne .     said victor .      it   s foreign     said dibbler .  he scowled at victor .  someone like victor under the same roof wasn   t part of the plan .  he   d been hoping to get silverfish alone .     means food     he added .   silverfish stared at the card .      what about it .     he said .      why don   t you     said dibbler  speaking very carefully     hold this card up at the end of the performance .         why should we do that .         because someone like sham harga will pay you a lo   quite a lot of money     said dibbler .   they stared at the card .      i   ve eaten at harga   s house of ribs     said victor .     i wouldn   t say it   s the best .  not the best .  a long way from being the best .     he thought for a bit .     about as far away from being the best as you can get  in fact .         that doesn   t matter     said dibbler sharply .     that   s not important .         but     silverfish said     if we went around saying harga   s house of ribs was the best place in the city  what would all the other restaurants think .      dibbler leaned across the table .      they   d think     he said        why didn   t we think of it first .         he sat back .  silverfish flashed him a look of bright incomprehension .      just run that past me one more time  will you .     he said .      they   ll want to do exactly the same thing .     said dibbler .      i know     said victor .     they   ll want us to hold up cards with things on like    harga   s isn   t the best place in town  actually  ours is .            something like that  something like that     snapped dibbler  glaring at him .     maybe we can work on the words  but something like that .         but  but     silverfish fought to keep ahead of the conversation     harga won   t like it  will he .  if he pays us money to say his place is best  and then we take money from other people to say that their place is best  then he   s bound to           pay us more money     said dibbler     to say it again  only in larger letters .      they stared at him .      you really think that will work .     said silverfish .      yes     said dibbler flatly .     you listen to the street traders any morning .  they don   t shout     nearly fresh oranges  only slightly squashy  reasonable value     do they .  no  they shout     git chore orinjes  they   re luvverly .     good business sense .      he leaned across the desk again .      seems to me     he said     that you could do with some of that around here .         so it appears     said silverfish weakly .      and with the money     said dibbler  his voice a crowbar inserted in the cracks in reality     you could really get on with perfecting your art .      silverfish brightened a bit .     that   s true     he said .     for example  some way of getting sound on        dibbler wasn   t listening .  he pointed to a stack of boards leaning against the wall .      what are those .     he said .      ah     said silverfish .     that was my idea .  we thought it would be  er  good business sense     he savored the words as if they were some rare new sweet     to tell people about the other moving pictures we were making .      dibbler picked up one of the boards and held it critically at arm   s length .   it said       nexte weke wee will be shewing  pelias and melisande   a romantick tragedie in two reels .   thank you .          oh     he said  flatly .      isn   t that all right .     said silverfish  now thoroughly beaten .     i mean  it tells them everything they should know  doesn   t it .         may i .     said dibbler  taking a piece of chalk from silverfish   s desk .  he scribbled intently on the back of the card for a while  and then turned it around .   now it read       goddes and men saide it was notte to bee   but they would notte listen .   pelias and melisande  a storie of forbiden love .   a searing sarger of passion that bridged spaes and tyme .   thys wille shok you .   with a       elephants .       victor and silverfish read it carefully  as one reads a dinner menu in an alien language .  this was an alien language  and to make it worse it was also their own .      well  well     said silverfish .     my word   i don   t know if there was anything actually forbidden .  er .  it was just very historical .  i thought it would help  you know  children and so on .  learn about history .  they never actually met  you know  which was what was so tragic .  it was all very  er  sad .     he stared at the card .     though i must say  you   ve certainly got something there .  er .     he looked uncomfortable about something .     i don   t actually remember any elephants     he said  as if it was his own fault .     i was there the whole afternoon we made it  and i don   t recall a thousand elephants at any point .  i   m sure i would have noticed .      dibbler stared .  he didn   t know where they were coming from  but now he was putting his mind to it he was getting some very clear ideas about what you needed to put in movies .  a thousand elephants was a good start .      no elephants .     he said .      i don   t think so .         well  are there any dancing girls .         um  no .         well  are there any wild chases and people hanging by their fingertips from the edge of a cliff .      silverfish brightened up slightly .     i think there   s a balcony at one point     he said .      yes .  does anyone hang on it by their fingertips .         i don   t think so     said silverfish .     i believe melisande leans over it .         yes  but will the audience hold their breath in case she falls off .         i hope they   d be watching pelias    speech     said silverfish testily .     we had to put it on five cards .  in small writing .      dibbler sighed .      i think i know what people want     he said     and they don   t want to read lots of small writing .  they want spectacles .         because of the small writing .     said victor  sarcastically .      they want dancing girls .  they want thrills .  they want elephants .  they want people falling off roofs .  they want dreams .  the world is full of little people with big dreams .         what  you mean like dwarfs and gnomes and so on .     said victor .      no .         tell me  mr .  dibbler     said silverfish     what exactly is your profession .         i sell merchandise     said dibbler .      mostly sausages     victor volunteered .      and merchandise     said dibbler  sharply .     i only sells sausages when the merchandising trade is a bit slow .         and the sale of sausages leads you to believe you can make better moving pictures .     said silverfish .     anyone can sell sausages .  isn   t that so  victor .         well       said victor  reluctantly .  no one except dibbler could possibly sell dibbler   s sausages .      there you are  then     said silverfish .      the thing is     said victor     that mr .  dibbler can even sell sausages to people that have bought them off him before .         that   s right .     said dibbler .  he beamed at victor .      and a man who could sell mr .  dibbler   s sausages twice could sell anything     said victor .       the next morning was bright and clear  like all holy wood days  and they made a start on the interestinge and curious adventures of cohen the barbarian .  dibbler had worked on it all evening  he said .   the title  however  was silverfish   s .  although dibbler had assured him that cohen the barbarian was practically historical and certainly educational  silverfish had held out against valley of blud .   victor was handed what looked like a leather purse but which turned out to be his costume .  he changed behind a couple of rocks .   he was also given a large  blunt sword .      now     said dibbler  who was sitting in a canvas chair     what you do is  you fight the trolls  rush up and untie the girl from the stake  fight the other trolls  and then run off behind that other rock over there .  that   s the way i see it .  what do you say  tommy .         well  i       silverfish began .      that   s great     said dibbler .     ok .  yes  victor .         you mentioned trolls .  what trolls .     said victor .   the two rocks unfolded themselves .      don   t you worry about a fing  mister     said the nearest one .     me and ole galena over there have got this down pat .         trolls .     said victor  backing away .      that   s right     said galena .  he flourished a club with a nail in it .      but  but     victor began .      yeah .     said the other troll .   what victor would like to have said was  but you   re trolls  fierce animated rocks that live in the mountains and bash travelers with huge clubs very similar to the ones you   re holding now  and i thought when they said trolls they meant ordinary men dressed up in  oh  i don   t know  sacking painted gray or something .      oh  good     he said weakly .     er .         and don   t you go listening to them stories about us eatin    people     said galena .     that   s a slander  that is .  i mean  we   re made of rock  what   d we want to eat people           swaller     said the other troll .     you mean swaller .         yeah .  what   s we want to swaller people for .  we always spit out the bits .  and anyway we   re retired from all that now     he added quickly .     not that we ever did it .     he nudged victor in a friendly fashion  nearly breaking one of his ribs .      it   s good here     he said conspiratorially .     we get three dollars a day plus a dollar barrier cream allowance for daylight working .         on account of turning to stone until nightfall otherwise  what is a pain     said his companion .      yeah  an    it holds up shooting and people strike matches on you .         plus our contract says we get five pence extra for use of own club     said the other troll .      if we could just get started       silverfish began .      why   s there only two trolls .     complained dibbler .     what   s heroic about fighting two trolls .  i asked for twenty  didn   t i .         two   s fine by me     victor called out .      listen  mr .  dibbler     said silverfish     i know you   re trying to help  but the basic economics        silverfish and dibbler started to argue .  gaffer the handleman sighed and took the back off the moving picture box to feed and water the demons  who were complaining .   victor leaned on his sword .      do a lot of this sort of thing  do you .     he said to the trolls .      yeah     said galena .     all the time .  like  in a king   s ransom  i play a troll who rushed out an    hit people .  an    in the dark forest  i play a troll who rushed out an    hit people .  an     an     in mystery mountain i play a troll who rushed out  an    jumped up an    down on people .  it doesn   t pay to get type cast .         and do you do the same thing .     said victor  to the other troll .      oh  morraine   s a character actor  ain   t you .     said galena .     best in the business .         what does he play .         rocks .      victor stared .      on account of his craggy features     galena went on .      not just rocks .  you should see him do an ancient monolith .  you   d be amazed .  go on  morry  show    im yer inscription .         nah     said morraine  grinning sheepishly .      i   m thinking of changing my name for movin    pictures     galena went on .     somethin    with a bit o    class .  i thought    flint .        he gave victor a worried look  insofar as victor was any judge of the range of expressions available to a face that looked as though it had been kicked out of granite with a pair of steel toed boots .     what you fink .     he said .      er .  very nice .         more dynamic  i fought     said the prospective flint .   victor heard himself say     or rock .  rock   s a nice name .      the troll stared at him  its lips moving soundlessly as it tried out the alias .      cor     he said .     never fought of that .  rock .  i like that .  i reckon i   d be due more   n three dollars a day  with a name like rock .         can we make a start .     said dibbler sternly .     maybe we   ll be able to afford more trolls if this is a successful click  but it won   t be if we go over budget  which means we ought to wrap it up by lunchtime .  now  morry and galena           rock     corrected rock .      really .  anyway  you two rush out and attack victor  ok .  right   turn it        the handleman turned the handle of the picture box .  there was a faint clicking noise and a chorus of small yelps from the demons .  victor stood looking helpful and alert .      that means you start     said silverfish patiently .     the trolls rush out from behind the rocks  and you valiantly defend yourself .         but i don   t know how to fight trolls .     victor wailed .      tell you what     said the newly christened rock .     you parry first  and we   ll sort of arrange not to hit you .      light dawned .      you mean it   s all pretending .     said victor .   the trolls exchanged a brief glance  which nevertheless contrived to say  amazing  isn   t it  that things like this apparently rule the world .      yeah     said rock .     that   s it .  nuffin   s real .         we ain   t allowed to kill you     said morraine reassuringly .      that   s right     said rock .     we wouldn   t go round killin    you .         they stops our money if we does things like that     said morraine  morosely .       outside the fault in reality they clustered  peering in with something approaching eyes at the light and warmth .  there was a crowd of them by now .   there had been a way through  once .  to say that they remembered it would be wrong  because they had nothing as sophisticated as memory .  they barely had anything as sophisticated as heads .  but they did have instincts and emotions .   they needed a way in .   they found it .       it worked quite well  the sixth time .  the main problem was the trolls    enthusiasm for hitting each other  the ground  the air and  quite often  themselves .  in the end  victor just concentrated on trying to hit the clubs as they whirred past him .   dibbler seemed quite happy with this .  gaffer wasn   t .      they moved around too much     he said .     they were out of the picture half the time .         it was a battle     said silverfish .      yeah  but i can   t move the picture box around     said the handleman .     the imps fall over .         couldn   t you strap them in or something .     said dibbler .   gaffer scratched his chin .     i suppose i could nail their feet to the floor     he said .      anyway  it   ll do for now     said silverfish .     we   ll do the scene where you rescue the girl .  where   s the girl .  i distinctly instructed her to be here .  why isn   t she here .  why doesn   t anyone ever do what i tell them .      the handleman took his cigarette stub out of his mouth .      she   s filmin    a bolde adventurer over the other side of the hill     he volunteered .      but that ought to have been finished yesterday .     wailed silverfish .      film exploded     said the handleman .      blast .  well  i suppose we can do the next fight .  she doesn   t have to be in it     said silverfish grumpily .     all right  everybody .  we   ll do the bit where victor fights the dreaded balgrog .         what   s a balgrog .     said victor .   a friendly but heavy hand tapped him on the shoulder .      it   s a traditional evil monster what is basically morry painted green with wings stuck on     said rock .     i   ll jus    go an    help him with the paintin    .      he lumbered off .   no one seemed to want victor at the moment .   he stuck the ridiculous sword into the sand  wandered away and found a bit of shade under some scrubby olive trees .  there were rocks here .  he tapped them gently .  they didn   t appear to be anyone .   the ground formed a cool little hollow that was almost pleasant by the seared standards of holy wood hill .   there was even a draft blowing from somewhere .  as he leaned back against the stones he felt a cool breeze coming from them .  must be full of caves under here  he thought .      far away in unseen university  in a drafty  many pillar   d corridor  a little device that no one had paid much attention to for years started to make a noise     so this was holy wood .  it hadn   t looked like this on the silver screen .  it seemed that moving pictures involved a lot of waiting around and  if he was hearing things right  a mixing up of time .  things happened before the things they happened after .  the monsters were just morry painted green with wings stuck on .  nothing was really real .   funnily enough  that was exciting .      i   ve just about had enough of this     said a voice beside him .   he looked up .  a girl had come down the other path .  her face was red with exertion under the pale make up  her hair hung over her eyes in ridiculous ringlets  and she wore a dress which  while clearly made for her size  was designed for someone who was ten years younger and keen on lace edging .   she was quite attractive  although this fact was not immediately apparent .      and you know what they say when you complain .     she demanded .  this was not really addressed to victor .  he was just a convenient pair of ears .      i can   t imagine     said victor politely .      they say     there   s plenty of other people out there just waiting for a chance to get into moving pictures .     that   s what they say .      she leaned against a gnarled tree and fanned herself with her straw hat .     and it   s too hot     she complained .     and now i   ve got to do a ridiculous one reeler for silverfish  who hasn   t got the faintest idea .  and some kid probably with bad breath and hay in his hair and a forehead you could lay a table on .         and trolls     said victor mildly .      oh gods .  not morry and galena .         yes .  only galena   s calling himself rock now .         i thought it was going to be flint .         he likes rock .      from behind the rocks came the plaintive bleat of silverfish wondering where everyone had got to just when he needed them .  the girl rolled her eyes .      oh gods .  for this i   m missing lunch .         you could always eat it off my forehead     said victor  standing up .   he had the satisfaction of feeling her thoughtful gaze on the back of his neck as he retrieved his sword and gave it a few experimental swishes  with rather more force than was necessary .      you   re the boy in the street  aren   t you .     she said .      that   s right .  you   re the girl who was going to be shot     said victor .     i see they missed .      she looked at him curiously .     how did you get a job so quickly .  most people have to wait weeks for a chance .         chances are where you find them  i   ve always said     said victor .      but how        victor had already strolled away with gleeful nonchalance .  she trailed after him  her face locked in a petulant pout .      ah     said silverfish sarcastically  looking up .     my word .  everyone where they should be .  very well .  we   ll go from the bit where he finds her tied to the stake .  what you do     he said to victor     is untie her  then drag her off and fight the balgrog  and you     he pointed to the girl     you  you  you just follow him and look as  as rescued as you possibly can  ok .         i   m good at that     she said  resignedly .      no  no  no     said dibbler  putting his head in his hands .      not that again .         isn   t that what you wanted .     said silverfish .     fights and rescues .         there   s got to be more to it than that .     said dibbler .      like what .     silverfish demanded .      oh  i don   t know .  razzmatazz .  oomph .  the old zonkaroonie .         funny noises .  we haven   t got sound .         everyone makes clicks about people running around and fighting and falling over     said dibbler .     there should be something more .  i   ve been looking at the things you make here  and they all look the same to me .         well  all sausages look the same to me     snapped silverfish .      they   re meant to .  that   s what people expect .         and i   m giving them what they expect  too     said silverfish .     people like to see more of what they expect .  fights and chases  that sort of thing              scuse me  mister silverfish     said the handleman  above the angry chattering of the demons .      yes .     snapped dibbler .         scuse me  mister dibbler  but i got to feed    em ina quarter of a hour .      dibbler groaned .   in retrospect  victor was always a little unclear about those next few minutes .  that   s the way it goes .  the moments that change your life are the ones that happen suddenly  like the one where you die .   there had been another stylized battle  he knew that much  with morry and what would have been a fearsome whip if the troll hadn   t kept tangling it around his own legs .  and  when the dreadful balgrog had been beaten and had slid out of shot mugging terribly and trying to hold its wings on with one hand  he   d turned and cut the ropes holding the girl to the stake and should have dragged her sharply to the right when        the whispering started .   there were no words but there was something that was the heart of words  that went straight through his ears and down his spinal column without bothering to make a stopover in his brain .   he stared into the girl   s eyes and wondered if she was hearing it too .   a long way off  there were words .  there was silverfish saying     come on  get on with it  what are you looking at her like that for .     and the handleman saying     they gets really fractious if they misses a meal     and dibbler saying  in a voice hissing like a thrown knife     don   t stop turning the handle .      the edges of his vision went cloudy  and there were shapes in the cloud that changed and faded before he had a chance to examine them .  helpless as a fly in an amber flow  as much in control of his destiny as a soap bubble in a hurricane  he leaned down and kissed her .   there were more words beyond the ringing in his ears .      why   s he doing that .  did i tell him to do that .  no one told him to do that .            and then i have to muck    em out afterward  and let me tell you  it   s no           turn that handle .  turn that handle .     screamed dibbler .      now why   s he looking like that .         cor .         if you stop turning that handle you   ll never work in this town again .         listen  mister  i happen to belong to the handlemen   s guild           don   t stop .  don   t stop .      victor surfaced .  the whispering faded  to be replaced by the distant boom of the breakers .  the real world was back  hot and sharp  the sun pinned to the sky like a medal awarded for being a great day .   the girl took a deep breath .      i   m  gosh  i   m terribly sorry     babbled victor  backing away .     i really don   t know what happened        dibbler jumped up and down .      that   s it  that   s it .     he yelled .     how soon can you have it ready .         well  like i said  i got to feed the imps and muck    em out           right  right   it   ll give me time to get some posters drawn     said dibbler .      i   ve already had some done     said silverfish coldly .      i bet you have  i bet you have     said dibbler  excitedly .     i bet you have .  i bet they say things like    you mighte like to see a quite interestinge moving picture    .         what   s wrong with it .     silverfish demanded .     it   s a bloody sight better than hot sausage .         i told you  when you sell sausages you don   t just hang around waiting for people to want sausage  you go out there and make them hungry .  and you put mustard on    em .  and that   s what your lad there has done .      he clapped one hand on silverfish   s shoulder  and waved the other expansively .      can   t you see it .     he said .  he hesitated .  strange ideas were pouring into his head faster than he could think them .  he felt dizzy with excitement and possibilities .      sword of passione     he said .     that   s what we   ll call it .  not name it after some daft old bugger who   s probably not even alive anymore .  sword of passione .  yeah .  a tumultuous saga of   of desire an    raw  raw  raw wossname in the primal heat of a tortured continent .  romance .  glamour .  in three searing reels .  thrill to the death fight with ravening monsters .  scream as a thousand elephants           it   s only one reel     muttered silverfish testily .      shoot some more this afternoon .     crowed dibbler  his eyes revolving .     you just need more fights and monsters .         and there   s certainly no elephants     snapped silverfish .   rock put up a craggy arm .      yes .     demanded silverfish .      if you   ve got some gray paint an    stuff to make the ears out of  i   m sure me an    morry could           no one   s ever done a three reeler     said gaffer reflectively .     could be really tricky .  i mean  it   d be nearly ten minutes long .     he looked thoughtful .     i suppose if i was to make the spools bigger        silverfish knew he was cornered .      now look here     he began .   victor stared down at the girl .  everyone else was ignoring them .      er     he said     i don   t think we   ve been formally introduced .         you didn   t seem to let that stop you     she said .      i wouldn   t normally do something like that .  i must have been   ill .  or something .         oh  good .  and that makes me feel a lot better  does it .         shall we sit in the shade .  it   s very hot out here .         your eyes went all   smouldery .         did they .         they looked really odd .         i felt really odd .         i know .  it   s this place .  it gets to you .  d   you know     she said  sitting down on the sand     there   s all kind of rules for the imps and things  they mustn   t be worn out  what kind of food they get  stuff like that .  no one cares about us  though .  even the trolls get better treatment .         it   s the way they go around being seven foot tall and weighing       pounds all the time  i expect     said victor .      my name   s theda withel  but my friends call me ginger     she said .      my name   s victor tugelbend .  er .  but my friends call me victor     said victor .      this is your first click  is it .         how can you tell .         you looked as though you were enjoying it .         well  it   s better than working  isn   t it .         you wait until you   ve been in it as long as i have     she said bitterly .      how long   s that .         nearly since the start .  five weeks .         gosh .  it   s all happened so fast .         it   s the best thing that   s ever happened     said ginger flatly .      i suppose so   er  are we allowed to go and eat .     said victor .      no .  they   ll be shouting for us again any minute     said ginger .   victor nodded .  he had  on the whole  got through life quite happily by doing what he pleased in a firm yet easygoing sort of way  and he didn   t see why he should stop that even in holy wood .      then they   ll have to shout     he said .     i want something to eat and a cool drink .  maybe i   ve just caught a bit too much sun .      ginger looked uncertain .     well  there   s the commissary  but           good .  you can show me the way .         they fire people just like that           what  before the third reel .         they say    there   s plenty more people who   re dying to break into moving pictures     you see           good .  that means they   ll have all afternoon to find two of them who look just like us .     he strolled past morry  who was also trying to keep in the shade of a rock .      if anyone wants us     he said     we   ll be having some lunch .         what  right now .     said the troll .      yes     said victor firmly  and strode on .   behind him he could see dibbler and silverfish locked in heated discussion  with occasional interruptions from the handleman  who spoke in the leisurely tones of one who knows he   s going to get paid six dollars today regardless .         we   ll call it an epic .  people will talk about it for ages .         yes  they   ll say we went bankrupt .         look  i know where i can get some colored woodcuts done at practically cost              i was finking  maybe if i got some string and tied the moving picture box onto wheels  so it can be moved around           people   ll say  that silverfish  there   s a moving picture smith with the guts to give the people what they want  they   ll say .  a man to roll back the wossname of the medium              maybe if i was to make a sort of pole and swivel arrangement  we could bring the picture box right up close to           what .  you think they   ll say that .         trust me  tommy .         well   all right .  all right .  but no elephants .  i want to make that absolutely clear .  no elephants .             looks weird to me     said the archchancellor .     looks like a bunch of pottery elephants .  thought you said it was a machine .         more   more of a device     said the bursar uncertainly .  he gave it a prod .  several of the pottery elephants wobbled .      riktor the tinkerer built it  i think .  it was before my time .      it looked like a large  ornate pot  almost as high as a man of large pot height .  around its rim eight pottery elephants hung from little bronze chains  one of them swung backward and forward at the bursar   s touch .   the archchancellor peered down inside .      it   s all levers and bellows     he said  distastefully .   the bursar turned to the university housekeeper .      well  now  mrs .  whitlow     he said     what exactly happened .      mrs .  whitlow  huge  pink and becorseted  patted her ginger wig and nudged the tiny maid who was hovering beside her like a tugboat .      tell his lordship  ksandra     she ordered .   ksandra looked as though she was regretting the whole thing .      well  sir  please  sir  i was dusting  you see           she hwas dusting     said mrs .  whitlow  helpfully .  when mrs .  whitlow was in the grip of acute class consciousness she could create aitches where nature never intended them to be .         and then it started me   king a noise           hit made hay hnoise     said mrs .  whitlow .     so she come and told me  your lordship  h   as hper my instructions .         what kind of noise  ksandra .     said the bursar  as kindly as he could .      please  sir  sort of       she screwed up her eyes         whumm   whumm   whumm   whumm   whummwhummwhumm whummwhumm   plib     sir .         plib     said the bursar  solemnly .      yes  sir .         hplib     echoed mrs .  whitlow .      that was when it spat at me  sir     said ksandra .      hexpectorated     corrected mrs .  whitlow .      apparently one of the elephants spat out a little lead pellet  master     said the bursar .     that was the  er  the    plib .            did it  bigods     said the archchancellor .     can   t have pots going around gobbin    all over people .      mrs .  whitlow twitched .      what   d it go and do that for .     ridcully added .      i really couldn   t say  master .  i thought perhaps you   d know .  i believe riktor was a lecturer here when you were a student .  mrs .  whitlow is very concerned     he added  in tones that made it clear that when mrs .  whitlow was concerned about something it would be an unwise archchancellor who ignored her     about staff being magically interfered with .      the archchancellor tapped the pot with his knuckles .     what  old    numbers    riktor .  same fella .         apparently  archchancellor .         total madman .  thought you could measure everythin    .  not just lengths and weights and that kind of stuff  but everythin    .     if it exists     he said     you ought to be able to measure it .        ridcully   s eyes misted with memory .     made all kinds of weird widgets .  reckoned you could measure truth and beauty and dreams and stuff .  so this is one of old riktor   s toys  is it .  wonder what it measured .         ay think     said mrs .  whitlow     that it should be put haway somewhere out of    arm   s way  if it   s hall the hsame to you .         yes  yes  yes  of course     said the bursar hurriedly .  staff were hard to keep at unseen university .      get rid of it     said the archchancellor .   the bursar was horrified .     oh  no  sir     he said .     we never throw things out .  besides  it is probably quite valuable .         hmm     said ridcully .     valuable .         possibly an important historical artifact  master .         shove it in my study  then .  i said the place needs bright   nin    up .  it   ll be one of them conversation pieces  right .  got to go now .  got to see a man about trainin    a gryphon .  good day  ladies           er  archchancellor  i wonder if you could just sign       the bursar began  but to a closing door .   no one asked ksandra which of the pottery elephants had spat the ball  and the direction wouldn   t have meant anything to them anyway .   that afternoon a couple of porters moved the universe   s only working resograph  into the archchancellor   s study .       no one had found a way to add sound to moving pictures  but there was a sound that was particularly associated with holy wood .  it was the sound of nails being hammered .   holy wood had gone critical .  new houses  new streets  new neighborhoods  appeared overnight .  and  in those areas where the hastily educated alchemical apprentices were not yet fully alongside the trickier stages of making octo cellulose  disappeared even faster .  not that it made a lot of difference .  barely would the smoke have cleared before someone was hammering again .   and holy wood grew by fission .  all you needed was a steady handed  non smoking lad who could read alchemical signs  a handleman  a sackful of demons and lots of sunshine .  oh  and some people .  but there were plenty of those .  if you couldn   t breed demons or mix chemicals or turn a handle rhythmically  you could always hold horses or wait on tables and look interesting while you hoped .  or  if all else failed  hammer nails .  building after rickety building skirted the ancient hill  their thin planks already curling and bleaching in the pitiless sun  but there was already a pressing need for more .   because holy wood was calling .  more people arrived every day .  they didn   t come to be ostlers  or tavern wenches  or short order carpenters .  they came to make movies .   and they didn   t know why .   as cut me own throat dibbler knew in his heart  wherever two or more people are gathered together  someone will be trying to sell them a suspicious sausage in a bun .   now that dibbler was in fact engaged elsewhere  others had arisen to fulfil that function .   one such was nodar borgle the klatchian  whose huge echoing shed wasn   t so much a restaurant as a feeding factory .  great steaming tureens occupied one end .  the rest of it was tables  and around the tables were     victor was astonished .      there were trolls  humans and dwarfs .  and a few gnomes .  and perhaps even a few elves  the most elusive of discworld races .  and lots of other things  which victor had to hope were trolls dressed up  because if they weren   t  everyone was going to be in a lot of trouble .  and they were all eating  and the amazing thing was that they were not eating one another .      you take a plate and you queue up and then you pay for it     said ginger .     it   s called self serf .         you pay for it before you eat it .  what happens if it   s dreadful .      ginger nodded grimly .     that   s why .      victor shrugged  and leaned down to the dwarf behind the lunch counter .     i   d like           it   s stoo     said the dwarf .      what kind of stew .         there ain   t more   n one kind .  that   s why it   s stoo     the dwarf snapped .     stoo   s stoo .         what i meant was  what   s in it .     said victor .      if you need to ask  you   re not hungry enough     said ginger .     two stews  fruntkin .      victor stared at the gray brown stuff that was dribbled onto his plate .  strange lumps  carried to the surface by mysterious convection currents  bobbed for a moment  and then sank back down  hopefully forever .   borgle belonged to the dibbler school of cuisine .      it   s stoo or nuffin  boy .     the cook leered .     half a dollar .  cheap at half the price .      victor handed over the money with reluctance  and looked around for ginger .      over here     said ginger  sitting down at one of the long tables .     hi  thunderfoot .  hi  breccia  how   s it goin    .  this is vic .  new boy .  hi  sniddin  didn   t see you there .      victor found himself wedged between ginger and a mountain troll in what looked like chain mail  but it turned out to be just holy wood chain mail  which was inexpertly knitted string painted silver .   ginger started talking animatedly to a four inch high gnome and a dwarf in one half of a bear outfit  leaving victor feeling a little isolated .   the troll nodded at him  and then grimaced at its plate .      dey call dis pumice     he said .     dey never even bother to cut der lava off .  and you can   t even taste der sand .      victor stared at the troll   s plate .      i didn   t know trolls ate rock     he said  before he could stop himself .      why not .         aren   t you made of it .         yeah .  but you   re made a meat  an    what do you eat .      victor looked at his own plate .     good question     he said .      vic   s doing a click for silverfish     said ginger  turning around .     it looks like they   re going to make it a three reeler .      there was a general murmur of interest .   victor carefully laid something yellow and wobbly on the side of his plate .      tell me     he said thoughtfully     while you   ve been filming  have any of you had a   heard a sort of   felt that you were       he hesitated .  they were all looking at him .     i mean  did you ever feel something was acting through you .  i can   t think of any other way to put it .      his fellow diners relaxed .      dat   s just holy wood     said the troll .     it gets to you .  it   s all dis creativity sloshin    about .         that was a pretty bad attack you had  though     said ginger .      happens all the time     said the dwarf reflectively .     it   s just holy wood .  last week  me and the lads were working on tales of the dwarfes and suddenly we all started singing .  just like that .  just like this song came into our heads  all at once .  what d   you think of that .         what song .     said ginger .      search me .  we just call it the    hiho    song .  that   s all it was .  hihohiho .  hihohiho .         sound like every other dwarf song i ever did hear     rumbled the troll .       it was past two o   clock when they got back to the moving picture making place .  the handleman had the back off the picture box and was scraping at its floor with a small shovel .   dibbler was asleep in his canvas chair with a handkerchief over his face .  but silverfish was wide awake .      where have you two been .     he shouted .      i was hungry     said victor .      and you   ll jolly well stay hungry  my lad  because        dibbler lifted the corner of his handkerchief .      let   s get started     he muttered .      but we can   t have performers telling us           finish the click  and then sack him     said dibbler .      right .     silverfish waved a threatening finger at victor and ginger .     you   ll never work in this town again .      they got through the afternoon somehow .  dibbler made them bring a horse in  and cursed the handleman because the picture box still couldn   t be moved around .  the demons complained .  so they put the horse head on in front of the box and victor bounced up and down in the saddle .  as dibbler said  it was good enough for moving pictures .   afterward  silverfish very grudgingly paid them two dollars each and dismissed them .      he   ll tell all the other alchemists     said ginger dispiritedly .     they stick together like glue .         i notice we only get two dollars a day but the trolls get three     said victor .     why   s that .         because there aren   t so many trolls wanting to make moving pictures     said ginger .     and a good handleman can get six or seven dollars a day .  performers aren   t important .     she turned and glared at him .      i was doing ok     she said .     nothing special  but ok .  i was getting quite a lot of work .  people thought i was reliable .  i was building a career           you can   t build a career on holy wood     said victor .      that   s like building a house on a swamp .  nothing   s real .         i liked it .  and now you   ve spoilt it all .  and i   ll probably have to go back to a horrible little village you   ve probably never even heard of .  back to bloody milkmaiding .  thanks very much .  every time i see a cow   s arse  i   ll think of you .      she stormed off in the direction of the town leaving victor with the trolls .  after a while rock cleared his throat .      you got anywhere to stay .     he said .      i don   t think so     said victor  weakly .      there   s never enough places to stay     said morry .      i thought i might sleep on the beach     said victor .     it   s warm enough  after all .  i think i really could do with a good rest .  good night .      he tottered off in that direction .   the sun was setting  and a wind off the sea had cooled things a little .  around the darkening bulk of the hill the lights of holy wood were being lit .  holy wood only relaxed in the darkness .  when your raw material is daylight  you don   t waste it .   it was pleasant enough on the beach .  no one much went there .  the driftwood  cracked and salt crusted  was no good for building .  it was stacked in a long white row on the tide line .   victor pulled together enough to make a fire  and lay back and watched the surf .   from the top of the next dune  hidden behind a dry clump of grass  gaspode the wonder dog watched him thoughtfully .       it was two hours after midnight .   it had them now  and poured joyfully out of the hill  poured its glitter into the world .   holy wood dreams     it dreams for everyone .   in the hot breathless darkness of a clapboard shack  ginger withel dreamed of red carpets and cheering crowds .  and a grating .  she kept coming back to a grating  in the dream  where a rush of warm air blew up her skirts     in the not much cooler darkness of a marginally more expensive shack  silverfish the moving picturesmith dreamed of cheering crowds  and someone giving him a prize for the best moving picture ever made .  it was a great big statue .   out in the sand dunes rock and morry dozed fitfully  because trolls are night creatures by nature and sleeping in darkness bruised the instincts of eons .  they dreamed of mountains .   down on the beach  under the stars  victor dreamed of pounding hooves  flowing robes  pirate ships  sword fights  chandeliers     on the next dune  gaspode the wonder dog slept with one eye open and dreamed of wolves .   but cut me own throat dibbler was not dreaming  because he was not asleep .   it had been a long ride to ankh morpork and he preferred selling horses to riding them  but he was there now .   the storms that so carefully avoided holy wood didn   t worry about ankh morpork  and it was pouring with rain .  that didn   t stop the city   s night life  though   it just made it damper .   there was nothing you couldn   t buy in ankh morpork  even in the middle of the night .  dibbler had a lot of things to buy .  he needed posters painted .  he needed all sorts of things .  many of them involved ideas he   d had to invent in his head on the long ride  and now had to explain very carefully to other people .  and he had to explain it fast .   the rain was a solid curtain when he finally staggered out into the gray light of dawn .  the gutters overflowed .  along the rooftops  repulsive gargoyles threw up expertly over passers by although  since it was now five a . m .   the crowds had thinned out a bit .   throat took a deep breath of the thick city air .  real air .  you would have to go a long way to find air that was realer than ankh morpork air .  you could tell just by breathing it that other people had been doing the same thing for thousands of years .   for the first time in days he felt that he was thinking clearly .  that was the strange thing about holy wood .  when you were there it all seemed natural  it all seemed just what life was all about  but when you got away from it and looked back  it was like looking at a brilliant soap bubble .  it was as though  when you were in holy wood  you weren   t quite the same person .   well  holy wood was holy wood  and ankh was ankh  and ankh was solid and proof  in throat   s opinion  against any holy wood weirdness .   he splashed through the puddles  listening to the rain .   after a while he noticed  for the first time in his life  that it had a rhythm .   funny .  you could live in a city all your life  and you had to go away and come back again before you noticed the way the rain dripping off the gutters had a rhythm all its own  dumdi dum dum  dumdi dumdi dum dum     a few minutes later sergeant colon and corporal nobbs of the night watch were sharing a friendly roll up in the shelter of a doorway and doing what the night watch was best at  which was keeping warm and dry and staying out of trouble .   they were the only witnesses to the manic figure which splashed down the dripping street  pirouetted through the puddles  grabbed a drainpipe to swing around the corner and  clicking its heels together merrily  disappeared from view .   sgt .  colon handed the soggy dog end back to his companion .      was that old throat dibbler .     he said after a while .      yeah     said nobby .      he looked happy  didn   t he .         must be off    is nut  if you ask me     said nobby .     singing in the rain like that .          whumm   whumm     the archchancellor  who had been updating his dragon stud book and enjoying a late night drink in front of the fire  looked up .      whumm   whumm   whumm        bigods .     he muttered  and wandered over to the big pot .  it was actually wobbling from side to side  as if the building was shaking .   the archchancellor watched  fascinated .      whumm   whummwhummwhummwhumm .   it wobbled to a standstill  and went silent .      odd     said the archchancellor .     damned odd .      plib .   on the other side of the room  his brandy decanter shattered .   ridcully the brown took a deep breath .      bursaar .          victor was woken up by sandflies .  the air was already warm .  it was going to be another fine day .   he waded out into the shallows to wash and clear his head .   let   s see   he still had his two dollars from yesterday  plus a handful of pennies .  he could afford to stay a while  especially if he slept on the beach .  and borgle   s stoo  while only food in the technical sense  was cheap enough   although  come to think of it  eating there might involve embarrassing encounters with ginger .   he took another step  and sank .   victor hadn   t swum in the sea before .  he surfaced  half drowned  treading water furiously .  the beach was only a few yards away .   he relaxed  gave himself time to get his breath back  and swam a leisurely crawl out beyond the breakers .  the water was crystal clear .  he could see the bottom shelving away sharply to   he surfaced for a quick breath   a dim blueness in which it was just possible  through the teeming shoals of fish  to see the outline of pale  rectangular rocks scattered on the sand .   he tried a dive  fighting his way down until his ears clanged .  the largest lobster he had ever seen waved its feelers at him from a rocky spire and snapped away into the depths .   victor bobbed up again  gasping  and struck out for the shore .   well  if you couldn   t make it in moving pictures there was an opening here for a fisherman  that was certain .   a beachcomber would do all right  as well .  there was enough wind dried firewood piled up on the edge of the dunes to keep ankh morpork   s fires supplied for years .  no one in holy wood would dream of lighting a fire except for cooking or company .   and someone had been doing just that .  as he waded ashore victor realized that the wood further along the beach had been stacked not haphazardly but apparently by design  in neat piles .  further along  stones had been stacked into a crude fireplace .   it was clogged with sand .  maybe someone else had been living on the beach  waiting for their big chance in moving pictures .  come to think of it  the timber behind the half buried stones had a dragged together look .  you could imagine  looking at it from the sea  that several balks of timber had been set up to form an arched doorway .   perhaps they were still there .  perhaps they might have something to drink .   they were  indeed  still there .  but they hadn   t needed a drink for months .       it was eight in the morning .  a thunderous knocking awoke bezam planter  owner of the odium  one of ankh morpork   s mushrooming crop of moving picture pits .   he   d had a bad night .  the people of ankh morpork liked novelty .  the trouble was that they didn   t like novelty for long .  the odium had done great business for a week  had broken even for the next week  and was now dying .  the late showing last night had been patronized by one deaf dwarf and an orangutan  who   d brought along its own peanuts .  bezam relied on the sale of peanuts and banged grains for his profit  and wasn   t in a good mood .   he opened the door and stared out blearily .      we   re shut    til two o   clock     he said .     mat   nee .  come back then .  seats in all parts .      he slammed the door .  it rebounded off throat dibbler   s boot and hit bezam on the nose .      i   ve come about the special showing of sword of passione     said throat .      special showing .  what special showing .         the special showing i   m about to tell you about     said throat .      we ain   t showing nothin    about any special passionate swords .  we   re showin    the exciting           mister dibbler says yore showing sword of passione     rumbled a voice .   throat leaned against the doorway .  behind him was a slab of rock .  it looked as though someone had been throwing steel balls at it for thirty years .   it creased in the middle and leaned down toward bezam .   he recognized detritus .  everyone recognized detritus .  he wasn   t a troll you forgot .      but i haven   t even heard of       bezam began .   throat pulled a large tin from under his coat  and grinned .      and here are some posters     he added  producing a fat white roll .      mister dibbler let me stick some up on walls     said detritus proudly .   bezam unrolled the poster .  it was in eye watering colors .  it showed a picture of what might just possibly be ginger pouting in a blouse too small for her  and victor in the act of throwing her over one shoulder while fighting an assortment of monsters with the other hand .  in the background  volcanoes were erupting  dragons were zooming through the sky  and cities were burning down .         the motione picture they coud not banne .         read bezam hesitantly .        a scorching adventure in the white hotte dawne of a new continont .  a mann and a womann throne together in the wherlpool of a world gone madde .  .  staring   delores de syn   as the woman and   victor maraschino   as cohen the barbarian .  .  .  thrils .  adventure .  .  elephants .  .  .  cominge soone to a pit nr .  you .  .  .  .         he read it again .      who   s staring delores de syn .     he said  suspiciously .      that   s starring     said throat .     that   s why we   ve put stars against their names  see .     he leaned closer and lowered his voice to a piercing whisper .     they do say     he said     that she   s the daughter of a klatchian pirate and his wild  headstrong captive  and he   s the son of   the son of   a rogue wizard and a reckless gypsy flamenco dancer .         cor .     said bezam  impressed despite himself .  dibbler permitted himself a mental slap on the back .  he   d been quite taken with it himself .      i reckon you should start showing it in about an hour     he said .      at this time in the morning .     said bezam .  the click he had obtained for the day was an exciting study of pottery making  which had been worrying him .  this seemed a much better proposition .      yes     said dibbler .     because a lot of people are going to want to watch it .         i dunno about that     said bezam .     houses have been falling off lately .             they   ll want to watch this one     said throat .     trust me .  have i ever lied to you .      bezam scratched his head .     well  one night last month you sold me a sausage in a bun and you said           i was speaking rhetorically     snapped throat .      yeah     said detritus .   bezam sagged .     oh .  well .  i dunno about rhetorically     he said .      right     said throat  grinning like a predatory pumpkin .      just you open up  and you can sit back and rake in the money .         oh .  good     said bezam weakly .   throat put a friendly arm around the man   s shoulders .      and now     he said     let   s talk about percentages .         what   re percentages .         have a cigar     said throat .       victor walked slowly up holy wood   s nameless main street .  there was packed sand under his fingernails .   he wasn   t sure that he had done the right thing .   probably the man had just been some old beachcomber who   d just gone to sleep one day and hadn   t woken up  although the stained red and gold coat was unusual beach combing wear .  it was hard to tell how long he   d been dead .  the dryness and salt air had been a preservative  they   d preserved him just the way he must have looked when he was alive  which was like someone who was dead .   by the look of his hut  he   d beachcombed some odd stuff .   it had occurred to victor that someone ought to be told  but there was probably no one in holy wood who would be interested .  probably only one person in the world had been interested in whether the old man lived or died  and he   d been the first to know .   victor buried the body in the sand  landward of the driftwood hut .   he saw borgle   s ahead of him .  he   d risk breakfast there  he decided .  besides  he needed somewhere to sit down and read the book .   it wasn   t the sort of thing you expected to find on a beach  in a driftwood hut  clutched in the hand of a dead man .   on the cover were the words the boke of the film .   on the first page  in the neat around hand of someone to whom writing doesn   t come easily  were the further words  this is the chroncal of the keeprs of the paramountain coppied out by me deccan beacuase of the old onne it being fallin apart .   he turned the stiff pages carefully .  they seemed to be crammed with almost identical entries .  they were all undated  but that wasn   t very important  since one day had been pretty much like the other .   gott up .  went to lavatry .  made up fire  announused the matinee performanse .  broke fast .  colected woode .  made up fire .  foraged on the hille .  chanted

gott up at midnigte  went to lavaotry  checked fire  but it was not needful of woode .       he saw the waitress out of the tail of his eye .      i   d like a boiled egg     he said .      it   s stew .  fish stew .      he looked up into ginger   s blazing eyes .      i didn   t know you were a waitress     he said .   she made a show of dusting the salt bowl .     nor did i until yesterday     she said .     lucky for me borgle   s regular morning girl got a chance in the new moving picture that untied alchemists are making  isn   t it .     she shrugged .     if i   m really lucky  who knows .  i might get to do the afternoon shift too .         look  i didn   t mean           it   s stew .  take it or leave it .  three customers this morning have done both .         i   ll take it .  look  you won   t believe it  but i found this book in the hands of           i   m not allowed to dally with customers .  this isn   t the best job in town  but you   re not losing it for me     snapped ginger .     fish stew  right .         oh .  right .  sorry .      he flicked backward through the pages .  before deccan there was tento  who also chanted three times a day and also sometimes received gifts of fish and also went to the lavatory  although either he wasn   t so assiduous about it as deccan or hadn   t thought it always worth writing down .  before that  someone called meggelin had been the chanter .  a whole string of people had lived on the beach  and then if you went back further there was a group of them  and further still the entries had a more official feel .  it was hard to tell .  they seemed to be written in code  line after line of little complex pictures     a bowl of primal soup was plonked down in front of him .      look     he said .     what time do you get off           never     said ginger .      i just wondered if you might know where           no .      victor stared at the murky surface of the broth .  borgle worked on the principle that if you find it in water  it   s a fish .  there was something purple in there and it had at least ten legs .   he ate it anyway .  it was costing him thirty pence .   then  with ginger resolutely busying herself at the counter with her back to him lighthouse fashion  so that however he tried to attract her attention her back was still facing him without her apparently moving  he went to look for another job .   victor had never worked for anything in his life .  in his experience  jobs were things that happened to other people .       bezam planter adjusted the tray around his wife   s neck .      all right     he said .     got everything .         the banged grains have gone soft     she said .     and there   s no way to keep the sausages hot .         it   ll be dark  love .  no one   ll notice .     he tweaked the strap and stood back .      there     he said .     now  you know what to do .  halfway through i   ll stop showing the film and put up the card that says    why not try a cool refreshinge drinke and some banged grains .     and then you come out of the door over there and walk up the aisle .         you might as well mention cool refreshing sausages as well     said mrs .  planter .        and i reckon you should stop using a torch to show people to their seats     said bezam .     you   re starting too many fires .         it   s the only way i can see in the dark     she said .      yes  but i had to let that dwarf have his money back last night .  you know how sensitive they are about their beards .  tell you what  love  i   ll give you a salamander in a cage .  they   ve been on the roof since dawn  they should be nice and ready .      they were .  the creatures lay dozing in the bottom of their cages  their bodies vibrating gently as they absorbed the light .  bezam selected six of the ripest  climbed heavily back down to the projection room  and tipped them into the showing box .  he wound throat dibbler   s film onto a spool  and then peered out into the darkness .   oh  well .  might as well see if there was anyone outside .   he shuffled to the front door  yawning .   he reached up  and slid the bolt .   he reached down  and slid the other bolt .   he pulled open the doors .      all right  all right     he grumbled .     let   s be having you        he woke up in the projection room  with mrs .  planter fanning him desperately with her apron .      what happened .     he whispered  trying to put out of his mind the memories of trampling feet .      it   s a full house .     she said .     and they   re still queueing up outside .  they   re all down the street .  it   s them disgusting posters .      bezam got up unsteadily but with determination .      woman  shut up and get down to the kitchen and bang some more grains .     he shouted .     and then come and help me repaint the signs .  if they   re queueing for the fivepenny seats  they   ll queue for tenpence .      he rolled up his sleeves and grasped the handle .     in the front row the librarian sat with a bag of peanuts in his lap .  after a few minutes he stopped chewing and sat with his mouth open  staring and staring and staring at the flickering images .          hold your horse  sir .  ma   am .         no .      by mid day victor had earned tuppence .  it wasn   t that people didn   t have horses that needed holding  it was just that they didn   t seem to want him to hold them .   eventually a gnarled little man from further along the street sidled up to him  dragging four horses .  victor had been watching him for hours  in frank astonishment that anyone should give the wizened homunculus a kindly smile  let alone a horse .  but he   d been doing a brisk trade  while victor   s broad shoulders  handsome profile and honest  open smile were definitely a drawback in the horse holding business .      you   re new to this  right .     said the little man .      yes     said victor .      ah .  i could tell .  waitin    for yer big break in the clicks  right .     he grinned encouragingly .      no .  i   ve had my big break  in fact     said victor .      why you here then .      victor shrugged .     i broke it .         ah  is that so .  yessir  thank   ee sir  godsblessyousir  rightchewaresir     said the man  accepting another set of reins .      i suppose you don   t need an assistant .     said victor wistfully .       bezam planter stared at the pile of coins in front of him .  throat dibbler moved his hands and it was a smaller pile of coins  but it was still a bigger pile of coins than bezam had ever seen while in a waking state .        and we   re still showing it every quarter of an hour .     breathed bezam .     i   ve had to hire a boy to turn the handle .  i don   t know  what should i do with all this money .      throat patted him on the shoulder .      buy bigger premises     he said .      i   ve been thinking about that     said bezam .     yeah .  something with fancy pillars out in front .  and my daughter calliope plays the organ really nice  it   d make a good accompaniment .  and there should be lots of gold paint and curly bits        his eyes glazed .   it had found another mind .   holy wood dreams .      and make it a palace  like the fabulous rhoxie in klatch  or the richest temple there ever was  with slave girls to sell the banged grains and peanuts  and bezam planter walking about proprietorially in a red velvet jacket with gold string on it        hmm .     he whispered  as the sweat beaded on his forehead .      i said  i   m off     said throat .     got to keep moving in the moving picture business  you know .         mrs .  planter says you   ve got to make more pictures with that young man     said bezam .     the whole city   s talking about him .  she said several ladies swooned when he gave them that smouldery look .  she watched it five times     he added  his voice rimed with sudden suspicion .     and that girl .  wow .         don   t you worry about a thing     said throat loftily .     i   ve got them under contr        sudden doubt drifted across his face .      see you     he said shortly  and scurried out of the building .   bezam stood alone and looked around at the cobwebbed interior of the odium  his overheated imagination peopling its dark corners with potted palms  gold leaf and fat cherubs .  peanut shells and banged grain bags crunched under his feet .  have to get it cleaned up for the next house  he thought .  i expect that monkey   ll be first in the queue again .   then his eye fell on the poster for sword of passione .  amazing  really .  there hadn   t been much in the way of elephants and volcanoes  and the monsters had been trolls with bits stuck on them  but in that close up   well   all the men had sighed  and then all the women had sighed   it was like magic .  he grinned at the images of victor and ginger .   wonder what those two   re doing now .  he thought .  prob   ly eating caviar off of gold plates and lounging around up to their knees in velvet cushions  you bet .          you look up to your knees in it  lad     said the horse holder .      i   m afraid i   m not getting the hang of this horse holding     said victor .      ah     tis a hard trade  horse holding     said the man .     it   s learning the proper grovelin    and the irreverent but not too impudent cheery    oss    older   s banter .  people don   t just want you to look after the    oss  see .  they want a    oss    olding hexperience .         they do .         they want an amusin    encounter and a soup son of repartee     said the little man .     it   s not just a matter of    oldin    reins .      realization began to dawn on victor .      it   s a performance     he said .   the    oss    older tapped the side of his strawberry shaped nose .      that   s right .     he said .       torches flared in holy wood .  victor struggled through the crowds in the main street .  every bar  every tavern  every shop had its doors thrown open .  a sea of people ebbed and flowed between them .  victor tried jumping up and down to search the mob of faces .   he was lonely and lost and hungry .  he needed someone to talk to  and she wasn   t there .      victor .      he spun around .  rock bore down on him like an avalanche .      victor .  my friend .     a fist the size and hardness of a foundation stone pounded him playfully on the shoulder .      oh  hi     said victor weakly .     er .  how   s it going  rock .         great .  great .  tomorrow we shoot bad menace of troll valley .         i   m very happy for you     said victor .      you my lucky human .     rock boomed .     rock .  what a name .  come and have a drink .      victor accepted .  he really didn   t have much of a choice  because rock gripped his arm and  plowing through the crowds like an icebreaker  half led  half dragged him toward the nearest door .   a blue light illuminated a sign .  most morporkians could read troll  it was hardly a difficult language .  the sharp runes spelled out the blue lias .   it was a troll bar .   the smoky glow from the furnaces beyond the slab counter was the only light .  it illuminated three trolls playing   well  something percussive  but victor couldn   t quite make out what because the decibel level was in realms where the sound was a solid force  and it made his eyeballs vibrate .  the furnace smoke hid the ceiling .      what you havin    .     roared rock .      i don   t have to drink molten metal  do i .     victor quavered .  he had to quaver at the top of his voice in order to be heard .      we got all typer human drink .     shouted the female troll behind the bar .  it had to be a female .  there was no doubt about it .  she looked slightly like the statues cavemen used to carve of fertility goddesses thousands of years ago  but mostly like a foothill .     we very cosmopolitan .         i   ll have a beer  then .         ana flowers of sulfur onna rocks  ruby .     added rock .   victor took the opportunity to look around the bar  now that he was getting accustomed to the gloom and his eardrums had mercifully gone numb .   he was aware of masses of trolls seated at long tables  with here and there a dwarf  which was astonishing .  dwarfs and trolls normally fought like  well  dwarfs and trolls .  in their native mountains there was a state of unremitting vendetta .  holy wood certainly changed things .      can i have a quiet word .     victor shouted in rock   s pointed ear .      sure .     rock put down his drink .  it contained a purple paper umbrella  which was charring in the heat .      have you seen ginger .  you know .  ginger .         she working at borgle   s .         only in the mornings .  i   ve just been there .  where does she go when she   s not working .         who know where anyone go .      there was a sudden silence from the combo in the smoke .  one of the trolls picked up a small rock and started to pound it gently  producing a slow  sticky rhythm that clung to the walls like smoke .  and from the smoke  ruby emerged like a galleon out of the fog  with a ridiculous feather boa around her neck .   it was continental drift with curves .   she began to sing .   the trolls stood in respectful silence .  after a while victor heard a sob .  tears were rolling down rock   s face .      what   s the song about .     he whispered .   rock leaned down .        is ancient folklorique troll song     he said .     is about amber and jasper .  they were       he hesitated  and waved his hands about vaguely .     friends .  good friends .         i think i know what you mean     said victor .      and one day amber takes her troll   s dinner down to the cave and finds him       rock waved his hands in vague yet thoroughly descriptive motions       with another lady troll .  so she go home and get her club and come back and beat him to death  thump  thump  thump .     cos he was her troll and he done her wrong .  is very romantic song .      victor stared .  ruby undulated down from the tiny stage and glided among the customers  a small mountain in a four wheel skid .  she must weigh two tons  he thought .  if she sits on my knee they   ll have to roll me off the floor like a carpet .      what did she just say to that troll .     he said  as a deep wave of laughter rolled across the room .   rock scratched his nose .     is play on words     he said .     very hard to translate .  but basically  she say    is that the legendary sceptre of magma who was king of the mountain  smiter of thousands  yea  even tens of thousands  ruler of the golden river  master of the bridges  delver in dark places  crusher of many enemies        he took a deep breath        in your pocket or are you just glad to see me .         victor   s forehead creased .      i don   t get it     he said .      perhaps i not translate properly     said rock .  he took a pull of molten sulfur .     i hear untied alchemists is casting for           rock  there   s something very odd about this place     said victor urgently .     can   t you feel it .         what odd .         everything seems to  well  fizz .  no one acts like they should .  did you know there was a great city here once .  where the sea is .  a great city .  and it   s just gone .      rock rubbed his nose thoughtfully .  it looked like a neanderthal man   s first attempt at an axe .        and there   s the way everyone acts .     said victor .     as if who they are and what they want are the most important things in the world .         i   m wondering       rock began .      yes .     said victor .      i   m wondering  would it be worth takin    half a inch off my nose .  my cousin breccia knows this stonemason  fixed his ears a treat .  what do you fink .      victor stared dully at him .      i mean  on the one hand  it   s too big  but on the other hand  it   s definit   ly your stereotyped troll nose  right .  i mean  maybe i   ll look better  but in this business maybe it best to look just as troll as you can .  like  morry   s had his touched up with cement  now he got a face you wouldn   t want to meet on a dark night .  what you fink .  i value your opinion  because you a human with ideas .      he gave victor a bright silicon smile .   eventually victor said     it   s a great nose  rock .  with you behind it  it could go a long way .      rock gave a big grin  and took another pull of sulfur .  he extracted a small steel swizzle stick and sucked the amethyst off it .      you really fink       he began  and was then aware of the small area of empty space .  victor had gone .          i don   t know nuffin about no one     said the horse holder  looking shiftily at the looming presence of detritus .   dibbler chewed on his cigar .  it had been a bumpy journey from ankh  even in his new coach  and he   d missed lunch .      tall lad  bit dopey  thin mustache     he said .     he was working for you  right .     the horse holder gave in .      he   ll never make a good    oss    older  anyway     he said .      lets his work get on top of him .  i think he went to get something to eat .          victor sat in the dark alley  his back pressed against the wall  and tried to think .   he remembered staying out in the sun too long  once  when he was a boy .  the feeling he   d got afterward was something like this .   there was a soft flopping noise in the packed sand by his feet .   someone had dropped a hat in front of him .  he stared at it .   then someone started playing the harmonica .  they weren   t very good at it .  most of the notes were wrong  and those that were right were cracked .  there was a tune in there somewhere  in the same way that there   s a bit of beef in a hamburger grinder .   victor sighed and fumbled in his pocket for a couple of pennies .  he tossed them into the hat .      yeah  yeah     he said .     very good .  now go away .      he was aware of a strange smell .  it was hard to place  but could perhaps have been a very old and slightly damp nursery rug .   he looked up .      woof bloody woof     said gaspode the wonder dog .       borgle   s commissary had decided to experiment with salads tonight .  the nearest salad growing district was thirty slow miles away .      what dis .     demanded a troll  holding up something limp and brown .   fruntkin the short order chef hazarded a guess .      celery .     he said .  he peered closer .     yeah  celery .         it brown .            s   right .     s   right .  ripe celery ort to be brown     said fruntkin  quickly .     shows it   s ripe     he added .      it should be green .         nah .  yore finking about the tomatoes     said fruntkin .      yeah  and what   s this runny stuff .     said a man in the queue .     fruntkin drew himself up to his full height .      that     he said     is the mayonnaisey .  made it myself .  out of a book     he added proudly .      yeah  i expect you did     said the man  prodding it .      clearly oil  eggs and vinegar were not involved  right .         specialitay de lar mayson     said fruntkin .      right  right     said the man .     only it   s attacking my lettuce .      fruntkin grasped his ladle angrily .      look       he began .      no  it   s all right     said the prospective diner .     the slugs have formed a defensive ring .      there was a commotion by the door .  detritus the troll waded through the diners  with cut me own throat dibbler strutting along behind him .   the troll shouldered the queue aside and glared at fruntkin .      mr .  dibbler want a word     he said  and reached across the counter  lifted the dwarf up by his food encrusted shirt  and dangled him in front of throat .      anyone seen victor tugelbend .     said throat .     or that girl ginger .      fruntkin opened his mouth to swear  and thought better of it .      the boy was in here half an hour ago     he squeaked .      ginger works here mornings .  don   t know where she goes .         where   d victor go .     said throat .  he pulled a bag out of his pocket .  it jingled .  fruntkin   s eyes swiveled toward it as though they were ball bearings and it was a powerful magnet .      dunno  mr .  throat     he said .     he just went out again when she wasn   t here .         right     said throat .     well  if you see him again  tell him i   m looking for him and i   m going to make him a star  right .         star .  right     said the dwarf .     throat reached into his moneybag and produced a ten dollar piece .      and i want to order dinner for later on     he added .      dinner .  right     quavered fruntkin .      steak and prawns  i think     said throat .     with a choice of sunkissed vegetables in season  and then strawberries and cream .      fruntkin stared at him .      er        he began .   detritus poked the dwarf so that he swung backward and forward .      an    i     he said     will    ave   er   a well weathered basalt with a aggregate of fresh hewn sandstone conglomerates .  right .         er .  yes     said fruntkin .      put him down  detritus .  he doesn   t want to be hanging around     said throat .     and gently .     he looked around at the fascinated faces .      remember     he said     i   m looking for victor tugelbend and i   m going to make him a star .  if anyone sees him  you must tell him .  oh  and i   ll have the steak rare  fruntkin .      he strode back to the door .   after he had gone the chattering flowed back like a tide .      make him a star .  what   d he want a star for .         i didn   t know you could make stars   i thought they were like  you know  stuck to the sky           i think he meant make him a star .  you know  him himself .  turn him into a star .         how can you make anyone into a star .         i dunno .  i suppose you compress them right up small and they burst into this mass of flaming hydrogen .         good grief        yeah .  is that troll mean  or what .          victor looked at the dog carefully .   it couldn   t have spoken to him .  it must have been his imagination .  but he   d said that last time  hadn   t he .      i wonder what your name is .     said victor  patting it on the head .      gaspode     said gaspode .   victor   s hand froze in mid tousle .      tuppence     said the dog  wearily .     world   s only bloody harmonica playing dog .  tuppence .      it is the sun  victor thought .  i haven   t been wearing a hat .  in a minute i   ll wake up and there   ll be cool sheets .      well  you didn   t play very well .  i couldn   t recognize the tune     he said  stretching his mouth into a terrible grin .      you   re not supposed to recognize the bloody tune     said gaspode  sitting down heavily and industriously scratching one ear with his hind leg .     i   m a dog .  you   re supposed to be bloody amazed i can bloody well get a squeak out of the bloody thing .      how shall i put it .  victor thought .  do i just say  excuse me  you appear to be tal   no  probably not .      er     he said .  hey  you   re quite chatty for   no .      fleas     said gaspode  changing ears and legs .     giving me gyp .         oh dear .         and all these trolls .  can   t stand    em .  they smell all wrong .  bloody walking stones .  you try and bite    em  next minute you   re spittin    teef .  it   s not natural .      talking of natural  i can   t help noticing that        bloody desert  this place     said gaspode .   you   re a talking dog .      i expect you   re wondering     said gaspode  turning his penetrating stare on victor once again     how come i   m talking .         hadn   t given it a thought     said victor .      me neither     said gaspode .     until a couple of weeks ago .  all my life  never said a bloody word .  worked for a bloke back in the big city .  tricks and that .  balancing a ball on my nose .  walkin    on me    ind legs .  jumpin    through a    oop .  carried the hat around in my mouf afterward .  you know .  show business .  then this woman pats me on me    ead  says    eow  wot a dear little doggy  he looks like he understands every word we say     and i thinks     ho  ho  i don   t even bother to make the effort anymore  missus     and then i realizes i can hear the words  and they   re coming out of me own mouf .  so i grabbed the    at and had it away on my paws pretty damn quick  while they were still starin    .         why .     said victor .   gaspode rolled his eyes .     exactly wot life do you fink a genuine talking dog is going to have .     he said .     shouldn   t have opened my stupid mouth .         but you   re talking to me     said victor .   gaspode gave him a sly look .      yeah  but jus    you try tellin    anyone     he said .     anyway  you   re all right .  you   ve got the look .  i could tell it a mile orf .         what on earth do you mean .     said victor .      you don   t fink you really belong to yourself  right .     said the dog .     you   ve    ad the feeling that something else is doin    your thinking for you .         good grief .         give you a kind of hunted look     said gaspode .  he picked up the cap in his mouth .     tuppence     he said indistinctly .     i mean  it   s not as if i   ve got any way of spending it  but   tuppence .     he gave a canine shrug .      what do you mean by a hunted look .     said victor .      you   ve all got the look .  many are called and few are chosen  style of fing .         what look .         like you   ve been called here and you don   t know why .     gaspode tried to scratch his ear again .     saw you acting cohen the barbarian     he said .      er   what did you think of it .     said victor .        i reckon  so long as ole cohen never gets to hear about it  you should be ok .             i said  how long ago was he in here .     shouted dibbler .  on the tiny stage  ruby was crooning something in a voice like a ship in thick fog and bad trouble .      grooooowwonnogghrhhooooo            he only just went out .     bellowed rock .     i   m trying to listen to this song  all right .            oowoowgrhhffrghooooo         cut me own throat nudged detritus  who was taking the weight off his knuckles and watching the floor show with his mouth open .   the old troll   s life had  up to now  been very straightforward  people paid you money  and you hit other people .   now it was beginning to get complicated .  ruby had winked at him .   strange and unfamiliar emotions were rampaging through detritus    battered heart .         grooooooooohoofoooooo            come on     snapped throat .   detritus lumbered to his feet and took one last longing look at the stage .         ooooogoooomoo .  oohhhooo .         ruby blew him a kiss .  detritus blushed the color of fresh cut garnet .       gaspode led the way out of the alley and through the dark hinterland of scrubby bushes and sandgrass behind the town .      there   s definitely something wrong with this place     he muttered .      it   s different     said victor .     what do you mean  wrong .      gaspode looked as though he was going to spit .      now  take me     he said  ignoring the interruption .     a dog .  never dreamed in my life except about chasing fings .  and sex  of course .  suddenly i   m dreaming these dreams .  in color .  frightened the bloody life out of me .  never seen color before  right .  dogs see in black an    white  as i expect you knows  you bein    a great reader .  red comes as a nasty shock  i can tell you .  you fink your dinner is just this white bone with shades of gray on it  suddenly it turns out for years you bin eatin    this gharsteley red and purple stuff .         what kind of dreams .     said victor .      it   s bloody embarrassing     said gaspode .     like  in one there   s this bridge that   s been washed away and i have to run and bark a warning  right .  and there   s another where this house is on fire and i drag these kids out .  and there   s one where some kids are lost in these caves and i find    em and go and lead the search party to them   and i hates kids .  seems i can   t get me    ead down these days without rescuin    people or savin    people or foilin    robbers or sunnink .  i mean  i   m seven years old  i got hardpad  i got scurf  i got fleas somethin    dreadful  i don   t need to be a    ero every time i go to sleep .         gosh .  isn   t life interesting     said victor     when you see it from someone else   s perspective    .      gaspode rolled a crusted yellow eye skyward .      er .  where are we going .     said victor .      we   re goin    to see a few holy wood folk     said gaspode .        cos there   s something weird goin    on .           up on the hill .  i didn   t know there were any people on the hill .         they ain   t people     said gaspode .       a little twig fire burned on the slope of holy wood hill .  victor had lit it because   well  because it was reassuring .  because it was the sort of thing humans did .   he found it necessary to remember he was human  and probably not crazy .   it wasn   t that he   d been talking to a dog .  people often talked to dogs .  the same applied to the cat .  and maybe even the rabbit .  it was the conversation with the mouse and the duck that might be considered odd .      you think we wanted to talk .     snapped the rabbit .     one minute i   m just another rabbit and happy about it  next minute whazaam  i   m thinking .  that   s a major drawback if you   re looking for happiness as a rabbit  let me tell you .  you want grass and sex  not thoughts like    what   s it all about  when you get right down to it .            yeah  but at least you eats grass     gaspode pointed out .      at least grass don   t talk back at you .  the last thing you needs when you   re hungry is a bloody ethical conundrum on your plate .         you think you   ve got problems     said the cat  apparently reading his mind .     i   m reduched to eating fish .  you put a paw on your dinner  it shoutsh    help .      you got a major predicament .      there was silence .  they looked at victor .  so did the mouse .  and the duck .  the duck was looking particularly belligerent .  it had probably heard about orange sauce .      yeah .  take us     said the mouse .     there   s me  being chased by this     it indicated the cat looming over it     around the kitchen .  scrabble  scrabble  squeak  panic .  then there   s this sizzling noise in my head  i see a frying pan   you understand .  a second ago i never knew what frying was  now i   m holding the handle  he comes around the corner  clang .  now he   s staggering around saying    what hit me .     i say    me .     that   s when we both realize .  we   re talking .         concheptualishing     said the cat .  it was a black cat  with white paws  ears like shotgun targets  and the scarred face of a cat that has already lived eight lives to the full .      you tell him  kid     said the mouse .      tell him what you did next     said gaspode .      we came here     said the cat .      from ankh morpork .     said victor .      yeah .         that   s nearly thirty miles .         yeah  and take it from me     said the cat     it   s hard to hitch hike when you   s a cat .         see .     said gaspode .     it   s happening all the time .  all sorts are turnin    up in holy wood .  they don   t know why they   ve come  only that it   s important to be here .  an    they don   t act like they do anywhere else in the world .  i bin watchin    .  somethin    weird   s goin    on .      the duck quacked .  there were words in there somewhere  but so mangled by the incompatibility of beak and larynx that victor couldn   t understand a word .   the animals gave it a sympathetic audience .      what   s up  duck .     said the rabbit .      the duck says     translated gaspode     that it   s like a migratory thing .  just the same feelin    as a migration  he says .         yeah .  i didn   t have far to come     the rabbit volunteered .      we lived on the dunes anyway .     it sighed .     for three happy years and four miserable days     it added .   a thought struck victor .     so you   d know about the old man on the beach .     he said .      oh  him .  yeah .  him .  he was always coming up here .         what sort of person was he .     said victor .      listen  buster  up to four days ago i had a vocabulary consisting of two verbs and one noun .  what do you think i thought he was .  all i know is  he didn   t bother us .  we probably thought he was a rock on legs  or something .        victor thought about the book in his pocket .  chanting and lighting fires .  what sort of person did that .      i don   t know what   s going on     he said .     i   d like to find out .  look  haven   t you got names .  i feel awkward  talking to people without names .         only me     said gaspode .     bein    a dog .  i   m named after the famous gaspode  you know .         a kid called me puss once     said the cat doubtfully .      i thought you had names in your own language     said victor .     you know  like    mighty paws    or   or    speedy hunter .     or something .      he smiled encouragingly .   the others gave him a long blank stare .      he reads books     explained gaspode .     see  the thing is     he added  scratching himself vigorously     animals don   t normally bother with names .  i mean  we know who we are .         mind you  i like    speedy hunter        said the mouse .      i was thinking that   s more a cat   s name     said victor  starting to sweat .     mice have friendly little names  like   like squeak .         squeak .     said the mouse  coldly .   the rabbit grinned .      and  and i always thought rabbits were called flopsy .  or mr .  thumpy     victor gabbled .   the rabbit stopped grinning and twitched its ears .      now look  pal       it began .      y   know     said gaspode cheerfully  in an attempt to revive the conversation     i heard there   s this legend where the first two people in the world named all the animals .  makes you fink  don   t it .      victor pulled out the book to cover his embarrassment .  chanting and lighting fires .  three times a day .      this old man       he began .      what   s so important about him .     said the rabbit .     he just used to come up onto the hill and make noises a couple of times every day .  you could set your   your     it hesitated .     it was always the same times .  many times a day .         three times .  three performances .  like a sort of theater .     said victor  running his finger down the page .      we can   t count up to three     said the rabbit sourly .     it goes one   many .  many times .     he glared at victor .     mr .  thumpy     it said  in withering tones .      and people from other places brought him fish     said victor .     there   s no one else living near here .  they must have come from miles away .  people sailed miles just to bring him fish .  it   s as though he didn   t want to eat fish out of the bay here .  and it   s teeming with them .  when i went swimming i saw lobsters you wouldn   t believe .         what did you name them .     said mr .  thumpy  who wasn   t the kind of rabbit that forgot a grudge .     mr .  snappy .         yeah  i want this cleared up right now     squeaked the mouse .     back home i was top mouse .  i could lick any other mouse in the house .  i want a proper name  kid .  anyone calls me squeaky boots     he looked up at victor     is asking for a head shaped like a frying pan  do i make myself clear .      the duck quacked at length .      hold it     said gaspode .     the thing is  the duck says     said gaspode     that all this is part of the same thing .  humans and trolls and everything coming here .  animals suddenly talking .  the duck says he thinks it   s caused by something here .         how does a duck know that .     said victor .      look  friend     said the rabbit     when you can fly all the way across the sea and even end up finding the same bloody continent  you can start badmouthing ducks .         oh     said victor .     you mean mysterious animal senses  yes .      they glared at him .      anyway  it   s got to stop     said gaspode .     all this cogitatin    and talkin    is all right for you humans .  you   re used to it .  fing is  see  someone   s got to find out what   s causin    all this        they carried on glaring at him .      well     he said  vaguely     maybe the book can help .  the early bits are in some sort of ancient language .  i can   t        he paused .  wizards weren   t welcomed in holy wood .  it probably wasn   t a good idea to mention the university  or his small part in it .     that is     he continued  choosing his words with care     i think i know someone in ankh morpork who might be able to read it .  he   s an animal  too .  an ape .         how   s he in the mysterious senses department .     said gaspode .      he   s red hot on mysterious senses     said victor .      in that case       said the rabbit .      hold it     said gaspode .     someone   s coming .      a moving torch was visible coming up the hill .  the duck rocketed clumsily into the air and glided away .  the others disappeared into the shadows .  only the dog didn   t move .      aren   t you going to make yourself scarce .     victor hissed .   gaspode raised an eyebrow .      woof .     he said .   the torch zig zagged erratically among the scrub  like a firefly .  sometimes it would stop for a moment  and then wander away in some totally new direction .  it was very bright .      what is it .     said victor .   gaspode sniffed .     human     he said .     female .  wearin    cheap scent .     his nose twitched again .     it   s called passion   s plaything .     he sniffed again .     fresh laundry  no starch .  old shoes .  lot of studio make up .  she   s been in borgle   s and had       his nose twitched       stoo .  not a big plate .         i suppose you can tell how tall she is  can you .     said victor .      she smells about five foot two  two and a half     hazarded gaspode .      oh  come on .           walk a mile on these paws and call me a liar .      victor kicked sand over his little fire and strolled down the slope .   the light stopped moving as he approached it .  for a moment he got a glimpse of a female figure clasping a shawl around her with one hand holding the torch high above her head .  then the light vanished so quickly it left blue and purple after images dancing across his vision .  behind them  a small figure made a blacker shadow against the dusk .   it said     what are you doing in my   what am i   why are you in   where        and then  as if it had finally got to grips with the situation  changed gear and in a much more familiar voice demanded     what are you doing here .         ginger .     said victor .      yes .      victor paused .  what were you supposed to say in circumstances like this .      er       he said .     it   s nice up here in the evenings  don   t you think .      she glared at gaspode .      that   s that horrible dog who   s been hanging around the studio  isn   t it .     she said .     i can   t stand small dogs .         bark  bark     said gaspode .  ginger stared at him .  victor could almost read her thoughts  he said bark  bark .  and he   s a dog  and that   s the kind of noise dogs make  isn   t it .      i   m a cat person  myself     she said  vaguely .   a low level voice said     yeah .  yeah .  wash in your own spit  do you .         what was that .      victor backed away  waving his hands frantically .     don   t look at me .     he said .     i didn   t say it .         oh .  i suppose it was the dog  was it .     she demanded .      who  me .     said gaspode .   ginger froze .  her eyes swiveled around and down  to where gaspode was idly scratching an ear .      woof .     he said .        that dog spoke       ginger began  pointing a shaking finger at him .      i know     said victor .     that means he likes you .     he looked past her .  another light was coming up the hill .      did you bring someone with you .     he said .      me .     ginger turned around .   now the light was accompanied by the cracking of dry twigs  and dibbler stepped out of the dusk with detritus trailing behind like a particularly scary shadow .      ah ha .     he said .     the lovebirds surprised  eh .      victor gaped at him .     the what .     he said .      the what .     said ginger .      been looking all over for you two     said dibbler .     someone said he   d seen you come up here .  very romantic .  could do something with that .  look good on the posters .  right .     he draped his arms around them .     come on     he said .      what for .     said victor .      we   re shooting first thing in the morning     said dibbler .      but mr .  silverfish said i wasn   t going to work in this town again       victor began .   dibbler opened his mouth  and hesitated just for a moment .     ah .  yes .  but i   m going to give you another chance     he said  speaking quite slowly for once .     yeah .  a chance .  like  you   re young people .  headstrong .  young once myself .  dibbler  i thought  even if it means cutting your own throat  give    em a chance .  lower wages  of course .  a dollar a day  how about that .      victor saw the look of sudden hope on ginger   s face .   he opened his mouth .      fifteen dollars     said a voice .  it wasn   t his .   he shut his mouth .      what .     said dibbler .   victor opened his mouth .      fifteen dollars .  renegot   ble after a week .  fifteen dollars or nuffin    .      victor shut his mouth  his eyes rolling .     dibbler waved a finger under his nose  and then hesitated .      i like it .     he said eventually .     tough bargainer .  ok .  three dollars .         fifteen .         five   s my last offer  kid .  there   s thousands of people down there who   d jump at it  right .         name two  mr .  dibbler .      dibbler glanced at detritus  who was lost in a reverie concerning ruby  and then stared at ginger .      ok     he said .     ten .  because i like you .  but it   s cutting my own throat .         done .      throat held out a hand .  victor stared at his own as if he was seeing it for the first time  and then shook .      and now let   s get back down     said dibbler .     lot to organize .      he strode off through the trees .  victor and ginger followed meekly behind him  in a state of shock .      are you crazy .     ginger hissed .     holding out like that .  we could have lost our chance .         i didn   t say anything .  i thought it was you .     said victor .      it was you .     said ginger .   their eyes met .   they looked down .      bark  bark     said gaspode the wonder dog .   dibbler turned round .      what   s that noise .     he said .      oh  it   s   it   s just this dog we found     said victor hurriedly .     he   s called gaspode .  after the famous gaspode  you know .         he does tricks     said ginger  malevolently .      a performing dog .     dibbler reached down and patted gaspode   s bullet head .      growl  growl .         you   d be amazed  the things he can do     said victor .      amazed     echoed ginger .        ugly devil  though     said dibbler .  he gave gaspode a long  slow stare  which was like challenging a centipede to an arse kicking contest .  gaspode could outstare a mirror .   dibbler seemed to be turning an idea over in his mind .     mind you   bring him along in the morning .  people like a good laugh     said dibbler .      oh  he   s a laugh all right     said victor .     a scream .      as they walked off victor heard a quiet voice behind him say     i   ll get you for that .  anyway  you owe me a dollar .         what for .         agent   s fee     said gaspode the wonder dog .       over holy wood  the stars were out .  they were huge balls of hydrogen heated to millions of degrees  so hot they could not even burn .  many of them would swell enormously before they died  and then shrink to tiny  resentful dwarfs remembered only by sentimental astronomers .  in the meantime  they glowed because of metamorphoses beyond the reach of alchemists  and turned mere boring elements into pure light .   over ankh morpork  it just rained .   the senior wizards crowded around the elephant vase .  it had been put back in the corridor on ridcully   s strict orders .      i remember riktor     said the dean .     skinny man .  bit of a one track mind .  but clever .         heh  heh .  i remember his mouse counter     said windle poons  from his ancient wheelchair .     used to count mice .         the pot itself is quite       the bursar began  and then said     what d   you mean  count mice .  they were fed into it on a little belt or something .         oh  no .  you just wound it up  y   see  and it sat there whirring away  counting all the mice in the building  mm  and these little wheels with numbers on them came up .         why .         mm .  i s   pose he just wanted to count mice .      the bursar shrugged .     this pot     he said  peering closely      is actually quite an old ming vase .        he waited expectantly .      why   s it called ming .     said the archchancellor  on cue .   the bursar tapped the pot .  it went ming .      and they spit lead balls at people  do they .     said ridcully .      no  master .  he just used it to put the   the machinery in .  whatever it is .  whatever it   s doing .         whumm        hold on .  it wobbled     said the dean .      whumm   whumm     the wizards stared at one another in sudden panic        what   s happening .  what   s happening .     said windle poons .     why won   t anyone  mm  tell me what   s happening .         whumm   whumm        run .     suggested the dean .      which way .     quavered the bursar .      whummwhumm        i   m an old man and i demand someone tell me what   s        silence .      duck .     shouted the archchancellor .   plib .   a splinter of stone was knocked off the pillar behind him .   he raised his head .      bigods  that was a damn lucky es        plib .   the second pellet knocked the tip off his hat .   the wizards lay trembling on the flagstones for several minutes .  after a while the dean   s muffled voice     was that all  do you think .      the archchancellor raised his head .  his face  always red  was now incandescent .      bursaar .         master .         that   s what i call shootin    .          victor turned over .      wzstf     he said .      it   s six aye emm  rise and shine  mr .  dibbler says     said detritus  grasping the bedclothes in one hand and dragging them onto the floor .      six o   clock .  that   s night time .     groaned victor .      it   s going to be a long day  mr .  dibbler says     said the troll .     mr .  dibbler says you got to be on set by half past six .  this is goin    to happen .      victor pulled on his trousers .      i suppose i get to eat breakfast .     he said sarcastically .      mr .  dibbler is havin    food laid on  mr .  dibbler says     said detritus .   there was a wheezing noise from under the bed .  gaspode emerged  in a cloud of old rugness  and had an early morning scratch .      wha       he began  and then saw the troll .     bark  bark     he corrected himself .      oh .  a little dog .  i like little dogs     said detritus .      woof .         raw     the troll added .  but he couldn   t get the right amount of statutory nastiness into his voice .  visions of ruby in her feather boa and three acres of red velvet kept undulating across his mind .   gaspode scratched his ear vigorously .      woof     he said quietly .     in tones of low menace     he added  after detritus had gone .       the slope of the hill was already alive with people when victor arrived .  a couple of tents had been erected .  someone was holding a camel .  several cages of demons gibbered in the shade of a thorn tree .   in the middle of all this were dibbler and silverfish  arguing .  dibbler had his arm around silverfish   s shoulder .      a dead giveaway  is that     said a voice from the level of victor   s knees .     it means some poor bugger is about to be taken to the cleaners .         it   ll be a step up for you  tom .     dibbler was saying .     i mean  how many people in holy wood can call themselves vice president in charge of executive affairs .         yes  but it   s my company .     silverfish wailed .      right .  right .     said dibbler .     that   s what a name like vice president of executive affairs means .         it does .         have i ever lied to you .      silverfish   s brow furrowed .     well     he said     yesterday you said           i mean metaphorically     said dibbler quickly .      oh .  well .  metaphorically .  i suppose not           there you are  then .  now  where   s that artist .     dibbler spun around  giving the impression that silverfish had just been switched off .   a man scurried up with a folder under his arm .      yessir  mr .  dibbler .      throat pulled a scrap of paper out of his pocket .      i want the posters ready by tonight  understand .     he warned .     here .  this is the name of the click .         shadowe of the dessert     the artist read .  his brow furrowed .  he had been educated beyond the needs of holy wood .     it   s about food .     he said .   but dibbler wasn   t listening .  he was advancing on victor .      victor .     he said .     baby .         it   s got him     said gaspode quietly .     got him worse than anyone  i reckon .         what has .  how can you tell .     victor hissed .      partly a   cos of subtle signs what you don   t seem to be abler recognize     said gaspode     and partly because he   s actin    like a complete twerp  really .         great to see you .     dibbler enthused  his eyes glowing manically .     he put his arm around victor   s shoulder and half walked  half dragged him toward the tents .      this is going to be a great picture .     he said .      oh  good     said victor weakly .      you play this bandit chieftain     said dibbler     only a nice guy  too  kind to women and so forth  and you raid this village and you carry off this slave girl only when you look into her eyes  see  you fall for her  and then there   s this raid and hundreds of men on elephants come charging           camels     said a skinny youth behind dibbler .     it   s camels .         i ordered elephants .         you got camels .         camels  elephants     said dibbler dismissively .     we   re talking exotic here  ok .  and           and we   ve only got one     said the youth .      one what .         camel .  we could only find one camel     said the youth .      but i   ve got dozens of guys with bedsheets on their heads waiting for camels .     shouted dibbler  waving his hands in the air .     lots of camels  right .         we only got one camel    cos there   s only one camel in holy wood and that   s only    cos a guy from klatch rode all the way here on it     said the youth .      you should have sent away for more .     snapped dibbler .      mr .  silverfish said i wasn   t to .      dibbler growled .      maybe if it moves around a lot it   ll look like more than one camel     said the youth optimistically .      why not ride the camel past the picture box  and then get the handleman to stop the demons  and lead it back and put a different rider on it  then start up the box again and ride it past again .     said victor .     would that work .      dibbler looked at him open mouthed .      what did i tell you .     he said  to the sky in general .     the lad is a genius .  that way we can get a hundred camels for the price of one  right .         it means the desert bandits ride in single file  though     said the youth .     it   s not like  you know  a massed attack .         sure  sure     said dibbler dismissively .     makes sense .  we just put a card up where the leader says  he says       he thought for a second .     he says     follow me in single file  bwanas  to fool the hated enemy     ok .      he nodded at victor .     have you met my nephew soll .     he said .     keen lad .  been nearly to school and everything .  brought him out here yesterday .  he   s vice president in charge of making pictures .      soll and victor exchanged nods .      i don   t think    bwanas    is the right word  uncle     said soll .      it   s klatchian  isn   t it .     said dibbler .      well  technically  but i think it   s the wrong part of klatch and maybe    effendies    or something           just so long as it   s foreign     said dibbler with an air that suggested the matter was settled .  he patted victor on the back again .     ok  kid  get into costume .     he chuckled .     a hundred camels .  what a mind .         excuse me  mr .  dibbler     said the poster artist  who had been hovering uneasily     i don   t understand this bit here        dibbler snatched the paper from him .      which bit .     he snapped .      where you   re describing miss de syn           it   s obvious     said dibbler .     what we want here is to conjure up the exotic  alluring yet distant romance of pyramid studded klatch  right  so nat   r   ly we gotta use the symbol of a mysterious and unscrutable continent  see .  do i have to explain everything to everyone all the time .         it   s just that i thought       the artist began .      just do it .      the artist looked down at the paper .        she has the face        he read        of a spink .              right     said dibbler .     right .         i thought maybe sphinx           will you listen to the man .     said dibbler  talking to the sky again .  he glared at the artist .     she doesn   t look like two of them  does she .  one spink  two spinks .  now get on with it .  i want those posters all around the city first thing tomorrow .      the artist gave victor an agonized look he was coming to recognize .  everyone around dibbler wore them after a while .      right you are  mr .  dibbler     he said .      right .     dibbler turned to victor .      why aren   t you changed .     he said .   victor ducked quickly into a tent .  a little old lady   shaped like a cottage loaf helped him into a costume apparently made of sheets inexpertly dyed black  although given the current state of accommodation in holy wood they were probably just sheets taken off a bed at random .  then she handed him a curved sword .      why   s it bent .     he asked .      i think it   s meant to be  dear     she said doubtfully .      i thought swords had to be straight     said victor .  outside  he could hear dibbler asking the sky why everyone was so stupid .      perhaps they start out straight and go bendy with use     said the old lady  patting him on the hand .     a lot of things do .      she gave him a bright smile .     if you   re all right  dear  i   d better go and help the young lady  in case any little dwarfs is peering in at her .      she waddled out of the tent .  from the tent next door came a metallic chinking noise and the sound of ginger   s voice raised in complaint .   victor made a few experimental slashes with the sword .   gaspode watched him with his head on one side .      what   re you supposed to be .     he said at last .      a leader of a pack of desert bandits  apparently     said victor .     romantic and dashing .         dashing where .         just dashing generally  i guess .  gaspode  what did you mean when you said it   s got dibbler .      the dog gnawed at a paw .      look at his eyes     he said .     they   re even worse than yours .         mine .  what   s wrong with mine .      detritus the troll stuck his head through the tent flaps .      mr .  dibbler says he wants you now     he said .      eyes .     said victor .     something about my eyes .         woof .         mr .  dibbler says       detritus began .      all right  all right .  i   m coming .      victor stepped out of his tent at the same time as ginger stepped out of hers .  he shut his eyes .      gosh  i   m sorry     he babbled .     i   ll go back and wait for you to get dressed           i am dressed .         mr .  dibbler says       said detritus  behind them .      come on     said ginger  grabbing his arm .     we mustn   t keep everyone waiting .         but you   re   your       victor looked down  which wasn   t a help .     you   ve got a navel in your diamond     he hazarded .      i   ve come to terms with that     said ginger  flexing her shoulders in an effort to make everything settle .     it   s these two saucepan lids that are giving me problems .  makes you realize what those poor girls in the harems must suffer .           and you don   t mind people seeing you like that .     said victor  amazed .      why should i .  this is moving pictures .  it   s not as if it   s real .  anyway  you   d be amazed at what girls have to do for a lot less than ten dollars a day .         nine     said gaspode  who was still trailing at victor   s heels .      right  gather round  people     shouted dibbler through a megaphone .     sons of the desert over there  please .  the slave girls   where are the slave girls .  right .  handlemen .            i   ve never seen so many people in a click     ginger whispered .     it must be costing more than a hundred dollars .      victor eyed the sons of the desert .  it looked as though dibbler had dropped in at borgle   s and hired the twenty people nearest the door  irrespective of their appropriateness  and had given them each dibbler   s idea of a desert bandit headdress .  there were trollish sons of the desert   rock recognized him  and gave him a little wave   dwarf sons of the desert and  shuffling into the end of the line  a small  hairy and furiously scratching son in a headdress that reached down to his paws .         grab her  become entranced by her beauty  and then throw her over your pommel .     dibbler   s voice intruded into his consciousness .   victor desperately re ran the half heard instructions past his mind .      my what .     he said .      it   s part of your saddle     ginger hissed .      oh .         and then you ride into the night  with all the sons following you and singing rousing desert bandit songs           no one   ll hear them     said soll helpfully .     but if they open and shut their mouths it   ll help create a  you know  amby ance .           but it isn   t night     said ginger .     it   s broad daylight .      dibbler stared at her .   his mouth opened once or twice .      soll .     he shouted .      we can   t film at night  uncle     said the nephew hurriedly .      the demons wouldn   t be able to see .  i don   t see why we can   t put up a card saying    night time    at the start of the scene  so that           that   s not the magic of moving pictures .     snapped dibbler .     that   s just messing about .         excuse me     said victor .     excuse me  but surely it doesn   t matter  because surely the demons can paint the sky black with stars on it .      there was a moment   s silence .  then dibbler looked at gaffer .      can they .     he said .      nah     said the handleman .     it   s bloody hard enough to make sure they paint what they do see  never mind what they don   t .      dibbler rubbed his nose .      i might be prepared to negotiate     he said .   the handleman shrugged .     you don   t understand  mr .  dibbler .  what   d they want money for .  they   d only eat it .  we start telling them to paint what isn   t there  we   re into all sorts of           perhaps it   s just a very bright full moon .     said ginger .      that   s good thinking     said dibbler .     we   ll do a card where victor says to ginger something like     how bright the moon is tonight  bwana .            something like that     said soll diplomatically .       it was noon .  holy wood hill glistened under the sun  like a champagne flavored wine gum that had been half sucked .  the handlemen turned their handles  the extras charged enthusiastically backward and forward  dibbler raged at everyone  and cinematographic history was made with a shot of three dwarfs  four men  two trolls and a dog all riding one camel and screaming in terror for it to stop .   victor was introduced to the camel .  it blinked its long eyelashes at him and appeared to chew soap .  it was kneeling down and it looked like a camel that had had a long morning and wasn   t about to take any shit from anyone .  so far it had kicked three people .      what   s it called .     he said cautiously .      we call it evil minded son of a bitch     said the newly appointed vice president in charge of camels .      that doesn   t sound like a name .            s a good name for this camel     said the handler fervently .      there   s nothin    wrong with bein    a son of a bitch     said a voice behind him .     i   m a son of a bitch .  my father was a son of a bitch  you greasy nightshirt wearin    bastard .      the handler grinned nervously at victor and turned around .  there was no one behind him .  he looked down .      woof     said gaspode  and wagged what was almost a tail .      did you just hear someone say something .     said the handler carefully .      no     said victor .  he leaned close to one of the camel   s ears and whispered  in case it was a special holy wood camel     look  i   m a friend  ok .      evil minded son of a bitch flicked a carpet thick ear .         how do you ride it .     he said .      when you want to go forward you swear at it and hit it with a stick  and when you want to stop you swear at it and really hit it with a stick .         what happens if you want it to turn .         ah  well  you   re on to the advanced manual there .  best thing to do is get off and do it round by hand .           when you   re ready .     dibbler bellowed through his megaphone .     now  you ride up to the tent  leap off the camel  fight the huge eunuchs  burst into the tent  drag the girl out  get back on the camel and away .  got it .  think you can do that .         what huge eunuchs .     said victor  as the camel unfolded itself upward .   one of the huge eunuchs shyly raised a hand .      it   s me .  morry     it said .      oh .  hi  morry .         hi  vic .         and me  rock     said a second huge eunuch .      hi  rock .         hi  vic .         places  everyone     said dibbler .     we   ll   what is it  rock .         er  i was just wondering  mr .  dibbler   what is my motivation for this scene .         motivation .         yes .  er .  i got to know  see     said rock .      how about  i   ll fire you if you don   t do it properly .      rock grinned .     right you are  mr .  dibbler     he said .      ok     said dibbler .     everyone ready   turn    em .          evil minded son of a bitch turned awkwardly  legs flailing at odd camel angles  and then lumbered into a complicated trot .   the handle turned     the air glittered .   and victor awoke .  it was like rising slowly out of a pink cloud  or a magnificent dream which  try as you might  drains out of your mind as the daylight shuffles in  leaving a terrible sense of loss  nothing  you know instinctively  nothing you   re going to experience for the rest of the day is going to be one half as good as that dream .   he blinked .  the images faded away .  he was aware of an ache in his muscles  as if he   d recently been really exerting himself .      what happened .     he mumbled .   he looked down .      wow     he said .  an expanse of barely clad buttock occupied a view recently occupied by the camel   s neck .  it was an improvement .      why     said ginger icily     am i lying on a camel .         search me .  didn   t you want to .      she slid down onto the sand and tried to adjust her costume .   at this point they both became aware of the audience .   there was dibbler .  there was dibbler   s nephew .  there was the handleman .  there were the extras .  there were the assorted vice presidents and other people who are apparently called into existence by the mere presence of moving picture creation .     there was gaspode the wonder dog .   and every one  except for the dog  who was sniggering  had his mouth open .   the handleman   s hand was still turning the handle .  he looked down at it as if its presence was new to him  and stopped .   dibbler seemed to come out of whatever trance he was in .      whoo hoo     he said .     blimey .         magic     breathed soll .     real magic .      dibbler nudged the handleman .      did you get all that .     he said .      get what .     said ginger and victor together .   then victor noticed morry sitting on the sand .  there was a sizeable chip out of his arm  rock was trowelling something into it .  the troll noticed victor   s expression and gave him a sickly grin .      fink you   re cohen the barbarian  do you .     he said .        yeah     said rock .     there was no call to go callin    him wot you called him .  an    if you   re going to go doin    fancy swordwork  we   re applyin    for an extra dollar a day havin    bits chopped off allowance .      victor   s sword had several nicks on the blade .  for the life of him  he couldn   t imagine how they had got there .      look     he said desperately .     i don   t understand .  i didn   t call anyone anything .  have we started filming yet .         one minute i   m sitting in a tent  next minute i   m breathing camel     said ginger petulantly .     is it too much to ask what is going on .      but no one seemed to be listening to them .      why can   t we find a way of getting sound .     said dibbler .     that was damn good dialogue there .  didn   t understand a word of it  but i know good dialogue when i hear it .         parrots     said the handleman flatly .     your common howondaland green .  amazing bird .  memory like an elephant .  get a couple of dozen in different sizes and you   ve got a full vocal        that launched a detailed technical discussion .   victor let himself slide off the camel   s back and ducked under its neck to reach ginger .      listen     he said urgently .     it was just like last time .  only stronger .  like a sort of dream .  the handleman started to take pictures and it was just like a dream .         yes  but what did we actually do .     she said .      what you did     said rock     was gallop the camel up to the tent  leap off  come at us like a windmill              leapin    on rocks and laughin          said morry .      yeah  you said to morry     have at you  you foul black guard        said rock .     and then you caught him a right ding on the arm  cut a hole in the tent           good sword work  though     said morry appraisingly .     a bit showy  but pretty good .         but i don   t know how to       victor began .           and she was lying there all longgrass     said rock .      an    you swept her up  and she said           long grass .     said ginger weakly .      languorous     said victor .     i think he means languorous .            she said     why  it is the thief of   the thief of          rock hesitated .     dad   s bag  i think you said .         bagged dad     said morry  rubbing his arm .      yeah  an    then she said     you are in great danger  for my father has sworn to kill you     and victor said     but now  o fairest rose  i can reveal that i am really the shadow of the dessert              what   s languorous mean .     said ginger suspiciously .      an    he said     fly with me now to the casbah     or something like that  an    then he gave her this  this  thing humans do with their lips           whistle .     said victor  with hopeless hope .      nah  the other thing .  sounds like a cork coming out of a bottle     said rock .      kiss     said ginger  coldly .      yeah .  not that i   m any judge     said rock     but it seemed to go on for a while .  definitely very  you know  kissy .         i thought it was going to be bucket of water time myself     said a quiet canine voice behind victor .  he kicked out backward  but failed to connect .      and then he was back on the camel and dragged her up and mr .  dibbler shouted    stop  stop  what the hell   s going on  why won   t anyone tell me what the hell   s going on        said rock .     and then you said    what happened .            don   t know when i last saw swordplay like that     said morry .      oh     said victor .     well .  thank you .         all that shouting    ha .     and    have at you  you dog .     very professional     said morry .        i see     said victor .  he reached sideways and grabbed ginger   s arm .      we   ve got to talk     he hissed .     somewhere quiet .  behind the tent .         if you think i   m going anywhere alone with you       she began .      listen  this is no time to start acting like        a heavy hand settled on victor   s shoulder .  he turned  and saw the shape of detritus eclipsing the world .      mr .  dibbler doesn   t want anyone running off     he said .      everyone has to stay until mr .  dibbler says .         you   re a real pain  you know     said victor .  detritus gave him a big  gem studded grin .         mr .  dibbler says i can be a vice president     he said proudly .      in charge of what .     said victor .      vice presidents     said detritus .   gaspode the wonder dog made a little growling sound at the back of his throat .  the camel  which had been idly staring at the sky  sidled around a bit and suddenly lashed out with a kick that caught the troll in the small of the back .  detritus yelped .  gaspode gave the world a look of satisfied innocence .      come on     said victor grimly .     while he   s trying to find something to hit the camel with .      they sat down in the shade behind the tent .      i just want you to know     said ginger coldly     that i have never attempted to look languorous in my life .         could be worth a try     said victor  absently .      what .         sorry .  look  something made us act like that .  i don   t know how to use a sword .  i   ve always just waved it around .  what did you feel like .           you know how you feel when you hear someone say something and you realize you   ve been daydreaming .         it was like your own life fading away and something else filling up the space .      they considered this in silence .      do you think it   s something to do with holy wood .     she said .   victor nodded .  then he threw himself sideways and landed on gaspode  who had been watching them intently .      yelp     said gaspode .      now listen     victor hissed into his ear     no more of these hints .  what is it that you noticed about us .  otherwise it   s detritus for you .  with mustard .      the dog squirmed in his grip .      or we could make you wear a muzzle     said ginger .      i ain   t dangerous .     wailed gaspode  scrabbling with his paws in the sand .      a talking dog sounds pretty dangerous to me     said victor .      dreadfully     said ginger .     you never know what it might say .         see .  see .     said gaspode mournfully .     i knew it   d be nothing but trouble  showin    i can talk .  it shouldn   t happen to a dog .         but it   s going to     said victor .      oh  all right .  all right .  for what good it   ll do     muttered gaspode .   victor relaxed .  the dog sat up and shook sand off himself .      you won   t understand it  anyway     he grumbled .     another dog would understand  but you won   t .  it   s down to species experience  see .  like kissing .  you know what it   s like  but i don   t .  it   s not a canine experience .     he noticed the warning look in victor   s eyes  and plunged on     it   s the way you look as if you belong here .     he watched them for a moment .     see .  see .     he said .     i tole you you wouldn   t understand .  it   s   it   s territory  see .  you got all the signs of bein    right where you should be .  nearly everyone else here is a stranger  but you aren   t .  er .  like  you mus    have noticed where some dogs bark at you when you   re new to a place .  it   s not jus    smell  we got this amazin    sense of displacement .  like  some humans get uncomfortable when they see a picture hung crooked .  it   s like that  only worse .  it   s kind of like the only place you ought to be now is here .     he looked at them again  and then industriously scratched an ear .      what the hell     he said .     the trouble is  i can explain it in dog but you only listen in human .         it sounds a bit mystical to me     said ginger .      you said something about my eyes     said victor .      yeah  well .  have you looked at your own eyes .     gaspode nodded at ginger .     you too  miss .         don   t be daft     said victor .     how can we look at our own eyes .      gaspode shrugged .     you could look at each other   s     he suggested .   they automatically turned to face each other .   there was a long drawn out moment .  gaspode employed it to urinate noisily against a tent peg .   eventually victor said     wow .      ginger said     mine  too .         yes .  doesn   t it hurt .         you should know .         there you are  then     said gaspode .     and you look at dibbler next time you see him .  really look  i mean .      victor rubbed his eyes  which were beginning to water .     it   s as though holy wood has called us here  is doing something to us and has  has              branded us     said ginger bitterly .     that   s what it   s done .         it  er  it does look quite attractive  actually     said victor gallantly .     gives them a sort of sparkle .      a shadow fell across the sand .      ah  there you are     said dibbler .  he put his arms around their shoulders as they stood up  and gave them a sort of hug .     you young people  always going off alone together     he said archly .     great business .  great business .  very romantic .  but we   ve got a click to make  and i   ve got lets of people standing around waiting for you  so let   s do it .         see what i mean .     muttered gaspode  very quietly .   when you knew what you were looking for  you couldn   t miss it .   in the center of both of dibbler   s eyes was a tiny golden star .       in the heartlands of the great dark continent of klatch the air was heavy and pregnant with the promise of the coming monsoon .   bullfrogs croaked in the rushes   by the slow brown river .  crocodiles dozed on the mudflats .   nature was holding its breath .   a cooing broke out in the pigeon loft of azhural n   choate  stock dealer .  he stopped dozing on the veranda  and went over to see what had caused the excitement .   in the vast pens behind the shack a few threadbare bewilderbeests  marked down for a quick sale  yawning and cudding in the heat  looked up in alarm as n   choate leapt the veranda steps in one bound and tore toward them .   he rounded the zebra pens and homed in on his assistant m   bu  who was peacefully mucking out the ostriches .      how many       he stopped  and began to wheeze .   m   bu  who was twelve years old  dropped his shovel and patted him heavily on the back .      how many       he tried again .      you been overdoing it again  boss .     said m   bu in a concerned voice .      how many elephants we got .           i just done them     said m   bu .     we got three .         are you sure .         yes  boss     said m   bu  evenly .     it   s easy to be sure  with elephants .      azhural crouched in the red dust and hurriedly began to scrawl figures with a stick .      old muluccai   s bound to have half a dozen     he muttered .     and tazikel   s usually got twenty or so  and then the people on the delta generally have           someone want elephants  boss .            got fifteen head  he was telling me  plus also there   s a load at the logging camp probably going cheap  call it two dozen           someone want a lot of elephants  boss .            was saying there   s a herd over t   etse way  shouldn   t be a problem  then there   s all the valleys over toward        m   bu leaned on the fence and waited .      maybe two hundred  give or take ten     said azhural  throwing down the stick .     nowhere near enough .         you can   t give or take ten elephants  boss     said m   bu firmly .  he knew that counting elephants was a precision job .  a man might be uncertain about how many wives he had  but never about elephants .  either you had one  or you didn   t .      our agent in klatch has an order for     azhural swallowed     a thousand elephants .  a thousand .  immediately .  cash on delivery .      azhural let the paper drop to the ground .     to a place called ankh morpork     he said despondently .  he sighed .     it would have been nice     he said .   m   bu scratched his head and stared at the hammerhead clouds massing over mt f   twangi .  soon the dry veldt would boom to the thunder of the rains .   then he reached down and picked up the stick .      what   re you doing .     said azhural .      drawing a map  boss     said m   bu .   azhural shook his head .     not worth it  boy .  three thousand miles to ankh  i reckon .  i let myself get carried away .  too many miles  not enough elephants .         we could go across the plains  boss     said m   bu .     lot of elephants on the plains .  send messengers ahead .  we could pick up plenty more elephants on the way  no problem .  that whole plain just about covered in damn elephants .         no  we   d have to go around on the coast     said the dealer  drawing a long curving line in the sand .     the reason being  there   s the jungle just here     he tapped on the parched ground     and here     he tapped again  slightly concussing an emerging locust that had optimistically mistaken the first tap for the onset of the rains .     no roads in the jungle .      m   bu took the stick and drew a straight line through the jungle .      where a thousand elephants want to go  boss  they don   t need no roads .      azhural considered this .  then he took the stick and drew a jagged line by the jungle .      but here   s the mountains of the sun     he said .     very high .  lots of deep ravines .  and no bridges .      m   bu took the stick  indicated the jungle  and grinned .      i know where there   s a lot of prime timber just been uprooted  boss     he said .      yeah .  ok  boy  but we   ve still got to get it into the mountains .         it just so happen that a t   ousand real strong elephants   ll be goin    that way  boss .      m   bu grinned again .  his tribe went in for sharpening their teeth to points .     he handed back the stick .   azhural   s mouth opened slowly .      by the seven moons of nasreem     he breathed .     we could do it  you know .  it   s only  oh  thirteen or fourteen hundred miles that way .  maybe less  even .  yeah .  we could really do it .         yes  boss .         y   know  i   ve always wanted to do something big with my life .  something real     said azhural .     i mean  an ostrich here  a giraffe there   it   s not the sort of thing you get remembered for       he stared at the purple gray horizon .      we could do it  couldn   t we .     he said .      sure  boss .         right over the mountains .         sure  boss .      if you looked really hard  you could just see that the purple gray was topped with white .      they   re pretty high mountains     said azhural  his voice now edged with doubt .      slope go up  slope go down     said m   bu gnomically .      that   s true     said azhural .     like  on average  it   s flat all the way .      he gazed at the mountains again .      a thousand elephants     he muttered .     d   you know  boy  when they built the tomb of king leonid of ephebe they used a hundred elephants to cart the stone .  and two hundred elephants  history tells us  were employed in the building of the palace of the rhoxie in klatch city .      thunder rumbled in the distance .      a thousand elephants     azhural repeated .     a thousand elephants .  i wonder what they want them for .          the rest of the day passed in a trance for victor .   there was more galloping and fighting  and more rearranging of time .  victor still found that hard to understand .  apparently the film could be cut up and then stuck together again later  so that things happened in the right order .  and some things didn   t have to happen at all .  he saw the artist draw one card which said    in thee kinges    palace  one houre latre .        one hour of time had been vanished  just like that .  of course  he knew that it hadn   t really been surgically removed from his life .  it was the sort of thing that happened all the time in books .  and on the stage  too .  he   d seen a group of strolling players once  and the performance had leapt magically from    a battlefield in tsort    to    the ephebian fortresse  that nighte    with no more than a brief descent of the sackcloth curtain and a lot of muffled bumping and cursing as the scenery was changed .   but this was different .  ten minutes after doing a scene  you   d do another scene that was taking place the day before  somewhere else  because dibbler had rented the tents for both scenes and didn   t want to have to pay anymore rent than necessary .  you just had to try and forget about everything but now  and that was hard when you were also waiting every moment for that fading sensation     it didn   t come .  just after another half hearted fight scene dibbler announced that it was all finished .      aren   t we going to do the ending .     said ginger .      you did that this morning     said soll .      oh .      there was a chattering noise as the demons were let out of their box and sat swinging their little legs on the edge of the lid and passing a tiny cigarette from hand to hand .  the extras queued up for their wages .  the camel kicked the vice president in charge of camels .  the handlemen wound the great reels of film out of the boxes and went away to whatever arcane cutting and gluing the handlemen got up to in the hours of darkness .  mrs .  cosmopilite  vice president in charge of wardrobe  gathered up the costumes and toddled off  possibly to put them back on the beds .   a few acres of scrubby backlot stopped being the rolling dunes of the great nef and went back to being scrubby backlot again .  victor felt that much the same thing was happening to him .   in ones and twos  the makers of moving picture magic departed  laughing and joking and arranging to meet at borgle   s later on .   ginger and victor were left alone in a widening circle of emptiness .      i felt like this the first time the circus went away     said ginger .      mr .  dibbler said we were going to do another one tomorrow     said victor .     i   m sure he just makes them up as he goes along .  still  we got ten dollars each .  minus what we owe gaspode     he added conscientiously .  he grinned foolishly at her .     cheer up     he said .     you   re doing what you   ve always wanted to do .         don   t be stupid .  i didn   t even know about moving pictures a couple of months ago .  there weren   t any .      they strolled aimlessly toward the town .      what did you want to be .     he ventured .   she shrugged .     i didn   t know .  i just knew i didn   t want to be a milkmaid .      there had been milkmaids at home .  victor tried to recollect anything about them .     it always looked quite an interesting job to me  milkmaiding     he said vaguely .     buttercups  you know .  and fresh air .         it   s cold and wet and just as you   ve finished the bloody cow kicks the bucket over .  don   t tell me about milking .  or being a shepherdess .  or a goosegirl .  i really hated our farm .         oh .         and they expected me to marry my cousin when i was fifteen .         is that allowed .         oh  yes .  everyone marries their cousins where i come from .         why .     said victor .      i suppose it saves having to worry about what to do on saturday nights .         oh .           didn   t you want to be anything .     said ginger  putting a whole sentence worth of disdain in a mere three letters .      not really     said victor .     everything looks interesting until you do it .  then you find it   s just another job .  i bet even people like cohen the barbarian get up in the morning thinking     oh  no  not another day of crushing the jeweled thrones of the world beneath my sandalled feet .            is that what he does .     said ginger  interested despite herself .      according to the stories  yes .         why .         search me .  it   s just a job  i guess .      ginger picked up a handful of sand .  there were tiny white shells in it  which stayed behind as it trickled away between her fingers .      i remember when the circus came to our village     she said .     i was ten .  there was this girl with spangled tights .  she walked a tightrope .  she could even do somersaults on it .  everybody cheered and clapped .  they wouldn   t let me climb a tree  but they cheered her .  that   s when i decided .         ah     said victor  trying to keep up with the psychology of this .     you decided you wanted to be someone .         don   t be silly .  that   s when i decided i was going to be a lot more than just someone .      she threw the shells toward the sunset and laughed .     i   m going to be the most famous person in the world  everyone will fall in love with me  and i shall live forever .         it   s always best to know your own mind     said victor diplomatically .      you know what the greatest tragedy is in the whole world .     said ginger  not paying him the least attention .     it   s all the people who never find out what it is they really want to do or what it is they   re really good at .  it   s all the sons who become blacksmiths because their fathers were blacksmiths .  it   s all the people who could be really fantastic flute players who grow old and die without ever seeing a musical instrument  so they become bad plowmen instead .  it   s all the people with talents who never even find out .  maybe they are never even born in a time when it   s even possible to find out .      she took a deep breath .     it   s all the people who never get to know what it is they can really be .  it   s all the wasted chances .  well  holy wood is my chance  do you understand .  this is my time for getting .      victor nodded .     yes     he said .  magic for ordinary people  silverfish had called it .  a man turned a handle  and your life got changed .      and not just for me     ginger went on .     it   s a chance for all of us .  the people who aren   t wizards and kings and heroes .  holy wood   s like a big bubbling stew but this time different ingredients float to the top .  suddenly there   s all these new things for people to do .  do you know the theaters don   t allow women to act .  but holy wood does .  and in holy wood there   s jobs for trolls that don   t just involve hitting people .  and what did the handlemen do before they had handles to turn .      she waved a hand vaguely in the direction of ankh morpork   s distant glow .      now they   re trying to find ways of adding sound to moving pictures     she said     and out there are people who   ll turn out to be amazingly good at making  making   making soundies .  they don   t even know it yet   but they   re out there .  i can feel them .  they   re out there .      her eyes were glowing gold .  it might just be the sunset  victor thought  but        because of holy wood  hundreds of people are finding out what it is they really want to be     said ginger .     and thousands and thousands are getting a chance to forget themselves for an hour or so .  this whole damn world is being given a shake .         that   s it     said victor .     that   s what worries me .  it   s as though we   re being slotted in .  you think we   re using holy wood  but holy wood is using us .  all of us .         how .  why .         i don   t know  but           look at wizards     ginger went on  vibrating with indignation .     what good has their magic ever done anyone .         i think it sort of holds the world together       victor began .      they   re pretty good at magic flames and things  but can they make a loaf of bread .     ginger wasn   t in the mood for listening to anyone .      not for very long     said victor helplessly .      what does that mean .         something real like a loaf of bread contains a lot of   well   i suppose you   d call it energy     said victor .     it takes a massive amount of power to create that amount of energy .  you   d have to be a pretty good wizard to make a loaf that   d last in this world for more than a tiny part of a second .  but that   s not what magic is really about  you see     he added quickly     because this world is           who cares .     said ginger .     holy wood   s really doing things for ordinary people .  silver screen magic .         what   s come over you .  last night           that was then     said ginger impatiently .     don   t you see .  we could be going somewhere .  we could be becoming someone .  because of holy wood .  the world is our           lobster     said victor .   she waved a hand irritably .     any shellfish you like     she said .     i was thinking of oysters  actually .         were you .  i was thinking of lobsters .             bursaar .      i shouldn   t have to run around like this at my age  thought the bursar  scurrying down the corridor in answer to the archchancellor   s bellow .  why   s he so interested in the damn thing  anyway .  wretched pot .        coming  master     he trilled .   the archchancellor   s desk was covered with ancient documents .   when a wizard died  all his papers were stored in one of the outlying reaches of the library .  shelf after shelf of quietly moldering documents  the haunt of mysterious beetles and dry rot  stretched away into an unguessable distance .  everyone kept telling everyone that there was a wealth of material here for researchers  if only someone could find the time to do it .   the bursar was annoyed .  he couldn   t find the librarian anywhere .  the ape never seemed to be around these days .  he   d had to scrabble among the stuff himself .      i think this is the last  archchancellor     he said  tipping an avalanche of dusty paperwork onto the desk .  ridcully flailed at a cloud of moths .      paper  paper  paper     he muttered .     how many damn bits of paper in his stuff  eh .         er           archchancellor     said the bursar .     he kept a record .         look at this     said the archchancellor .        star enumerator         rev counter for use in ecclesiastical areas         swamp meter      swamp meter .  the man was mad .         he had a very tidy mind     said the bursar .      same thing .         is it  er  really important  archchancellor .     the bursar ventured .      damn thing shot pellets at me     said ridcully .     twice .         i   m sure it wasn   t  er  intended           i want to see how it was made  man .  just think of the sportin    possibilities .      the bursar tried to think of the possibilities .      i   m sure riktor didn   t intend to make any kind of offensive device     he ventured  hopelessly .      who gives a damn what he intended .  where is the thing now .         i had a couple of servants put sandbags around it .           good idea .  it   s           whumm   whumm     it was a muffled sound from the corridor .  the two wizards exchanged a meaningful glance .      whumm   whummwhumm .   the bursar held his breath .   plib  plib .   plib .   the archchancellor peered at the hourglass on the mantelpiece .     it   s doin    it every five minutes now     he said .      and it   s up to three shots     said the bursar .     i   ll have to order some more sandbags .      he flicked through a heap of paper .  a word caught his eye .   reality .   he glanced at the handwriting that flowed across the page .  it had a very small  cramped  deliberate look .  someone had told him that this was because numbers riktor had been an anal retentive .  the bursar didn   t know what that meant  and hoped never to find out .   another word was  measurement .  his gaze drifted upward  and took in the underlined title  some notes on the objective measurement of reality .   over the page was a diagram .  the bursar stared at it .      found anything .     said the archchancellor  without looking up .   the bursar shoved the paper up the sleeve of his robe .      nothing important     he said .       down below  the surf boomed on the beach .      and below the surface  the lobsters walked backward along the deep  drowned streets      victor threw another piece of driftwood onto the fire .  it burned blue with salt .      i don   t understand her     he said .     yesterday she was quite normal  today it   s all gone to her head .           bitches .     said gaspode  sympathetically .      oh  i wouldn   t go that far     said victor .     she   s just aloof .         loofs .     said gaspode .      that   s what intelligence does for your sex life     said don   t call me mr thumpy .     rabbits never have that sort of trouble .  go  sow  thank you doe .         you could try offering her a moushe     said the cat .      preshent company exchepted  of course     it added guiltily  trying to avoid definitely not squeak   s glare .      being intelligent hasn   t done my social life any favors  either     said mr .  thumpy bitterly .     a week ago  no problems .  now suddenly i want to make conversation  and all they do is sit there wrinklin    their noses at you .  you feel a right idiot .      there was a strangulated quacking .      the duck says  have you done anything about the book .     said gaspode .      i had a look at it when we broke for lunch     said victor .   there was another irritable quack .      the duck says  yes  but what have you done about it .     said gaspode .      look  i can   t go all the way to ankh morpork just like that     snapped victor .     it takes hours .  we film all day as it is .         ask for a day off     said mr .  thumpy .      no one asks for a day off in holy wood .     said victor .      i   ve been fired once  thank you .         and he took you on again at more money     said gaspode .      funny  that .     he scratched an ear .     tell him your contract says you can have a day off .         i haven   t got a contract .  you know that .  you work  you get paid .  it   s simple .         yeah     said gaspode .     yeah .  yeah .  a verbal contract .  it   s simple .  i like it .          toward the end of the night detritus the troll lurked awkwardly in the shadows by the back door of the blue lias .  strange passions had wracked his body all day .  every time he   d shut his eyes he kept seeing a figure shaped like a small hillock .   he had to face up to it .   detritus was in love .   yes  he   d spent many years in ankh morpork hitting people for money .  yes  it had been a friendless  brutalizing life .  and a lonely one  too .  he   d been resigned to an old age of bitter bachelorhood and suddenly  now  holy wood was handing him a chance he   d never dreamed of .   he   d been strictly brought up and he could dimly remember the lecture he   d been given by his father when he was a young troll .  if you saw a girl you liked  you didn   t just rush at her .  there were proper ways to go about things .   he   d gone down to the beach and found a rock .  but not any old rock .  he   d searched carefully  and found a large sea smoothed one with veins of pink and white quartz .  girls liked that sort of thing .   now he waited  shyly  for her to finish work .   he tried to think of what he would say .  no one had ever told him what to say .  it wasn   t as if he was a smart troll like rock or morry  who had a way with words .  basically  he   d never needed much of what you might call a vocabulary .  he kicked despondently at the sand .  what chance did he have with a smart lady like her .   there was a thump of heavy feet  and the door opened .  the object of desire stepped out into the night and took a deep breath  which had the same effect on detritus as an ice cube down the neck .   he gave his rock a panicky look .  it didn   t seem anything like big enough now  when you saw the size of her .  but maybe it was what you did with it that mattered .   well  this was it .  they said you never forgot your first time     he wound up his arm with the rock in it and hit her squarely between the eyes .     that   s when it all started to go wrong .   tradition said that the girl  when she was able to focus again  and if the rock was of an acceptable standard  should immediately be amenable to whatever the troll suggested  i . e .   a candle lit human for two  although of course that sort of thing wasn   t done anymore now  at least if there was any chance of being caught .   she shouldn   t narrow her eyes and catch him a ding across the ear that made his eyeballs rattle .      you stupid troll .     she shouted  as detritus staggered around in a circle .     what you do that for .  you think i unsophisticated girl just off mountain .  why you not do it right .         but  but     detritus began  in terror at her rage     i not able to ask father permission to hit you  not know where he living        ruby drew herself up haughtily .      all that old fashioned stuff very uncultured now     she sniffed .     it   s not the modern way .  i not interested in any troll     she added     that not up to date .  a rock on the head may be quite sentimental     she went on  the certainty draining out of her voice as she surveyed the sentence ahead of her     but diamonds are a girl   s best friend .     she hesitated .  that didn   t sound right  even to her .   it certainly puzzled detritus .      what .  you want i should knock my teeth out .     he said .      well  all right  not diamonds     ruby conceded .     but there proper modern ways now .  you got to court a girl .      detritus brightened .     ah  but i       he began .      that   s court  not caught     said ruby wearily .     you got to  to  to       she paused .   she wasn   t all that sure what you had to do .  but ruby had spent some weeks in holy wood  and if holy wood did anything  it changed things  in holy wood she   d plugged into a vast cross species female freemasonry she hadn   t suspected existed  and she was learning fast .  she   d talked at length to sympathetic human girls .  and dwarfs .  even dwarfs had better courtship rituals  for gods    sake .     and what humans got up to was amazing .   whereas all a female troll had to look forward to was a quick thump on the head and the rest of her life subduing and cooking anything the male dragged back to the cave .   well  there were going to be changes .  next time ruby went home the troll mountains were going to receive their biggest shake up since the last continental collision .  in the meantime  she was going to start with her own life .   she waved a massive hand in a vague way .      you got to  to sing outside a girl   s window     she said     and  and you got to give her oograah .         oograah .         yeah .  pretty oograah .        detritus scratched his head .      why .     he said .   ruby looked panicky for a moment .  she also couldn   t for the life of her imagine why the handing over of inedible vegetation was so important  but she wasn   t about to admit it .      fancy you not knowing that     she said scathingly .   the sarcasm was lost on detritus .  most things were .      right     he said .     i not so uncultured as you think     he added .     i bang up to date .  you wait and see .          hammering filled the air .  buildings were spreading backward from the nameless main street into the dunes .  no one owned any land in holy wood  if it was empty  you built on it .     dibbler had two offices now .  there was one where he shouted at people  and a bigger one just outside it where people shouted at each other .  soll shouted at handlemen .  handlemen shouted at alchemists .  demons wandered over every flat surface and drowned in the coffee cups and shouted at one another .  a couple of experimental green parrots shouted at themselves .  people wearing odd bits of costume wandered in and just shouted .  silverfish shouted because he couldn   t quite work out why he now had a desk in the outer office even though he owned the studio .   gaspode sat stolidly by the door to the inner office .  in the past five minutes he had attracted one half hearted kick  a soggy biscuit and a pat on the head .  he reckoned he was ahead of the game  dogwise .   he was trying to listen to all the conversation at once .  it was extremely instructive .  for one thing  some of the people coming in and shouting were carrying bags of money        you what .      the shout had come from the inner office .  gaspode cocked the other ear .      i  er  want a day off  mr dibbler     said victor .      a day off .  you don   t want to work .         just for the day  mr dibbler .         but you don   t think i   m going to go around paying people to have days off  do you .  i   m not made of money  you know .  it   s not as if we make a profit  even .  hold a crossbow to my head  why don   t you .      gaspode looked at the bags in front of soll  who was furiously adding up piles of coins .  he raised a cynical eyebrow .   there was a pause .  oh  no  thought gaspode .  the young idiot   s forgetting his lines .      i don   t want paying  mr dibbler .      gaspode relaxed .      you don   t want paying .         no  mr .  dibbler .           but you want a job when you get back  i suppose .     said dibbler sarcastically .   gaspode tensed .  victor had taken a lot of coaching .      well  i hope so  mr .  dibbler .  but i was thinking of going to see what untied alchemists had to offer .      there was a sound exactly like the sound of a chairback striking the wall .  gaspode grinned evilly .   another bag of money was dropped in front of soll .      untied alchemists .         they really look as if they   re making progress with soundies  mr .  dibbler     said victor meekly .      but they   re amateurs .  and crooks .      gaspode frowned .  he hadn   t been able to coach victor past this stage .      well  that   s a relief  mr .  dibbler .         why   s that .         well  it   d be dreadful if they were crooks and professional .      gaspode nodded .  nice one .  nice one .   there was the sound of footsteps hurrying around a desk .  when dibbler spoke next  you could have sunk a well in his voice and sold it at ten dollars a barrel .      victor .  vic .  haven   t i been like an uncle to you .      well  yes  thought gaspode .  he   s like an uncle to most people here .  that   s because they   re his nephews .   he stopped listening  partly because victor was going to get his day off and was very likely going to get paid for it as well  but mainly because another dog had been led into the room .   it was huge and glossy .  its coat shone like honey .   gaspode recognized it as pure bred ramtop hunting dog .  when it sat down beside him  it was as if a beautifully sleek racing yacht had slipped into a berth alongside a coal barge .   he heard soll say     so that is uncle   s latest idea  is it .  what   s it called .           laddie     said the handler .      how much was it .         sixty dollars .         for a dog .  we   re in the wrong business .         it can do all kinds of tricks  the breeder said .  bright as a button  he said .  just what mr .  dibbler is looking for .         well  tie it up there .  and if that other mutt starts a fight  kick it out .      gaspode gave soll a long  thoughtful scrutiny .  then  when the attention was no longer on them  he sidled closer to the newcomer  looked it up and down  and spoke quietly out of the corner of his mouth .      what you here for .     he said .   the dog gave him a look of handsome incomprehension .      i mean  do you b   long to someone or what .     said gaspode .   the dog whined softly .   gaspode tried basic canine  which is a combination of whines and sniffs .      hallo .     he ventured .     anyone in there .      the dog   s tail thumped uncertainly .      the grub here   s ruddy awful     said gaspode .   the dog raised its highly bred muzzle .      what dis place .     it said .      this is holy wood     said gaspode conversationally .     i   m gaspode .  named after the famous gaspode  you know .  anythin    you want to know  you just           all dese two legs here .  dur   what dis place .      gaspode stared .   at that moment dibbler   s door opened .  victor emerged  coughing  at one end of a cigar .      great  great     said dibbler  following him out .     knew we could sort it out .  don   t waste it  boy  don   t waste it .  they cost a dollar a box .  oh  i see you brought your little doggie .           woof     said gaspode  irritably .   the other dog gave a short sharp bark and sat up with obedient alertness radiating from every hair .      ah     said dibbler     and i see we   ve got our wonder dog .      gaspode   s apology for a tail twitched once or twice .   then the truth dawned .   he glared at the larger dog  opened his mouth to speak  caught himself just in time  and managed to turn it into a    bark .         i got the idea the other night  when i saw your dog     said dibbler .     i thought  people like animals .  me  i like dogs .  good image  the dog .  saving lives  man   s best friend  that kind of stuff .      victor looked at gaspode   s furious expression .      gaspode   s quite bright     he said .      oh  i expect you think he is     said dibbler .     but you   ve just got to look at the two of them .  on the one hand there   s this bright  alert  handsome animal  and on the other there   s this dust ball with a hangover .  i mean  no contest  am i right .      the wonder dog gave a brisk yap .      what dis place .  good boy laddie .      gaspode rolled his eyes .      see what i mean .     said dibbler .     give him the right name  a bit a training  and a star is born .     he slapped victor on the back again .     nice to see you  nice to see you  drop in again any time  only not too frequently  let   s have lunch sometime  now get out  soll .         coming  uncle .      victor was suddenly alone  apart from the dogs and the room full of people .  he took the cigar out of his mouth  spat on the glowing end  and carefully hid it behind a potted plant .      a star is whelped     said a small  withering voice from below .        what he say .  where dis place .         don   t look at me     said victor .     nothing to do with me .         will you just look at it .  i mean  are we talking thicko city here or what .     sneered gaspode .      good boy laddie .         come on     said victor .     i   m supposed to be on set in five minutes .      gaspode trailed after him  muttering under his horrible breath .  victor caught the occasional    old rug    and    man   s best friend    and    bloody wonder bloody dog .     finally  he couldn   t stand it any longer .      you   re just jealous     he said .      what  of an overgrown puppy with a single figure iq .     sneered gaspode .      and a glossy coat  cold nose and probably a pedigree as long as your ar   as my arm     said victor .      pedigree .  pedigree .  what   s a pedigree .  it   s just breedin    .  i had a father too  you know .  and two grandads .  and four great grandads .  and many of    em were the same dog  even .  so don   t you tell me from no pedigree     said gaspode .   he paused to cock a leg against one of the supports of the new    home of century of the fruitbat moving pictures    sign .   that was something else that had puzzled thomas silverfish .  he   d come in this morning  and the hand painted sign saying    interesting and instructive films    had gone and had been replaced by this huge billboard .  he was sitting back in the office with his head in his hands  trying to convince himself that it had been his idea .      i   m the one holy wood called     gaspode muttered  in a self pitying voice .     i came all the way here  and then they chose that great hairy thing .  probably it   ll work for a plate of meat a day  too .         well  look  maybe you weren   t called to holy wood to be a wonder dog     said victor .     maybe it   s got something else in mind for you .      this is ridiculous  he thought .  why are we talking about it like this .  a place hasn   t got a mind .  it can   t call people to it   well  unless you count things like homesickness .  but you can   t be homesick for a place you   ve never been to before  it stands to reason .  the last time people were here must have been thousands of years ago .   gaspode sniffed at a wall .      did you tell dibbler everything i told you .     he said .      yes .  he was very upset when i mentioned about going to untied alchemists .      gaspode sniggered .      an    you told him what i said about a verbal contract not being worth the paper it   s printed on .         yes .  he said he didn   t understand what i meant .  but he gave me a cigar .  and he said he   d pay for me and ginger to go to ankh morpork soon .  he said he   s got a really big picture planned .         what is it .     said gaspode suspiciously .      he didn   t say .         listen  lad     said gaspode     dibbler   s making a fortune .  i counted it .  there were five thousand  two hundred and seventy three dollars and fifty two pence on soll   s desk .  and you earned it .  well  you and ginger did .         gosh .         now  there   s some new words i want you to learn     said gaspode .     think you can .         i hope so .            per cent age of the gross        said gaspode .     there .  think you can remember it .            per cent age of the gross        said victor .      good lad .         what does it mean .         don   t you worry about that     said gaspode .     you just have to say it   s what you want  ok .  when the time   s right .         when will the time be right  then .     said victor .   gaspode grinned nastily .     oh  i reckon when dibbler   s just got a mouthful of food   d be favorite .          holy wood hill bustled like an ant heap .  on the seaward side fir wood studios were making the third gnome .  microlithic pictures  which was run almost entirely by the dwarfs  was hard at work on golde diggers of       which was going to be followed by the golde rushe .  floating bladder pictures was hard at work with turkey legs .  and borgle   s was packed out .      i don   t know what it   s called  but we   re doing one about going to see a wizard .  something about following a yellow sick toad     a man in one half of a lion suit explained to a companion in the queue .      no wizards in holy wood  i thought .         oh  this one   s all right .  he   s not very good at the wizarding .         so what   s new .      sound .  that was the problem .  alchemists toiled in sheds all over holy wood  screaming at parrots  pleading with mynah birds  constructing intricate bottles to trap sound and bounce it around harmlessly until it was time for it to be let out .  to the sporadic boom of octo cellulose exploding was added the occasional sob of exhaustion or scream of agony as an enraged parrot mistook a careless thumb for a nut .   the parrots weren   t the success they   d hoped for .  it was true that they could remember what they heard and repeat it after a fashion  but there was no way to turn them off and they were in the habit of ad libbing other sounds they   d heard or  dibbler suspected  had been taught by mischievous handlemen .  thus  brief snatches of romantic dialogue would be punctuated with cries of    waaaarrrk .  showusyerknickers .     and dibbler said he had no intention of making that kind of picture  at least at the moment .   sound .  whoever got sound first would rule holy wood  they said .  people were flocking to the clicks now  but people were fickle .  color was different .  color was just a matter of breeding demons who could paint fast enough .  it was sound that meant something new .   in the meantime  there were stop gap measures .  the dwarfs    studio had shunned the general practice of putting the dialogue on cards between scenes and had invented subtitles  which worked fine provided the performers remembered not to step too far forward and knock over the letters .   but if sound was missing  then the screen had to be filled from side to side with a feast for the eyes .  the sound of hammering was always holy wood   s background noise  but it redoubled now     the cities of the world were being built in holy wood .   untied alchemists started it  with a one tenth size wood and canvas replica of the great pyramid of tsort .  soon the backlots sprouted whole streets in ankh morpork  palaces from pseudopolis  castles from the hublands .  in some cases  the streets were painted on the back of the palaces  so that princes and peasants were separated by one thickness of painted sacking .   victor spent the rest of the morning working on a one reeler .  ginger hardly said a word to him  even after the obligatory kiss when he rescued her from whatever it was morry was supposed to be today .  whatever magic holy wood worked on them it wasn   t doing it today .  he was glad to get away .   afterward he wandered across the backlot to watch them putting laddie the wonder dog through his paces .   there was no doubt  as the graceful shape streaked like an arrow over obstacles and grabbed a trainer by a well padded arm  that here was a dog almost designed by nature for moving pictures .  he even barked photogenically .      an    do you know what he   s sayin    .     said a disgruntled voice beside victor .  it was gaspode  a picture of bow legged misery .        no .  what .     said victor .         me laddie .  me good boy .  good boy laddie        said gaspode .     makes you want to throw up  doesn   t it .         yes  but could you leap a six foot hurdle .     said victor .      that   s intelligent  is it .     said gaspode .     i always walk around   what   s that they   re doing now .         giving him his lunch  i think .         they call that lunch  do they .      victor watched gaspode stroll over and peer into the dog   s bowl .  laddie gave him a sideways look .  gaspode barked quietly .  laddie whined .  gaspode barked again .   there was a lengthy exchange of yaps .   then gaspode strolled back  and sat down beside victor .      watch this     he said .   laddie took the food bowl in his mouth  and turned it upside down .      disgustin    stuff     said gaspode .     all tubes and innards .  i wouldn   t give it to a dog  and i am one .         you made him tip out his own dinner .     said victor  horrified .      very obedient lad  i thought     said gaspode smugly .      what a nasty thing to do .         oh  no .  i give    im some advice  too .      laddie barked peremptorily at the people clustering around him .  victor heard them muttering .      dog don   t eat his dinner     came detritus    voice     dog go hungry .         don   t be daft .  mr .  dibbler says he   s worth more than we are .         perhaps it   s not what he   s used to .  i mean  a posh dog like him an    all .  it   s a bit yukky  isn   t it .         it dog food .  that what dogs are supposed to eat .         yeah  but is it wonder dog food .  what   re wonder dogs fed on .         mr dibbler   ll feed you to him if there   s any trouble .         all right  all right .  detritus  go around to borgle   s .  see what he   s got .  not the stuff he gives to the usual customers  mind .         that is the stuff he give to usual customers .         that   s what i mean .      five minutes later detritus trailed back carrying about nine pounds of raw steak .  it was dumped in the dog bowl .  the trainers looked at laddie .   laddie cocked an eye toward gaspode  who nodded almost imperceptibly .   the big dog put one foot on one end of the steak  took the other end in his mouth  and tore off a lump .  then he padded over the compound and dropped it respectfully in front of gaspode  who gave it a long  calculating stare .      well  i dunno     he said at last .     does that look like ten percent to you  victor .         you negotiated his dinner .      gaspode   s voice was muffled by meat .     i reckon ten percent is ver    fair .  very fair  in the circumstances .         you know  you really are a son of a bitch     said victor .      proud of it     said gaspode  indistinctly .  he bolted the last of the steak .     what shall we do now .         i   m supposed to get an early night .  we   re starting for ankh very early tomorrow     said victor doubtfully .      still not made any progress with the book .         no .         let me have a look  then .         can you read .         dunno .  never tried .      victor looked around them .  no one was paying him any attention .  they never did .  once the handles stopped turning  no one bothered about performers  it was like being temporarily invisible .   he sat down on a pile of lumber  opened the book randomly at an early page  and held it out in front of gaspode   s critical stare .   eventually the dog said     it   s got all marks on it .        victor sighed .     that   s writing     he said .   gaspode squinted .     what  all them little pictures .         early writing was like that .  people drew little pictures to represent ideas .         so   if there   s a lot of one picture  it means it   s an important idea .         what .  well  yes .  i suppose so .         like the dead man .      victor was lost .      the dead man on the beach .         no .  the dead man on the pages .  see .  everywhere  there   s the dead man .      victor gave him an odd look  and then turned the book around and peered at it .      where .  i don   t see any dead men .      gaspode snorted .      look  all over the page     he said .     he looks just like those tombs you get in old temples and stuff .  you know .  where they do this statchoo of the stiff lyin    on top of the tomb  with his arms crossed an    holdin    his sword .  dead noble .         good grief .  you   re right .  it does look sort of   dead           prob   ly all the writing   s goin    on about what a great guy he was when he was alive     said gaspode knowledgeably .      you know     slayer of thousands    stuff .  prob   ly he left a lot of money for priests to say prayers and light candles and sacrifice goats and stuff .  there used to be a lot of that sort of thing .  you know  you   d get dese guys whorin    and drinkin    and carryin    on regardless their whole life  and then when the old grim reaper starts sharpenin    his scythe they suddenly becomes all pious and pays a lot of priests to give their soul a quick wash and brush up and gen   rally keep on tellin    the gods what a decent chap they was .         gaspode .     said victor levelly .      what .           you were a performing dog .  how come you know all this stuff .         i ain   t just a pretty face .         you aren   t even a pretty face  gaspode .      the little dog shrugged .     i   ve always had eyes and ears     he said .     you   d be amazed  the stuff you see and hear when you   re a dog .  i dint know what any of it meant at the time  of course .  now i do .      victor stared at the pages again .  there certainly was a figure which  if you half closed your eyes  looked very much like a statue of a knight with his hands resting on his sword .      it might not mean a man     he said .     pictographic writing doesn   t work like that .  it   s all down to context  you see .     he racked his brains to think of some of the books he   d seen .      for example  in the agatean language the signs for    woman    and    slave    written down together actually mean    wife .         he looked closely at the page .  the dead man   or the sleeping man  or the standing man resting his hands on his sword  the figure was so stylized it was hard to be sure   seemed to appear beside another common picture .  he ran his finger along the line of pictograms .      see     he said     it could be the man figure is only part of a word .  see .  it   s always to the right of this other picture  which looks a bit like   a bit like a doorway  or something .  so it might really mean       he hesitated .        doorway man        he hazarded .   he turned the book slightly .      could be some old king     said gaspode .     could mean something like the man with the sword is imprisoned  or something .  or maybe it means watch out  there   s a man with a sword behind the door .  could mean anything  really .      victor squinted at the book again .     it   s funny     he said .     it doesn   t look dead .  just   not alive .  waiting to be alive .  a waiting man with a sword .        victor peered at the little man figure .  it had hardly any features  but still managed to look vaguely familiar .      you know     he said     it looks just like my uncle osric            clickaclickaclicka .  click .   the film spun to a standstill .  there was a thunder of applause  a stamping of feet and a barrage of empty banged grain bags .   in the very front row of the odium the librarian stared up at the now empty screen .  it was the fourth time that afternoon he   d watched shadow of the dessert  because there   s something about a    lb orangutan that doesn   t encourage people to order it out of the pit between houses .  a drift of peanut shells and screwed up paper bags lay around his feet .   the librarian loved the clicks .  they spoke to something in his soul .  he   d even started writing a story which he thought would make a very good moving picture .     everyone he showed it to said it was jolly good  often even before they   d read it .   but something about this click was worrying him .  he   d sat through it four times  and he was still worried .   he eased himself out of the three seats he was occupying and knuckled his way up the aisle and into the little room where bezam was rewinding the film .   bezam looked up as the door opened .      get out       he began  and then grinned desperately and said     hallo  sir .  pretty good click  eh .  we   ll be showing it again any minute now and   what the hell are you doing .  you can   t do that .      the librarian ripped the huge roll of film off the projector and pulled it through his leathery fingers  holding it up to the light .  bezam tried to snatch it back and got a palm in his chest that sat him firmly on the floor  where great coils of film piled up on top of him .   he watched in horror as the great ape grunted  grasped a piece of the film in both hands and  with two bites  edited it .  then the librarian picked him up  dusted him off  patted him on the head  thrust the great pile of unwound click into his helpless arms  and ambled swiftly out of the room with a few frames of film dangling from one paw .   bezam stared helplessly after him .      you   re banned .     he shouted  when he judged the ape to be safely out of earshot .   then he looked down at the two severed ends .   breaks in films weren   t unusual .  bezam had spent many a flustered few minutes feverishly cutting and pasting while the audience cheerfully stamped its feet and high spiritedly threw peanuts  knives and double headed axes at the screen .   he let the coils fall around him and reached for the scissors and glue .  at least   he found  after holding the two ends up to the lantern   the librarian hadn   t taken a very interesting bit .  odd  that .  bezam wouldn   t have put it past the ape to have taken a bit where the girl was definitely showing too much chest  or one of the fight scenes .  but all he   d wanted was a piece that showed the sons galloping down from their mountain fastness  in single file  on identical camels .      dunno what he wanted that for     he muttered  taking the lid off the glue pot .     it just shows a lot of rocks .          victor and gaspode stood among the sand dunes near the beach .      that   s where the driftwood hut is     said victor  pointing      and then if you look hard you can see there   s a sort of road pointing straight toward the hill .  but there   s nothing on the hill but the old trees .      gaspode looked back at holy wood bay .      funny it bein    circular     he said .        i thought so     said victor .      i heard once where there was this city that was so wicked that the gods turned it into a puddle of molten glass     said gaspode  apropos of nothing .     and the only person who saw it happen was turned into a pillar of salt by day and a cheese shaker by night .         gosh .  what had the people been doing .         dunno .  prob   ly not much .  it doesn   t take much to annoy gods .         me good boy .  good boy laddie .      the dog came streaking over the dunes  a comet of gold and orange hair .  it skidded to a halt in front of gaspode  and then began to dance around excitedly  yapping .      he   s escaped and he wants me to play with him     said gaspode despondently .     ridiculous  ain   t it .  laddie drop dead .      laddie rolled over obediently  all four legs in the air .      see .  he understands every word i say     muttered gaspode .      he likes you     said victor .      huh     sniffed gaspode .     how   re dogs ever goin    to amount to anything if they bounce around worshipping people just    cos they   ve been given a meal .  what   s he want me to do with this .  .      laddie had dropped a stick in front of gaspode and was looking at him expectantly .      he wants you to throw it     said victor .      what for .         so he can bring it back .         what i don   t understand     said gaspode  as victor picked up the stick and hurled it away  laddie racing along underneath it     is how come we   re descended from wolves .  i mean  your average wolf  he   s a bright bugger  know what i mean .  chock full of cunnin    an    like that .  we   re talking gray paws racing over the trackless tundra  is what i   m getting at .        gaspode looked wistfully at the distant mountains .     and suddenly a handful of generations later we   ve got percy the pup here with a cold nose  bright eyes  glossy coat and the brains of a stunned herring .         and you     said victor .  laddie whirled back in a storm of sand and dropped the damp stick in front of him .  victor picked it up and threw it again .  laddie bounded off  yapping himself sick with excitement .      well  yeah     said gaspode  ambling along in a bow legged swagger .     only i can look after myself .  it   s a dog eat dog world out there .  you think dopey the mutt there would last five minutes in ankh morpork .  he set one paw in some o    the streets  he   s three sets of fur gloves an    crispy fried no .     at the nearest klatchian all night carryout .      victor threw the stick again .      tell me     he said     who was the famous gaspode you   re named after .         you never heard of him .         no .         he was dead famous .         he was a dog .         yeah .  it was years and years ago .  there was this ole bloke in ankh who snuffed it  and he belonged to one of them religions where they bury you after you   re dead  an    they did  and he had this ole dog              called gaspode    .         yeah  and this ole dog had been his only companion and after they buried the man he lay down on his grave and howled and howled for a couple of weeks .  growled at everybody who came near .  an    then died .      victor paused in the act of throwing the stick again .      that   s very sad     he said .  he threw .  laddie tore along underneath it  and disappeared into a stand of scrubby trees on the hillside .      yeah .  everyone says it demonstrates a dog   s innocent and undyin    love for    is master     said gaspode  spitting the words out as if they were ashes .      you don   t believe that  then .         not really .  i b   lieve any bloody dog will stay still an    howl when you   ve just lowered the gravestone on his tail     said gaspode .   there was a ferocious barking .      don   t worry about it .  he   s probably found a threatening rock or something     said gaspode .   he   d found ginger .       the librarian knuckled purposefully through the maze of unseen university   s library and descended the steps toward the maximum security shelves .   nearly all the books in the library were  being magical  considerably more dangerous than ordinary books  most of them were chained to the bookcases to stop them flapping around .   but the lower levels        there they kept the rogue books  the books whose behavior or mere contents demanded a whole shelf  a whole room to themselves .  cannibal books  books which  it left on a shelf with their weaker brethren  would be found looking considerably fatter and more smug in the smoking ashes next morning .  books whose mere contents pages could reduce the unprotected mind to gray cheese .  books that were not just books of magic  but magical books .   there   s a lot of loose thinking about magic .  people go around talking about mystic harmonies and cosmic balances and unicorns  all of which is to real magic what a glove puppet is to the royal shakespeare company .   real magic is the hand around the bandsaw  the thrown spark in the powder keg  the dimension warp linking you straight into the heart of a star  the flaming sword that burns all the way down to the pommel .  sooner juggle torches in a tar pit than mess with real magic .  sooner lie down in front of a thousand elephants .   at least  that   s what wizards say  which is why they charge such swingeingly huge fees for getting involved with the bloody stuff .   but down here  in the dark tunnels  there was no hiding behind amulets and starry robes and pointy hats .  down here  you either had it or you didn   t .  and if you hadn   t got it  you   d had it .   there were sounds from behind the heavily barred doors as the librarian shuffled along .  once or twice something heavy threw itself against a door  making the hinges rattle .   there were noises .   the orangutan stopped in front of an arched doorway that was blocked with a door made not of wood but of stone  balanced so that it could easily be opened from outside but could withstand massive pressure from within .   he paused for a moment  and then reached into a little alcove and removed a mask of iron and smoked glass  which he put on  and a pair of heavy leather gloves reinforced with steel mesh .  there was also a torch made of oil soaked rags  he lit this from one of the flickering braziers in the tunnel .   at the back of the alcove was a brass key .   he took the key  and then he took a deep breath .   all the books of power had their own particular natures .  the octavo was harsh and imperious .  the bumper fun grimoire went in for deadly practical jokes .  the joy of tantric sex had to be kept under iced water .  the librarian knew them all  and how to deal with them .   this one was different .  usually people saw only tenth or twelfth hand copies  as like the real thing as a painting or an explosion was to  well  to an explosion .  this was a book that had absorbed the sheer  graphite gray evil of its subject matter .     its name was hacked in letters over the arch  lest men and apes forget .   necrotelicomnicon .   he put the key in the lock  and offered up a prayer to the gods .      oook     he said fervently .     oook .      the door swung open .   in the darkness within  a chain gave a faint clink .          she   s still breathing     said victor .  laddie leapt around them  barking furiously .      maybe you should loosen her clothing or something     said gaspode .     it   s just a thought     he added .     you don   t have to glare at me like that .  i   m a dog  what do i know .         she seems all right  but   look at her hands     said victor .     what the hell has she been trying to do .         tryin    to open that door     said gaspode .      what door .         that door there .      part of the hill had slipped away .  huge blocks of masonry protruded from the sand .  there were the stubs of ancient pillars  sticking up like fluoridated teeth .   between two of them was an arched doorway  three times as high as victor .  it was sealed with a pair of pale gray doors  either of stone or of wood that had become as hard as stone over the years .  one of them was slightly open  but had been prevented from opening further by the drifts of sand in front of it .  frantically scrabbled furrows had been dug deep into the sand .  ginger had been trying to shift it with her bare hands .      stupid thing to do in this heat     said victor  vaguely .  he looked from the door to the sea  and then down at gaspode .   laddie scrambled up the sand and barked excitedly at the crack between the doors .      what   s he doing that for .     said victor  suddenly feeling spooked .     all his hair is standing up .  you don   t think he   s got one of those mysterious animal premonitions of evil  do you .         i think he   s a pillock     said gaspode .     laddie shut up .      there was a yelp .  laddie recoiled from the door  lost his balance on the shifting sand  and rolled down the slope .  he leapt to his feet and started barking again  not ordinary stupid dog barking this time  but the genuine treed cat variety .   victor leaned forward and touched the door .   it felt very cold  despite the perpetual heat of holy wood  and there was just the faint suspicion of vibration .   he ran his fingers over the surface .  there was a roughness there  as though there had been a carving that had been worn into obscurity over the years .      a door like that     said gaspode  behind him     a door like that  if you want my opinion  a door like that  a door like that     he took a deep breath     bodes .         hmm .  what .  bodes what .         it don   t have to bode anything     said gaspode .     just basic bodingness is bad enough  take it from me .         it must have been important .  looks a bit temple ish     said victor .     why   d she want to open it .         bits of cliff sliding down an    mysterious doors appearin        said gaspode  shaking his head .     that   s a lot of boding .  let   s go somewhere far away and really think about it  eh .      ginger gave a groan .  victor crouched down .      what   d she say .         dunno     said gaspode .      it sounded like    i want to be a lawn     i thought .         daft .  touch of the sun there  i reckon     said gaspode knowledgeably .      maybe you   re right .  her head certainly feels very hot .     he picked her up  staggering a little under the weight .      come on     he managed .     let   s get down into the town .  it   ll be getting dark soon .     he looked around at the stunted trees .  the door lay in a sort of hollow  which presumably caught enough dew to make the growth there slightly less desiccated than elsewhere .      you know  this place looks familiar     he said .     we did our first click here .  it   s where i first met her .         very romantic     said gaspode distantly  hurrying away with laddie bounding happily around him .     if something    orrible comes out of that door  you can fink of it as our monster .         hey .  wait .         hurry up  then .         what would she want to be a lawn for  do you think .         beats me        after they had gone silence poured back into the hollow .   a little later  the sun set .  its long light hit the door  turning the merest scratches into deep relief .  with the help of imagination  they might just have formed the image of a man .   with a sword .   there was the faintest of noises as  grain by grain  sand trickled away from the door .  by midnight it had opened by at least a sixteenth of an inch .   holy wood dreamed .   it dreamed of waking up .       ruby damped down the fires under the vats  put the benches on the tables  and prepared to shut the blue lias .  but just before blowing out the last lamp she hesitated in front of the mirror .   he   d be waiting out there again tonight .  just like every night .  he   d been in during the evening  grinning to himself .  he was planning something .   ruby had been taking advice from some of the girls who worked in the clicks  and in addition to her feather boa she   d now invested in a broad rimmed hat with some sort of oograah  cherries she thought they were called  in it .  she   d been assured that the effect was stunning .     the trouble  she had to admit  was that he was  well  a very hunky troll .  for millions of years troll women had been naturally attracted to trolls built like a monolith with an apple on top .  ruby   s treacherous instincts were firing messages up her spine  insidiously insisting that in those long fangs and bandy legs was everything a troll girl could wish for in a mate .   trolls like rock or morry  of course  were far more modern and could do things like use a knife and fork  but there was something  well  reassuring about detritus .  perhaps it was the way his knuckles touched the ground so dynamically .  and apart from anything else  she was sure she was brighter than he was .  there was a sort of gormless unstoppability about him that she found rather fascinating .  that was the instincts at work again   intelligence has never been a particularly valuable survival trait in a troll .   and she had to admit that  whatever she might attempt in the way of feather boas and fancy hats  she was pushing     and was     lbs above the fashionable weight .   if only he   d buck his ideas up .   or at least  buck one idea up .   maybe this make up the girls had been talking about could be worth a try .   she sighed  blew out the lamp  opened the door and stepped out into a maze of roots .   a gigantic tree stretched the whole length of the alley .  he must have dragged it for miles .  the few surviving branches poked through windows or waved forlornly in the air .   in the middle of it all was detritus  perched proudly on the trunk  his face split in a watermelon grin  his arms spread wide .      tra laa .     he said .   ruby heaved a gigantic sigh .  romance wasn   t easy  when you were a troll .       the librarian forced the page open and chained it down .  the book tried to snap at him .   its contents had made it what it was .  evil and treacherous .   it contained forbidden knowledge .   well  not actually forbidden .  no one had ever gone so far as forbidding it .  apart from anything else  in order to forbid it you   d have to know what it was  which was forbidden .  but it definitely contained the sort of information which  once you knew it  you wished you hadn   t .      legend said that any mortal man who read more than a few lines of the original copy would die insane .   this was certainly true .   legend also said that the book contained illustrations that would make a strong man   s brain dribble out of his ears .   this was probably true  too .   legend went on to say that merely opening the necrotelicomnicon would cause a man   s flesh to crawl off his hand and up his arm .   no one actually knew if this was true  but it sounded horrible enough to be true and no one was about to try any experiments .   legend had a lot to say about the necrotelicomnicon  in fact  but absolutely nothing to say about orangutans  who could tear the book into little bits and chew it for all legend cared .  the worst that had ever happened to the librarian after looking at it was a mild migraine and a touch of eczema  but that was no reason to take chances .  he adjusted the smoked glass of the visor and ran one black leather finger down the index  the words bridled as the digit slid past  and tried to bite it .   occasionally he   d hold the strip of film up to the light of the flickering torch .       the wind and sand had blurred them  but there was no doubt that there were carvings on the rock .  and the librarian had seen designs like that before .   he found the reference he was looking for and  after a brief struggle during which he had to threaten the necrotelicomnicon with the torch  forced the book to turn to the page .   he peered closer .   good old achmed the i just get these headaches           and in that hill  it is said  a door out of the world was found  and people of the city watched what was seen therein  knowing not that dread waited between the universes        the librarian   s fingertip dragged from right to left across the pictures  and skipped to the next paragraph .         for others found the gate of holy wood and fell upon the world  and in one nighte all manner of madnesse befell  and chaos prevailed  and the city sank beneath the sea  and all became one withe the fishes and the lobsters save for the few who fled        he curled a lip  and looked further down the page .         a golden warrior  who drove the fiends back and saved the world  and said  where the gate is  there am i also  i am he that was born of holy wood  to guard the wild idea .  and they said  what must we do to destroy the gate forever  and he said unto them  this you cannot do  for it is not a thing  but i will guard the gate for you .  and they  not having been born yesterday  and fearing the cure more than the malady  said to him  what will you take from us  that you will guard the door .  and he grew until he was the height of a tree and said  only your remembrance  that i do not sleep .  three times a day will you remember holy wood .  else the cities of the world will tremble and fall  and you will see the greatest of them all in flames .  and with that the golden man took up his golden sword and went into the hill and stood at the gate  forever .      and the people said to one another  funny  he lookes just like my uncle osbert        the librarian turned the page .         but there were among them  humans and animals alike  those touched by the magic of holy wood .  it goeth through the generations like an ancient curse  until the priests cease in their remembrance and the golden man sleepeth .  then let the world beware        the librarian let the book snap shut .   it wasn   t an uncommon legend .  he   d read it before   at least  had read most of it   in books considerably less dangerous than this .  you came across variants in all the cities of the sto plain .  there had been a city once  in the mists of pre history   bigger than ankh morpork  if that were possible .  and the inhabitants had done something  some sort of unspeakable crime not just against mankind or the gods but against the very nature of the universe itself  which had been so dreadful that it had sunk beneath the sea one stormy night .  only a few people had survived to carry to the barbarian peoples in the less advanced parts of the disc all the arts and crafts of civilization  such as usury and macrame .   no one had ever really taken it seriously .  it was just one of those usual    if you don   t stop it you   ll go blind    myths that civilizations tended to hand on to their descendants .  after all  ankh morpork itself was generally considered as wicked a city as you could hope to find in a year of shore leaves  and seemed to have avoided any kind of supernatural vengeance  although it was always possible that it had taken place and no one had noticed .   legend had always put the nameless city far away and long ago .   no one knew where it was  or even if it had existed .   the librarian glanced at the symbols again .   they were very familiar .  they were on the old ruins all over holy wood .       azhural stood on a low hill  watching the sea of elephants move below him .  here and there a supply wagon bobbed between the dusty gray bodies like a rudderless boat .  a mile of veldt was being churned into a soggy mud wallow  bare of grass   although  by the smell of it  it   d be the greenest patch on the disc after the rains came .   he dabbed at his eyes with a corner of his robe .   three hundred and sixty three .  who   d have thought it .   the air was solid with the piqued trumpeting of three hundred and sixty three elephants .  and with the hunting and trapping parties already going on ahead  there should be plenty more .  according to m   bu  anyway .  and he wasn   t going to argue .   funny  that .  for years he   d thought of m   bu as a sort of mobile smile .  a handy lad with a brush and shovel  but not what you might call a major achiever .   and then suddenly someone somewhere wanted a thousand elephants  and the lad had raised his head and a gleam had come into his eye and you could see that under that grin was a skilled kilopachydermatolist ready to answer the call .  funny .  you could know someone for their whole life and not realize that the gods had put them in this world to move a thousand elephants around the place .   azhural had no sons .  he   d already made up his mind to leave everything to his assistant .  everything he had at this point amounted to three hundred and sixty three elephants and  ahaha  a mammoth overdraft  but it was the thought that counted .   m   bu trotted up the path toward him  his clipboard held firmly under one arm .      everything ready  boss     he said .     you just got to say the word .      azhural drew himself up .  he looked around at the heaving plain  the distant baobab trees  the purple mountains .  oh  yes .  the mountains .  he   d had misgivings about the mountains .  he   d mentioned them to m   bu  who said     we   ll cross them bridges when we get to    em  boss     and when azhural had pointed out that there weren   t any bridges  had looked him squarely in the eye and said firmly     first we build them bridge  then we cross    em .      far beyond the mountains was the circle sea and ankh morpork and this holy wood place .  far away places with strange sounding names .   a wind blew across the veldt  carrying faint whispers  even here .   azhural raised his staff .      it   s fifteen hundred miles to ankh morpork     he said .     we   ve got three hundred and sixty three elephants  fifty carts of forage  the monsoon   s about to break and we   re wearing   we   re wearing   sort of things  like glass  only dark   dark glass things on our eyes       his voice trailed off .  his brow furrowed  as if he   d just been listening to his own voice and hadn   t understood it .   the air seemed to glitter .   he saw m   bu staring at him .   he shrugged .     let   s go     he said .   m   bu cupped his hands .  he   d spent all night working out the order of the march .      blue section bilong uncle n   gru   forward .     he shouted .     yellow section bilong aunti googool   forward .  green section bilong second cousin .  kck .    forward          an hour later the veldt in front of the low hill was deserted except for a billion flies and one dung beetle who couldn   t believe his luck .   something went    plop    on the red dust  throwing up a little crater .   and again  and again .   lightning split the trunk of a nearby baobab .   the rains began .       victor   s back was beginning to ache .  carrying young women to safety looked a good idea on paper  but had major drawbacks after the first hundred yards .      have you any idea where she lives .     he said .     and is it somewhere close .         no idea     said gaspode .      she once said something about it being over a clothes shop     said victor .      that   ll be in the alley alongside borgle   s then     said gaspode .   gaspode and laddie led the way through the alleys and up a rickety outside staircase .  maybe they smelled out ginger   s room .  victor wasn   t going to argue with mysterious animal senses .   victor went up the back stairs as quietly as possible .  he was dimly aware that where people stayed was often infested by the common or greatly suspicious landlady  and he felt that he had enough problems as it was .   he used ginger   s feet to push open the door .   it was a small room  low ceilinged and furnished with the sad  washed out furniture found in rented rooms across the multiverse .  at least  that   s how it had started out .   what it was furnished with now was ginger .       she had saved every poster .  even those from early clicks  when she was just in very small print as a girl .  they were thumb tacked to the walls .  ginger   s face   and his own   stared at him from every angle .   there was a large mirror at one end of the poky room  and a couple of half burned candles in front of him .   victor deposited the girl carefully on the narrow bed and then stared around him  very carefully .  his sixth  seventh and eighth senses were screaming at him .  he was in a place of magic .      it   s like a sort of temple     he said .     a temple to   herself .         it gives me the willies     said gaspode .   victor stared .  maybe he   d always successfully avoided being awarded the pointy hat and big staff  but he had acquired wizard instincts .  he had a sudden vision of a city under the sea  with octopuses curling stealthily through the drowned doorways and lobsters watching the streets .      fate don   t like it when people take up more space than they ought to .  everyone knows that .      i   m going to be the most famous person in the whole world  thought victor .  that   s what she said .  he shook his head .      no     he said aloud .     she just likes posters .  it   s just ordinary vanity .      it didn   t sound believable  even to him .  the room fairly hummed with        what .  he hadn   t felt anything like it before .  power of some sort  certainly .  something that was brushing tantalizingly against his senses .  not exactly magic .  at least  not the kind he was used to .  but something that seemed similar while not being the same  like sugar compared with salt  the same shape and the same color  but     ambition wasn   t magical .  powerful  yes  but not magical   surely .   magic wasn   t difficult .  that was the big secret that the whole baroque edifice of wizardry had been set up to conceal .  anyone with a bit of intelligence and enough perseverance could do magic  which was why the wizards cloaked it with rituals and the whole pointy hat business .   the trick was to do magic and get away with it .   because it was as if the human race was a field of corn and magic helped the users grow just that bit taller  so that they stood out .  that attracted the attention of the gods and   victor hesitated   other things outside this world .  people who used magic without knowing what they were doing usually came to a sticky end .   all over the entire room  sometimes .   he pictured ginger  back on the beach .  i want to be the most famous person in the whole world .  perhaps that was something new  come to think of it .  not ambition for gold  or power  or land or all the things that were familiar parts of the human world .  just ambition to be yourself  as big as possible .  not ambition for  but to be .   he shook his head .  he was just in some room in some cheap building in some town that was about as real as  as  as  well  as the thickness of a click .  it wasn   t the place to have thoughts like this .   the important thing was to remember that holy wood wasn   t a real place at all .   he stared at the posters again .  you just get one chance  she said .  you live for maybe seventy years  and if you   re lucky you get one chance .  think of all the natural skiers who are born in deserts .  think of all the genius blacksmiths who were born hundreds of years before anyone invented the horse .  all the skills that are never used .  all the wasted chances .   how lucky for me  he thought gloomily  that i happen to be alive at this time .   ginger turned over in her sleep .  at least her breathing was more regular now .      come on     said gaspode .     it   s not right  you being alone in a lady   s boodwah .           i   m not alone     victor said .     she   s with me .         that   s the point     said gaspode .      woof     laddie added  loyally .      you know     said victor  following the dogs down the stairs     i   m beginning to feel there   s something wrong here .  there   s something going on and i don   t know what it is .  why was she trying to get into the hill .         prob   ly in league with dread powers     said gaspode .      the city and the hill and the old book and everything     said victor  ignoring this .     it all makes sense if only i knew what was connecting it .      he stepped out into the early evening  into the lights and noise of holy wood .      tomorrow we   ll go up there in the daylight and sort this out once and for all     he said .      no  we won   t     said gaspode .     the reason being  tomorrow we   re goin    to ankh morpork  remember .         we .     said victor .     ginger and i are going .  i didn   t know about you .         laddie goin     too     said gaspode .     i           good boy laddie .         yeah  yeah .  i heard the trainers say .  so i   ve got to go with him to see he don   t get into any trouble  style of fing .      victor yawned .     well  i   m going to go to bed .  we   ll probably have to start early .      gaspode looked innocently up and down the alley .  somewhere a door opened and there was the sound of drunken laughter .      i fought i might have a bit of a stroll before turnin    in     he said .     show laddie           laddie good boy .            the sights and that .      victor looked doubtful .      don   t keep him out too late     he said .     people will worry .         yeah  right     said gaspode .     g   night .        he sat and watched victor wander off .      huh     he said  under his dreadful breath .     catch anyone worryin    about me .     he glared up at laddie  who sprang to obedient attention .      right  young fella me pup     he said .        s time you got educated .  lesson one  glomming free drinks in bars .  it   s lucky for you     he added     that you met me .          two canine shapes staggered uncertainly up the midnight street .      we   re poor li   l lambs     gaspode howled     wot have loorst our way           woof .  woof .  woof .         we   re li   l loorst sheeps wot have   wot have       gaspode sagged down  and scratched an ear  or at least where he vaguely thought an ear might be .  his leg waved uncertainly in the air .  laddie gave him a sympathetic look .   it had been an amazingly successful evening .  gaspode had always got his free drinks by simply sitting and staring intently at people until they got uncomfortable and poured him some beer in a saucer in the hope that he would drink it and go away .  it was slow and tedious  but as a technique it had served him well .  whereas laddie     laddie did tricks .  laddie could drink out of bottles  laddie could bark the number of fingers people held up  so could gaspode  of course  but it had never occurred to him that such an activity could be rewarded .   laddie could home in on young women who were being taken out for the evening by a hopeful swain and lay his head on their lap and give them such a soulful look that the swain would buy him a saucer of beer and a bag of goldfish shaped biscuits just in order to impress the prospective loved one .  gaspode had never been able to do that  because he was too short for laps and  anyway  got nothing but disgusted screams if he tried it .   he   d sat under the table in perplexed disapproval to begin with  and then in alcoholic perplexed disapproval  because laddie was generosity itself when it came to sharing saucers of beer .   now  after they   d both been thrown out  gaspode decided it was time for a lecture in true dogness .      you don   t want to go himblong .  umlong .  humbling yourself to    umans     he said .     it   s letting everyone down .  we   ll never frow off the shackles of dependency on mankind if dogs like you go aroun    bein    glad to see people the whole time .  i was person   ly disgusted when you did that lyin    on your back and playin    dead routine  let me tell you .         woof .         you   re just a running dog of the human imperialists     said gaspode severely .   laddie put his paws over his nose .   gaspode tried to stand up  tripped over his legs  and sat down heavily .  after a while a couple of huge tears coursed down his fur .      o   course     he said     i never had a chance  you know .     he managed to get back on all four feet .     i mean  look at the start i had in life .  frone inna river inna sack .  an actual sack .  dear little puppy dog opens his eyes  look out in wonder at the world  style of fing  he   s in this sack .     the tears dripped off his nose .     for two weeks i thought the brick was my mother .         woof     said laddie  with uncomprehending sympathy .      just my luck they threw me in the ankh     gaspode went on .     any other river  i   d have drowned and gone to doggy heaven .  i heard where this big black ghostly dog comes up to you when you die an    says  your time has gome .  cone .  come .      gaspode stared at nothing much .     can   t sink in the ankh  though     he said thoughtfully .     ver    tough river  the ankh .           woof .         it shouldn   t happen to a dog     said gaspode .     metaphorically .         woof .      gaspode peered blearily at laddie   s bright  alert and irrevocably stupid face .      you don   t understand a bloody word i   ve been saying  do you .     he muttered .      woof .     said laddie  begging .      lucky bugger     sighed gaspode .   there was a commotion at the other end of the alley .  he heard a voice say     there he is .  here  laddie .  here  boy .     the words dripped relief .      it   s the man     growled gaspode .     you don   t have to go .         good boy laddie .  laddie good boy .     barked laddie  trotting forward obediently  if a little unsteadily .      we   ve been looking for you everywhere .     muttered one of the trainers  raising a stick .      don   t hit it .     said the other trainer .     you   ll ruin everything .     he peered into the alley  and met gaspode   s stare coming the other way .      that   s the fleabag that   s been hanging around     he said .      it gives me the creeps .         heave something at it     suggested the other man .   the trainer reached down and picked up a stone .  when he stood up again the alley was empty .  drunk or sober  gaspode had perfect reflexes in certain circumstances .      see .     the trainer said  glaring at the shadows .     it   s like it   s some kind of mind reader .         it   s just a mutt     said his companion .     don   t worry about it .  come on  get the leash on this one and let   s get him back before mr .  dibbler finds out .      laddie followed them obediently back to century of the fruitbat  and allowed himself to be chained up to his kennel .  possibly he didn   t like the idea  but it was hard to be sure in the network of duties  obligations and vague emotional shadows that made up what  for want of a better word  had to be called his mind .   he pulled experimentally on the chain once or twice  and then lay down  awaiting developments .   after a while a small hoarse voice on the other side of the fence said     i could send you a bone with a file in it  only you   d eat it .      laddie perked up .      good boy laddie .  good boy gaspode .         ssh .  ssh .  at least they ort to let you speak to a lawyer     said gaspode .     chaining someone up   s against human rights .         woof .         anyway  i paid    em back .  i followed the    orrible one back to his house an    piddled all down his front door .         woof .      gaspode sighed  and waddled away .  sometimes  in his heart of hearts  he wondered whether it wouldn   t after all be nice to belong to someone .  not just be owned by them or chained up by them  but actually belong  so that you were glad to see them and carried their slippers in your mouth and pined away when they died  etc .   laddie actually liked that kind of stuff  if you could call it    liked     it was more like something built into his bones .  gaspode wondered darkly if this was true dogness  and growled deep in his throat .  it wasn   t  if he had anything to do with it .  because true dogness wasn   t about slippers and walkies and pining for people  gaspode was sure .  dogness was about being tough and independent and mean .   yeah .   gaspode had heard that all canines could interbreed  even back to the original wolves  so that must mean that  deep down inside  every dog was a wolf .  you could make a dog out of a wolf  but you couldn   t take the wolf out of a dog .  when the hardpad was acting up and the fleas were feisty and acting full of plumptiousness  it was a comforting thought .   gaspode wondered how you went about mating with a wolf  and what happened to you when you stopped .   well  that didn   t matter .  what mattered was that true dogs didn   t go around going mad with pleasure just because a human said something to them .   yeah .   he growled at a pile of trash and dared it to disagree .   part of the pile moved  and a feline face with a defunct fish in its mouth peered out at him .  he was just about to bark half heartedly at it  for tradition   s sake  when it spat the fish out and spoke to him .      hallo  gathpode .      gaspode relaxed .     oh .  hallo  cat .  no offense meant .  didn   t know it was you .         i hateth fisth     said the cat     but at leasth they don   t talk back .      another part of the trash moved and squeak the mouse emerged .      what   re you two doin    down here .     said gaspode .     i thought you said it was safer on the hill .         not anymore     said the cat .     it   sh getting too shpooky .      gaspode frowned .     you   re a cat     he said disapprovingly .      you ort to be right alongside the idea of spooky .         yeah  but that doesh   nt exhtend to having golden sparks crackling off your fur and the ground shaking the whole time .  and weird voices that you think must be happening in your own head     said cat .     it   s becoming eldritch up there .         so we all came down     said squeak .     mr .  thumpy and the duck are hiding out in the dunes        another cat dropped off the fence beside them .  it was large and ginger and not blessed with holy wood intelligence .  it stared at the sight of a mouse looking relaxed in the presence of a cat .   squeak nudged cat on the paw .     get rid of it     he said .     cat glared at the newcomer .     sod off     he said .     go on  beat it .  gods  thish ish so humiliating .         not just for you     said gaspode  as the new cat trotted away shaking its head .     if some of the dogs in this town see me chatting to a cat  my street cred is going to go way down .         we were reckoning     said the cat  with the occasional nervous glance toward squeak     that maybe we ought to give in and see if  see if  see if           he   s trying to say there might be a place for us in moving pictures     said squeak .     what do you think .         as a double act .     said gaspode .  they nodded .      not a chance     he said .     who   s going to pay good money to see cats and mice chasing one another .  they   re only interested even in dogs if they jus    pander to humans the whole time  so they certainly ain   t going to watch a cat chase a mouse .  take it from me .  i know about movin    pictures .         then it   s about time your humans got it sorted out so we can go home     snapped the mouse .     the boy isn   t doing anything .         he   s useless     said the mouse .      he   s in love     said gaspode .     it   s very tricky .         yeah  i know how it ish     said the cat sympathetically .      people throwing old boots and things at you .         old boots .     said the mouse .      that   sh what   s always happened to me when i   ve been in love     said cat wistfully .      it   s different for humans     said gaspode uncertainly .      you don   t get so many boots and buckets of water thrown at you .  it   s more  er  flowers and arguing and stuff .      the animals looked glumly at one another .      i   ve watched    em     said squeak .     she thinks he   s a idiot .         that   s all part of it     added gaspode .     they call it romance .        cat shrugged .     give me a boot every time .  you know where you stand  with a boot .          the glittering spirit of holy wood streamed out into the world  no longer a trickle but a flood .  it bubbled in the veins of people  even of animals .  when the handlemen turned their handles  it was there .  when the carpenters hammered their nails  they hammered for holy wood .  holy wood was in borgle   s stew  in the sand  in the air .  it was growing .   and it was going to flower     cut me own throat dibbler  or c . m . o . t .  as he liked to be called  sat up in bed and stared at the darkness .   in his head a city was on fire .   he fumbled hurriedly beside his bed for the matches  managed to light the candle  and eventually located a pen .   there was no paper .  he specifically told everyone there ought to be some paper by his bed  in case he woke up with an idea .  that   s when you got the best ideas  when you were asleep .   at least there was a pen and ink     images sleeted past his eyes .  catch them now  or let them go forever     he snatched up the pen and started to scribble on the bedsheets .   a man and a woman aflame with passione in a citie riven by sivil war .   the pen scritched and spluttered its way across the coarse linen .   yes .  yes .  this was it .   he   d show    em  with their silly plaster pyramids and penny and dime palaces .  this was the one they   d have to look up to .  when the history of holy wood was written this was the one they   d point to and say  that was the moving picture to end all moving pictures .     trolls .  battles .  romance .  people with thin mustaches .  soldiers of fortune .  and one woman   s fight to keep the   dibbler hesitated   something or other she loves  we   ll think about this later  in a world gone mad .   the pen jerked and tore and raced onward .   brother against brother .  women in crinoline dresses slapping people   s faces .  a mighty dynasty brought low .   a great city aflame .  not with passione  he made a note in the margin  but with flame .   possibly even     he bit his lip .   yeah .  he   d been waiting for this .  yeah .   a thousand elephants .    later soll dibbler said     look  uncle  the ankh morpork civil war   great idea .  no problem with that .  famous historical occurrence  no problem .  it   s just that none of the historians mentioned seeing any elephants .         it was a big war     said dibbler defensively .     you   re bound to miss things .         not a thousand elephants  i think .         who   s running this studio .         it   s just that           listen     said dibbler .     maybe they didn   t have a thousand elephants  but we   re going to have a thousand elephants     cos a thousand elephants is more real  ok .       the sheet gradually filled up with dibbler   s excited scrawl .  he reached the bottom and continued over the woodwork of the bed .   by the gods  this was the real stuff .  no fiddly little battles here .  they   d need just about every handleman in holy wood .   he sat back  panting with exhilarated exhaustion .   he could see it now .  it was as good as made .   all it needed was a title .  something with a ring to it .  something that people would remember .  something   he scratched his chin with the pen   that said that the affairs of ordinary people were so much chaff in the great storms of history .  storms  that was it .  good imagery  a storm .  you got thunder .  lightning .  rain .  wind .   wind .  that was it .   he crawled up to the top of the sheet and  with great care  wrote   blown away .       victor tossed and turned in his narrow bed  trying to get to sleep .  images marched through his half dozing mind .  there were chariot races and pirate ships and things he couldn   t identify  and in the middle of it all this thing  climbing a tower .  something huge and terrible  grinning defiance at the world .  and someone screaming     he sat up  drenched in sweat .   after a few minutes he swung his legs out of bed and went to the window .   above the lights of the town holy wood hill brooded in the first dim light of dawn .  it was going to be another fine day .       holy wood dreams surged through the streets  in great invisible golden waves .   and something came with it .   something that never  never dreamed at all .  something that never went to sleep .   ginger got out of bed and also looked toward the hill  although it is doubtful if she saw it .  moving like a sightless person in a familiar room  she padded across to the door  down the steps  and out into the tail of the night .   a small dog  a cat and a mouse watched from the shadows as she moved silently down the alley and headed for the hill .      did you see her eyes .     said gaspode .      glowing     said the cat .     yukth .         she   s going to the hill     said gaspode .     i don   t like that .         so what .     said squeak .     she   s always around the hill somewhere .  goes up there every night and moons around looking dramatic .         what .         every night .  we thought it was all this romance stuff .         but you can see by the way she   s movin    that somethin   s not right     said gaspode desperately .     that   s not walkin     that   s lurchin    .  like she   s bein    pulled along by a inner voice  style of fing .         don   t look like that to me     said squeak .     walking on two legs is lurching  in my book .         you   ve only got to look at her face to see there   s somethin    wrong .         of course there   s something wrong .  she   s a human     said squeak .   gaspode considered the options .  there weren   t many .  the obvious one was to find victor and get him to come back here .  he rejected it .  it sounded too much like the silly  bouncy sort of thing that laddie would do .  it suggested that the best a dog could think of when confronted with a puzzle was to find a human to solve it .   he trotted forward and gripped the trailing hem of the sleepwalker   s nightdress firmly in his jaws .  she walked on  pulling him off his feet .  the cat laughed  far too sarcastically for gaspode   s liking .      time to wake up  miss     he growled  letting the nightdress go .  ginger strode onward .      see .     said the cat .     give them an opposed thumb and they think they   re something shpecial .         i   m going to follow her     said gaspode .     a girl could come to harm out by herself at night .         that   s dogs for you     said the cat to squeak .     alwaysh fawning on people .  it   ll be diamante collars and a bowl with his name on it nexsht  i   m telling you .         if you   re lookin   to lose a mouthful of fur you   ve come to the right place  kitty     snarled gaspode  barring his rotting teeth again .        i don   t have to tolerate that short of thing     said the cat  lifting its nose haughtily .     come  squeak .  let us hie us to a garbage heap where there ain   t sho much rubbish .      gaspode scowled at their departing backs .      pussy .     he yelled after them .   then he trotted after ginger  hating himself .  if i was a wolf  which technic   ly i am  he thought  there   d definitely be a rending of jaws and similar .  any girl wandering around by herself would be in dead trouble .  i could attack  i could attack any time i liked  i   m jus    choosing not to .  one thing i   m not doin     i   m not sort of keepin    an eye on her .  i know victor told me to keep an eye on her  but catch me goin    around doin    what humans tell me .  i   d like to see humans that could give me orders .  tear his froat out  jus    like that .  hah .   an    if anything happened to her he   d go around moonin    for days and prob   ly forget to feed me .  not that dogs like me needs humans to feed    em  i could be out bringing down reindeers just by leaping on their backs and bitin    their jugulars off  but it   s damn convenient getting it all on a plate .   she was moving quite fast .  gaspode   s tongue hung out as he strove to keep up .  his head was aching .   he risked a few sideways squints to see if any other dogs were watching .  if they were  he thought  he could pretend he was chasin    her .  which was what he was doing  anyway .  yeah .  the trouble was  he never had much breath at the best of times  and it was getting hard to keep pace .  she ought to have the decency to slow down a bit .   ginger began to climb the lower slopes of the hill .   gaspode considered barking loudly  and then if anyone drew attention to this afterward he could always say it was to frighten her .  trouble was  he had about enough wind left for a threatening wheeze .   ginger topped a rise and went down into the little dell among the trees .     gaspode staggered after her  righted himself  opened his mouth to whimper a warning  and almost swallowed his tongue .   the door had opened several inches .  more sand rolled down the heap even as gaspode watched .   and he could hear voices .  they didn   t seem to be speaking words but the bones of words  meaning without disguise .  they hummed around his bullet head like mendicant mosquitoes  begging and cajoling and        he was the most famous dog in the world .  the knots unraveled from his coat  the frayed patches sprouted glossy curls  his fur grew on his suddenly supple frame and withdrew from his teeth .  plates appeared in front of him not laden with the multi colored and mysterious organs that he was normally expected to eat but with dark red steak .  there was sweet water  no  there was beer in a bowl with his name on it .  tantalizing odors on the air suggested that a number of lady dogs would be happy to make his acquaintance after he had drunk and dined .  thousands of people thought he was marvelous .  he had a collar with his name on it  and     no  that couldn   t be right .  not a collar .  it   d be a squeaky toy next  if you dint draw the line at collars .   the image collapsed in confusion  and now        the pack bounded through the dark  snow covered trees  falling in behind him  red mouths agape  long legs eating up the road .  the fleeing humans on the sledge didn   t have a chance  one was thrown aside when a runner bounced off a branch  and lay screaming in the road as gaspode and the wolves fell upon     no  that wasn   t right  he thought wretchedly .  you dint actually eat humans .  they got up your nose all right  the gods knew  but you couldn   t acktually eat    em .   a confusion of instincts threatened to short circuit his schizophrenically doggy mind .   the voices gave up their assault in disgust and turned their attention to ginger  who was methodically trying to shift more sand .   one of gaspode   s fleas bit him sharply .  it was probably dreaming of being the biggest flea in the world .  his leg came up automatically to scratch it  and the spell faded .   he blinked .      bloody hell     he whined .   this is what   s happening to the humans .  wonder what they   re making her dream .   the hairs rose along gaspode   s back .   you didn   t need any special mysterious animal instincts here .  perfectly generalized everyday instincts were enough to horrify him .  there was something dreadful on the other side of the door .   she was trying to let it out .   he had to wake her up .   biting wasn   t really a good idea .  his teeth weren   t that good these days .  he doubted very much if barking would be any better .  that left one alternative     the sand moved eerily under his paws  maybe it was dreaming of being rocks .  the scrawny trees around the hollow were wrapped in sequoia fantasies .  even the air that curled around gaspode   s bullet head moved sluggishly  although it   s anyone   s guess what the air dreams about .   gaspode trotted up to ginger and pushed his nose against her leg .       the universe contains any amount of horrible ways to be woken up  such as the noise of the mob breaking down the front door  the scream of fire engines  or the realization that today is the monday which on friday night was a comfortably long way off .  a dog   s wet nose is not strictly speaking the worst of the bunch  but it has its own peculiar dreadfulness which connoisseurs of the ghastly and dog owners everywhere have come to know and dread .  it   s like having a small piece of defrosting liver pressed lovingly against you .       ginger blinked .  the glow faded from her eyes .  she looked down  her expression of horror turning to astonishment and then  when she saw gaspode leering up at her  back to a more mundane horror .         allo     gaspode said  ingratiatingly .   she backed away  bringing her hands up protectively .  sand dribbled between her fingers .  her eyes flickered toward it in bewilderment  and then back to gaspode .      gods  that   s horrible     she said .     what   s going on .  why am i here .     her hands flew to her mouth .     oh no     she whispered     not again .      she stared at him for a moment  glared up at the doorway  then turned  hitched up her nightdress  and hurried back to town through the morning mists .   gaspode struggled after her  aware of anger in the air  desperately trying to put as much space as possible between the door and himself .   sunnink dreadful in there  he thought .  prob   ly tentacled fings that rips your face off .  i mean  when you finds mysterious doors in old hills  stands to reason wot comes out ain   t going to be pleased to see you .  evil creatures wot man shouldn   t wot of  and here   s one dog wot don   t want to wot of them either .  why couldn   t she     he grumbled on toward the town .   behind him the door moved the tiniest fraction of an inch .       holy wood was awake long before victor  and the hammering from century of the fruitbat echoed around the sky .  waggonloads of timber were queuing up to enter the archway .  he was buffeted and pushed aside by a hurrying stream of plasterers and carpenters .  inside  crowds of workmen scurried around the arguing figures of silverfish and c . m . o . t .  dibbler .   victor reached them just as silverfish said  in astonished tones     the whole city .           you can leave out the bits around the edge     said dibbler .      but i want the whole of the center .  the palace  the university  the guilds   everything that makes it a real city  understand .  it   s got to be right .      he was red in the face .  behind him loomed detritus the troll  patiently holding what appeared to be a bed over his head on one massive hand  like a waiter with a tray .  dibbler had the sheets in one hand .  then victor realized that the whole bed  not just the sheets  was covered in writing .      but the cost       silverfish protested .      we   ll find the money somehow     said dibbler calmly .   silverfish couldn   t have looked more horrified if dibbler had worn a dress .  he tried to rally .      well  if you   re determined  throat           right .            i suppose  come to think of it  maybe we could amortize the cost over several clicks  maybe even hire it out afterward           what are you talking about .     demanded dibbler .     we   re building it for blown away .         yes  yes  of course     said silverfish soothingly .     and then afterward  we can           afterward .  there won   t be any afterward .  haven   t you read the script .  detritus  show him the script .      detritus obligingly dropped the bed between them .      it   s your bed  throat .         script  bed  what   s the difference .  look   here   just above the carving        there was a pause while silverfish read .  it was quite a long one .  silverfish wasn   t used to reading matter that didn   t come in columns with totals at the bottom .   eventually he said     you   re going   to   set it on fire .         it   s historical .  you can   t argue with history     said dibbler smugly .     the city was burned down in the civil war  everyone knows that .        silverfish drew himself up .     the city might have been     he said stiffly     but i didn   t have to find the budget for it .  it   s recklessly extravagant .         i   ll pay for it somehow     said dibbler  calmly .      in a word   im possible .         that   s two words     said dibbler .      there   s no way i can work on something like this     said silverfish  ignoring the interruption .     i   ve tried to see your point of view  haven   t i .  but you   ve taken moving pictures and you   re trying to turn them into  into  into dreams .  i never wanted them to be like this .  include me out .         ok .     dibbler looked up at the troll .      mr .  silverfish was just leaving     he said .  detritus nodded  and then slowly and firmly picked up silverfish by his collar .   silverfish went white .     you can   t get rid of me like that     he said .      you want to bet .         there won   t be an alchemist in holy wood who   ll work for you .  we   ll take the handlemen with us .  you   ll be finished .         listen .  after this click the whole of holy wood will be coming to me for a job .  detritus  throw this bum out .         right you are  mr .  dibbler     rumbled the troll  gripping silverfish   s collar .      you haven   t heard the last of this  you   you scheming  devious megalomaniac .      dibbler removed his cigar .      that   s mister megalomaniac to you     he said .   he replaced the cigar  and nodded significantly to the troll  who gently but firmly grasped silverfish by a leg as well .      you lay a finger on me and you   ll never work in this town again .     shouted silverfish .      i got a job anyway  mr .  silverfish     said detritus calmly  carrying silverfish toward the gate .     i   m vice president of throwing out people mr .  dibbler doesn   t like the face of .         then you   ll have to take on an assistant .     snarled silverfish .      i got a nephew looking for a career     said the troll .     have a nice day .         right     said dibbler  rubbing his hands briskly .     soll .      soll appeared from behind a trestle table loaded with rolled up plans  and took a pencil out of his mouth .      yes  uncle .         how long will it take .         about four days  uncle .         that   s too long .  hire more people .  i want it done by tomorrow  right .         but  uncle           or you   re sacked     said dibbler .  soll looked frightened .      i   m your nephew  uncle     he protested .     you can   t sack nephews .      dibbler looked around and appeared to notice victor for the first time .      ah  victor .  you   re good at words     he said .     can i sack a nephew .         er .  i don   t think so .  i think you have to disown them  or something     said victor lamely .     but           right .  right .     said dibbler .     good man .  i knew it was some kind of a word like that .  disown .  hear that  soll .         yes  uncle     said soll dispiritedly .     i   ll go and see if i can find some more carpenters  then  shall i .         right .     soll flashed victor a look of terrified astonishment as he scurried away .  dibbler started haranguing a group of handlemen .  instructions spouted out of the man like water from a fountain .      i reckon no one   s goin    to ankh morpork this morning  then     said a voice by victor   s knee .      he   s certainly very  er  ambitious today     said victor .      not like himself at all .        gaspode scratched an ear .     there was sunnink i got to tell you .  what was it  now .  oh  yeah .  i remember .  your girlfriend is an agent of demonic powers .  that night we saw her on the hill she was prob   ly on her way to commune with evil .  what d   you fink of that  eh .      he grinned .  he was rather proud of the way he   d introduced the subject .      that   s nice     said victor abstractedly .  dibbler was certainly acting even stranger than usual .  even stranger than usual for holy wood  even        yeah     said gaspode  slightly annoyed at this reception .      a cavortin    at night with eldritchly occult intelligences from the other side  i shouldn   t wonder .         good     said victor .  you didn   t normally burn things in holy wood .  you saved them and painted on the other side .  despite himself  he began to get interested .         a cast of thousands     dibbler was saying .     i don   t care where you get them from  we   ll hire everyone in holy wood if we have to  right .  and i want           a helpin    them in their evil attempts to take over the whole world  if i   m any judge     said gaspode .      does she .     said victor .  dibbler was talking to a couple of apprentice alchemists now .  what was that .  a twenty reeler .  but no one had ever dreamed of going above five .      yeah  a diggin    away to rouse them from their ancient slumber to reek havoc  style of fing     said gaspode .     prob   ly aided by cats  you mark my           look  just shut up a minute  will you .     said victor  irritably .     i   m trying to hear what they   re saying .         well     scuse me .  i was jus    tryin    to save the world     muttered gaspode .     if gharstely creatures from before the dawna time starts wavin    at you from under your bed  jus    you don   t come complainin    to me .         what are you going on about .     said victor .      oh  nothin    .  nothin    .        dibbler looked up  caught sight of victor   s craning face  and waved at it .      you  lad .  come here .  have i got a part for you .         have you .     said victor  pushing his way through the crowd .      that   s what i said .         no  you asked if       victor began  and gave up .      and where   s miss ginger  may i ask .     said dibbler .      late again .            prob   ly sleepin   in       grumbled a sullen and totally ignored voice from down below in the sea of legs         prob   ly takes it out of you  messin    with the occult           soll  send someone to fetch her here           yes  uncle .            wot can you expect  huh  people who like cats   re capable of anythin     you can   t trust    em           and find someone to transcribe the bed .         yes  uncle .            but do they listen .  not them .  bet if i had a glossy coat an    ran aroun    yappin    they   d listen all right        dibbler opened his mouth to speak  and then frowned and raised a hand .      where   s that muttering coming from .     he said .         prob   ly saved the whole world for    em  by rights i   d get a statchoo put up to me nose but no  oh no  not for you mr .  gaspode  on account of you not bein    the right kinda person  so        the whine stopped .  the crowd shuffled aside  revealing a small bow legged gray dog  which looked up impassively at dibbler .      bark .     it said  innocently .       events always moved fast in holy wood  but the work on blown away sped forward like a comet .  the other fruitbat clicks were halted .  so were most of the others in the town  because dibbler was hiring actors and handlemen at twice what anyone else would pay .   and a sort of ankh morpork rose among the dunes .  it would have been cheaper  soll complained  to have risked the wrath of the wizards  sneaked some filming in ankh morpork itself  and then slipped someone a fistful of dollars to put a match to the place .   dibbler disagreed .      apart from anything else     he declared     it wouldn   t look right .         but it   s the real ankh morpork  uncle     said soll .     it   s got to look exactly right .  how can it not look right .         ankh morpork doesn   t look all that genuine  you know     said dibbler thoughtfully .      of course it   s bloody genuine .     snapped soll  the bonds of kinship stretching to snapping point .     it   s really there .  it   s really itself .  you can   t make it any more genuine .  it   s as genuine as it can get .      dibbler took his cigar out of his mouth .      no  it isn   t     he said .     you   ll see .      ginger turned up around lunchtime  looking so pale that even dibbler didn   t shout at her .  she kept glaring at gaspode  who tried to stay out of her way .   dibbler was preoccupied  anyway .  he was in his office  explaining the plot .   it was basically quite simple  running on the familiar lines of boy meets girl  girl meets another boy  boy loses girl  except that on this occasion there was a civil war in the middle of it     the origins of the ankh morpork civil war       p . m .   grune               a . m .   grune        have always been a subject of heated debate among historians .  there are two main theories    .  the common people  having been heavily taxed by a particularly stupid and unpleasant king  decided that enough was enough and that it was time to do away with the outmoded concept of monarchy and replace it with  as it turned out  a series of despotic overlords who still taxed heavily but at least had the decency not to pretend the gods had given them the right to do it  which made everyone feel a bit better or   .  one of the players in a game of cripple mr .  onion in a tavern had accused another of palming more than the usual number of aces  and knives had been drawn  and then someone had hit someone with a bench  and then someone else had stabbed someone  and arrows started to fly  and someone had swung on the chandelier  and a carelessly hurled axe had hit someone in the street  and then the watch had been called in  and someone had set fire to the place  and someone had hit a lot of people with a table  and then everyone lost their tempers and commenced to start fighting .   anyway  it all caused a civil war  which is something every mature civilization needs to have had          the way i see it     said dibbler     there   s this high born girl living all by herself in this big house  right  and her young man goes off to fight for the rebels  you see  and she meets this other guy  and there   s the chemistry between them           they blow up .     said victor .      he means they fall in love     said ginger coldly .      that sort of thing     nodded dibbler .     eyes meeting across a crowded room .  and she   s all alone in the world except for the servants and  let   s see  yeah  perhaps her pet dog           this   ll be laddie .     said ginger .      right .  and of course she   s going to do everything she can to preserve the family mine  so she   s kind of flirting with    em both  the men  not the dog  and then one of them gets killed in the war and the other one throws her over but it   s all ok because she   s tough at heart .     he sat back .     what d   you think .     he said .   the people sitting around the room looked uneasily at one another .   there was a fidgety silence .      it sounds great  uncle     said soll  who wasn   t looking for any more problems today .      technically very challenging     said gaffer .   there was a chorus of relieved assent from the rest of the team .      i don   t know     said victor slowly .   everyone else   s eyes turned on him in the same way that spectators at the lion pit watch the first condemned criminal to be pushed out through the iron gate .  he went on     i mean  is that all .  it doesn   t sound  well  very complicated for such a long click .  people sort of falling in love while a civil war is going on in the background   i don   t see how you can make much of a picture out of that .      there was another troubled silence .  a couple of people near victor moved away .  dibbler was staring at him .   victor could hear  coming from under his chair  an almost inaudible little voice .         oh  of course  there   s always a part for laddie   wot   s he got that i haven   t got  that   s wot i   d like to        dibbler was still staring fixedly at victor .   then he said     you   re right .  you   re right .  victor   s right .  why didn   t anyone else spot it .         that   s just what i was thinking  uncle     said soll hurriedly .     we need to flesh it out a bit .      dibbler waved his cigar vaguely .     we can think up some more stuff as we go  no problem .  like   like   how about a chariot race .  people always like a chariot race .  it   s gripping .  will he fall out  will the wheels come off .  yeah .  a chariot race .         i   ve  er  been reading a bit about the civil war     said soll cautiously     and i don   t think there   s any mention of             of there not being chariot races  am i right .     said dibbler  in soapy tones containing the razor blade of menace .  soll sagged .      since you put it like that  uncle     he said     you   re right .         and       dibbler stared reflectively        we could try   a great big shark .     even dibbler sounded slightly surprised at his own suggestion .   soll looked hopefully at victor .      i   m almost certain sharks didn   t fight in the civil war     said victor .      you sure .         i   m sure people would have noticed     said victor .      they   d have got trampled by the elephants     muttered soll .      yeah     said dibbler  sadly .     it was just a thought .  don   t know why i said it  really .      he stared at nothing for a while  and then shook his head briskly .   a shark  victor thought .  all the little golden fishes of your own thoughts are swimming away happily  and then the water moves and this great shark of a thought comes in from outside .  as if someone   s doing our thinking for us .          you just don   t know how to behave     victor told gaspode  when they were alone .     i could hear you grumbling under the chair the whole time .         i might not know how to behave  but at least i don   t go mooning around over some girl who   s letting dretful creatures of the night into the world     said gaspode .      i should hope not     said victor  and then     what do you mean .         aha .  now he listens .  your girlfriend           she   s not my girlfriend .         would be girlfriend     said gaspode     is goin    out every night and tryin    to open that door in the hill .  she tried it again last night  after you   d gone .  i saw her .  i stopped her     he added  defiantly .     not that i expect any credit  of course .  there   s some dretful in there  an    she   s lettin    it out .  no wonder she   s always late and tired in the mornings  what with spendin    the whole night diggin    .         how do you know they   re dreadful .     said victor weakly .      put it like this     said gaspode .     if something   s shoved in a cave under a hill behind great big doors  it   s not    cos people want it to come out every night to wash the dishes  is it .     corse     he added charitably     i   m not sayin    she knows she   s doing it .  prob   ly they   ve got a grip of her weak an    feeble cat lovin    female mind and are twisting it to their evil will .         you do talk a lot of crap sometimes     said victor  but he didn   t sound very convincing even to himself .      ask her  then     said the dog  smugly .      i will .         right .      exactly how  though .  thought victor  as they trudged out into the sunshine .  excuse me  miss  my dog says that you   no .  i say  ginger  i understand that you   re going out and   no .  hey  ginj  how come my dog saw   no .   perhaps he should just start up a conversation and wait until it got around naturally to monstrosities from beyond the void .   but it would have to wait  because of the row that was going on .   it was over the third major part in blown away .  victor was of course the dashing but dangerous hero  ginger was the only possible choice for the female lead  but the second male role   the dull but dutiful one   was causing trouble .   victor had never seen anyone stamp their foot in anger before .  he   d always thought it was something they did only in books .  but ginger was doing it .      because i   d look an idiot  that   s why .     she was saying .   soll  who was by now feeling like a lightning rod on a stormy day  waved his hand frantically .        but he   s ideal for the role .     he said .     it calls for a solid character           solid .  of course he   s solid .  he   s made of stone .     shouted ginger .     he might have a suit of chain mail and a false mustache but he   s still a troll .      rock  looming monolithically over the pair of them  cleared his throat noisily .      excuse me     he said     i hope we   re not going to get elementalist about this .      now it was ginger   s turn to wave her hands .     i like trolls     she said .     as trolls  that is .  but you can   t seriously mean me to do a romantic scene with a  a  a cliff face .         now look here     said rock  his voice winding up like a pitcher   s arm .     what you   re saying is  is ok for trolls to be shown bashing people with clubs  is not ok to show trolls have finer feelings like squashy humans .         she   s not saying that at all     said soll desperately .     she   s not           if you cut me  do i not bleed .     said rock .      no  you don   t     said soll     but           ah  yes  but i would .  if i had blood  i   d bleed all over the place .         and another thing     said a dwarf  prodding soll in the knee .     it says in the script that she owns a mine full of happy  laughing  singing dwarfs  right .         oh  yes     said soll  putting the troll problem on one side .      what about it .         it   s a bit stereotypical  isn   t it .     said the dwarf .     i mean  it   s a bit dwarfs   miners .  i don   t see why we have to be type cast like this all the time .         but most dwarfs are miners     said soll desperately .      well  ok  but they   re not happy about it     said another dwarf .     and they don   t sing the whole time .         that   s right     said a third dwarf .        cos of safety  see .  you can bring the whole roof down on you  singing .         and there   s no mines anywhere near ankh morpork     said possibly the first dwarf  although they all looked identical to soll .     everyone knows that .  it   s on loam .  we   d be a laughing stock  if our people saw us mining for jewels anywhere near ankh morpork .         i wouldn   t say i   ve got a cliff face     rumbled rock  who sometimes took a little time to digest things .     craggy  maybe .  but not cliffy .         the fact is     said one of the dwarfs     we don   t see why humans get all the good roles and we get all the titchy bit parts .      soll gave the jolly little laugh of someone in a corner who hopes that a joke will lighten the atmosphere a bit .      ah     he said     that   s because you           yes .     said the dwarfs in unison .      um     said soll  and struck out quickly for a change of subject .     you see  the whole point  as i understand it  is that ginger will do absolutely anything to keep the mansion and the mine and           i hopes we can get on     said gaffer     only i   ve got to muck the imps out in an hour .         oh  i see     said rock .     i   m absolutely anything  am i .         you don   t keep mines     said one of the dwarfs .     mines keep you .  you take the treasure out .  you don   t put it in .  that   s fundamental to the whole mine business .         well  perhaps this mine is worked out     said soll quickly .      anyway  she           well  in that case  you don   t keep it     said another dwarf  in the expansive manner of one about to settle down to a good long explanation .     you abandon it  propping and shoring where necessary  and sink another shaft on a line with the major seam           allowing for fault escarpments and uniclinal structures     said another dwarf .      of course  allowing for fault escarpments and uniclinal structures  and then             and general crustal shifting .         all right  and then           unless you   re just cutting and filling  of course .         granted  but           i don   t see     rock began     that my face could be called           shut up .     screamed soll .     everyone shut up .  shut up .  the next person who doesn   t shut up will never work in this town again .  understand .  do i make myself clear .  right .     he coughed  and continued in a more normal voice     very well .  now  i want it understood that this is a breathtaking  block busting romantic film about a woman   s fight to save the       he consulted his clipboard  and went on valiantly        everything she loves against the background of a world gone mad  and i don   t want anymore trouble from anyone .      a dwarf tentatively raised his hand .         scuse me .         yes .     said soll .      why is it all mr .  dibbler   s films are set against the background of a world gone mad .     said the dwarf .   soll   s eyes narrowed .     because mr .  dibbler     he growled     is a very observant man .          dibbler had been right .  the new city was the old city distilled .  narrow alleys were narrower  tall buildings taller .  gargoyles were more fearsome  roofs more pointed .  the towering tower of art in unseen university was  here  even taller and more precariously towering even though it was at the same time only one quarter the size  the unseen university was more baroque and buttressed  the patrician   s palace more pillar   d .  carpenters swarmed over a construction that  when it was finished  would make ankh morpork look like a very indifferent copy of itself  except that the buildings in the original city were not  by and large  painted on canvas stretched over timber and didn   t have the dirt carefully sprayed on .  ankh morpork   s buildings had to get dirty all by themselves .   it looked far more like ankh morpork than ankh morpork ever had .       ginger had been ushered off to the changing tents before victor had a chance to speak to her  and then shooting started and it was too late .   century of the fruitbat  and now it said on the sign  in slightly smaller type  more stars than there are in the heavens     believed that a click should be made in less than ten times the time it took to watch .  blown away was going to be different .  there were battles .  there were night scenes  the imps painting away furiously by torchlight .  dwarfs worked merrily in a mine never seen before or since  where fake gold nuggets the size of chickens had been stuck in the plaster walls .  since soll demanded that their lips should be seen to move they sang a risqu   version of the    hihohiho    song  which had rather caught on among holy wood   s dwarf population .   it was just possible that soll knew how it all fitted together .  victor didn   t .  it was always best  he had learned  never to try to follow the plot of any click you were in  and in any case soll wasn   t just shooting back to front but sides to middle as well .  it was totally confusing  just like real life .   when he did get a chance to talk to ginger  two handlemen and everyone else in the cast who currently had nothing to do were watching them .      ok  people     said soll .     this is the scene near the end where victor meets ginger after all they   ve been through together  and on the card he   ll be saying       he stared at the big black oblong handed to him .     yes  he   ll be saying    frankly  my dear  i   d give anything for one of   harga   s   prime   pork   ribs   in   special   curry   sauce           soll   s voice slowed and stopped .  when he breathed in  it was like a whale surfacing .      who wrote this .      one of the artists cautiously raised a hand .      mr .  dibbler told me to     he said quickly .   soll leafed through the big heap of cards that represented the dialogue for a large part of the click .  his lips tightened .  he nodded to one of the people with clipboards and said      could you just run over to the office and ask my uncle to stroll over here  if he   s got a moment .      soll pulled a card out of the stack and read        i sure miss the old mine but for a taste of real country cooking i always   go   to   harga   s   house   of      i see .      he selected another at random .     ah .  i see here a wounded royalist soldier   s last words are    what i wouldn   t give right now for a    eat till it hurts special at   harga   s   house   of   ribs   mother .            i think it   s very moving     said dibbler  behind him .      there won   t be a dry eye in the house  you   ll see .         uncle       soll began .   dibbler raised his hands .     i said i   d raise the money somehow     he said     and sham harga   s even helping us with the food for the barbecue scene .         you said you weren   t going to interfere with the script .         that   s not interfering     said dibbler stolidly .     i don   t see how that could be considered interfering .  i just polished it up here and there .  i think it   s rather an improvement .  besides  harga   s all you can gobble for a dollar is amazing value these days .         but the click is set hundreds of years ago .     shouted soll .      we ell     said dibbler .     i suppose someone could say     i wonder if the food at harga   s house of ribs will still be as good in hundreds of years    time                that isn   t moving pictures .  that is crass commerce .         i hope so     said dibbler .     we   re in real trouble if it isn   t .         now look       soll began  threateningly .   ginger turned to victor .      can we go somewhere and talk .     she said  quietly .      without your dog     she added  in her normal voice .     definitely without your dog .         you want to talk to me .     said victor .      there hasn   t been much of a chance  has there .         right .  certainly .  gaspode  stay .  there   s a good dog .     victor derived a quiet satisfaction from the brief look of pure disgust that flashed across gaspode   s face .   behind them the eternal holy wood argument had wound up to cruising speed  with soll and c . m . o . t .  standing nose to nose and arguing in a circle of amused and interested staff .      i don   t have to take this  you know .  i can resign .         no  you can   t .  you   re my nephew .  you can   t resign from being a nephew    .      ginger and victor sat down on the steps of a canvas and wood mansion .  they had absolute privacy .  no one was going to bother to watch them with a rip snorter of a row going on a few yards away .      er     said ginger .  her fingers twisted among themselves .  victor couldn   t help noticing that the nails were worn down .      er     she said again .  her face was a picture of anguish  and pale under the make up .  she isn   t beautiful  victor felt himself think  but you could have real trouble believing it .      i  er  don   t know how to say this     she said     but  er  has anyone noticed me walking in my sleep .         to the hill .     said victor .   her head whipped around like a snake .      you know .  how do you know .  have you been spying on me .     she snapped .  it was the old ginger again  all fire and venom and the aggressiveness of paranoia .        laddie found you   asleep yesterday afternoon     said victor  leaning back .      during the day .         yes .      she put her hands to her mouth .     it   s worse than i thought     she whispered .     it   s getting worse .  you know when you met me up the hill .  just before dibbler found us  and thought we were   spooning       she blushed .     well  i didn   t even know how i   d got there .         and you went back last night     said victor .      the dog told you  did he .     she said  dully .      yes .  sorry .         it   s every night now     moaned ginger .     i know  because even if i go back to bed there   s sand all over the floor and my nails are all broken .  i go there every night and i don   t know why .         you   re trying to open the door     said victor .     there   s this big ancient door now  where part of the hill has slid away  and           yes  i   ve seen it  but why .         well  i   ve got a couple of ideas     said victor cautiously .      tell me .         um .  well  have you heard of something called a genius loci .         no .     her brow wrinkled .     it   s clever  is it .         it   s the sort of soul of a place .  it can be quite strong .  it can be made strong  by worship or love or hate  if it goes on long enough .  and i   m wondering if the spirit of a place can call to people .  and animals  too .  i mean  holy wood is a different sort of place  isn   t it .  people act differently here .  everywhere else  the most important things are gods or money or cattle .  here  the most important thing is to be important .      he had her full attention .     yes .     she said encouragingly  and     it doesn   t sound too bad so far .           i   m getting to the bad bit .         oh .      victor swallowed .  his brain was bubbling like a bouillon .  half remembered facts surfaced tantalizingly and sank again .  dry old tutors in high old rooms had been telling him dull old things which were suddenly as urgent as a knife  and he dredged desperately for them .      i   m not       he croaked .  he cleared his throat .     i   m not sure it   s right  though     he managed .     it   s come from somewhere else .  it can happen .  you   ve heard of ideas whose time has come .         yes .         well  they   re the tame ones .  there   s other ones .  ideas so full of vigor they don   t even wait for their time .  wild ideas .  escaped ideas .  and the trouble is  when you get something like that  you get a hole        he looked at her polite  blank expression .  analogies bubbled to the surface like soggy croutons .  imagine all the worlds that have ever been are in one sense pressed together like a sandwich   a pack of cards   a book   a folded sheet   if conditions are right  things can go through rather than along   but if you open a gate between worlds  there are terrible dangers  as for instance     as for instance     as for instance     as for instance what .   it rose up in his memory like the suddenly discovered bit of suspicious tentacle just when you thought it was safe to eat the paella .      it could be that something else is trying to come through the same way     he ventured .     in the  uh  in the nowhere between the somewhere there are creatures which on the whole i   d rather not describe to you .         you already have     said ginger  in a tense voice .      and  uh  they   re generally quite keen to get into the real worlds and perhaps they   re somehow making contact with you when you   re asleep and       he gave up .  he couldn   t bear her expression anymore .      i could be entirely wrong     he said quickly .      you   ve got to stop me opening the door     she whispered .      i could be one of them .         oh  i don   t think so     said victor loftily .     they   ve generally got too many arms  i think .         i tried putting tacks on the floor to wake myself up     said ginger .      sounds awful .  did it work .         no .  they were all back in their bag in the morning .  i must have picked them up again .      victor pursed his lips .     that could be a good sign     he said .      why .         if you were being summoned by  uh  unpleasant things  i think they wouldn   t bother what you walked over .         urgh .         you haven   t got any idea why it   s all happening  have you .     victor said .      no .  but i always get the same dream .     her eyes narrowed .     hey  how come you know all this stuff .         i   a wizard told me  once     said victor .      you   re not a wizard yourself .         absolutely not .  no wizards in holy wood .  and this dream .         oh  it   s too strange to mean anything .  anyway  i used to dream it even when i was small .  it starts off with this mountain  only it   s not a normal mountain  because        detritus the troll loomed over them .      young mr .  dibbler says it   s time to start shooting again     he rumbled .      will you come to my room tonight .     hissed ginger .      please .  you can wake me up if i start sleepwalking again .         well  er  yes  but your landlady might not like it       victor began .        oh  mrs .  cosmopilite is very broadminded     said ginger .      she is .         she   ll just think we   re having sex     said ginger .      ah     said victor hollowly .     that   s all right  then .         young mr .  dibbler don   t like being kept waiting     said detritus .      oh  shut up     said ginger .  she stood up and brushed the dust off her dress .  detritus blinked .  people didn   t usually tell him to shut up .  a few worried fault lines appeared on his brow .  he turned and tried another loom  this time aimed at victor .      young mr .  dibbler don   t like           oh  go away     snapped victor  and wandered off after her .   detritus stood alone and screwed up his eyes in the effort of thought .   of course  people did occasionally say things like    go away    and    shut up    to him  but always with the tremor of terrified bravado in their voice  and so naturally he always riposted    hur hur    and hit them .  but no one had ever spoken to him as if his existence was the last thing in the world they could possibly be persuaded to worry about .  his massive shoulders sagged .  perhaps all this hanging around ruby was bad for him .   soll was standing over the artist who lettered the cards .  he looked up as victor and ginger approached .      right     he said     places  everyone .  we   ll go straight on to the ballroom scene .     he looked pleased with himself .      are the words all sorted out .     said victor .      no problem     said soll proudly .  he glanced at the sun .      we   ve lost a lot of time     he added     so let   s not waste any more .         fancy you being able to get c . m . o . t .  to give in like that     said victor .      he had no argument at all .  he   s gone back to his office to sulk  i expect     said soll loftily .     ok  everyone  let   s all get          the lettering artist tugged at his sleeve .      i was just wondering  mr .  soll  what you wanted me to put in the big scene now victor doesn   t mention ribs           don   t worry me now  man .         but if you could just give me an idea        soll firmly unhooked the man   s hand from his sleeve .      frankly     he said     i don   t give a damn     and he strode off toward the set .   the artist was left alone .  he picked up his paintbrush .  his lips moved silently  shaping themselves around the words .   then he said     hmm .  nice one .          banana n   vectif  cunningest hunter in the great yellow plains of klatch  held his breath as he tweezered the last piece into place .  rain drummed on the roof of his hut .   there .  that was it .   he   d never done anything like this before  but he knew he was doing it right .   he   d trapped everything from zebras to thargas in his time  and what had he got to show for it .  but yesterday  when he   d taken a load of skins into n   kouf  he   d heard a trader say that if any man ever built a better mousetrap  then the world would beat a path to his door .   he   d lain awake all night thinking about this .  then  in the first light of dawn  he scratched a few designs on the hut wall with a stick and got to work .  he had taken the opportunity to look at a few mousetraps while he was in the town  and they were definitely less than perfect .  they hadn   t been built by hunters .   now he picked up the twig and pushed it gently into the mechanism .   snap .   perfect .   now  all he had to do was take it into n   kouf and see if the merchant       the rain was very loud indeed .  in fact  it sounded more like     when banana woke up he was lying in the ruins of his hut and they were in a half mile wide swathe of trodden mud .   he looked muzzily at what remained of his home .  he looked at the brown scar that stretched from horizon to horizon .  he looked at the dark  muddy cloud just visible at one end of it .   then he looked down .  the better mousetrap was now a rather nice two dimensional design  squashed into the middle of an enormous footprint .   he said     i didn   t know it was that good .          according to the history books  the decisive battle that ended the ankh morpork civil war was fought between two handfuls of bone weary men in a swamp early one misty morning and  although one side claimed victory  ended with a practical score of humans    ravens        which is the case with most battles .   something that both dibblers were agreed on was that  if they   d been in charge  no one would have been able to get away with such a low grade war .  it was a crime that people should have been allowed to stage a major turning point in the history of the city without using thousands of people and camels and ditches and earthworks and siege engines and trebuckets and horses and banners .      and in a bloody fog  too     said gaffer .     no thought about light levels .      he surveyed the proposed field of battle  shading his eyes from the sun with one hand .  there would be eleven handlemen working on this one  from every conceivable angle .  one by one they held up their thumbs .   gaffer rapped on the picture box in front of him .      ready  lads .     he said .   there was a chorus of squeaks .        good lads     he said .     get this one right and thee can have an extra lizard for thy tea .      he grasped the handle with one hand and picked up a megaphone with the other .      ready when you are  mr .  dibbler .     he yelled .  c . m . o . t .  nodded and was about to raise his hand when soll   s arm shot out and grabbed it .  the nephew was staring intently at the ranged ranks of horsemen .      just one moment     he said levelly  and then cupped his hands and raised his voice to a shout .     hey  you there .  fifteenth knight along .  yes  you .  would you mind unfurling your banner  please .  thank you .  could you please report to mrs .  cosmopilite for a new one .  thank you .      soll turned to his uncle  his eyebrows raised .      it   s   it   s a heraldic device     said dibbler quickly .      crossed spare ribs on a bed of lettuce .     said soll .      very keen on their food  those old knights           and i liked the motto     said soll .        every  k  night is gormay night at harga   s house of ribs .     if we had sound  i wonder what his battle cry would have been .         you   re my own flesh and blood     said dibbler  shaking his head .     how can you do this to me .         because i   m your own flesh and blood     said soll .   dibbler brightened .  of course  when you looked at it like that  it didn   t seem so bad .       this is holy wood .  to pass the time quickly  you just film the clock hands moving fast     in unseen university  the resograph is already recording seven plibs a minute .       and  toward the end of the afternoon  they burned ankh morpork .   the real city had been burned down many times in its long history   out of revenge  or carelessness  or spite  or even just for the insurance .  most of the big stone buildings that actually made it a city  as opposed simply to a load of hovels all in one place  survived them intact and many people   considered that a good fire every hundred years or so was essential to the health of the city since it helped to keep down the rats  roaches  fleas and  of course  people not rich enough to live in stone houses .   the famous fire during the civil war had been noteworthy simply because it was started by both sides at the same time in order to stop the city falling into enemy hands .   it had not otherwise  according to the history books  been very impressive .  the ankh had been particularly high that summer  and most of the city had been too damp to burn .   this time it was a lot better .   flames poured into the sky .  because this was holy wood  everything burned  because the only difference between the stone buildings and the wooden buildings was what was painted on the canvas .  the two dimensional unseen university burned .  the patrician   s backless palace burned .  even the scale model tower of art gushed flames like a roman candle .   dibbler watched it with concern .   after a while soll  behind him  said     waiting for something  uncle .         hmm .  oh  no .  i hope gaffer   s concentrating on the tower  that   s all     said dibbler .     very important symbolic landmark .         it certainly is     said soll .     very important .  so important  in fact  that i sent some lads up it at lunchtime just to make sure it was all ok .         you did .     said dibbler  guiltily .      yes .  and do you know what they found .  they found someone had nailed some fireworks to the outside .  lots and lots of fireworks  on fuses .  it   s a good thing they found them because if the things had gone off it would have ruined the shot and we   d never be able to do it again .  and  do you know  they said it looked as though the fireworks would spell out words .     soll added .      what words .         never crossed my mind to ask them     said soll .     never crossed my mind .      he stuck his hands in his pockets and began to whistle under his breath .  after a while he glanced sidelong at his uncle .         hottest ribs in town        he muttered .     really .      dibbler looked sulky .     it would have got a laugh  anyway     he said .      look  uncle  this can   t go on     said soll .     no more of this commercial messing about  right .         oh  all right .         sure .      dibbler nodded .     i   ve said all right  haven   t i .         i want a bit more than that  uncle .         i solemnly promise not to do anymore meddling in the click     said dibbler gravely .     i   m your uncle .  i   m family .  is that good enough for you .         well .  all right .      when the fire had died down they raked some of the ashes together for a barbecue at the end of shooting party  under the stars .       the velvet sheet of the night drapes itself over the parrot cage that is holy wood  and on warm nights like this there are many people with private business to pursue .   a young couple  strolling hand in hand across the dunes  were frightened to near insensibility when an enormous troll jumped out at them from behind a rock waving its arms and shouting    aaaargh .         scared you  did i .     said detritus  hopefully .   they nodded  white faced .      well  that   s a relief     said the troll .  he patted them on the heads  forcing their feet a little way into the sand .     thanks very much .  much obliged .  have a nice night     he added mournfully .   he watched them walk off hand in hand  and then burst into tears .   in the handlemen   s shed  c . m . o . t .  dibbler stood watching thoughtfully as gaffer pasted together the day   s footage .  the handleman was feeling very gratified  mr .  dibbler had never shown the slightest interest in the actual techniques of film handling before now .  this may have explained why he was a little freer than usual with guild secrets that had been handed down sideways from one generation to the same generation .      why are all the little pictures alike .     said dibbler  as the handleman wound the film onto its spool .     seems to me that   s wasting money .         they   re not really alike     said gaffer .     each one   s a bit different  see .  and so people   s eyes see a lot of little slightly different pictures very fast and their eyes think they   re watching something move .      dibbler took his cigar out of his mouth .     you mean it   s all a trick .     he said  astonished .      yeah  that   s right .     the handleman chuckled and reached for the paste pot .   dibbler watched in fascination .      i thought it was all a special kind of magic     he said  a shade disappointed .     now you tell me it   s just a big find the lady game .         sort of .  you see  people don   t actually see any one picture .  they see a lot of them at once  see what i mean .         hey  i got lost at see there .         every picture adds to the general effect .  people don   t see  sorry  any one picture  they just see the effect caused by a lot of them moving past very quickly .         do they .  that   s very interesting     said dibbler .     very interesting indeed .     he flicked the ash from his cigar toward the demons .  one of them caught it and ate it .      so what would happen     he said slowly     if  say  just one picture in the whole click was different .         funny you should ask     said gaffer .     it happened the other day when we were patching up beyond the valley of the trolls .  one of the apprentices had stuck in just one picture from the golde rush and we all went around all morning thinking about gold and not knowing why .  it was as if it   d gone straight into our heads without our eyes seeing it .  of course  i took my belt to the lad when we spotted it  but we   d never have found out if i hadn   t happened to look at the click slowly .      he picked up the paste brush again  squared up a couple of strips of film  and fixed them together .  after a while he became aware that it had gone very quiet behind him .      you all right  mr .  dibbler .     he said .      hmm .  oh .     dibbler was deep in thought .     just one picture had all that effect .         oh  yes .  are you all right  mr .  dibbler .         never felt better  lad     dibbler said .     never felt better .      he rubbed his hands together .     let   s you and me have a little chat  man to man     he added .     because  you know       he laid a friendly hand on gaffer   s shoulder        i   ve a feeling that this could be your lucky day .      and in another alleyway gaspode sat muttering to himself .      huh .  stay  he says .  givin    me orders .  jus    so   s his girlfriend doesn   t have to have a horrid smelly dog in her room .  so here   s me  man   s best friend  sittin    out in the rain .  if it was rainin     anyway .  maybe it ain   t rainin     but if it was rainin     i   d be soaked by now .  serve him right if i just upped and walked away .  i could do it  too .  any time i wanted .  i don   t have to sit here .  i hope no one   s thinkin    i   m sittin    here because i   ve been told to sit here .  i   d like to see the human who could give me orders .  i   m sittin    here    cos i want to .  yeah .      then he whined for a bit and shuffled into the shadows  where there was less chance of being seen .   in the room above  victor was standing facing the wall .  this was humiliating .  it had been bad enough bumping into a grinning mrs .  cosmopilite on the stairs .  she had given him a big smile and a complicated  elbow intensive gesture that  he felt certain  sweet little old ladies shouldn   t know .   there were clinks and the occasional rustle behind him as ginger got ready for bed .      she   s really very nice .  she told me yesterday that she had had four husbands     said ginger .      what did she do with the bones .     said victor .      i   m sure i don   t know what you mean     said ginger  sniffing .     all right  you can turn around now .  i   m in bed .      victor relaxed  and turned round .  ginger had drawn the covers up to her neck and was holding them there like a besieged garrison manning the barricades .      you   ve got to promise me     she said     that if anything happens  you won   t try to take advantage of the situation .      victor sighed .     i promise .         it   s just that i   ve got a career to think about  you see .         yes  i see .      victor sat by the lamp and took the book out of his pocket .      i   m not trying to be ungrateful or anything like that     ginger went on .   victor ruffled through the yellowing pages  looking for the place he   d got to .  scores of people had spent their lives by holy wood hill  apparently just to keep a fire alight and chant three times a day .  why .      what are you reading .     said ginger  after a while .      it   s an old book i found     said victor  shortly .     it   s about holy wood .         oh .           i should get some sleep if i were you     he said  twisting so that he could make out the crabby script in the lamp light .   he heard her yawn .      did i finish telling you about the dream .     she said .      i don   t think so     said victor  in what he hoped was a politely discouraging voice .      it always starts off with this mountain           look  you really shouldn   t be talking              and there are stars around it  you know  in the sky  but one of them comes down and it   s not a star at all  it   s a woman holding a torch over her head        victor slowly turned back to the front of the book .      yes .     he said  carefully .      and she keeps on trying to tell me something  something i can   t make out  about waking something  and then there are a lot of lights and this roar  like a lion or a tiger or something  you know .  and then i wake up .      victor   s finger idly traced the outline of the mountain under the stars .      it   s probably just a dream     he said .     it probably doesn   t mean anything .      of course  holy wood hill wasn   t pointed .  but perhaps it was once  in the days when there had been a city where now there was a bay .  good grief .  something must have really hated this place .      you don   t remember anything else about the dream  by any chance .     he asked  with feigned casualness .   there was no answer .  he crept to the bed .   she was asleep .   he went back to the chair  which was promising to become annoyingly uncomfortable within half an hour  and turned down the lamp .   something in the hill .  that was the danger .   the more immediate danger was that he was going to fall asleep  too .   he sat in the dark and worried .  how did you wake up a sleepwalker  anyway .  he recalled vaguely that it was said to be a very dangerous thing to do .  there were stories about people dreaming about being executed and then  when someone had touched them on the shoulder to wake them up  their heads had fallen off .  how anyone ever knew what a dead person had been dreaming wasn   t disclosed .  perhaps the ghost came back afterward and stood at the end of the bed  complaining .   the chair creaked alarmingly as he shifted position .  perhaps if he stuck one leg out like this he could rest it on the end of the bed  so that even if he did fall asleep she wouldn   t be able to get past without waking him .   funny  really .  for weeks he   d spent the days sweeping her up in his arms  defending her bravely from whatever it was morry was dressed up as today  kissing her  and generally riding off into the sunset to live happily  and possibly even ecstatically  ever after .  there was probably no one who   d ever watched one of the clicks who would possibly believe that he   d spend the night sitting in her room on a chair made out of splinters .  even he found it hard to believe  and here he was .  you didn   t get this sort of thing in clicks .  clicks were all passione in a worlde gone madde .  if this was a click  he certainly wouldn   t be sitting around in the dark on a hard chair .  he   d be   well  he wouldn   t be sitting around in the dark on a hard chair  that was for sure .       the bursar locked his study door behind him .  you had to do that .  the archchancellor thought that knocking on doors was something that happened to other people .   at least the horrible man seemed to have lost interest in the resograph  or whatever riktor had called it .  the bursar had had a dreadful day  trying to conduct university business while knowing that the document was hidden in his room .   he pulled it out from under the carpet  turned up the lamp  and began to read .     he   d be the first to admit that he wasn   t any good at mechanical things .  he gave up quickly on the bits about pivots  octiron pendulums  and air being compressed in bellows .   he homed in again on the paragraph that said     if  then  disturbances in the fabric of reality cause ripples to spread out from the epicentre  then the pendulum will tilt  compress the air in the relevant bellows  and cause the ornamental elephant closest to the epicentre to release a small lead ball into a cup .  and thus the direction of the disturbance           whumm   whumm     he could hear it even up here .  they   d just heaped more sandbags around it .  no one dared move it now .  the bursar tried to concentrate on his reading .         can be estimated by the number and force         whumm   whummwhummwhumm .   the bursar found himself holding his breath .         of the expelled pellets  which i estimate in serious disturbances        plib .         may well exceed two pellets        plib .         expelled several inches        plib .         during the        plib .         course        plib .         of        plib .         one        plib .         month .      plib .       gaspode woke up and quickly hauled himself into what he hoped looked like an alert position .     someone was shouting  but politely  as if they wanted to be helped but only if it wouldn   t be too much trouble .   he trotted up the steps .  the door was ajar .  he pushed it open with his head .   victor was lying on his back  tied to a chair .  gaspode sat down and watched him intently  in case he was about to do something interesting .      all right  are we .     he said  after a while .      don   t just sit there  idiot .  untie these knots     said victor .      idiot i may be  but tied up i ain   t     said gaspode evenly .      got the jump on you  did she .         i must have nodded off for a moment     said victor .      long enough for her to get up  rip up a sheet  and tie you to the chair     said gaspode .      yes  all right  all right .  can   t you gnaw through it  or something .         with these teeth .  i could fetch someone  though     said gaspode  and grinned .      er  i   m not sure that   s a very good           don   t worry .  i   ll be right back     said gaspode  and padded out .      it might be a bit difficult to explain       victor called after him  but the dog was down the stairs and ambling along through the maze of backlots and alleys to the rear of century of the fruitbat .   he shuffled up to the high fence .  there was the gentle clink of a chain .      laddie .     he whispered hoarsely .   there was a delighted bark .      good boy laddie .         yeah     said gaspode .     yeah .     he sighed .  had he ever been like that .  if he had  thank goodness he hadn   t known about it .      me good boy .         sure  sure .  laddie be quiet     muttered gaspode  and squeezed his arthritic body under the fence .  laddie licked his face as he emerged .      i   m too old for this sort of stuff     he muttered  and peered at the kennel .      a choke chain     he said .     a bloody choke chain .  stop pulling on it  you daft idiot .  back up .  back up .  right .      gaspode shoved a paw into the loop and eased it over laddie   s head .      there     he said .     if we all knew how to do that  we   d be runnin    the world .  now stop kiddin    around .  we need you .      laddie sprang to tongue lolling attention .  if dogs could salute  he would have done .   gaspode wriggled under the fence again  and waited .  he could hear laddie   s footsteps the other side  but the big dog seemed to be padding away from the fence .      no .     hissed gaspode .     follow me .      there was a scurry of paws  a swishing noise  and laddie cleared the high fence and did a four point landing in front of him .   gaspode unpeeled his tongue from the back of his throat .      good boy     he muttered .     good boy .          victor sat up  rubbing his head .      i caught myself a right crack when the chair fell backward     he said .   laddie sat looking expectantly  with the remains of the sheet in his mouth .      what   s he waiting for .     said victor .      you   ve got to tell him he   s a good boy     sighed gaspode .      doesn   t he expect some meat or a sweet or something .      gaspode shook his head .     jus    tell him what a good boy he is .  it   s better   n hard currency  for dogs .         oh .  well  then  good boy  laddie .      laddie bounced up and down excitedly .  gaspode swore under his breath .        sorry about this     he said .     pathetic  isn   t it .         good boy  find ginger     said victor .      look  i can do that     said gaspode desperately  as laddie started snuffling at the floor .     we all know where she   s headed .  you don   t have to go and        laddie dashed out of the door  but gracefully .  he paused at the bottom of the stairs and gave an eager  follow me bark .      pathetic     said gaspode  miserably .       the stars always seemed to shine more brightly over holy wood .  of course  the air was clearer than ankh  and there wasn   t much smoke  but even so   they were somehow bigger  too  and closer  as if the sky was a vast lens .   laddie streaked over the dunes  pausing occasionally for victor to catch up .  gaspode followed on some way behind  rolling from side to side and wheezing .   the trail led to the hollow  which was empty .   the door was open about a foot .  scuffed sand around it indicated that  whatever may or may not have come out  ginger had gone in .   victor stared at it .   laddie sat by the door  staring hopefully at victor .      he   s waitin        said gaspode .      what for .     said victor apprehensivley .   gaspode groaned .     what do you think .     he said .      oh .  yes .  there   s a good boy  laddie .      laddie yapped and tried to turn a somersault .      what do we do next .     said victor .     i suppose we go in  do we .         could be     said gaspode .      er .  or we could wait till she comes out .  the fact is  i   ve never been very happy about darkness     said victor .     i mean  night time is ok  but pitch darkness           i bet cohen the barbarian isn   t afraid of the dark     said gaspode .        well  yes           and the black shadow of the desert  he   s not afraid of the dark either .         ok  but           and howondaland smith  balgrog hunter  practic   ly eats the dark for his tea     said gaspode .      yes  but i   m not those people .     wailed victor .      try tellin    that to all those people who handed over their pennies to watch you bein       em     said gaspode .  he scratched at an insomniac flea .     cor  it   d be a laugh to have a handleman here now  wouldn   t it .     he said  cheerfully .      wot a comedy feature it   d make .  mr hero not goin    into the dark  we could call it .  it   d be better   n turkey legs .  it   d be funnier   n a night at the arena .  i reckon people   d queue fo           all right  all right     said victor .     i   ll go a little way in  perhaps .     he looked around desperately at the dried up trees around the hollow .     and i   ll make a torch     he added .       he   d expected spiders and dampness and possibly snakes  if nothing worse     instead  there was just a dry  roughly square passageway  leading slightly downward .  the air had a slightly salty smell  suggesting that somewhere the tunnel was connected to the sea .   victor took a few paces along it  and stopped .      hang on     he said .     if the torch goes out  we could get horribly lost .         no  we can   t     said gaspode .     sense of smell  see .         gosh  that   s clever .      victor went on a little further .  the walls were covered with big versions of the square ideograms that featured in the book .      you know     he said  pausing to run his fingers over one      these aren   t really like a written language .  it   s more as if             keep movin    and stop makin    excuses     said gaspode behind him .   victor   s foot kicked against something which bounced away into the darkness .      what was it .     he quavered .   gaspode snuffled off into the darkness  and returned .      don   t worry about it     he said .      oh .         it   s just a skull .         whose .         he dint say     said gaspode .      shut up .      something crunched under victor   s sandal .      an    that       gaspode began .      i don   t want to know .         it was a seashell  in fact     said gaspode .   victor peered into the moving square of darkness ahead of them .  the makeshift torch flared in the draft and  if he strained his ears  he could hear a rhythmic sound  it was either a beast roaring in the distance  or the sound of the sea moving in some underground tunnel .  he opted for the second suggestion .      something   s been calling her     he said .     in dreams .  someone that wants to be let out .  i   m afraid she   s going to get hurt .         she   s not worth it     said gaspode .     messin    around with girls who   re in thrall to creatures from the void never works out  take my word for it .  you   d never know what you were going to wake up next to .         gaspode .         you   ll see i   m right .      the torch went out .   victor waved it desperately and blew on it in a last attempt to rekindle it .  a few sparks flared and faded .  there simply wasn   t enough torch left .   the darkness flowed back .  victor had never known darkness like it .  no matter how long you looked into it  your eyes wouldn   t grow accustomed to it .  there was nothing to become accustomed to .  it was darkness and mother of darkness  darkness absolute  the darkness under the earth  darkness so dense as to be almost tangible  like cold velvet .      it   s bloody dark     volunteered gaspode .   i   ve broken out into what they call a cold sweat  thought victor .  so that   s what it feels like .  i   d always wondered .   he eased himself sideways until he reached the wall .      we   d better go back     he said  in what he hoped was a matter of fact voice .     there could be anything ahead of us .  ravines or anything .  we could get more torches and more people and come back .      there was a flat sound from far down the passage .   whoomph .   it was followed by a light so harsh that it projected the image of victor   s eyeballs on the back of his skull .  it faded after a few seconds  but was still almost painfully bright .  laddie whimpered .      there you are     said gaspode hoarsely .     you   ve got some light now  so everything   s all right .         yes  but what   s making it .         i   m supposed to know  am i .      victor inched forward  his shadow dancing behind him .   after a hundred yards or so the passageway opened out in what had perhaps once been a natural cave .  the light was coming from an arch high up at one end  but it was bright enough to reveal every detail .   it was bigger even than the great hall at the university  and must once have been even more impressive .  the light gleamed off baroque gold ornamentation  and on the stalactites that ribbed the roof .  stairs wide enough for a regiment rose from a wide shadowy hole in the floor  a regular thud and boom and a smell of salt said that the sea had found an entrance somewhere below .  the air was clammy .      some kind of a temple .     muttered victor .     gaspode sniffed at a dark red drapery hung on one side of the entrance .  at his touch it collapsed into a mess of slime .      yuk     he said .     the whole place is moldy .     something many legged scuttled hastily across the floor and dropped into the stairwell .   victor reached out gingerly and prodded a thick red rope  slung between gold encrusted posts .  it disintegrated .   the cracked stairway carried on up to the distant lighted arch .  they climbed it  scrambling over heaps of crumbling seaweed and driftwood flung up by some past high tide .   the arch opened out into another vast cavern  like an amphitheater .  rows of seats stretched down toward a   a wall .   it shimmered like mercury .  if you could fill an oblong pool of mercury the size of a house  and then tip it on its side without any of it spilling  then it would look something like this .   only not so malevolent .   it was flat and blank but victor suddenly felt he was being stared at  like something under a lens .   laddie whined .   then victor realized what it was that was making him uneasy .   it wasn   t a wall .  a wall was attached to something .  that thing was attached to nothing .  it just hung in the air  billowing and rippling like an image in a mirror  but without the mirror .   the light was coming from somewhere on the other side of it .  victor could see it now  a bright pinpoint moving around in the shadow at the far end of the chamber .   he set off down the sloping aisle between the rows of stone seats  the dogs plodding along beside him with their ears flat and their tails between their legs .  they waded through something that might once have been carpet  it tore wetly and disintegrated under their feet .   after they   d gone a few yards gaspode said     i don   t know if you   ve noticed  but some of             i know     said victor  grimly .         the seats  they   re still           i know .            occupied .         i know .      all these people   these things who had been people   sitting in rows .  it   s as though they were watching a click .   he   d almost reached it now .  it shimmied above him  a rectangle with length and height but no thickness .   just in front of it  almost underneath the silver screen  a smaller flight of steps led him down into a circular pit half filled with debris .  by climbing onto it he could see behind the screen  to where the light was .   it was ginger .  she was standing with one hand held above her head .  the torch in it burned like phosphorus .   she was staring up at a body on a slab .  it was a giant .  or  at least  something like a giant .  it might just have been a suit of armor with a sword laid on top of it  half buried in dust and sand .      it   s the thing from the book .     he hissed .     ye gods  what does she think she   s doing .         i don   t think she   s thinkin    anythin        said gaspode .   ginger half turned and victor saw her face .  she was smiling .   behind the slab victor could make out some kind of big  corroded disc .  at least it was hanging from the ceiling by proper chains  and not defying gravity in such a disconcerting way .      right     he said     i   m going to put a stop to this right now .  ginger .      his voice boomed back at him from the distant walls .  he could hear it bouncing away along caverns and corridors   er  er  er .  there was a thud of falling rock somewhere far behind him .      keep it quiet .     said gaspode .     you   ll have the whole place down on us .           ginger .     victor hissed .     it   s me .      she turned and looked at him  or through him  or into him .      victor     she said sweetly .     go away .  far away .  go away now or great harm will befall .         great harm will befall     muttered gaspode .     that   s boding talk  that is .         you don   t know what you   re doing     said victor .     you asked me to stop you .  come back .  come back with me now .      he tried to climb up        and something sank under his foot .  there was a far away gurgling noise  a metallic clonk  and then one watery musical note billowed up around him and echoed around the cavern .  he moved his foot hurriedly  but only onto another part of the ledge which sank like the first  producing a different note .   now there was a scraping sound as well .  victor had been standing in a small sunken pit .  now to his horror he realized that it was rising slowly  to the accompaniment of blaring notes and the whirr and wheeze of ancient machinery .  he thrust out his hands and hit a corroded lever  which produced a different chord and then snapped off .  laddie was howling .  victor saw ginger drop her torch and clap her hands over her ears .   a block of masonry leaned slowly out of the wall and smashed on the seats .  fragments of rock pattered down  and a rumbling counterpoint to the blare suggested that the noise was rearranging the shape of the whole cavern .   and then it died  with a long strangulated gurgle and a final gasp .  a series of jerks and creaks indicated that whatever prehistoric machinery had been activated by victor had given of its all before collapsing .   silence returned .   victor eased himself carefully out of the music pit  which was now several feet in the air  and ran over to ginger .  she was on her knees  and sobbing .        come on     he said .     let   s get out of here .         where am i .  what   s happening .         i couldn   t even begin to explain .      the torch was spluttering on the floor .  it wasn   t an actinic fire now  it was just a piece of charred and nearly extinguished driftwood .  victor grabbed it and waved it around until a dull yellow flame appeared .      gaspode .     he snapped .      yeah .         you two dogs lead the way .         oh  thank you very much .      ginger clung to him as they lurched back up the aisle .  despite the incipient terror  victor had to admit that it was a very pleasant sensation .  he looked around at the occasional occupants of the seats and shuddered .      it looks as though they died watching a click     he said .      yeah .  a comedy     said gaspode  trotting ahead of him .      why do you say that .         they   re all grinnin    .         gaspode .         well  you   ve got to look on the bright side  haven   t you .     sneered the dog .     can   t go around bein    miserable jus    because you   re in some lost underground tomb with a mad cat lover an    a torch that   s goin    to go out any minute           keep going .  keep going .      they half fell  half ran down the steps  skidded unpleasantly on the seaweed at the bottom  and headed for the little archway that led to the wonderful prospect of living air and bright daylight .  the torch was beginning to scorch victor   s hand .  he let it go .  at least there had been no problems in the passage  if they kept to one wall and didn   t do anything stupid they couldn   t help but reach the door .  and it must be dawn by now  which meant that it shouldn   t be long before they could see the light .   victor straightened up .  this was pretty heroic  really .  there hadn   t been any monsters to fight  but probably even monsters would have rotted away centuries ago .  of course it had been creepy  but really it was only  well  archaeology .  now it was all behind him it didn   t seem so bad at all     laddie  who had been running ahead of them  barked sharply .      what   s he saying .     said victor .      he   s saying     said gaspode     that the tunnel   s blocked .         oh  no .         it was prob   ly your organ recital that did it .         really blocked .      really blocked .  victor crawled over the heap .  several large roof slabs had come down  bringing tons of broken rock with them .  he pulled and pushed at one or two pieces  but this produced only further falls .      perhaps there   s another way out .     he said .     perhaps you dogs could go and           forget it  pal     said gaspode .     anyway  the only other way must be down those steps .  they connect with the sea  right .  all you have to do is swim down there and hope your lungs hold out .      laddie barked .      not you     said gaspode .     i wasn   t talking to you .  never volunteer for anything .      victor continued his burrowing among the rocks .      i don   t know     he said  after a while     but it seems to me i can see a bit of light here .  what do you think .      he heard gaspode scramble over the stones .      could be  could be     said the dog grudgingly .     looks like a couple of blocks have wedged up and left a space .         big enough for someone small to crawl through .     said victor encouragingly .      i knew you were going to say that     said gaspode .   victor heard the scrabble of paws on loose rock .  eventually a muffled voice said     it opens up a bit   tight squeeze here   blimey          there was silence .      gaspode .     said victor apprehensively .      it   s ok .  i   m through .  an    i can see the door .         great .      victor felt the air move and there was a scratching noise .  he reached out carefully and his hand met a ferociously hairy body .      laddie   s trying to follow you .         he   s too big .  he   ll get stuck .      there was a canine grunt  a frantic kicking which showered victor with gravel  and a small bark of triumph .      o   corse  he   s a bit skinnier   n me     said gaspode  after a while .      now you two run and fetch help     said victor .     er .  we   ll wait here .      he heard them disappear into the distance .  laddie   s far away barking indicated that they had reached the outside air .   victor sat back .      now all we have to do is wait     he said .      we   re in the hill  aren   t we .     said ginger   s voice in the darkness .      yes .         how did we get here .         i followed you .         i told you to stop me .         yes  but then you tied me up .         i did no such thing .         you tied me up     repeated victor .     and then you came here and opened the door and made a torch of some sort and went all the way into that   that place .  i dread to think of what you   d have done if i hadn   t woken you up .      there was a pause .      i really did all that .     said ginger uncertainly .      you really did .         but i don   t remember any of it .         i believe you .  but you still did it .           what   what was that place  anyway .      victor shifted in the darkness  trying to make himself comfortable .      i don   t know     he confessed .     at first i thought it was a temple .  and it looked as though people used it for watching moving pictures .         but it looked hundreds of years old .         thousands  i expect .         but look  that can   t be right     said ginger  in the small voice of one trying to be reasonable while madness is breaking down the door with a cleaver .     the alchemists only got the idea a few months ago .         yes .  it   s something to think about .      he reached out and found her .  her body was ramrod stiff and flinched at his touch .      we   re safe enough here     he added .     gaspode will soon bring back some help .  don   t you worry about that .      he tried not to think about the sea slapping at the stairs  and the many legged things that scuttled over the midnight floor .  he tried to put out of his mind the thought of octopi slithering silently over the seats in front of that living  shifting screen .  he tried to forget the patrons who had been sitting in the darkness while  above them  centuries passed .  perhaps they were waiting for the lady to come around with the banged grains and hot sausages .   the whole of life is just like watching a click  he thought .  only it   s as though you always get in ten minutes after the big picture has started  and no one will tell you the plot  so you have to work it all out yourself from the clues .   and you never  never get a chance to stay in your seat for the second house .       candlelight flickered in the university corridor .   the bursar did not think of himself as a brave man .  the most he felt happy about tackling was a column of numbers  and being good at numbers had taken him further up the hierarchy of unseen university than magic had ever done .  but he couldn   t let this pass .      whumm   whumm   whummwhummwhummwhumm whumm .   he crouched behind a pillar and counted eleven pellets .  little jets of sand puffed out of the bags .  they were coming at two minute intervals now .   he ran to the heap of sandbags and tugged at them .   reality wasn   t the same everywhere .  well  of course  every wizard knew that .  reality wasn   t very thick anywhere on the discworld .  in some places it was very thin indeed .  that was why magic worked .  what riktor thought he could measure was changes in reality  places where the real was rapidly becoming unreal .  and every wizard knew what could happen if things became unreal enough to form a hole .   but  he thought  as he clawed at the bags  you   d need massive amounts of magic .  we   d be bound to spot that amount of magic .  it   d stand out like   well  like a lot of magic .   i must have taken at least fifty seconds so far .   he peered at the vase in its bunker .   oh .   he   d been hoping he might be wrong .   all the pellets had been expelled in one direction .  half a dozen sandbags had been shot full of holes .  and numbers had thought that a couple of pellets in a month indicated a dangerous build up of unreality     the bursar mentally drew a line from the vase  through the damaged sandbags  to the far end of the corridor .      whumm   whumm     he jerked back  and then realized that there was no need to worry .  all the pellets were being shot out of the ornamental elephant   s head opposite him .  he relaxed .      whumm   whumm     the vase rocked violently as mysterious machinery swung around inside it .  the bursar put his head closer to it .  yes  there was definitely a hissing sound  like air being squeezed     eleven pellets slammed at high speed into the sandbags .   the vase recoiled back  in accordance with the famous principle of reaction .  instead of hitting a sandbag  it hit the bursar .   ming ng ng .   he blinked .  he took a step backward .  he fell over .   because holy wood   s disturbances in reality were extending weak but opportunist tendrils even as far as ankh morpork  a couple of little bluebirds flew around his head for a moment and went    tweet tweet tweet    before vanishing .       gaspode lay on the sand and wheezed .  laddie danced around him  barking urgently .      we   re well out of that     he managed  and stood up and shook himself .   laddie barked and looked incredibly photogenic .      all right  all right     sighed gaspode .     how about if we go and find some breakfast and maybe catch up on our sleep and then we   ll        laddie barked again .   gaspode sighed .      oh  all right     he said .     have it your way .  but you won   t get any thanks  you know .      the dog whizzed away across the sand .  gaspode followed at a more leisurely  ambling pace  and was very surprised when laddie doubled back  picked him up gently by the scruff of the neck  and bounded off again .      you   re only doin    this to me    cos i   m small     gaspode complained  as he swung from side to side  and    no  not that way .  humans   ll be no good at this time o    the morning .  we want trolls .  they   ll still be up and about and they   re dab hands at the underground stuff .  take the next right .  we want the blue lias and   oh  bugger .        it had suddenly dawned on him that he was going to be required to talk .   and in public .   you could spend ages carefully concealing your vocal abilities from people and then  bingo  you were on the spot and you had to talk .  otherwise young victor and cat woman would be molderin    down there forever .  young laddie was going to drop him in front of someone and look expectant and he   d have to explain .  and afterward spend his whole life as some sort of freak .   laddie trotted up the street and into the smoky portals of the blue lias  which was crowded .  he threaded his way through a maze of treetrunk legs to the bar  barked sharply  and dropped gaspode on the floor .   he looked expectant .   the buzz of conversation stopped .      is that laddie .     said a troll .     what he want .      gaspode wandered groggily to the nearest troll and tugged politely at a trailing strip of rusty chain mail .         scuse me     he said .      he bloody intelligent dog     said another troll  idly kicking gaspode aside .     i see him in click yesterday .  he can play dead and count up to five .         that two more than you can  then .     this got a around of laughter .         no  shut up .  i reckon     said the first troll     he trying to tell us something .               scuse me           you only got to look at the way he leaping about and barking .         that right .  i saw him in this click  he showing people where to find lost children in caves .                 scuse me        a troll brow wrinkled .     to eat    em  you mean .         no  to bring    em outside .         what  like for a barbecue sort of thing .               scuse me        another foot caught gaspode on the side of his bullet head .      could be he found some more .  look at the way he running back and forward to the door .  he one clever dog .         we could go look     said the first troll .      good idea .  it seem like ages since i had my tea .         listen  you not allowed to eat people in holy wood .  it get us bad name .  also silicon anti defamation league be down on you like a ton of rectangular building things .         yeah  but could be a reward or something .               scuse me           right .  also  big improvement for troll image viz ah viz public relations if we find lost children .         and even if we don   t  we can eat the dog  right .      the bar emptied  leaving only the usual clouds of smoke  cauldrons of molten troll drinks  ruby idly scraping the congealed lava off the mugs  and a small  weary  moth eaten dog .   the small  weary  moth eaten dog thought hard about the difference between looking and acting like a wonder dog and merely being one .   it said    bugger .          victor remembered being frightened of tigers when he was young .  in vain did people point out that the nearest tiger was three thousand miles away .  he   d say     is there any sea between where they live and here .     and people would say     well  no  but       and he   d say     then it   s just a matter of distance .      darkness was the same thing .  all dreadful dark places were connected by the nature of darkness itself .  darkness was everywhere  all the time  just waiting for the lights to go out .  just like the dungeon dimensions  really .  just waiting for reality to snap .   he held on tight to ginger .      you needn   t     she said .     i   ve got a grip on myself now .         oh  good     he said weakly .      the trouble is  so have you .      he relaxed .      are you cold .     she said .      a bit .  it   s very clammy down here .         is it your teeth i can hear chattering .         who else   s .  no     he added hurriedly     don   t even think about it .         you know     she said  after a while     i don   t remember anything about tying you up .  i   m not even very good at knots .         these were pretty good     said victor .      i just remember the dream .  there was this voice telling me that i must wake the   the sleeping man .      victor thought of the armored figure on the slab .      did you get a good look at it .     he said .     what was it like .         i don   t know about tonight     said ginger cautiously .      but in my dreams it   s always looked a bit like my uncle oswald .      victor thought of a sword taller than he was .  you couldn   t parry a slash from something like that  it   d cut through anything .  somehow it was hard to think of anything looking like an oswald with a sword like that .      why   s he remind you of your uncle oswald .     he said .      because my uncle oswald lay quite still like that .  mind you  i only ever saw him once .  and that was at his funeral .      victor opened his mouth   and there were distant  blurred voices .  a few stones moved .  a voice  a little closer now  trilled     hallo  little children .  this way  little children .           that   s rock .     said ginger .      i   d know that voice anywhere     said victor .     hey .  rock .  it   s me .  victor .      there was a worried pause .  then rock   s voice bellowed     it   s my friend victor .         that mean we can   t eat him .         no one is to eat my friend victor .  we dig him out with speed .      there was the sound of crunching .  then another troll   s voice complained     they call this limestone .  i call it tasteless .      there was some more scrabbling .  a third voice said     don   t see why we can   t eat him .  who   d know .         you uncivilized troll     scolded rock .     what you thinking of .  you eat people  everyone laugh at you  say     he very defective troll  do not know how to behave in polite society    and stop paying you three dollar a day and send you back to mountains .      victor gave what he hoped would sound like a light chuckle .      they   re a lot of laughs  aren   t they .     he said .      heaps     said ginger .      of course  all that stuff about eating people is just bravado .  they hardly ever do it .  you shouldn   t worry about it .         i   m not .  i   m worried because i walk around all the time when i   m asleep and i don   t know why .  you make it sound as if i was going to wake up that sleeping creature .  it   s a horrible thought .  something   s inside my head .      there was a crash as more rocks were pulled aside .      that   s the odd thing     said victor .     when people are  er  possessed  the  er  possessing thing doesn   t usually care much about them or anyone else .  i mean  it wouldn   t have just tied me up .  it would have hit me over the head with something .      he reached for her hand in the dark .        that thing on the slab     he said .      what about it .         i   ve seen it before .  it   s in the book i found .  there   s dozens of pictures of it  and they must have thought it was very important to keep it behind the gate .  that   s what the pictograms say  i think .  gate   man .  the man behind the gate .  the prisoner .  you see  i   m sure the reason why all the priests or whoever they were had to go and chant there every day was        a slab by his head was pulled aside and weak daylight poured through .  it was very closely followed by laddie  who tried to lick victor   s face and bark at the same time .      yes  yes .  well done  laddie     said victor  trying to fight him off .     good dog .  good boy  laddie .         good boy laddie .  good boy laddie .      the bark brought several small shards of stone down from the ceiling .      aha .     said rock .  several other troll heads appeared behind him as victor and ginger stared out of the hole .      they not little children     muttered the one who had been complaining about the eating ban .     they look stringy .         i tell you before     said rock menacingly     no eating people .  it cause no end of trouble .         why not just one leg .  then everyone   ll be        rock picked up a half ton slab in one hand  weighed it thoughtfully  and then hit the other troll so hard with it that it broke .      i tell you before     he told the recumbent figure     it trolls like you getting us a bad name .  how can we take rightful place in brotherhood of sapient species with defective trolls like you letting side down aller time .      he reached through the hole and pulled victor out bodily .      thanks  rock .  er .  there   s ginger in there  too .      rock gave him a crafty nudge that bruised a couple of ribs .      so i see     he said .     and she wearing very pretty silk neggleliggle .  you find nice place to indulge in bit of    what is the health of your parent .     and the disc move for you  yeah .     the other trolls grinned .      uh  yes  i suppose       victor began .      that   s not true at all .     snapped ginger  as she was helped through the hole .     we weren   t           yes  it is .     said victor  making furious signals with his hands and eyebrows .     it   s absolutely true .  you   re absolutely right  rock .         yeah     said one of the trolls behind rock .     i seen them on the clicks .  he kissing her and carrying her off the whole time .         now listen     ginger began .      and now we get out of here fast     said rock .     this whole ceiling looking very defective to me .  could go at any time .      victor glanced up .  several of the blocks were dipping ominously .      you   re right     he said .  he grabbed the arm of the protesting ginger and hustled her along the passage .  the trolls gathered up the fallen compatriot who did not know how to behave in polite company and plodded after them .      that was disgusting  giving them the impression that       ginger hissed .      shut up .     snapped victor .     what did you want me to say  hmm .  i mean  what sort of explanation do you think would fit .  what would you like people to know .      she hesitated .      well  all right     she conceded .     but you could have thought of something else .  you could have said we were exploring  or looking for  for fossils       her voice trailed off .      yes  in the middle of the night with you in a silk neggleliggle     said victor .     what is a neggleliggle  anyway .         he meant negligee     said ginger .      come on  let   s get back to town .  afterward i might just have time to have a couple of hours    sleep .         what do you mean  afterward .           we   re going to have to buy these lads a big drink        there was a low rumble from the hill .  a cloud of dust billowed out of the doorway and covered the trolls .  the rest of the roof had gone .      and that   s it     said victor .     it   s over .  can you make the sleepwalking part of you understand that .  it   s no good trying to get in anymore  there isn   t any way .  it   s buried .  it   s over .  thank goodness .          there   s a bar like it in every town .  it   s dimly lit and the drinkers  although they talk  don   t address their words to one another and they don   t listen  either .  they just talk the hurt inside .  it   s a bar for the derelict and the unlucky and all of those people who have been temporarily flagged off the racetrack of life and into the pits .   it always does a brisk trade .   on this dawn the mourners sat ranged along the counter  each in his cloud of gloom  each certain that he was the most unfortunate individual in the whole world .      i created it     said silverfish  morosely .     i thought it would be educational .  it could broaden people   s horizons .  i didn   t intend for it to be a  a  a show .  with a thousand elephants .     he added nastily .      yeah     said detritus .     she don   t know what she wants .  i do what she want  then she say  that not right  you a troll with no finer feelin     you do not understand what a girl wants .  she say  girl want sticky things to eat in box with bow around  i make box with bow around  she open box  she scream  she say flayed horse not what she mean .  she don   t know what she wants .         yeah     said a voice from under silverfish   s stool .     it   d serve    em all right if i went off an    joined the wolves .         i mean  take this blown away thing     said silverfish .     it   s not even real .  it   s not like things really were .  it   s just lies .  anyone can tell lies .         yeah     said detritus .     like  she say  girl want music under window  i play music under window  everyone in street wake up and shouting out of house  you bad troll  what you hitting rocks this time of night .  and she never even wake up .         yeah     said silverfish .      yeah     said detritus .      yeah     said the voice under the stool .   the man who ran the bar was naturally cheerful .  it wasn   t hard to be cheerful  really  when your customers acted like lightning rods for any misery that happened to be floating around .  he   d found that it wasn   t a good idea to say things like     never mind  look on the bright side     because there never was one  or    cheer up  it may never happen     because often it already had .  all that was expected of him was to keep the drink coming .   he was a little puzzled this morning  though .  there seemed to be an extra person in the bar  quite apart from whoever it was speaking up from the floor .  he kept getting the feeling that he was serving an extra drink  and even getting paid for it  and even talking to the mysterious purchaser .  but he couldn   t see him .  in fact he wasn   t quite sure what he was seeing  or who he was talking to .   he wandered down to the far end of the bar .   a glass slid toward him .   same again  said a voice out of the shadows .      er     said the barman .     yeah .  sure .  what was it .      anything .   the barman filled it with rum .  it was pulled away .   the barman sought for something to say .  for some reason  he was feeling terrified .      don   t see you in here  much     he managed .   i come for the atmosphere .  same again .      work in holy wood  do you .     said the barman  topping up the glass quickly .  it vanished again .   not for some time .  same again .   the barman hesitated .  he was  at heart  a kindly soul .        you don   t think you   ve had enough  do you .     he said .   i know exactly when i   ve had enough .      everyone says that  though .      i know when everyone   s had enough .   there was something very odd about that voice .  the barman wasn   t quite sure that he was hearing it with his ears .     oh .  well  er     he said .     same again .      no .  busy day tomorrow .  keep the change .   a handful of coins slid across the counter .  they felt icy cold  and most of them were heavily corroded .      oh  er       the barman began .   the door opened and shut  letting in a cold blast of air despite the warmth of the night .   the barman wiped the top of the bar in a distracted way  carefully avoiding the coins .      you see some funny types  running a bar     he muttered .   a voice by his ear said  i forgot .  a packet of nuts  please .       snow glittered on the rimward outriders of the ramtop mountains  that great world spanning range which  where it curves around the circle sea  forms a natural wall between klatch and the great flat sto plains .   it was the home of rogue glaciers and prowling avalanches and high  silent fields of snow .   and yetis .  yetis are a high altitude species of troll  and quite unaware that eating people is out of fashion .  their view is  if it moves  eat it .  if it doesn   t  then wait for it to move .  and then eat it .   they   d been listening all day to the sounds .  echoes had bounced from peak to peak along the frozen ranges until  now  it was a steady dull rumble .      my cousin     said one of them  idly probing a hollow tooth with a claw     said they was enormous gray animals .  elephants .         bigger   n us .     said the other yeti .        nearly as bigger   n us     said the first yeti .     loads of them  he said .  more than he could count .      the second yeti sniffed the wind and appeared to consider this .      yeah  well     he said  gloomily .     your cousin can   t count above one .         he said there was lots of big ones .  big fat gray elephants  all climbing  all roped together .  big and slow .  all carrying lots of oograah .         ah .      the first yeti indicated the vast sloping snowfield .      good and deep today     he said .     nothing   s gonna move fast in this  right .  we lie down in the snow  they won   t see us till they   re right on top of us  we panic    em  it   s big eats time .     he waved his enormous paws in the air .     very heavy  my cousin said .  they   ll not move fast  you mark my words .      the other yeti shrugged .      let   s do it     he said  against the sound of distant  terrified trumpeting .   they lay down in the snow  their white hides turning them into two unsuspicious mounds .  it was a technique that had worked time and again  and had been handed down from yeti to yeti for thousands of years  although it wasn   t going to be handed much further .   they waited .   there was a distant bellowing as the herd approached .   eventually the first troll said  very slowly  because it had been working this out for a long time .     what do you get  right  what do you get if  you cross   a mountain with a elephant .      it never got an answer .   the yetis had been right .   when five hundred crude two elephant bobsleighs crested the ridge ten feet away at sixty miles an hour  their strappedon occupants trumpeting in panic  they never saw the yetis until they were right on top of them .       victor got only two hours    sleep but got up feeling remarkably refreshed and optimistic .   it was all over .  things were going to be a whole lot better now .  ginger had been quite nice to him last night   well  a few hours ago   and whatever it was in the hill had been well and truly buried .   you got that sort of thing sometimes  he thought  as he poured some water into the cracked basin and had a quick wash .  some wicked old king or wizard gets buried and their spirit creeps about  trying to put things right or something .  well known effect .  but now there must be a million tons of rock blocking the tunnel  and i can   t see anyone doing any creeping through that .   the unpleasantly alive screen surfaced briefly in his memory  but even that didn   t seem so bad now .  it had been dark in there  there had been lots of moving shadows  he had been wound up like a spring in any case  no wonder his eyes had played tricks on him .  there had been the skeletons  too  but even they now lacked the power to terrify .  victor had heard of tribal leaders up on the cold plains who   d be buried with whole armies of mounted horsemen  so that their souls would live on in the next world .  maybe there was something like that here  once .  yes  it all seemed much less horrifying in the cold light of day .   and that   s just what it was .  cold light .   the room was full of the kind of light you got when you woke up on a winter   s morning and knew  by the light  that it had snowed .  it was a light without shadows .   he went to the window and looked out on a pale silver glow .   holy wood had vanished .   the visions of the night fountained up in his mind again  as the darkness returns when the light goes out .   hang on  hang on  he thought  fighting the panic .  it   s only fog .  you   re bound to get fog sometimes  this close to the sea .  and it   s glowing like that because the sun   s out .  there   s nothing occult about fog .  it   s just fine drops of water floating in the air .  that   s all it is .   he dragged his clothes on and threw open the door to the passage and almost tripped over gaspode  who had been lying full length in front of the door like the world   s most unwashed draft excluder .   the little dog raised himself unsteadily on his front paws  fixed victor with a yellow eye and said     i jus    want you to know  right  that i ain   t lyin    in front of your door    cos of any of this loyal dog protectin    his master nonsense  ok  it   s jus    that when i got back here           shut up  gaspode .      victor opened the outer door .  fog drifted in .  it seemed to have an exploratory feel to it  it came in as if it had been waiting for just this opportunity .      fog   s just fog     he said aloud .     come on .  we   re going to ankh morpork today  remember .         my head     said gaspode     my head feels like the bottom of a cat   s basket .         you can sleep on the coach .  i can sleep on the coach  if it comes to that .      he took a few steps into the silvery glow  and was almost immediately lost .  buildings loomed vaguely at him in the thick clammy air .      gaspode .     he said hesitantly .  fog   s just fog  he repeated .  but it feels crowded .  it feels like that  if it suddenly went away  i   d see lots of people watching me .  from outside .  and that   s ridiculous  because i am outside  so there   s nothing outside of outside .  and it   s flickering .      i expect you   ll be wantin    me to lead the way     said a smug voice by his knee .      it   s very quiet  isn   t it .     said victor  trying to sound nonchalant .     i expect it   s the fog muffling everything .         o   corse  maybe gharstely creatures have come up out o    the sea and murthered every mortal soul except us     said gaspode conversationally .      shut up .      something loomed up out of the brightness .  as it got closer it got smaller  and the tentacles and antennae that victor   s imagination had been furnishing became the more or less ordinary arms and legs of soll dibbler .      victor .     he said uncertainly .      soll .      soll   s relief was visible .     can   t see a thing in this stuff     he said .     we thought you   d got lost .  come on  it   s nearly noon .  we   re more or less ready to go .         i   m ready .         good .     fog droplets had condensed on soll   s hair and clothing .     er     he said .     where are we  exactly .      victor turned around .  his lodgings had been behind him .      the fog changes everything  doesn   t it .     said soll unhappily .     er  do you think your little dog can find his way to the studio .  he seems quite bright .         growl  growl     said gaspode  and sat up and begged in what victor at least recognized as a sarcastic way .      my word     said soll .     it   s as if he understands  isn   t it .      gaspode barked sharply .  after a second or two there was a barrage of excited answering barks .      of course  that   ll be laddie     said soll .     what a clever dog .      gaspode looked smug .      mind you  that   s laddie in a nutshell     said soll  as they set off toward the barking .     i expect he could teach your dog a few tricks  eh .      victor didn   t dare look down .   after a few false turns the archway of century of the fruitbat passed overhead like a ghost .  there were more people here  the site seemed to be filling up with lost wanderers who didn   t know where else to go .     there was a coach waiting outside dibbler   s office and dibbler himself stood beside it  stamping his feet .      come on  come on     he said     i   ve sent gaffer ahead with the film .  get in  the pair of you .         can we travel in this .     said victor .      what   s to go wrong .     said dibbler .     there   s one road to ankh morpork .  anyway  we   ll probably be well out of this stuff when we leave the coast .  i don   t see why everyone   s so nervy .  fog   s fog .         that   s what i say     said victor  climbing into the coach .      it   s just a mercy we finished blown away yesterday     said dibbler .     all this is probably just something seasonal .  nothing to worry about at all .         you said that before     said soll .     you said it at least five times so far this morning .      ginger was hunched on one seat  with laddie lying underneath it .  victor slid along until he was next to her .      did you get any sleep .     he whispered .      just an hour or two  i think     she said .     nothing happened .  no dream or anything .      victor relaxed .      then it really is over     he said .     i wasn   t sure .         and the fog .     she demanded .      sorry .     said victor guiltily .      what   s causing the fog .         well     said victor     as i understand it  when cool air passes over warm ground  water is precipitated out of           you know what i mean .  it   s not like normal fog at all .  it   sort of drifts oddly     she finished lamely .     and you can nearly hear voices     she added .      you can   t nearly hear voices     said victor  in the hope that his own rational mind would believe him .     you either hear them or you don   t .  listen  we   re both just tired .  that   s all it is .  we   ve been working hard and  er  not getting much sleep  so it   s understandable that we think we   re nearly hearing and seeing things .           oh  so you   re nearly seeing things  are you .     said ginger triumphantly .     and don   t you go around using that calm and reasonable tone of voice on me     she added .     i hate it when people go around being calm and reasonable at me .         i hope you two lovebirds aren   t having a tiff .      victor and ginger stiffened .  dibbler clambered up into the opposite seat  and leered encouragingly at them .  soll followed .  there was a slam as the driver shut the carriage door .      we   ll stop for a meal when we   re halfway     said dibbler  as they lurched forward .  he hesitated  and then sniffed suspiciously .      what   s that smell .     he said .      i   m afraid my dog is under your seat     said victor .      is it ill .     said dibbler .      i   m afraid it always smells like that .         don   t you think it would be a good idea to give it a bath .      a mutter on the edge of hearing said     do you think it would be a good idea to have your feet bitten right orf .      meanwhile  over holy wood  the fog thickened         the posters for blown away had been circulating in ankh morpork for several days  and interest was running at fever pitch .   they   d even got as far as the university this time .  the librarian had one pinned up in the fetid  book lined nest he called home   and various others were surreptitiously circulating among the wizards themselves .   the artist had produced a masterpiece .  held in victor   s arms  against the background of the flaming city  ginger was portrayed as not only showing nearly all she had but quite a lot of what she had not  strictly speaking  got .   the effect on the wizards was everything that dibbler could possibly have hoped for .  in the uncommon room  the poster was passed from hand to shaking hand as if it might explode .      there   s a girl who   s got it     said the chair of indefinite studies .  he was one of the fattest wizards  and so overstuffed that he seemed to be living up to his title .  he looked as though horsehair should be leaking from frayed patches .  people felt an overpowering urge to rummage down the side of him for loose change .      what   s    it     chair .     said another wizard .      oh  you know .  it .  oomph .  the old way hey hey .      they watched him politely and expectantly  like people awaiting the punch line .      good grief  do i have to spell it out .     he said .      he means sexual magnetism     said the lecturer in recent runes  happily .     the lure of wanton soft bosoms and huge pulsating thighs  and the forbidden fruits of desire which        a couple of wizards carefully moved their chairs away from him .      ah  sex     said the dean of pentacles  interrupting the lecturer in recent runes in mid sigh .     far too much of it these days  in my opinion .         oh  i don   t know     said the lecturer in recent runes .  he looked wistful .   the noise woke up windle poons  who had been dozing in his wheelchair by the fire .  there was always a roaring fire in the uncommon room  summer or winter .      wassat .     he said .   the dean leaned toward an ear .      i was saying     he said loudly     that we didn   t know the meaning of the word    sex    when we were young .         that   s true .  that   s very true     said poons .  he stared reflectively at the flames .     did we ever  mm  find out  do you remember .        there was a moment   s silence .      say what you like  she   s a fine figure of a young woman     said the lecturer in recent runes defiantly .      several young women     said the dean .   windle poons focused unsteadily on the poster .      who   s the young feller .     he said .      what young feller .     said several wizards .      he   s in the middle of the picture     said poons .     he   s holding her in his arms .      they looked again .     oh  him     said the chair  dismissively .      seems to me i   ve  mm  seen him before     said poons .      my dear poons  i hope you haven   t been sneaking off to the moving pictures     said the dean  grinning at the others .      you know it   s demeaning for a wizard to patronize the common entertainments .  the archchancellor would be very angry with us .         wassat .     said poons  cupping a hand to his ear .      he does look a bit familiar  now that you mention it     said the dean  peering at the poster .   the lecturer in recent runes put his head on one side .      it   s young victor  isn   t it .     he said .      eh .     said poons .      you know  you could be right     said the chair of indefinite studies .     he had the same type of weedy mustache .         who   s this .     said poons .      but he was a student .  he could have been a wizard     said the dean .     why would he want to go off and fondle young women .         it   s a victor all right  but not our victor .  says here he   s    victor maraschino        said the chair .      oh  that   s just a click name     said the lecturer in recent runes airily .     they all have funny names like that .  delores de syn and blanche languish and rock cliffe and so on       he realized that they were looking at him accusingly .     or so i   m told     he added lamely .     by the porter .  he goes to see a click nearly every night .         what   re you on about .     said poons  waving his walking stick in the air .      the cook goes every night  too     said the chair .     so do most of the kitchen staff .  you just try getting so much as a ham sandwich after nine o   clock .         just about everyone goes     said the lecturer .     except us .      one of the other wizards peered intently at the bottom of the poster .      it says here     he said        a sarger of passione and broad staircases in ankh morpork   s turbelent histry .            ah .  it   s historical  then  is it .     said the lecturer .      and it says    a epic love story that astoundede goddes and menne .  .            oh .  religious  as well .         and it says     withe a       elephants .  .  .            ah .  wildlife .  always very educational  wildlife     said the chair  looking speculatively at the dean .  the other wizards were doing so  too .      it seems to me     said the lecturer  slowly     that no one could possibly object to senior wizards viewing a work of historical  religious and  er  wildliforific interest .         university rules are very specific     said the dean  but not very enthusiastically .      but surely only meant for the students     said the lecturer .     i can quite understand that students shouldn   t be allowed to watch something like this .  they   d probably whistle and throw things at the screen .  but it couldn   t be seriously suggested  could it  that senior wizards such as ourselves shouldn   t examine this popular phenomenon .      poons    flailing walking stick caught the dean sharply across the back of his legs .      i demand to know what everyone   s talking about .     he snapped .        we don   t see why senior wizards shouldn   t be allowed to watch moving pictures .     bellowed the chair .      jolly good thing  too .     snapped poons .     everyone likes to look at a pretty woman .         no one mentioned anything about any pretty women .  we were far more interested in examining popular phenomenons     said the chair .      call it what you like  mm .     cackled windle poons .      if people see wizards strolling out of the gate and going into a common moving picture pit they   ll lose all respect for the profession     said the dean .     it   s not even as if it   s proper magic .  it   s just trickery .         y   know     said one of the lesser wizards  thoughtfully      i   ve always wondered exactly what these wretched clicks are .  some kind of puppet show  are they .  are these people acting on a stage .  or a shadow play .         see .     said the chair .     we   re supposed to be wise  and we don   t even know .      they all looked at the dean .      yes  but who wants to see a lot of young women dancing around in tights .     he said  hopelessly .       ponder stibbons  luckiest post graduate wizard in the history of the university  sauntered happily toward the secret entrance over the wall .  his otherwise uncrowded mind was pleasantly awash with thoughts of beer and maybe a visit to the clicks and maybe a klatchian extra hot curry to round off the evening  and then     it was the second worst moment in his life .   they were all there .  all the senior staff .  even the dean .  even old poons in his wheelchair .  all standing there in the shadows  looking at him very sternly .  paranoia exploded its dark fireworks in the dustbin of his mind .  they were all waiting just for him .   he froze .   the dean spoke .        oh .  oh .  oh .  er .  ah .  um .  um     he began  and then seemed to catch up with his tongue .     oh .  what   s this .  forward this minute  that man .      ponder hesitated .  then he ran for it .   after a while the lecturer in recent runes said     that was young stibbons  wasn   t it .  has he gone .         i think so .         he   s bound to say something to someone .         no he won   t     said the dean .      do you think he saw where we   d taken out the bricks .         no  i was standing in front of the holes     said the chair .      come on  then .  where were we .         look  i really think this is most unwise     said the dean .      just shut up  old chap  and hold this brick .         very well  but tell me this  how do you propose to get the wheelchair over .      they looked at poons    wheelchair .   there are wheelchairs which are lightweight and built to let their owners function fully and independently in modern society .  to the thing inhabited by poons  they were as gazelles to a hippopotamus .  poons was well aware of his function in modern society  and as far as he was concerned it was to be pushed everywhere and generally pandered to .   it was wide and long and steered by means of a little front wheel and a long cast iron handle .  cast iron  in fact  featured largely in its construction .  bits of baroque ironwork adorned its frame  which seemed to have been made of iron drainpipes welded together .  the rear wheels did not in fact have blades affixed to them  but looked as though these were optional extras .  there were various dread levers which only poons knew the purpose of .  there was a huge oilskin hood that could be erected in a matter of hours to protect its occupant from showers  storms and  probably  meteor strikes and falling buildings .  by way of light relief  the front handle was adorned with a selection of trumpets  hooters and whistles  with which poons was wont to announce his progress around the passages and quadrangles of the university .  for the fact was that although the wheelchair needed all the efforts of one strong man to get it moving it had  once actually locomotive  a sort of ponderous unstoppability  it may have had brakes  but windle poons had never bothered to find out .  staff and students alike knew that the only hope of survival  if they heard a honk or a blast at close range  was to flatten themselves against the nearest wall while the dreaded conveyance rattled by .      we   ll never get that over     said the dean firmly .     it must weigh at least a ton .  we ought to leave him behind  anyway .  he   s too old for this sort of thing .         when i was a lad i was over this wall  mm  every night     said poons  resentfully .  he chuckled .     we had some scrapes in those days  i can tell you .  if i had a penny  mm  for every time the watch chased me home     his ancient lips moved in a sudden frenzy of calculation     i   d have fivepence ha   penny .         maybe if we       the chair began  and then said    what do you mean  fivepence ha   penny .         i recall once they gave up halfway     said poons  happily .      oh  those were great times .  i remember me and old    numbers    riktor and    tudgy    spold climbed up on the temple of small gods  you see  in the middle of a service  and tudgy had got this piglet in a sack  and he           see what you   ve done .     complained the lecturer in recent runes .     you   ve set him off now .         we could try lifting it by magic     said the chair .     gindle   s effortless elevator should do the trick .            and then the high priest turned around and  heh  the look on his face .  and then old numbers said  let   s           it   s hardly a very dignified use of magic     sniffed the dean .      considerably more dignified than heaving the bloody thing over the wall ourselves  wouldn   t you say .     said the lecturer in recent runes  rolling up his sleeves .     come on  lads .              and next thing  pimple was hammering on the door of the assassins    guild  and then old scummidge  who was the porter there  heehee  he was a right terror  anyway  he came out  mm  and then the guards come around the corner           all ready .  right .            which puts me in mind of the time me and    cucumber    framer got some glue and went around to           up your end  dean .      the wizards grunted with effort .         and  mm  i can remember it as if it was only yesterday  the look on his face when           now lower away .      the iron shod wheels clanged gently on the cobbles of the alley .   poons nodded amiably .     great times .  great times     he muttered  and fell asleep .   the wizards climbed slowly and unsteadily over the wall  ample backsides gleaming in the moonlight  and stood wheezing gently on the far side .      tell me  dean     said the lecturer  leaning on the wall to stop the shaking in his legs     have we made   the wall   higher in the last fifty years .         i   don   t   think   so .         odd .  used to go up it like a gazelle .  not many years ago .  not many at all  really .      the wizards wiped their foreheads and looked sheepishly at one another .      used to nip over for a pint or three most nights     said the chair .      i used to study in the evenings     said the dean  primly .   the chair narrowed his eyes .      yes  you always did     he said .     i recall .      it was dawning on the wizards that they were outside the university  at night and without permission  for the first time in decades .  a certain suppressed excitement crackled from man to man .  any watcher trained in reading body language would have been prepared to bet that  after the click  someone was going to suggest that they might as well go somewhere and have a few drinks  and then someone else would fancy a meal  and then there was always room for a few more drinks  and then it would be   a . m .  and the city guards would be respectfully knocking on the university gates and asking if the archchancellor would care to step down to the cells to identify some alleged wizards who were singing an obscene song in six part harmony  and perhaps he would also care to bring some money to pay for all the damage .  because inside every old person is a young person wondering what happened .   the chair reached up and grasped the brim of his tall  wide and floppy wizarding hat .      right  boys     he said .     hats off .      they de hatted  but with reluctance .  a wizard gets very attached to his pointy hat .  it gives him a sense of identity .  but  as the chair had pointed out earlier  if people knew you were a wizard because you were wearing a pointy hat  then if you took the pointy hat off  they   d think you were just some rich merchant or something .   the dean shuddered .     it feels like i   ve taken all my clothes off     he said .      we can tuck them in under poons    blanket     said the chair .     no one   ll know it   s us .         yes     said the lecturer in recent runes     but will we .         they   ll just think we   re  well  solid burghers .         that   s just what i feel like     said the dean .     a solid burgher .         or merchants     said the chair .  he smoothed back his white hair .      remember     he said     if anyone says anything  we   re not wizards .  just honest merchants out for an enjoyable evening  right .         what does an honest merchant look like .     said a wizard .      how should i know .     said the chair .     so no one is to do any magic     he went on .     i don   t have to tell you what   ll happen if the archchancellor hears that his staff has been seen at the common entertainments .         i   m more worried about our students finding out     shuddered the dean .      false beards     said the lecturer in recent runes  triumphantly .     we should wear false beards .      the chair rolled his eyes .      we   ve all got beards     he said .     what kind of disguise would false beards be .         ah .  that   s the clever bit     said the lecturer .     no one would suspect that anyone wearing a false beard would have a real beard underneath  would they .      the chair opened his mouth to refute this  and then hesitated .      well       he said .      but where   d we get false beards at this time of night .     said a wizard doubtfully .   the lecturer beamed  and reached into his pocket .     we don   t have to     he said .     that   s the really clever bit  i brought some wire with me  you see  and all you need do is break two bits off  twiddle them into your sideburns  then loop them over your ears rather clumsily like this     he demonstrated     and there you are .      the chair stared .      uncanny     he said  at last .     it   s true .  you look just like someone wearing a very badly made false beard .         amazing  isn   t it .     said the lecturer happily  passing out the wire .     it   s headology  you know .      there were a few minutes of busy twanging and the occasional whimper as a wizard punctured himself with wire  but eventually they were ready .  they looked shyly at one another .      if we got a pillow case without a pillow in it and shoved it down inside the chair   s robe so the top was showing  he   d look just like a thin man making himself tremendously fat with a huge pillow     said one of them enthusiastically .  he caught the chair   s eye  and went quiet .   a couple of wizards grasped the handles of poons    terrible wheelchair and started it rumbling over the damp cobbles .      wassat .  what   s everyone doing .     said poons  suddenly waking up .      we   re going to play solid burghers     said the dean .      that   s a good game     said poons .          can you hear me  old chap .      the bursar opened his eyes .   the university sanitarium wasn   t very big  and was seldom used .  wizards tended to be either in rude health  or dead .  the only medicine they generally required was an antacid formula and a dark room until lunch .      brought you something to read     said the voice  diffidently .   the bursar managed to focus on the spine of adventures with crossbow and rod .      nasty knock you had there  bursar .  been asleep all day .      the bursar looked blearily at the pink and orange haze  which gradually refined itself into the archchancellor   s pink and orange face .   let   s see  he thought  exactly how did i     he sat bolt upright and grabbed the archchancellor   s robe and screamed into the big pink and orange face     something dreadful   s going to happen .          the wizards strolled through the twilight streets .  so far the disguise was working perfectly .  people were even jostling them .  no one ever knowingly jostled a wizard .  it was a whole new experience .   there was a huge crowd of people outside the entrance to the odium  and a queue that stretched down the street .  the dean ignored it  and led the party straight up to the doors  whereupon someone said    oi .      he looked up at a red faced troll in an ill fitting military looking outfit that included epaulettes the size of kettledrums and no trousers .      yes .     he said .      there are a queue  you know     said the troll .   the dean nodded politely .  in ankh morpork a queue was  almost by definition  something with a wizard at the head of it .     so i see     he said .     and a very good thing  too .  and if you will be so good as to stand aside  we   d like to take our seats .      the troll prodded him in the stomach .      what you fink you are .     he said .     a wizard or something .     this got a laugh from the nearest queuers .   the dean leaned closer .      as a matter of fact  we are wizards     he hissed .   the troll grinned at him .      don   t come the raw trilobite with me     he said .     i can see your false beard .         now listen       the dean began  but his voice became an incoherent squeak as the troll picked him up by the collar of his robe and propelled him out into the road .      you get in queue like everyone else     he said .  there was a chorus of jeers from the queue .   the dean growled and raised his right hand  fingers spread     the chair grabbed his arm .      oh  yes     he hissed .     that   d do a lot of good  wouldn   t it .  come on .         where to .         to the back of the queue .         but we   re wizards .  wizards never stand in line for anything .           we   re honest merchants  remember .     said the chair .  he glanced at the nearest click goers  who were giving them odd looks .     we   re honest merchants     he repeated loudly .  he nudged the dean .     go on     he hissed .      go on what .         go on and say something merchanty .         what sort of thing is that .     said the dean  mystified .      say something .  everyone   s looking at us .         oh .     the dean   s face creased in panic  and then salvation dawned .     lovely apples     he said .     get them while they   re hot .  they   re luvverly   will this do .         i suppose so .  now let   s go to the end        there was a commotion at the other end of the street .  people surged forward .  the queue broke ranks and charged .  the honest merchants were suddenly surrounded by a desperately pushing crowd .      i say  there is a queue  you know     said the honest merchant in recent runes diffidently  as he was shoved aside .   the dean grabbed the shoulder of a boy who was ferociously elbowing him aside .      what is going on  young man .     he demanded .      they   re a coming .     shouted the boy .      who are .         the stars .      the wizards  as one man  looked upward .      no  they   re not     said the dean  but the boy had shaken himself free and disappeared in the press of people .      strange primitive superstition     said the dean  and the wizards  with the exception of poons  who was complaining and flailing around with his stick  craned forward to see .       the bursar met the archchancellor in a corridor .      there   s no one in the uncommon room .     screamed the bursar .      the library   s empty .     bellowed the archchancellor .        i   ve heard about that sort of thing     the bursar whimpered .     spontaneous something or other .  they   ve all gone spontaneous .         calm down  man .  just because           i can   t even find any of the servants .  you know what happens when reality gives way .  even now giant tentacles are probably        there was a distant whumm   whumm noise  and the sound of pellets bouncing off the wall .      always the same direction     the bursar muttered .      what direction is that  then .         the direction they   ll be coming from .  i think i   m going mad .         now  now     said the archchancellor  patting him on the shoulder .     you don   t want to go around talking like that .  that   s crazy talk .          ginger stared  panic stricken  out of the carriage window .      who are all these people .     she said .      they   re fans     said dibbler .      but i   m not hot .         uncle means that they   re people who like seeing you in the clicks     said soll .     er .  like you a lot .         there   s women out there too     said victor .  he gave a cautious wave .  in the crowd  a woman swooned .      you   re famous     he said .     you said you always wanted to be famous .      ginger looked out at the crowd again .     i never thought it would be like this  though .  they   re all shouting our names .         we   ve put a lot of effort into telling people about blown away     said soll .      yes     said dibbler .     we said it was the greatest click in the entire history of holy wood .         but we   ve been making clicks for only a couple of months     ginger pointed out .      so what .  that   s still a history     said dibbler .     victor saw the look in ginger   s face .  exactly how long was holy wood   s real history .  perhaps there was some ancient stone calendar  down there on the sea bed  among the lobsters .  perhaps there was no way it could be measured .  how did you measure the age of an idea .      a lot of civic dignitaries are going to be there  too     said dibbler .     the patrician and the nobles and the guild heads and some of the high priests .  not the wizards  of course  the stuck up old idiots .  but it   ll be a night to remember right enough .         will we have to be introduced to them all .     said victor .      no .  they   ll be introduced to you     said dibbler .     it   ll be the biggest thrill of their lives .      victor stared out at the crowds again .      is it my imagination     he said     or is it getting foggy .          poons hit the chair across the back of the legs with his stick .      what   s going on .     he said .     why   s everyone cheering .         the patrician   s just got out of his carriage     said the chair .      don   t see what   s so wonderful about that     said poons .      i   ve got out of carriages hundreds of times .  there   s no trick to it at all .         it   s a bit odd     the chairman admitted .     and they cheered the head of the assassins    guild and the high priest of blind io  too .  and now someone   s rolled out a red carpet .         what  in the street .  in ankh morpork .         yes .         wouldn   t like to have their cleaning bill     said poons .   the lecturer in recent runes nudged the chair heavily in the ribs  or at least at the point where the ribs were overlaid by the strata of fifty years of very good dinners .      quiet .     he hissed .     they   re coming .         who .         someone important  by the look of it .      the chair   s face creased in panic behind his false real beard .     you don   t think they   ve invited the archchancellor  do you .      the wizards tried to shrink inside their robes  like upright turtles .   in fact it was a far more impressive coach than any of the crumbling items in the university   s mews .  the crowd surged forward against the line of trolls and city guards and stared expectantly at the carriage door  the very air hummed with anticipation .   mr .  bezam  his chest so inflated with self importance that he appeared to be floating across the ground  bobbed toward the carriage door and opened it .   the crowd held its collective breath  except for a small part of it that hit surrounding people with its stick and muttered     what   s happening .  what   s going on .  why won   t anyone tell me what   s happening .  i demand someone tell me  mm  what   s happening .          the door stayed shut .  ginger was gripping the handle as if it was a lifeline .      there   s thousands of them out there .     said ginger .     i can   t go out there .         but they all watch your clicks     pleaded soll .     they   re your public .         no .      soll threw up his hands .     can   t you persuade her .     he said to victor .      i   m not even sure i can persuade myself     said victor .      but you   ve spent days in front of these people     said dibbler .      no i haven   t     said ginger .     it was just you and the handlemen and the trolls and everyone .  that was different .  anyway  that wasn   t really me     she added .     that was delores de syn .      victor bit his lip thoughtfully .        maybe you ought to send delores de syn out there  then     he said .      how can i do that .     she demanded .      well   why not pretend it   s a click    .      the dibblers  uncle and nephew  exchanged glances .  then soll cupped his hands around his face like the eye of a picture box and dibbler  after a prompting nudge  placed one hand on his nephew   s head and turned an invisible handle in his ear .      action .     he directed .       the carriage door swung open .   the crowd gasped  like a mountain breathing in .  victor stepped out  reached up  took ginger   s hand     the crowd cheered  madly .   the lecturer in recent runes bit his fingers in sheer excitement .  the chair made a strange hoarse noise in the back of his throat .      you know you said what could a boy find to do that was better than being a wizard .     he said .      a true wizard should only be interested in one thing     muttered the dean .     you know that .         oh  i know it .         i was referring to magic .      the chair peered at the advancing figures .      you know  that is young victor .  i   ll swear it     he said .      that   s disgusting     said the dean .     fancy choosing to hang around young women when he could have been a wizard .         yeah .  what a fool     said the lecturer in recent runes  who was having trouble with his breathing .   there was a sort of communal sigh .      you got to admit she   s a bit of a corker  though     said the chair .      i   m an old man and if someone doesn   t let me see very soon     said a cracked voice behind them     someone   s going to be feeling the wrong end of  mm  my stick  all right .      two of the wizards edged aside and eased the wheelchair through .  once moving  it coasted right up to the edge of the carpet  bruising any knees or ankles that stood in its way .   poons    mouth fell open .   ginger gripped victor   s hand .      there   s a group of fat old men in false beards waving at you over there     she said through clenched and grinning teeth .      yes  i think they   re wizards     victor grinned back .      one of them keeps bouncing up and down in his wheelchair and shouting things like    way hey .     and    whoopwhoop .     and    hubba hubba           that   s the oldest wizard in the world     said victor .  he waved at a fat lady in the crowd  who fainted .      good grief .  what was he like fifty years ago .         well  for one thing he was eighty .     don   t blow him a kiss .      the crowd roared its approval .      he looks sweet .         just keep smiling and waving .         oh  gods  look at all those people waiting to be introduced to us .         i can see    em     said victor .      but they   re important .         well  so are we .  i guess .         why .         because we   re us .  it   s like you said  that time on the beach .  we   re us  just as big as we can be .  it   s just what you wanted .  we   re        he stopped .   the troll at the door of the odium gave him a hesitant salute .  the thump as its hand smacked into its ear was quite audible above the roar of the crowd         gaspode waddled at high speed down an alleyway  with laddie trotting obediently at his heels .  no one had paid them any attention when they jumped  or in gaspode   s case plopped  down from the carriage .      all evening in some stuffy pit ain   t my idea of a good night out     muttered gaspode .     this is the big city .  this ain   t holy wood .  you stick by me  pup  and you   ll be all right .  first stop  the back door of harga   s house of ribs .  they know me there .  ok .         good boy laddie .         yeah     said gaspode .          look at what it   s wearing .     said victor .      red velvet jacket with gold frogging     said ginger out of the corner of her mouth .     so what .  a pair of trousers would have been a good idea .         oh  gods     breathed victor .   they stepped into the brightly lit foyer of the odium .   bezam had done his best .  trolls and dwarfs had worked overnight to finish it .   there were red plush drapes  and pillars  and mirrors .   plump cherubs and miscellaneous fruit  all painted gold  seemed to cover every surface .   it was like stepping into a box of very expensive chocolates .   or a nightmare .  victor half expected to hear the roar of the sea  to see drapes fall away with a smear of black slime .      oh  gods     he repeated .      what   s the matter with you .     said ginger  grinning fixedly at the line of civic dignitaries waiting to be introduced to them .      wait and see     said victor hoarsely .     it   s holy wood .  holy wood   s been brought to ankh morpork .           yes  but           don   t you remember anything .  that night in the hill .  before you woke up .         no .  i told you .         wait and see     victor repeated .  he glanced at a decorated easel against one wall .   it said     three showings a day .      and he thought of sand dunes  and ancient myths  and lobsters .       map making had never been a precise art on the discworld .  people tended to start off with good intentions and then get so carried away with the spouting whales  monsters  waves and other twiddly bits of cartographic furniture that they often forgot to put the boring mountains and rivers in at all .   the archchancellor put an overflowing ashtray on a corner that threatened to roll up .  he dragged a finger across the grubby surface .      says here    here be dragons        he said .     right inside the city  too .  odd  that .         that   s just lady ramkin   s sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons     said the bursar  distractedly .      and here there   s    terra incognita        said the archchancellor .     why   s that .      the bursar craned to see .     well  it   s probably more interesting than putting in lots of cabbage farms .         and there   s    here be dragons    again .         i think that   s just a lie  in fact .      the archchancellor   s horny thumb continued in the direction they   d worked out .  he brushed aside a couple of fly specks .      nothing here at all     he said  peering closer .     just the sea .  and       he squinted      the holy wood .  mean anything .         isn   t that where the alchemists all went .     said the bursar .      oh  them .           i suppose     said the bursar slowly     they wouldn   t be doing some kind of magic out there .         alchemists .  doing magic .         sorry .  ridiculous idea  i know .  the porter told me they do some sort of  oh  shadow play or something .  or puppets .  or something similar .  pictures .  or something .  i wasn   t really paying attention .  i mean   alchemists .  really .  i mean  assassins   yes .  thieves   yes .  even merchants   merchants can be really devious  sometimes .  but alchemists   show me a more unworldly  bumbling  well meaning        his voice trailed off as his ears caught up with his mouth .      they wouldn   t dare  would they .     he said .      would they .      the bursar gave a hollow laugh .     no o o .  they wouldn   t dare .  they know we   d be down on them like a ton of bricks if they tried any magic around here       his voice trailed off again .      i   m sure they wouldn   t     he said .      i mean  even that far away     he said .      they wouldn   t dare     he said .      not magic .  surely not .     he said .      i   ve never trusted those grubby handed bastards .     he said .     they   re not like us  you know .  they   ve got no idea of proper dignity .          the crowd surging around the box office was getting deeper and more angry by the minute .      well  have you gone through all your pockets .     demanded the chair .      yes .     muttered the dean .      have another look  then .      as far as wizards were concerned  paying to get into anything was something that happened to other people .  a pointy hat usually did nicely .   while the dean struggled  the chair beamed madly at the young woman who was selling tickets .     but i assure you  dear lady     he said desperately     we are wizards .         i can see your false beards     said the girl  and sniffed .      we get all sorts in here .  how do i know you aren   t three little boys in your dad   s coat .         madam .         i   ve got two dollars and fifteen pence     said the dean  picking the coins out of a handful of fluff and mysterious occult objects .      that   s two in the stalls  then     said the girl  grudgingly unreeling two tickets .  the chair scooped them up .      then i   ll take windle in     he said quickly  turning to the others .     i   m afraid the rest of you had better get back to your honest trading .     he moved his eyebrows up and down suggestively .      i don   t see why we should       the dean began .      otherwise we   ll be in arrears     the chair went on  mugging furiously .     if you don   t get back .         see here  that was my money  and       the dean said  but the lecturer in recent runes grabbed his arm .      just come along     he said  winked slowly and deliberately at the chair .     time we were getting back .         i don   t see why       the dean gurgled  as they dragged him off .       gray clouds swirled in the archchancellor   s magic mirror .  many wizards had them  but not many ever bothered to use them .  they were quirky and unreliable .  they weren   t even much good for shaving in .   ridcully was surprisingly adept at using one .      stalkin        he offered as a brief explanation     couldn   t be having with all that crawlin    around in damp bracken for hours  bigods .  help yourself to a drink  man .  and one for me .      the clouds flickered .        can   t seem to see anything else     he said .     odd  that .  just fog  flashing away .      the archchancellor coughed .  it was beginning to dawn on the bursar that  against all expectation  the archchancellor was quite bright .      ever seen one of these shadow moving puppet play picture things .     ridcully asked .      the servants go     said the bursar .  this  ridcully decided  meant    no .         i think we should have a look     he said .      very well  archchancellor     said the bursar  meekly .       an inviolable rule about buildings for the showing of moving pictures  applicable throughout the multiverse  is that the ghastliness of the architecture around the back is inversely proportional to the gloriousness of the architecture in the front .  at the front  pillars  arches  gold leaf  lights .  at the back  weird ducts  mysterious prolapses of pipework  blank walls  fetid alleys .   and the window to the lavatories .      there   s no reason at all why we should have to do this     moaned the dean  as the wizards struggled in the darkness .      shut up and keep pushing     muttered the lecturer in recent runes  from the other side of the window .      we should have changed something into money     said the dean .     just a quick illusion .  where   s the harm in that .         it   s called watering the currency     said the lecturer in recent runes .     you can get thrown into the scorpion pit for stuff like that .  where am i putting my feet .  where am i putting my feet .         you   re fine     said a wizard .     right  dean .  up you come .         oh  dear     moaned the dean  as he was dragged through the narrow window into the unmentionable gloom beyond .      no good will come of this .         just watch where you   re putting your feet .  now see what you   ve done .  didn   t i tell you to watch where you were putting your feet .  anyway  come on .      the wizards skulked  or in the dean   s case  squelched furtively through the backstage area and into the darkened  bustling auditorium  where windle poons was keeping some seats free by the simple expedient of waving his stick at anyone who came near them .  they sidled in  tripping over one another   s legs  and sat down .   they stared at the shadowy gray rectangle at the other end of the hall .   after a while the chair said     can   t see what people see in it  myself .         has anyone done    deformed rabbit    .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      it hasn   t started yet     hissed the dean .      i   m hungry     complained poons .     i   m an old man  mm  and i   m hungry .         do you know what he did .     said the chair .     do you know what the old fool did .  when a young lady with a torch was showing us to our seats he pinched her on the   the fundament .      poons sniggered .     hubba hubba .  does your mother know you   re out .     he cackled .      it   s all too much for him     the chair complained .     we never should have brought him .         do you realize we   re missing our dinner .     said the dean .   the wizards fell silent at this .  a stout woman edging past poons    wheelchair suddenly started and looked around suspiciously and saw nothing except a dear old man  obviously fast asleep .      and it   s goose on tuesdays     said the dean .   poons opened one eye and honked the horn on his wheelchair .      tantarabobs .  how   s your granny off for soap .     he muttered triumphantly .        see what i mean .     said the chair .     he doesn   t know what century it is .      poons turned a beady black eye on him .      old i am  mm  and daft i may be     he said     but i ain   t goin    to be hungry .     he rummaged around in the unspeakable depths of the wheelchair and produced a greasy black bag .  it jingled .     i saw a young lady up the front a selling of special moving picture food     he said .      you mean you had money all the time .     said the dean .      and you never told us .         you never asked     said poons .   the wizards stared hungrily at the bag .      they be having buttered banged grains and sausages in buns and chocolate things with things on and things     said poons .  he gave them a toothless and crafty look .     you can have some too  if you like     he added graciously .       the dean ticked off his purchases .     now     he said     that   s six patrician sized tubs of banged grains with extra butter  eight sausages in a bun  a jumbo cup of fizzy drink  and a bag of chocolate covered raisins .     he handed over the money .      right     said the chair  gathering up the containers .     er .  do you think we should get something for the others .          in the picture throwing room bezam cursed as he threaded the huge reel of blown away into the picture throwing box .   a few feet away  in a roped off section of the balcony  the patrician of ankh morpork  lord vetinari  was also ill at ease .   they were  he had to admit  a pleasant enough young couple .  he just wasn   t sure why he was sitting next to them  and why they were so important .   he was used to important people  or at least to people who thought they were important .  wizards became important through high deeds of magic .  thieves became important for daring robberies and so  in a slightly different way  did merchants .  warriors became important through winning battles and staying alive .  assassins became important through skillful inhumations .  there were many roads to prominence  but you could see them  you could work them out .  they made some sort of sense .   whereas these two people had merely moved interestingly in front of this new fangled moving picture machinery .  the rankest actor in the city   s theater was a multi skilled master of thespianism by comparison to them  but it wouldn   t occur to anyone to line the streets and shout out his name .   the patrician had never visited the clicks before .  as far as he could ascertain  victor maraschino was famous for a sort of smouldering look that had middle aged ladies who should know better swooning in the aisles  and miss de syn   s forte was acting languidly  slapping faces  and looking fantastic while lying among silken cushions .   while he  patrician of ankh morpork  ruled the city  preserved the city  loved the city  hated the city and had spent a lifetime in the service of the city     and  as the common people had been filing into the stalls  his razor keen hearing had picked up the conversation of two of them      who   s that up there .         that   s victor maraschino and delores de syn .  do you know nothing .         i mean the tall guy in black .         oh  dunno who he is .  just some bigwig  i expect .      yes  it was fascinating .  you could become famous just for being  well  famous .  it occurred to him that this was an extremely dangerous thing and he might probably have to have someone killed one day  although it would be with reluctance .     in the meantime  there was a kind of secondary glory that came from being in the company of the truly celebrated  and to his astonishment he was enjoying it .   besides he was also sitting next to miss de syn  and the envy of the rest of the audience was so palpable he could taste it  which was more than he could do with the bagful of fluffy white starchy things he   d been given to eat .   on his other side  the horrible dibbler man was explaining the mechanics of moving pictures in the utterly mistaken belief that the patrician was listening to a word of it .   there was a sudden roar of applause .   the patrician leaned sideways to dibbler .      why are all the lamps being turned down .     he said .      ah  sir     said dibbler     that is so you can see the pictures better .         is it .  one would imagine it would make the pictures harder to see     said the patrician .      it   s not like that with the moving pictures  sir     said dibbler .      how very fascinating .      the patrician leaned the other way  to ginger and victor .  to his mild surprise they were looking extremely tense .  he   d noticed that as soon as they had walked into the odium .  the boy looked at all the ridiculous ornamentation as if it was something dreadful  and when the girl had stepped into the pit proper he   d heard her gasp .   they looked as though they were in shock .      i expect this is all perfectly commonplace to you     he said .      no     said victor .     not really .  we   ve never been in a proper picture pit before .         except once     said ginger grimly .      yes .  except once .         but  ah  you make moving pictures     said the patrician kindly .      yes  but we never see them .  we just see bits of them  when the handlemen are gluing it all together .  the only clicks i   ve ever seen were on an old sheet outdoors     said victor .      so this is all new to you .     said the patrician .      not exactly     said victor  gray faced .      fascinating     said the patrician  and went back to not listening to dibbler .  he had not got where he was today by bothering how things worked .  it was how people worked that intrigued him .   further along the row soll leaned across to his uncle and dropped a small coil of film in his lap .      this belongs to you     he said sweetly .      what is it .     said dibbler .      well i thought i   d have a quick look at the click before it got shown           you did .     said dibbler .      and what did i find  in the middle of the burning city scene  but five minutes showing nothing but a plate of spare ribs in harga   s special peanut sauce .  i know why  of course .  i just want to know why this .      dibbler grinned guiltily .     the way i see it     he said     if one little quick picture can make people want to go and buy things  just think what five minutes    worth could do .      soll stared at him .      i   m really hurt by this     said dibbler .     you didn   t trust me .  your own uncle .  after i gave you my solemn promise not to try anything again  you didn   t trust me .  that wounds me  soll .  i   m really wounded .  whatever happened to integrity around here .         i think you probably sold it to someone  uncle .         i   m really hurt     said dibbler .      but you didn   t keep your promise  uncle .         that   s got nothing to do with it .  that   s just business .  we   re talking family here .  you got to learn to trust family  soll .  especially me .      soll shrugged .     ok .  ok .         right .           yes  uncle .     soll grinned .     you   ve got my solemn promise on that .         that   s my boy .      at the other end of the row  victor and ginger were staring at the blank screen in sullen horror .      you know what   s going to happen now  don   t you     said ginger .      yes .  someone   s going to start playing music out of a hole in the floor .         was that cave really a picture pit .         sort of  i think     said victor  carefully .      but the screen here is just a screen .  it   s not   well  it   s just a screen .  just a better class of sheet .  it   s not        there was a blast of sound from the front of the hall .  with a clanking and the hiss of desperately escaping air  bezam   s daughter calliope rose slowly out of the floor  attacking the keys on a small organ with all the verve of several hours    practice and the combined efforts of two strong trolls working the bellows behind the scenes .  she was a beefy young woman and  whatever piece of music she was playing  it was definitely losing .   down in the stalls  the dean passed a bag along to the chair .      have a chocolate covered raisin     he said .      they look like rat droppings     said the chair .   the dean peered at them in the gloom .      so that   s it     he said .     the bag fell on the floor a minute ago  and i thought there seemed rather a lot .         shsss .     said a woman in the row behind .  windle poons    scrawny head turned like a magnet .      hoochie koochie .     he cackled .     twopence more and up goes the donkey .      the lights went down further .  the screen flickered .  numbers appeared and blinked briefly  counting down .   calliope peered intently at the score in front of her  rolled up her sleeves  pushed her hair out of her eyes  and launched a spirited attack on what was just discernible as the old ankh morporkian civic anthem .      the lights went out .       the sky flickered .  it wasn   t like proper fog at all .  it shed a silvery  slatey light  flickering internally like a cross between the aurora coriolis and summer lightning .   in the direction of holy wood the sky blazed with light .  it was visible even in the alley behind sham harga   s house of ribs  where two dogs were enjoying the all you can drag out of the midden for free special .   laddie looked up and growled .      i don   t blame you     said gaspode .     i said it boded .  didn   t i say there was boding happening .      sparks crackled off his fur .      come on     he said .     we   d better warn people .  you   re good at that .          clickaclickaclicka     it was the only noise inside the odium .  calliope had stopped playing and was staring up at the screen .   mouths hung open  and closed only to bite on handfuls of banged grains .   victor was dimly aware that he   d fought it .  he   d tried to look away .  even now  a little voice in his own head was telling him that things were wrong  but he ignored it .  things were clearly right .  he   d shared in the sighs as the heroine tried to preserve the old family mine in a worlde gonne madde   he   d shuddered at the fighting in the war .  he   d watched the ballroom scene in a romantic haze .  he        was aware of a cold sensation against his leg .  it was as though a half melted ice cube was soaking through his trousers .  he tried to ignore it  but it had a definite unignorable quality .   he looked down .         scuse me     said gaspode .   victor   s eyes focused .  then his eyes found themselves being dragged back to the screen  where a huge version of himself was kissing a huge version of ginger .   there was another feeling of sticky coldness .  he surfaced again .      i can bite your leg if you like     said gaspode .      i  er  i       victor began .      i can bite it quite hard     gaspode added .     just say the word .         no  er           something   s boding  just like i said .  bode  bode  bode .  laddie   s tried barkin    until he   s hoarse and no one   s listenin    .  so i fort i   d try the old cold nose technique .  never fails .   victor looked around him .  the rest of the audience were staring at the screen as if they were prepared to remain in their seats for   for        forever .   when he lifted up his arms from his seat  sparks crackled from his fingers  and there was a greasy feel to the air that even student wizards soon learned to associate with a vast accumulation of magical potential .  and there was fog in the pit .  it was ridiculous  but there it was  covering the floor like a pale silver tide .   he shook ginger   s shoulder .  he waved a hand in front of her eyes .  he shouted in her ear .   then he tried the patrician  and dibbler .  they yielded to pressure but swayed gently back into position again .      the film   s doing something to them     he said .     it must be the film .  but i can   t see how .  it   s a perfectly ordinary film .  we don   t use magic in holy wood .  at least   not normal magic          he struggled over unyielding knees until he reached the aisle  and ran up it through the tendrils of fog .  he hammered on the door of the picture throwing room .  when that got no answer he kicked it down .   bezam was staring intently at the screen through a small square hole cut in the wall .  the picture thrower was clicking away happily by itself .  no one was turning the handle .  at least  victor corrected himself  no one he could see .   there was a distant rumble  and the ground shook .   he stared at the screen .  he recognized this bit .  it was just before the burning of ankh morpork scene .   his mind raced .  what was it they said about the gods .  they wouldn   t exist if there weren   t people to believe in them .  and that applied to everything .  reality was what went on inside people   s heads .  and in front of him were hundreds of people really believing what they were seeing     victor scrabbled among the rubbish on bezam   s bench for some scissors or a knife  and found neither .  the machine whirred on  winding reality from the future to the past .   in the background  he could hear gaspode saying     i expect i   ve saved the day  right .      the brain normally echoes with the shouts of various inconsequential thoughts seeking attention .  it takes a real emergency to get them to shut up .  it was happening now .  one clear thought that had been trying to make itself heard for a long time rang out in the silence .   supposing there was somewhere reality was a little thinner than usual .  and supposing you did something there that weakened reality even more .  books wouldn   t do it .  even ordinary theater wouldn   t do it  because in your heart you knew it was just people in funny clothes on a stage .  but holy wood went straight from the eye into the brain .  in your heart you thought it was real .  the clicks would do it .   that was what was under holy wood hill .  the people of the old city had used the hole in reality for entertainment .  and then the things had found them .   and now people were doing it again .  it was like learning to juggle lighted torches in a firework factory .  and the things had been waiting     but why was it still happening .  he   d stopped ginger .   the film clicked on .  there seemed to be a fog around the picture throwing box  blurring its outline .   he snatched at the spinning handle .  it resisted for a moment  and then broke .  he gently pushed bezam off his chair  picked it up and hit the throwing box with it .  the chair exploded into splinters .  he opened the cage at the back and took out the salamanders  and still the film danced on the distant screen .   the building shook again .   you only get one chance  he thought  and then you die .   he pulled off his shirt and wrapped it around his hand .  then he reached out for the flashing line of the film itself  and gripped it .   it snapped .  the box jerked backward .  film went on unreeling in glittering coils which lunged at him briefly and then slithered down to the floor .   clickaclick   a   click .   the reels spun to a halt .   victor cautiously stirred the heap of film with his foot .  he   d been half expecting it to attack him like a snake .      have we saved the day .     prompted gaspode .     i   d appreciate knowing .      victor looked at the screen .      no     he said .   there were still images there .  they weren   t very clear  but he could still make out the vague shapes of himself and ginger  hanging onto existence .  and the screen itself was moving .  it bulged here and there  like ripples of a pool of dull mercury .  it looked unpleasantly familiar .        they   ve found us     he said .      who have .     said gaspode .      you know those ghastly creatures you were talking about .      gaspode   s brow furrowed .     the ones from before the dawnatime .         where they come from  there is no time     said victor .  the audience was stirring .      we must get everyone out of here     he said .     but without panicking        there was a chorus of screams .  the audience was waking up .   the screen ginger was climbing out .  she was three times normal size and flickered visibly .  she was also vaguely transparent  but she had weight  because the floor buckled and splintered under her feet .   the audience was climbing over itself to get away .  victor fought his way down the aisle just as poons    wheelchair went past backward in the flow of people  its occupant flailing desperately and shouting     hey .  hey .  it   s just getting good .      the chair grabbed victor   s arm urgently .      is it meant to do this .     he demanded .      no .         it   s not some sort of special kinematographic effect  then .     said the chair hopefully .      not unless they   ve got really good in the last twenty four hours     said victor .     i think it   s the dungeon dimensions .      the chair stared intently at him .      you are young victor  aren   t you     he said .      yes .  excuse me     said victor .  he pushed past the astonished wizard and climbed over the seats to where ginger was still sitting  staring at her own image .  the monster ginger was looking around and blinking very slowly  like a lizard .        that   s me .         no .     said victor .     that is  yes .  maybe .  not really .  sort of .  come on .         but it looks just like me .     said ginger  her voice modulated with hysteria .      that   s because they   re having to use holy wood .  it   it defines how they can appear  i think     said victor hurriedly .  he tugged her out of the seat and into the air  his feet kicking up mist and scattering banged grains .  she stumbled along after him  looking over her shoulder .      there   s another one trying to come out of the screen     she said .      come on .         it   s you .         i   m me .  it   s   something else .  it   s just having to use my shape .         what shape does it normally use .         you don   t want to know .         yes i do .  why do you think i asked .     she yelled  as they stumbled through the broken seats .      it looks worse than you can imagine .         i can imagine some pretty bad things .         that   s why i said worse .         oh .      the giant spectral ginger passed them  flickering like a strobe light  and smashed its way out through the wall .  there were screams from the outside .      it looks like it   s getting bigger     whispered ginger .      go outside     said victor .     get the wizards to stop it .         what   re you going to do .      victor drew himself up to his full height .     there are some things     he said     that a man has to do by himself .      she gave him a look of irritated incomprehension .      what .  what .  do you want to go to the lavatory or something .           just get out .      he shoved her toward the doors  then turned and saw the two dogs looking at him expectantly .      and you two  too     he said .   laddie barked .      dog   s gotta stay by    is master  style of fing     said gaspode  shame facedly .   victor looked around in desperation  picked up a fragment of seat  opened the door  threw the wood as far as possible and shouted    fetch .      both dogs bounded away after it  propelled by instinct .  on his way past  though  gaspode had just enough self control to say     you bastard .      victor pulled open the door of the picture throwing room and came out with handfuls of blown away .   the giant victor was having trouble leaving the screen .  the head and one arm had pulled free and were three dimensional .  the arms flailed vaguely at victor as he methodically threw coils of octo cellulose over it .  he ran back to the booth and pulled out the stacks of clicks that bezam  in defiance of common sense  had stored under the bench .   working with the methodical calmness of bowel twisting terror  he carried the cans by the armload to the screen and heaped them there .  the thing managed to wrench another arm free of two dimensionality and tried to scrabble at them  but whatever was controlling it was having trouble controlling this new shape .  it was probably unused to having only two arms  victor told himself .   he threw the last can onto the heap .      in our world you have to obey our rules     he said .     and i bet you burn just as well as anything else  hey .      the thing struggled to pull a leg free .   victor patted his pockets .  he ran back to the booth and scrabbled around madly .   matches .  there weren   t any matches .   he pushed open the doors to the foyer and dashed out into the street  where the crowds were milling around in horrified fascination and watching a fifty foot ginger disentangling itself from the wreckage of a building .   victor heard a clicking beside him .  gaffer the handleman was intently capturing the scene on film .   the chair was shouting at dibbler .      of course we can   t use magic against it .  they need magic .  magic only makes them stronger .         you must be able to do something .     screamed dibbler .      my dear sir  we didn   t start meddling with things best left       the chair hesitated in mid snarl     unmeddled with     he finished lamely .      matches .     victor shouted .     matches .  hurry .      they all stared at him .   then the chair nodded .     ordinary fire     he said .     you   re right .  that should do it .  good thinking  boy .     he fumbled in a pocket and produced the bundle of matches that chain smoking wizards always carried .      you can   t burn the odium     snapped dibbler .     there   s heaps of film in there .      victor ripped a poster off the wall  wrapped it in a crude torch  and lit one end .      that   s what i   m going to burn     he said .          scuse me           stupid .  stupid .     shouted dibbler .     that stuff burns really fast .             scuse me        so what .  i wasn   t intending to hang around in there     said victor .      i mean really fast .            scuse me     said gaspode patiently .  they looked down at him .      me an    laddie could do it     he said .     four legs   re better    n two and so forth  y   know .  when it comes to savin    the day .      victor looked at dibbler and raised his eyebrows .        i suppose they might be able to     dibbler conceded .  victor nodded .  laddie leaped gracefully  snatched the torch out of his hand and ran back into the building with gaspode lurching after him .      did i hear things  or can that little dog speak .     said dibbler .      he says he can   t     said victor .   dibbler hesitated .  the excitement was unhinging him a little .     well     he said     i suppose he should know .          the dogs bounded toward the screen .  the victor thing was nearly through  half sprawled among the cans .      can i light the fire .     said gaspode .        smy job  really .      laddie barked obediently and dropped the blazing paper .  gaspode snapped it up and advanced cautiously toward the thing .      savin    the day     he said  indistinctly  and dropped the torch on a coil of film .  it flared instantly and burned with a sticky white fire  like slow magnesium .      ok     he said .     now  let   s get the hell out of        the thing screamed .  what semblance there still was of victor left it  and something like an explosion in an aquarium twisted among the flames .  a tentacle whipped out and grabbed gaspode by the leg .   he turned and tried to bite it .   laddie ricocheted back down the stricken hall and launched himself at the flailing arm .  it recoiled  knocking him over and spinning gaspode across the floor .   the little dog sat up  took a few wobbling steps  and fell over .      bloody leg   s been gone     he muttered .  laddie gave him a sorrowful look .  flames crackled around the film cans .      go on  get out of here  you stupid mutt     said gaspode .      the whole thing   s goin    to go up in a minute .  no .  don   t pick me up .  put me down .  you haven   t got time            the walls of the odium expanded with apparent slowness  every plank and stone maintaining its position relative to all the others but floating out by itself .   then time caught up with events .   victor threw himself flat on his face .   boom .   an orange fireball lifted the roof and billowed up into the foggy sky .  wreckage smashed against the walls of other houses .  a red hot film can scythed over the heads of the recumbent wizards  making a menacing wipwipwip noise  and exploded against a distant wall .   there was a high  thin keening that stopped abruptly .   the ginger thing rocked in the heat .  the gust of hot air lifted its huge skirts in billows around its waist and it stood  flickering and uncertain  as debris rained down around it .   then it turned awkwardly and lurched onward .   victor looked at ginger  who was staring at the thinning clouds of smoke over the pile of rubble that had been the odium .      that   s wrong     she was muttering .     it doesn   t happen like that .  it never happens like that .  just when you think it   s too late  they come galloping out of the smoke .     she turned dull eyes upon him .     don   t they .     she pleaded .      that   s in the clicks     said victor .     this is reality .         what   s the difference .      the chair grabbed victor   s shoulder and spun him around .      it   s heading for the library .     he repeated .     you   ve got to stop it .  if it gets there the magic   ll make it invincible .  we   ll never beat it .  it   ll be able to bring others .         you   re wizards     said ginger .     why don   t you stop it .      victor shook his head .     the things like our magic     he said .     if you use it anywhere around them  it only makes them stronger .  but i don   t see what i can do        his voice trailed off .  the crowd was watching him expectantly .     they weren   t looking at him as if he was their only hope .  they were looking at him is if he was their certainty .   he heard a small child say     what happens now  mum .      the fat woman holding it said  authoritatively     it   s easy .  he rushes up and stops it just at the last minute .  happens every time .  seen him do it before .         i   ve never done it before .     said victor .      saw you do it     said the woman smugly .     in sons of the dessert .  when this lady here     she gave a brief curtsey in the direction of ginger     was on that horse what threw her over the cliff  and you galloped up and grabbed her at the last minute .  very impressive  i thought .         that wasn   t sons of the dessert     said an elderly man pedantically  while he filled his pipe     that was valley of the trolls .         it was sons     said a thin woman behind him .     i should know  i watched it twenty seven times .         yes  it was very good  wasn   t it     said the first woman .      every time i see a scene where she leaves him and he turns to her and gives her that look  i burst into tears           excuse me  but that wasn   t sons of the dessert     said the man  speaking slowly and deliberately .     you   re thinking of the famous plaza scene in burninge passiones .      the fat woman took ginger   s unresisting hand and patted it .      you   ve got a good man there     she said .     the way he always rescues you every time .  if i was being dragged off by mad trolls my ole man wouldn   t say a word except to ask where i wanted my clothes sent .         my husband wouldn   t get out of his chair if i was being et by dragons     said the thin woman .  she gave ginger a gentle prod .     but you want to wear more clothes  miss .  next time you   re taken off to be rescued  you insist they let you take a warm coat .  i never see you on the screen without thinking to myself  she   s temptin    a dose of    flu  going around like that .           where   s    is sword .     said the child  kicking its mother on the shin .      i expect he   ll be off to fetch it directly     she said  giving victor an encouraging smile .      er .  yes     he said .     come on  ginger .     he grabbed her hand .      give the lad room     shouted the pipe smoker authoritatively .   a space cleared around them .  ginger and victor saw a thousand expectant faces watching them .      they think we   re real     moaned ginger .     no one   s doing anything because they think you   re a hero  for gods    sake .  and we can   t do anything .  this thing is bigger than both of us .      victor stared down at the damp cobblestones .  i can probably remember some magic  he thought  but ordinary magic   s no good against the dungeon dimensions .  and i   m pretty sure real heroes don   t hang around in the middle of cheering crowds .  they get on with the job .  real heroes are like poor old gaspode .  no one ever notices them until afterward .  that   s the reality .   he raised his head slowly .   or is this the reality .   the air crackled .  there was another kind of magic .  it was snapping wildly in the world now  like a broken film .  if only he could grab it     reality didn   t have to be real .  maybe if conditions were right  it just had to be what people believed        stand back     he whispered .      what   re you going to do .     said ginger .      try some holy wood kind of magic .         there   s nothing magic about holy wood .         i   think there is .  a different sort .  we   ve felt it .  magic   s where you find it .      he took a few deep breaths  and let his mind unravel slowly .  that was the secret .  you did it  you just didn   t think about it .  you just let the instructions come from outside .  it was just a job .  you just felt the eye of the picture box on you  and it was a different world  a world that was just a flickering silver square .   that was the secret .  the flicker .   ordinary magic just moved things around .  it couldn   t create a real thing that   d last for more than a second  because that took a lot of power .   but holy wood easily created things over and over again  dozens of times a second .  they didn   t have to last for long .  they just had to last for long enough .   but you had to work holy wood magic by holy wood   s rules     he extended a rock steady hand toward the dark sky .      lights .      there was a sheet of lightning that illuminated the whole city        picture box .      gaffer spun the handle furiously .      action .      no one saw where the horse came from .  it was just there  leaping over the heads of the crowd .  it was white  with lots of impressive silver work on the bridle .  victor swung up into the saddle as it cantered past  then made it rear impressively so that it pawed the air .  he drew a sword which hadn   t been there a moment before .   the sword and the horse flickered almost imperceptibly .   victor smiled .  light glinted off a tooth .  ting .  a glint  but no sound  they hadn   t invented sound  yet .   believe it .  that was the way .  never stop believing .  fool the eye  fool the brain .   then he galloped between the cheering lines of spectators toward the university and the big scene .   the handleman relaxed .  ginger tapped him on the shoulder .        if you stop turning that handle     she said sweetly     i   ll break your bloody neck .         but he   s nearly out of shot        ginger propelled him toward windle poons    ancient wheelchair and gave windle a smile that made little clouds of wax boil out of his ears .      excuse me     she said  in a sultry voice that caused all the wizards to curl their toes up in their pointy shoes     but could we borrow you for a minute .         way hey .  draw it mild .             whumm   whumm     ponder stibbons knew about the vase  of course .  all the students had wandered along to have a look at it .   he didn   t pay it much attention as he sneaked along the corridor  attempting once again to make a bid for an evening   s freedom .      whummwhummwhummwhummwhummmmwhumm .   all he had to do was cut across through the cloisters and     plib .   all eight pottery elephants shot pellets at once .  the resograph exploded  turning the roof into something like a pepper shaker .   after a minute or two ponder got up  very carefully .  his hat was simply a collection of holes held together by thread .  a piece had been taken out of one of his ears .      i only wanted a drink     he said  muzzily .     what   s wrong with that .          the librarian crouched on the dome of the library  watching the crowds scurrying through the streets as the monstrous figure lurched nearer .   he was slightly surprised to see it followed by some sort of spectral horse whose hooves made no sound on the cobbles .   and that was followed by a three wheeled bathchair that took the corner on only two of them  sparks streaming away behind it .  it was loaded down with wizards  all shouting at the tops of their voices .  occasionally one of them would lose his grip and have to run behind until he could get up enough speed to leap on again .   three of them hadn   t made it .  that is  one of them had made it sufficiently to get a grip on the trailing leather cover  and the other two had made it just enough to grab the robe of the one in front  so that now  every time it took a bend  a tail of three wizards going    whaaaaa    snapped wildly across the road behind it .   there were also a number of civilians  but if anything they were shouting louder than the wizards .   the librarian had seen many weird things in his time  but that was undoubtedly the   th strangest .      up here he could very clearly hear the voices .         got to keep it turning .  he can only make it work if you keep it turning .  it   s holy wood magic .  he   s making it work in the real world .     that was a girl   s voice .      all right  but the imps get very fractious if       that was a man   s voice under extreme pressure .      bugger the imps .         how can he make a horse .     that was the dean .  the librarian recognized the whine .     that   s high grade magic .         it   s not a real horse  it   s a moving picture horse .     the girl again .     you .  you   re slowing down .         i   m not .  i   m not .  look  i   m turning the handle  i   m turning the handle .         he can   t ride on a horse that isn   t real .         you   re a magician and you really believe that .           wizard  actually .         well  whatever .  this isn   t your kind of magic .      the librarian nodded  and then stopped listening .  he had other things to do .   the thing was almost level with the tower of art  and would soon turn to head for the library .  things always homed in on the nearest source of magic .  they needed it .   the librarian had found a long iron pike in one of the university   s moldering storerooms .  he held it carefully in one foot while he unfastened the rope he   d tied to the weathercock .  it stretched all the way up to the top of the tower  it had taken him all night to fix it up .   he surveyed the city below  and then pounded his chest and roared      aaaaaaaaaaaaa   hngh  hngh .      maybe the pounding wasn   t entirely necessary  he thought  while he waited for the buzzing noises and little flashing lights to go away .   he gripped the pike in one hand  the rope in the other  and leapt .   the most graphic way of describing the librarian   s swing across the buildings of unseen university is to simply transcribe the noises made during the flight .   first     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .     this is self explanatory  and refers to the early part of the swing  when everything looked as if it was going well .   then     aaarghhhh .     this was the noise made as he missed the lurching thing by several meters and was realizing that  if you have tied a rope to the top of a very high and extremely solid stone tower and are now swinging toward it  failing to hit something on the way is an error which you will regret for the rest of your truncated life .   the rope completed its swing .  there was a noise exactly like a rubber sack full of butter hitting a stone slab and this was followed  after a moment or two  by a very quiet    oook    .   the pike clanged away in the darkness .  the librarian spread eagled himself starfish like against the wall  ramming fingers and toes into every available crevice .   he might have been able to climb his way down but the option never became available  because the thing reached out a flickering hand and plucked him off the wall with a noise like a sink plunger clearing a difficult blockage .   it held him up to what was currently its face .       the crowds flowed into the square in front of unseen university  with the dibblers to the fore .      look at them     cut me own throat sighed .     there must be thousands of them  and no one   s selling    em anything .      the wheelchair slid to a halt in another spray of sparks .   victor was waiting for it  the spectral horse flickering under him .  not one horse  but a succession of horses .  not moving  but changing from frame to frame .   lightning flashed again .      what   s he doing .     said the chair .      trying to keep it from getting to the library     said the dean  peering through the rain that was beginning to thud on the cobbles .     to stay alive in reality  things need magic to hold themselves together .  they   ve got no natural morphogenic field  you see  and           do something .  blow it up with magic .     shouted ginger .      oh  that poor monkey .         we can   t use magic .  that   s like pouring oil on a fire .     snapped the dean .     besides   i don   t know how you go about blowing up a fifty foot woman .  it   s not the sort of thing i   ve ever been called upon to do .         it   s not a woman .  it   s   it   s a film creature  you idiot .  do you think i   m really that big .     shouted ginger .     it   s using holy wood .  it   s a holy wood monster .  from film land .             steer  godsdamnit .  steer .         i don   t know how to .         you just have to throw your weight about .        the bursar gripped the broomstick nervously .  it   s all very well for you to say  he thought .  you   re used to it .   they had been stepping out of the great hall when a giant woman had lurched past the gate with a gibbering ape in one hand .  now the bursar was trying to control an antique broom out of the university museum while a madman behind him feverishly tried to load a crossbow .   airborne  the archchancellor had said .  it was absolutely essential that they were airborne .      can   t you keep it steady .     the archchancellor demanded .      it   s not made for two  archchancellor .         can   t damn well aim with you weavin    around the sky like this  man .      the contagious spirit of holy wood  whipping across the city like a steel hawser with one end suddenly cut free  sliced once again through the archchancellor   s mind .      we don   t leave our people in there     he muttered .      apes  archchancellor     said the bursar automatically .       the thing lurched toward victor .  it moved uneasily  fighting against the forces of reality that tugged at it .  it flickered as it tried to maintain the shape it had climbed into the world with  so that images of ginger alternated with glimpses of something that writhed and coiled .   it needed magic .   it eyed victor and the sword  and if it was capable of something so sophisticated as knowledge  it knew that it was vulnerable .   it turned  and bore down on ginger and the wizards .   who burst into flame .       the dean burned with a particularly pretty blue color .      don   t worry  young lady     said the chair from the heart of his fire .     it   s illusion .  it   s not real .         you   re telling me .     said ginger .     get on with it .        the wizards moved forward .   ginger heard footsteps behind her .  it was the dibblers .      why   s it frightened of the flame .     said soll  and the thing backed away from the advancing wizards .     it   s just illusion .  it must be able to feel there   s no heat .      ginger shook her head .  she looked like someone surfing on a curling wave of hysteria  perhaps because it is not every day you see giant images of yourself trampling down a city .      it   s used holy wood magic     she said .     so it can   t disobey holy wood rules .  it can   t feel  it can   t hear .  it can only see .  what it sees is what is real .  and what film fears is fire .      now the giant ginger was pressed against the tower .      well  it   s trapped     said dibbler .     they   ve got it now .      the thing blinked at the advancing flames .   it turned .  it reached up with its free hand .  it began to climb the tower .       victor slid off his horse and stopped concentrating .  it vanished .   despite his panic  he found room for a tiny gloat .  if only wizards had gone to the clicks  they   d have known exactly how to do it .   it was the critical fusion frequency .  even reality had one .  if you could only make something exist for a tiny part of a second  that didn   t mean you   d failed .  it meant you had to keep on doing it .   he scurried crabwise along the base of the tower  staring up at the climbing thing  and tripped over something metallic .  it turned out to be the librarian   s dropped pike .  a little further off  the end of the rope trailed in a puddle .   he stared at them for a moment  then used the pike to chop a few feet off the rope to make a crude shoulder strap for the weapon .   he grabbed the rope and gave it an experimental tug  and then       there was an unpleasant lack of resistance to the pull .  he threw himself backward just before hundreds of feet of sodden rope smacked damply onto the paving .   he looked around desperately for another route to the top .       the dibblers watched open mouthed as the thing climbed .  it wasn   t moving very fast  and occasionally had to wedge the gibbering librarian into a handy buttress while it found the next handhold  but it was moving up .      oh  yes .  yes .  yes     breathed soll .     what a picture .  pure kinema .         a giant woman carrying a screaming ape up a tall building     sighed dibbler .     and we   re not even having to pay wages .         yeah     said soll .      yeah       said dibbler .  there was a tiny note of uncertainty in his voice .   soll looked wistful .      yeah     he repeated .     er .         i know what you mean     said dibbler slowly .      it   s   i mean  it   s really great  but   well  i can   t help feeling           yeah .  there   s something wrong     said dibbler flatly .      not wrong     said soll desperately .     not exactly wrong .  not wrong as such .  just missing       he stopped  at a loss for words .   he sighed .  and dibbler sighed .   overhead  the thunder rolled .   and out of the sky came a broomstick with two screaming wizards on it .       victor pushed open the door at the base of the tower of art .   it was dark inside  and he could hear water dripping down from the distant roof .   the tower was said to be the oldest building in the world .  it certainly felt like it .  it wasn   t used for anything now  and the internal floors had long ago rotted away  so that all that was left inside was the staircase .   it was a spiral  made of huge slabs set into the wall itself .  some of them were missing .  it   d be a dangerous climb  even in daylight .   in the dark   not a chance .   the door slammed open behind him and ginger strode in  dragging the handleman behind her .      well .     she said .     hurry up .  you   ve got to save that poor monkey .         ape     said victor absently .      whatever .         it   s too dark     victor muttered .      it   s never too dark in the clicks     said ginger flatly .      think about it .      she nudged the handleman  who said  very quickly     she   s right .     s never dark in the clicks .  stands to reason .  you   ve got to have enough light to see the dark by .      victor glanced up at the gloom  and then back at ginger .      listen .     he said urgently .     if i   if something goes wrong  tell the wizards about the   you know .  the pit .  the things will be trying to break through there  too .         i   m not going back there .      there was a roll of thunder .      get going .     shouted ginger  white faced .     lights .  picture box .  action .  and stuff like that .      victor gritted his teeth and ran for it .  there was enough light to give the darkness a shape  and he leapt from stair to stair with the magic of holy wood reciting its litany in his head .      there has to be enough light     he panted     to see the darkness .      he staggered onward .      and in holy wood i never run out of strength     he added  hoping his legs would believe him .   that took care of the next turn .        and in holy wood i have to be in the nick of time     he shouted .  he leaned against the wall for a moment and fought for breath .      always in the nick of time     he muttered .   he started to run upward again .   the slabs passed under his feet like a dream  like squares of movie clicking through the picture box .   and he   d arrive in the nick of time .  thousands of people knew he would .   if heroes didn   t arrive in the nick of time  where was the sense in anything .  and     there was no slab in front of his falling foot .   his other foot was already arching to leave the step .   he focused every ounce of energy into one tendontwanging push  felt his toes hit the edge of the next slab up  flung himself forward and then jumped again because it was that or snap a leg .      this is nuts .      he ran onward  straining to look for more missing slabs .      always in the nick of time     he muttered .   so maybe he could stop and have a rest .  he could still make it in the nick of time .  that   s what the nick of time meant     no .  you had to play fair .   there was another missing slab ahead .   he stared blankly at the space .   there was going to be a whole tower of this .   he concentrated briefly and jumped onto nothing .  the nothing became a slab for the fraction of a second he needed to jump off onto the next one .   he grinned in the dark  and a sparkle of light twinkled on a tooth .   nothing created by holy wood magic was real for long .   but you could make it real for long enough .   hooray for holy wood .       the thing was flickering more slowly now  spending less time looking like a giant version of ginger and more looking like the contents of a taxidermist   s sink trap .  it pulled its dripping bulk over the top of the tower and lay there .  air whistled through its breathing tubes .  under its tentacles the rock crumbled  as the magic drained away and was replaced by the hungry appetite of time .   it was bewildered .  where were the others .  it was alone and besieged in a strange place        and now it was angry .  it extended an eye and glared at the ape struggling in what had been a hand .  thunder rocked the tower .  rain cascaded off the stones .   the thing extended a pseudopod and wrapped it around the librarian   s waist        and became aware of another figure  ridiculously small  erupting from the stairwell .       victor unslung the pike from his back .  what did you do now .  when you were dealing with humans you had options .  you could say    hey  put down that ape and come on out with your feelers up .     you could     a claw tipped tentacle as thick as his arm slammed down on the stones  cracking them .   he leapt backward and brought the pike around in a backhanded swipe that drew a deep yellow slash in the thing   s hide .  it howled and shuffled around with unpleasant speed to flail more tentacles at him .   shape  thought victor .  they   ve got no real shape in this world .  it has to spend too much time holding itself together .  the more it has to concentrate on me  the less it can concentrate on not falling to bits .   an assortment of mismatched eyes extended from various bits of the thing .   as they focused on victor they crinkled with angry bloodshot veins .     ok  he thought .  i   ve got its attention .  now what .   he stabbed at a snapping claw and jumped with his knees up under his chin when a mercifully unidentifiable pseudopod tried to chop his legs from under him .   another tentacle snaked out .   an arrow passed through it with the same effect as a steel pellet shooting through a sock filled with custard .  the thing screeched .   the broomstick barrelled over the top of the tower  with the archchancellor feverishly reloading .   victor heard a distant     if it bleeds  we can kill it .     followed by    what do you mean  we .      victor pressed forward  hacking at anything that looked vulnerable .  the creature changed form  trying to thicken its hide or grow a carapace wherever the pike fell  but it wasn   t fast enough .  they   re right .  it can be killed  victor thought .  it may take all day  but it   s not invincible     and then there was ginger in front of him  her expression filled with pain and shock .   he hesitated .   an arrow thudded into what might have been its body .      tally ho .  take us round again  bursar .      the image dissolved .  the thing screeched  threw the librarian aside like a doll  and lurched at victor with all tentacles at full stretch .  one of them knocked him over  three others dragged the pike from his hands  and then the thing was rearing up  like a leech  raising the iron pike to knock its tormentors out of the sky .   victor raised himself up on his elbows and concentrated .   just real for long enough .   the lightning bolt outlined the thing in blue and white light .  after the thunderclap the creature swayed drunkenly  with little tendrils of electricity coruscating across it and making whizzing noises .  a few limbs were smoking .   it was trying to hold itself together against the forces roaring around inside its body .  it skewed wildly across the stone  making odd little mewling noises  and then  with one good eye glaring balefully at victor  stepped off into space .   victor pushed himself up on his hands and knees and dragged himself to the edge .   even on the way down the thing wasn   t giving up .  it was trying frantic evolutions of feather and hide and membranes in an attempt to find something that would survive the fall     time slowed .  the air took on a purple haze .  death swung his scythe .   you belong dead  he said .      and then there was a sound like wet laundry hitting a wall and  it turned out  the only thing that could survive the fall was a corpse .       the crowd moved closer in the pouring rain .   now that all the control was gone the thing was dissolving into its component molecules  that were washing into the gutters and down to the river and out into the cold depths of the sea .      it   s deliquescing     said the lecturer in recent runes .      is it .     said the chair .     i thought that it was some kind of shop .      he prodded it with his foot .      careful     said the dean .     that is not dead which can eternal lie .      the chair studied it .      it looks bloody dead to me     he said .     hang on   there   s something moving        one of the outflung tentacles slumped aside .      did it land on someone .     said the dean .   it did .  they pulled out the twitching body of ponder stibbons  and prodded and patted him in a well meant way until he opened his eyes .        what happened .     he said .      a fifty foot monster fell on you     said the dean  simply .      are you  er  all right .         i only wanted one drink     ponder muttered .     i   d have come straight back  honest .         what are you talking about  lad .      ponder ignored him .  he got up  swaying a bit  and staggered off toward the great hall  and never  ever  went out again .      funny chap     said the chair .  they looked back down at the thing  which had nearly dissolved .         twas beauty killed the beast     said the dean  who liked to say things like that .      no it wasn   t     said the chair .     it was it splatting into the ground like that .          the librarian sat up and rubbed his head .   the book was thrust in front of his eyes .      read it .     said victor .      oook .         please .      the ape opened it at a page of pictograms .  he blinked at them for a moment .  then his finger went to the bottom right hand corner of the page and began to trace the signs from right to left .   right to left .   that was how you were supposed to read them  victor thought .   which meant that he   d been exactly wrong all the time .       gaffer the handleman panned his picture box along the row of wizards and then down to the rapidly dissolving monster .   the handle stopped turning .  he raised his head and gave everyone a bright smile .      if you could just bunch up tighter  gentlemen .     he said .  the wizards obediently shuffled even closer .     the light   s not very good .      soll wrote down     wizards loking at the corepse  take       on a piece of card .      shame you didn   t get the fall     he said  the edges of his voice deckled with hysteria .     maybe we can stunt it up or something .      ginger sat in the shadows by the tower  hugging her knees and trying to stop trembling .  among the shapes the thing had tried just before the end had been her own .   she pulled herself upright and  holding onto the rough stonework to steady herself  walked uncertainly away .  she wasn   t certain what the future held  but coffee would be involved if she had any say in the matter .   as she passed the tower door there was a clattering of feet and victor staggered out  with the librarian swinging along behind him .   he opened his mouth to speak  and started to gasp for air .  the orangutan pushed him aside and grabbed ginger firmly by the arm .  it was a warm  soft grip  but with just a hint that  if he really ever needed to  the librarian could easily turn any arm into a tube of jelly with bits in it .      oook .         look  it   s over     said ginger .     the monster   s dead .  that   s how things end  ok .  and now i   m going to get something to drink .         oook .         oook yourself .      victor raised his head .      it   s   not over     he said .      it is for me .  i just saw myself turn into a   a thing with tentacles .  a thing like that has a bit of an effect on a girl  you know .         it   s not important .     victor managed .     we got it wrong .  look  they   ll keep on coming now .  you   ve got to come back to holy wood .  they   ll be coming through there  too .           oook .     the librarian agreed  jabbing the book with a purple fingernail .      well  they can do it without me     said ginger .      no  they can   t .  i mean  they will anyway .  but you can stop them .  oh  stop looking at me like that .     he nudged the librarian .     go on  tell her     he said .      oook     said the librarian  patiently .     oook .         i can   t understand him .     wailed ginger .   victor   s brow wrinkled .     you can   t .         it   s all just monkey noises to me .      victor   s eyes swiveled sideways .     er        the librarian stood like a small prehistoric statue for a moment .  then he took ginger   s hand  very gently  and patted it .      oook     he said  graciously .      sorry     said ginger .      listen .     said victor .     i got it wrong .  you weren   t trying to help them  you were trying to stop them .  i read it the wrong way round .  it   s not a man behind a gate  it   s a man in front of a gate .  and a man in front of a gate     he took a deep breath     is a guard .         yes  but we can   t get to holy wood .  it   s miles away .      victor shrugged .     go and get the handleman     he said .       the land around ankh morpork is fertile and largely given over to the cabbage fields that help to give the city its distinctive odor .   the gray light of pre dawn unrolled over the blue green expanse  and around a couple of farmers who were making an early start on the spinach harvest .   they looked up  not at a sound  but at a traveling point of silence where sound ought to have been .   it was a man and a woman and something like a size five man in a size twelve fur coat  all in a chariot that flickered as it moved .  it bowled along the road toward holy wood and was soon out of sight .     a minute or two later it was followed by a wheelchair .  its axle glowed red hot .  it was full of people screaming at one another .  one of them was turning a handle on a box .   it was so overburdened that wizards occasionally fell off and ran along after it  shouting  until they had a chance to jump on again and start screaming .   whoever was attempting to steer was not succeeding  and it weaved back and forth across the road and eventually hurtled off it completely and through the side of a barn .   one of the farmers nudged the other .      oi   ve seen this on the clicks     he said .     it   s always the same .  they crash into a barn and they allus comes out the other side covered in squawking chickens .      his companion leaned reflectively on his hoe .      it   d be a sight worth seeing that     he said .      sure would .            cos all there is in there  boy  is twenty ton of cabbage .      there was a crash  and the chair erupted from the barn in a shower of chickens and headed madly toward the road .   the farmers looked at one another .      well  dang me     said one of them .       holy wood was a glow on the horizon .  the earth tremors were stronger now .   the flickering chariot came out of a stand of trees and paused at the top of the incline that led down to the town .   mist wreathed holy wood .  from out of it spears of light criss crossed the sky .      we   re too late .     said ginger hopefully .      almost too late     said victor .      oook     said the librarian .  his fingernail raced back and forth as he read the ancient pictograms   right to left  right to left .      i knew there was something not right     victor had said .      that sleeping statue   the guard .  the old priests sang songs and did ceremonies to keep him awake .  they remembered holy wood as best they could .         but i don   t know anything about a guard .         yes  you do .  like  deep down inside .         oook     said the librarian  tapping a page .     oook .         he says you   re probably descended from the original high priestess .  he thinks everyone in holy wood is descended from   you see   i mean  the first time the things broke through the entire city was destroyed and the survivors fled everywhere  you see  but everyone had this way of remembering even things that happened to their ancestors  i mean  it   s like there   s this great big pool of memory and we   re linked up to it and when it all started happening again we were all called to the place  and you tried to put it right  only it was weak so it couldn   t get through to you unless you were asleep        he trailed off helplessly .         oook    .     said ginger suspiciously .     you got all this from    oook    .         well  not just one     victor admitted .      i   ve never heard such a lot of       ginger began  and stopped .  a hand softer than the softest leather was pushed into hers .  she looked around into a face that compared badly to a deflated football .      oook     said the librarian .   ginger locked eyes with him for a moment .   then she said     but i   ve never felt the least bit like a high priestess           that dream you told me about     said victor .     it sounded pretty high priestessy to me .  very   very           oook .         sacerdotal .  yeah     victor translated .      it   s just a dream     said ginger nervously .     i   ve dreamed it occasionally as far back as i can remember .         oook  oook .           what   d he say .     said ginger .      he says that   s probably a lot further back than you think .      ahead of them holy wood glittered like frost  like a city made of congealed starlight .      victor .     said ginger .      yes .         where is everybody .      victor looked down the road .  where there should have been people  refugees  desperately fleeing   was nothing .   just silence  and the light .      where are they .     she repeated .   he looked at her expression .      but the tunnel fell down .     he said  saying it loudly in the hope that this would make it true .     it was all sealed off .         it wouldn   t take trolls long to clear a way through  though     said ginger .   victor thought about the   the cthinema .  and the first house  which had been going on for thousands of years .  and all the people he knew  sitting there  for another thousand years .  while overhead the stars changed .      of course  they might just be   well   somewhere else     he lied .      but they   re not     said ginger .     we both know that .      victor stared helplessly at the city of lights .      why us .     he said .     why is it happening to us .         everything has to happen to someone     said ginger .   victor shrugged .     and you only get one chance     he said .      right .         just when you need to save the world  there   s a world for you to save     said ginger .      yeah     said victor .     lucky old us .          the two farmers peered in through the barn doors .  stacks of cabbage waited stolidly in the gloom .        told you it were cabbage     said one of them .     knew it weren   t chickens .  oi knows a cabbage when i sees one  and oi believes what i sees .      from far above came voices  getting closer      for gods    sake  man  can   t you steer .         not with you throwing your weight about  archchancellor .         where the hell are we .  can   t see a thing in this fog .         i   ll just see if i can point it   don   t lean over like that .  don   t lean over like that .  i said don   t lean    .      the farmers dived sideways as the broomstick corkscrewed through the open doorway and disappeared among the ranks of cabbage .  there was a distant  brassica   d squelch .   eventually a muffled voice said     you leaned .         nonsense .  a fine mess you got me into .  what is it .         cabbages  archchancellor .         some kind of vegetable .         yes .         can   t stand vegetables .  thins the blood .      there was a pause .  then the farmers heard the other voice say     well  i   m very sorry about that  you bloodthirsty overbearing tub of lard .      there was another pause .   then     can i sack you  bursar .         no  archchancellor .  i   ve got tenure .         in that case  help me out and let   s go and find a drink .      the farmers crept away .      dang me     said the believer in cabbages .     they   re wizards .  best not to meddle in the affairs of danged wizards .         yeah     said the other farmer .     er   what does dang mean .  exactly .          it was the time of the silence .   nothing moved in holy wood except the light .  it flickered slowly .  holy wood light  victor thought .     there was a feeling of dreadful expectation .  if a movie set was a dream waiting to be made real  then the town was one step further up the scale   a real place waiting for something new  something that ordinary language couldn   t define .           he said  and stopped .       .     said ginger .       .          .      they stared at one another for a moment .  then victor grabbed her hand and dragged her into the nearest building  which turned out to be the commissary .   the scene inside was indescribable and remained so until victor found the blackboard that was used for what was laughingly referred to as the menu .   he picked up the chalk .      i   m talking but i cant here me     he wrote  and solemnly handed her the chalk .      me to .  y .      victor tossed the chalk up and down thoughtfully  and then wrote     i think bcos we never invented sound movies .  if we didn   t have imps that could paint in color maybe there would just be blak and white here too .      they stared at the scene around them .  there were untouched or half eaten meals on almost every table .  this wasn   t particularly unusual at borgle   s  but normally they were accompanied by people complaining bitterly .   ginger delicately dipped a finger in the nearest plate .      still warm     she mouthed .      let   s go     said victor quietly  pointing at the door .   she tried to say something complicated  scowled at his blank expression  and wrote     we shoud wait for the wizards .      victor stood frozen for a moment .  then his lips shaped a phrase that ginger would not admit to knowing and he made a dash for the outside .   the overloaded chair was already bowling along the street with smoke billowing from its axles .  he jumped up and down in front of it  waving his arms .   a long silent conversation went on .  there was a lot of chalking on the nearest wall .  finally ginger couldn   t contain her impatience any longer and hurried over .      youve got to stay away .  if they brake thru you wil be a meal .         so will you .     this was neater handwriting  it was the dean   s .   victor wrote     xcept i think i know what   s hapnen .  anyway  you will be needed if it goes wrong .      he nodded at the dean and hurried back to ginger and the librarian .  he gave the ape a worried look .  technically the librarian was a wizard   at least  when he   d been human he was a wizard  so presumably he still was .  on the other hand  he was also an ape  and a handy man to have around in an emergency .  he decided to risk it .      come on     he mouthed .   it was easy enough to find the way to the hill .  where there had been a path there was now a broad trail  poignantly scattered with the debris of hurried passage .  a sandal .  a discarded picture box .  a trailing red feather boa .   the door into the hill had been torn off its hinges .  a dull glow came from the tunnel .  victor shrugged and marched inside .   the debris hadn   t been cleared right away  but it had been pushed aside and flattened down to allow the crowd to go through .  the ceiling hadn   t fallen in .  this wasn   t because of the debris .  it was because of detritus .   he was holding it up .   nearly up .  he was already down on one knee .   victor and the librarian stacked boulders around the troll until he could let the weight off his shoulders .  he groaned  or at least looked as if he   d groaned  and toppled forward .  ginger helped him up .      what happened .     she mouthed at him .         .  .     detritus looked puzzled at the absence of his voice and tried to squint at his mouth .   victor sighed .  he had a vision of the holy wood people stampeding blindly along the passage  the trolls scrabbling at the blockage .  since detritus was the toughest  naturally he   d play a major part .  and since the only function he normally used his brain for was to stop the top of his head falling in  equally naturally he   d be the one left holding up the weight on the hill .  victor imagined him calling out  unheard  as the rest of them hurried by .   he wondered whether to write him a cheery message  but in detritus    case this was almost certainly a waste of time .  anyway  the troll wasn   t about to hang around .  he loped off along the tunnel with a grim look on his face  concentrating fiercely on some private errand of his own .  his trailing knuckles left two furrows in the dust .   the passage opened out into the cavern which was  victor now realized  a sort of ante chamber to the pit itself .  maybe thousands of years ago supplicants had flocked out here to buy   what .  consecrated sausages  maybe  and the holy banged grains .   spectral light filled it now .  it was still full of damp and ancient mold wherever victor looked .  yet wherever he didn   t look  at the edges of his vision  he kept getting the feeling that the place was decorated like a palace with red plush draperies and baroque gold decorations .  he kept turning his head sharply  trying to trap the ghostly  glittering image .   he met the librarian   s worried frown  and chalked on the cave wall      realities merging .      the librarian nodded .   victor winced  and led his little group of holy wood guerrillas   at least  two guerrillas and one orangutan   up the worn steps into the pit .   victor realized later that it was detritus who saved them all .     they took one look at the swirling images on the obscene screen and     dream .  reality .  believe .   await        and detritus tried to walk through them .  images designed to trap and throw a glamor over any sapient mind bounced off the back of his rocky skull and came right out again .  he paid them no attention at all .  he had other fish to fry .      being trampled almost to death by a preoccupied troll is almost the ideal cure for a person confused about what is real and what isn   t .  reality is something walking heavily up your spine .   victor hauled himself back onto his feet  pulled the others toward him  pointed to the flickering  bulging oblong at the other end of the hall  and mouthed    don   t look .      they nodded .   ginger gripped his arm tightly as they inched their way down from the aisle .   all of holy wood was there .  they saw faces they knew ranged along the seats  immobile in the shivering light  every expression nailed in place .   he felt her nails dig into his skin .  there was rock  and morry  and fruntkin from the commissary  and mrs .  cosmopilite the wardrobe lady .  there was silverfish  and a row of other alchemists .  there were the carpenters  and the handlemen  and all the stars that never were  all the people who had held horses or cleaned tables or stood in queues and waited and waited for their big chance     lobsters  thought victor .  there was a great city and lots of people died and now it   s the home of lobsters .   the librarian pointed .   detritus had found ruby in the very front row  and was trying to pull her out of her seat .  whichever way he moved her  her eyes swiveled toward the dancing images .  when he stood in front of her she blinked for a moment  scowled  and knocked him aside .   then her expression slid back to vacuity and she settled into her seat .   victor laid a hand on his shoulder and made what he hoped would be soothing  beckoning motions .  detritus    face was a fresco of misery .   the suit of armor was still on the slab behind the screen  in front of the tarnished disc .   they stared at it  hopelessly .   victor tentatively drew his finger through the dust .  it left a streak of shiny yellow metal .  he looked at ginger .      what now .     he mouthed .   she shrugged .  it meant   how should i know .  i was asleep  before .   the screen above them was bulging very fatly now .  how long before the things came through .   victor tried shaking the   well  call it a man .  a very tall man .  in seamless golden armor .  might as well try to shake awake a mountain .   he reached over and tried to free the sword  although it was longer than he was and  even if he could lift it  would be as maneuverable as a barge .   it was gripped fast .   the librarian was trying to read the book by the light of the screen  feverishly thumbing through the pages .   victor chalked on the side of the slab     can   t you think of anythin at al .      ginger took the chalk     no .  you woke me up .  .  i don   t no how to do it .  .  .  whatever it is .  .  .  .      the fourth exclamation mark only failed to be completed because the chalk snapped .  there was a distant    ping    as part of it hit something .   victor took the other half out of her hand .        maybe you shoud hav a look at the book     he suggested .   the librarian nodded and tried to put the book in her hands .  she waved him off for a moment  and stood staring into the shadows .   she took the book .   she looked from the ape to the troll to the man .   then she pulled her arm back and hurled the book away from her .   this time it wasn   t a ping .  it was a definite  low and very resonant    booong .     something could make a noise in the place with no sound .   victor skidded around the slab .   the big disc was a gong .  he tapped it .  bits of corrosion fell off  but the metal shivered under the light blow and gave out another tinny rumble under his touch .  below it  now that his eyes were instinctively seeking it out  was a six foot metal pole with a padded ball at one end .   he grabbed it and heaved it off its supports .  or tried to  at least .  it was rusted solidly in place .   the librarian positioned himself at the other end  caught victor   s eye  and this time they hauled on it together .  flakes of rust dug into victor   s hands .   it was immovable .  the gong hammer and its supports had been turned by time and salt air into one single metallic whole .   then time seemed to slow and became a series of frozen events in the flickering light  like moving pictures sliding through the box .   click .   detritus reached down over victor   s head  grasped the hammer by its middle  and lifted it up  tearing the rusted supports out of the very rock .   click .   they threw themselves flat as he gripped it in both hands  flexed his muscles  and took a swing at the gong .     click .   click .   click .   click .   caught in a series of tableaux  detritus appeared to move instantly into   click   different but connected positions as he pivoted on one horny foot  the hammer head   click   making a bright arc in the darkness .   click .   the impact knocked the gong so far backward that the chains broke  and it slammed against the wall of the pit .   sound came back quickly and in vast quantities  as though it had been dammed up somewhere and had then suddenly been released  to slosh joyfully back into the world and drown every eardrum .   booong .   click .       the giant figure on the slab sat upright slowly  dust cascading off it in slow streams .  underneath it was gold  untarnished by the years .   it moved slowly but deliberately  as though propelled by clockwork .  one hand grasped the giant sword .  the other gripped the edge of the slab to steady the figure as its long  tapering legs swung down to the ground .   it stood upright  ten feet tall  rested its hands on the hilt of the sword  and halted .  it didn   t look very much different from its posture on the slab  but this time there was an air of alertness about it  a sense of huge energies idly ticking over .  it paid no attention at all to the four who had awoken it .   the screen stopped its wild pulsating .  something had sensed the presence of the golden man and was focusing its attention on him .  which meant that it was temporarily removing it from elsewhere .   there was a stirring from the audience .  they were waking up .     victor grabbed the librarian and detritus .      you two     he said .     get everyone out of here .  get them out of here fast .         oook .      the holy wood people didn   t need much encouragement .  seeing the shapes on the screen clearly  without the cushion of hypnosis  was enough to make anything brainier than detritus have a sudden urge to be a long way away .  victor could see them struggling over the seats  fighting to escape from the pit .   ginger started to follow them .  victor stopped her .      not yet     he said  quietly .     not us .         what do you mean .     she demanded .   he shook his head .     we have to be the last ones out     he said .     it   s all part of holy wood .  you can use the magic  but it uses you  too .  besides  don   t you want to see how it all ends .         i had rather hoped to see how it all ends from a long way off .         ok  look at it another way   it   s going to take a couple of minutes for them to get out .  we might as well have a clear run at it  eh .      they could hear shouts in the ante chamber as the former audience piled into the tunnel .   victor walked up the suddenly deserted aisle to the back row and sat down in a vacated seat .      i hope old detritus is bright enough not to be left holding up the ceiling again     he said .   ginger sighed  and sat down next to him .   victor put his feet up on the seat in front of him and fumbled in his pockets .      would you like     he said     some banged grains .      the golden man was just visible under the screen .  his head was bowed .      you know  he does look like my uncle oswald     said ginger .     the screen went dark with such suddenness the inrushing blackness almost made a noise .   this must have happened many times before  victor thought .  in dozens of universes .  the wild idea arrives  and somehow the golden man  the oswald or whatever  arises .  to control it .  or something .  maybe wherever holy wood goes  osric follows .   a point of purple light appeared  and grew faster very quickly .  victor felt that he was dropping down a tunnel .   the golden figure raised its head .   the light twisted  and took on random features .  the screen wasn   t there anymore .  this was something entering the world .  it wasn   t an image at the other end of the hall  but something frantically trying to exist .   the golden man drew back his sword .   victor shook ginger   s shoulder .      i think this is where we leave     he said .   the sword connected .  golden light filled the cave .   victor and ginger were already racing down the steps of the ante chamber when the first shock hit .  they stared at the tunnel   s empty mouth .      not on your life     said ginger .     i   m not going to be trapped in there again .      the flooded stairs lay in front of them .  of course  they must connect to the sea  and really it was only a few yards away  but the water was inky black and  in gaspode   s word  boding .      can you swim .     said victor .  one of the cavern   s rotting pillars crashed down behind them .  from the pit itself came a terrible wailing .      not very well     said ginger .      me neither     he said .  the commotion behind them was getting worse .      still     he said  taking her hand .     we could look on this as a great opportunity to improve really quickly .      they jumped .       victor surfaced fifty yards offshore  lungs bursting .  ginger erupted a few feet away .  they trod water  and watched .   the earth trembled .   holy wood town  built of unseasoned wood and short nails  was shaking apart .  houses folded down on themselves slowly  like packs of cards .  here and there small explosions indicated that stores of octo cellulose were involved .  canvas cities and plaster mountains slid into ruin .   and between it all  dodging the falling timber but letting nothing else stand in their way  the people of holy wood ran for their lives .  handlemen  actors  alchemists  imps  trolls  dwarfs   they ran like ants whose heap is ablaze  heads down  legs pumping  eyes fixed furiously on the horizon .   a whole section of hill caved in .   for a moment victor thought he saw the huge golden figure of osbert  as insubstantial as dust motes in a shaft of light  rise over holy wood and bring its sword around in one all embracing sweep .   then it was gone .       victor helped ginger ashore .   they reached the main street  silent now except for the occasional creak and thud as another plank dropped off the half collapsed buildings .   they picked their way over fallen scenery and broken picture boxes .   there was a crash behind them as the    century of the fruitbat    sign slipped off its moorings and thudded on the sand .   they passed the remains of borgle   s commissary  whose destruction had increased the average food quality of the entire world by a small but significant amount .   they waded through unreeled clicks  flapping in the wind .     they climbed over broken dreams .   at the edge of what had been holy wood  victor turned and looked back once .      well  they were right at last     he said .     you   ll never work in this town again .      there was a sob .  to his surprise  ginger was crying .   he put his arm around her .      come on     he said .     i   ll walk you home .          holy wood   s own magic  now rootless and fading  crackled across the landscape  looking for pathways to earth itself   click     it was early evening .  the reddened light of the setting sun filled the windows of harga   s house of ribs  which was nearly deserted at this time of day .   detritus and ruby sat awkwardly on human size chairs .   the only other person around was sham harga himself  smearing the dirt more evenly around the vacant tables with a cloth and whistling vaguely .      ur     detritus ventured .      yes .     said ruby  expectantly .      ur .  nuffin     said detritus .  he felt out of place here  but ruby had insisted .  he kept feeling she wanted him to say something  but all he could think of was hitting her with a brick .   harga stopped whistling .   detritus felt his head twist around .  his mouth opened .      play it again  sham     said holy wood .   there was a crashing chord .  the back wall of the house of ribs moved aside into whatever dimension these things go  and an indistinct but unmistakable orchestra occupied the space normally filled by harga   s kitchen and the noisome alley behind it .   ruby   s dress became a waterfall of sequins .  the other tables whirled away .     detritus adjusted an unexpected tuxedo  and cleared his throat .      dere may being trouble ahead       he began  the words flowing straight from somewhere else into his vocal chords .   he took ruby   s hand .  a gold tipped cane hit his left ear .  a black silk hat materialized at high speed and bounced off his elbow .  he ignored them .      but while dere moonlight  an    music        he faltered .  the golden words were fading .  the walls came back .  the tables reappeared .  the sequins flared and died .      um     said detritus  suddenly .   she was watching him intently .      ur .  sorry     he said .     dunno what come over me  there .      harga strode up to the table .      what was all that       he began .  without shifting her gaze  ruby shot out a treetrunk arm  spun him around  and pushed him through the wall .      kiss me  you mad fool     she said .   detritus    brow wrinkled .     what .     he said .   ruby sighed .  well  so much for the human way .   she picked up a chair and hit him scientifically over the head with it .  a smile spread across his face  and he slumped forward .   she picked him up easily and slung him over her shoulder .  if ruby had learned anything in holy wood  it was that there was no use in waiting around for mr .  right to hit you with a brick .  you had to make your own bricks .       click     in a dwarf mine miles and miles from the loam of ankh morpork  a very angry overseer banged on his shovel for silence and spoke thusly      i want to make this absolutely clear  right .  one more  and i really mean it  one more  right .  just one more hiho hiho out of you bloody lawn ornaments and it   s double headed axe time  ok .  we   re dwarfs  godsdammit .  so act like them .  and that includes you  dozy .          click     make my day  call me mr thumpy hopped to the top of the dune and peered over .  then he slid back down again .      all clear     he reported .     no humans .  just ruins .         a playshe of our own     said the cat  happily .     a playshe where all animals  regardlesh of shape or speciesh  can live together in perfect        the duck quacked .      the duck says     said call me mr thumpy and die     it   s got to be worth a try .  if we   re going to be sapient  we might as well get good at it .  come on .      then he shivered .  there had been something like a faint tang of static electricity .  for a moment the little area in the sand dunes wavered as in a heat haze .   the duck quacked again .   not mr thumpy wrinkled his nose .  it was suddenly hard to concentrate .      the duck says     he wavered     the duck says   says   the duck   says   says   quack    .      the cat looked at the mouse .      miaow .     it said .   the mouse shrugged .     squeak     it commented .   the rabbit wrinkled its nose uncertainly .   the duck squinted at the cat .  the cat stared at the rabbit .  the mouse peered at the duck .   the duck rocketed upward .  the rabbit became a fast disappearing cloud of sand .  the mouse tore over the dunes .  and  feeling a lot happier than it had done for weeks  the cat ran after it .       click     ginger and victor sat at a table in the corner of the mended drum .  eventually ginger said     they were good dogs .         yes     said victor  distantly .      morry and rock have been digging through the rubble for ages .  they said there   s all kind of cellars and things down there .  i   m sorry .         yes .         maybe we ought to put up a statue to them  or something .         i   m not sure about that     said victor .     i mean  considering what dogs do to statues .  maybe dogs dying is all part of holy wood .  i don   t know .      ginger traced the outline of a knothole on the tabletop .      it   s all over now     she said .     you do know that  don   t you .  no more holy wood .  it   s all over .         yes .         the patrician and the wizards won   t let anyone make anymore clicks .  the patrician was very definite about it .         i don   t think anyone wants to make any     said victor .      who   s going to remember holy wood now .         what do you mean .         those old priests built a kind of half baked religion around it .  they forgot all about what it really was .  that didn   t matter  though .  i don   t think you need chants and fires .  you just need to remember holy

re a powerful merchant it   s nice to have a famous wife .  it   s like owning jewelry .     she looked down .     mrs .  cosmopilite says can she have one of the ones i don   t want .  i said she could have all three .         i   ve always been that way about choices myself     said victor  cheering up .      have you .  if that   s all the choice there is  i   m not choosing .  what can you be  after you   ve been yourself  as big as possible .         nothing     said victor .      no one knows what it feels like .           except us .         yes .         yes .      ginger grinned .

thoughtfully for some time .  it grew bigger and  eventually  disgorged a dark skinned young man riding an elephant .   it trotted up the road to the gates and lumbered to a halt at the city wall .  the dust cloud  colon couldn   t help noticing  was still on the horizon and still getting bigger .   the boy cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted     can you tell me the way to holy wood .         there ain   t no holy wood anymore  from what i hear     said colon .   the boy appeared to consider this .  he looked down at a piece of paper in his hand .  then he said     do you know where i can find mr .  c . m . o . t .  dibbler .      sgt .  colon repeated the initials under his breath .      you mean throat .     he said .     cut me own throat dibbler .         is he in .      sgt

glancing at the lowering cloud .      you   re herding fish .         not fish .        huge gray foreheads were becoming visible in the dust .  there was also the very distinctive smell you get when a thousand elephants have been foraging for days in cabbage fields .      just hang on     he said .     i   ll go and fetch him .      colon pulled his head back into the guardroom and nudged the sleeping form of corporal nobbs  currently the other half of the keen eyed fighting force that was ceaselessly guarding the city .      wassat .         you seen ole throat this morning  nobby .         yeah  he was in easy street .  bought a jumbo sausage surprise off him .         he   s back selling sausages .         got to .  lost all his money .  what   s up .         just take a look outside

a crucible and sighed wistfully .   a lot of gold had been left behind in holy wood  for anyone who had the nerve to go and dig for it .  for those who hadn   t  and silverfish wouldn   t hesitate to put himself first among that number  there were the old tried and tested or  to put it another way  tried and repeatedly failed methods of wealth production .  so now he was back home  picking up where he had left off .      any good .     said peavie  who had dropped in to commiserate .      well  it   s silvery     said silverfish doubtfully .     and it   s sort of metallic .  and it   s heavier than lead .  you have to cook up a ton of ore  too .  funny thing is  i thought i was onto something this time .  i really thought that this time we were on the way to a new  clear future           what are you going to call it .     said peavie .      oh  i don   t know .  it   s probably not worth naming     said silverfish .      ankhmorporkery .  silverfishium .  notleadium .     said peavie .      uselessium  more like     said silverfish .     i   m giving up on it and going back to something more sensible .      peavie peered into the furnace .      it doesn   t go boom  does it .     he said .   silverfish gave him a withering look .      this stuff .     he said .     whatever gave you that idea .          click     it was pitch dark under the rubble .   it had been pitch dark for a long time .   gaspode could feel the tons of stone above this little space .  you didn   t need any special doggy senses for that .   he dragged himself over to where a pillar had smashed down into the cellar .   laddie raised his head with difficulty  licked gaspode   s face  and managed the faintest of barks .      good boy laddie   good boy gaspode           good boy laddie     gaspode whispered .   laddie   s tail thumped once or twice on the stones .  then he whimpered for a while  with longer and longer pauses between the sounds .     then there was a faint noise .  just like bone on stone .   gaspode   s ears twitched .  he looked up at the advancing figure  visible even in utter darkness because it would forever be darker than mere blackness alone could manage .   he pulled himself upright  the hairs rising along his back  and growled .      another step and i   ll have your leg off and bury it     he said .   a skeletal hand reached out and tickled him behind the ears .   there was a faint barking from the darkness .      good boy laddie .      gaspode  tears pouring down his face  gave death an apologetic grin .      pathetic  isn   t it .     he said hoarsely .   i wouldn   t know .  i   ve never been that much of a dog person  said death .      oh .  come to that  i   ve never liked the idea of dyin        said gaspode .     we are dyin     ain   t we .      yes .      not surprised  really .  story of my life  dyin        said gaspode .     it   s just that i fought     he added  hopefully     that there was a special death for dogs .  a big black dog  maybe .      no  said death .      funny that     said gaspode .     i heard where every type of animal had its own ghastly dark specter what come for it at the end .  no offense meant     he added quickly .     i fought there was this big dog that trots up to you an    says     ok  gaspode  your work is done and so forth  lay down your weary burden  style of fing  and follow me to a land flowin    with steak and offal .         no .  there   s just me  said death .  the final frontier .      how come i   m seein    you  if i ain   t dead yet .      you   re hallucinating .   gaspode looked alert .     am i .  cor .           good boy laddie .     the barking was louder this time .   death reached into the mysterious recesses of his robe and produced a small hourglass .  there was almost no sand left in the top bulb .  the last seconds of gaspode   s life hissed from the future to the past .   and then there were none at all .   death stood up .   come  gaspode .   there was a faint noise .  it sounded like the audible equivalent of a twinkle .   golden sparks filled the hourglass .   the sand flowed backward .   death grinned .   and then  where he had been  there was a triangle of brilliant light .      good boy laddie .         there he are .  told you i hear barking .     said the voice of rock .     good boy .  here  boy .         cor  am i glad to see you       gaspode began .  the trolls clustering around the opening paid him no attention at all .  rock heaved the pillar aside and gently lifted laddie up .      nothing wrong that time won   t heal     he said .      can we eat it now .     said a troll above him .      you defective or something .  this one heroic dog .               scuse me           good boy laddie .      rock handed up the dog and climbed out of the hole .            scuse me       gaspode croaked after him .   he heard a distant cheer .   after a while  since there didn   t seem to be much of an alternative  he crawled painfully up the sloping pillar and managed to drag himself out onto the rubble .   no one was around .   he had a drink out of a puddle .   he stood up  testing the injured leg .   it   d do .     and finally  he swore .      woof  woof  woof .      he paused .  that wasn   t right .   he tried again .      woof .      he looked around        and color drained out of the world  returning it to a state of blessed blacks and whites .   it occurred to gaspode that harga would be throwing out the trash around now  and then there was bound to be a warm stable somewhere .  and what more did a small dog need .   somewhere in the distant mountains  wolves were howling .  somewhere in friendly houses  dogs with collars and dishes with their names on were being patted on the head .   somewhere in between  and feeling oddly cheerful about it  gaspode the wonder dog limped into the gloriously monochrome sunset .       about thirty miles turnwise of ankh morpork the surf boomed on the wind blown  seagrass waving  sand dune covered spit of land where the circle sea met the rim ocean .   sea swallows dipped low over the waves .  the dried heads of sea poppies clattered in the perpetual breeze  which scoured the sky of clouds and moved the sand around in curious patterns .   the hill itself was visible for miles .  it wasn   t very high  but lay among the dunes like an upturned boat or a very unlucky whale  and was covered in scrub trees .  no rain fell here  if it could possibly avoid it .   but the wind blew  and piled the dunes against the dried out  bleached wood of holy wood town .   it howled its auditions on the deserted backlots .   it tumbled scraps of paper through the crumbling plaster wonders of the world .     it rattled the boards until they fell into the sand and were covered .   clickaclickaclicka .   the wind sighed around the skeleton of a picture throwing box  leaning drunkenly on its abandoned tripod .   it caught a trailing scrap of film and wound out the last picture show  snaking the crumbling glistening coils across the sand .   in the picture thrower   s glass eye tiny figures danced jerkily  alive for just a moment
