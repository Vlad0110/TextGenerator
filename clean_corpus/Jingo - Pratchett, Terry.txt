copyright      about the publisher      begin reading   it was a moonless night  which was good for the purposes of solid jackson .   he fished for curious squid  so called because  as well as being squid  they were curious .  that is to say  their curiosity was the curious thing about them .   shortly after they got curious about the lantern that solid had hung over the stern of his boat  they started to become curious about the way in which various of their number suddenly vanished skyward with a splash .   some of them even became curious   very briefly curious   about the sharp barbed thing that was coming very quickly toward them .   the curious squid were extremely curious .  unfortunately  they weren   t very good at making connections .   it was a very long way to this fishing ground  but for solid the trip was usually well worth it .  the curious squid were very small  harmless  difficult to find and reckoned by connoisseurs to have the foulest taste of any creature in the world .  this made them very much in demand in a certain kind of restaurant where highly skilled chefs made  with great care  dishes containing no trace of the squid whatsoever .   solid jackson   s problem was that tonight  a moonless night in the spawning season  when the squid were especially curious about everything  the chef seemed to have been at work on the sea itself .   there was not a single interested eyeball to be seen .  there weren   t any other fish either  and usually there were a few attracted to the light .  he   d caught sight of one .  it had been making through the water extremely fast in a straight line .   he laid down his trident and walked to the other end of the boat  where his son les was also gazing intently at the torch lit sea .      not a thing in half an hour     said solid .      you sure we   re in the right spot  dad .      solid squinted at the horizon .  there was a faint glow in the sky that indicated the city of al khali  on the klatchian coast .  he turned round .  the other horizon glowed  too  with the lights of ankh morpork .  the boat bobbed gently halfway between the two .         course we are     he said  but certainty edged away from his words .   because there was a hush on the sea .  it didn   t look right .  the boat rocked a little  but that was with their movement  not from any motion of the waves .   it felt as if there was going to be a storm .  but the stars twinkled softly and there was not a cloud in the sky .   the stars twinkled on the surface of the water  too .  now that was something you didn   t often see .      i reckon we ought to be getting out of here     solid said .   les pointed at the slack sail .     what   re we going to use for wind  dad .      it was then that they heard the splash of oars .   solid  squinting hard  could just make out the shape of another boat  heading toward him .  he grabbed his boat hook .      i knows that   s you  you thieving foreign bastard .      the oars stopped .  a voice sang over the water .      may you be consumed by a thousand devils  you damned person .      the other boat glided closer .  it looked foreign  with eyes painted on the prow .      fished    em all out  have you .  i   ll take my trident to you  you bottomfeedin    scum that y   are .         my curvy sword at your neck  you unclean son of a dog of the female persuasion .      les looked over the side .  little bubbles fizzed on the surface of the sea .      dad .     he said .      that   s greasy arif out there .     snapped his father .     you take a good look at him .  he   s been coming out here for years  stealing our squid  the evil lying little devil .         dad  there   s           you get on them oars and i   ll knock his black teeth out .      les could hear a voice saying from the other boat        see  my son  how the underhanded fish thief           row .     his father shouted .      to the oars .     shouted someone in the other boat .      whose squid are they  dad .     said les .      ours .         what  even before we   ve caught them .         just you shut up and row .         i can   t move the boat  dad  we   re stuck on something .         it   s a hundred fathoms deep here  boy .  what   s there to stick on .      les tried to disentangle an oar from the thing rising slowly out of the fizzing sea .      looks like a   a chicken  dad .      there was a sound from below the surface .  it sounded like some bell or gong  slowly swinging .      chickens can   t swim .         it   s made of iron  dad .      solid scrambled to the rear of the boat .   it was a chicken  made of iron .  seaweed and shells covered it and water dripped off it as it rose against the stars .   it stood on a cross shaped perch .   there seemed to be a letter on each of the four ends of the cross .   solid held the torch closer .      what the        then he pulled the oar free and sat down beside his son .      row like the blazes  les .         what   s happening  dad .         shut up and row .  get us away from it .         is it a monster  dad .         it   s worse than a monster  son .     shouted solid  as the oars bit into the water .   the thing was quite high now  standing on some kind of tower      what is it  dad .  what is it .         it   s a damned weathercock .         there was not  on the whole  a lot of geological excitement .  the sinking of continents is usually accompanied by volcanoes  earthquakes and armadas of little boats containing old men anxious to build pyramids and mystic stone circles in some new land where being the possessor of genuine ancient occult wisdom might be expected to attract girls .  but the rising of this one caused barely a ripple in the purely physical scheme of things .  it more or less sidled back  like a cat who   s been away for a few days and knows you   ve been worrying .   around the shores of the circle sea a large wave  only five or six feet high by the time it reached them  caused some comment .  and in some of the very low lying swamp areas the water swamped some villages of people that no one else cared about very much .  but in a purely geological sense  nothing very much happened .   in a purely geological sense .         it   s a city  dad .  look  you can see all the windows and           i told you to shut up and keep rowing .      the seawater surged down the streets .  on either side  huge  weed encrusted buildings boiled slowly out of the surf .   father and son fought to keep some way on the boat as it was dragged along .  and  since lesson one in the art of rowing is that you do it while looking the wrong way  they didn   t see the other boat        you lunatic .         foolish man .         don   t you touch that building .  this country belongs to ankh morpork .      the two boats spun in a temporary whirlpool .      i claim this land in the name of the seriph of al khali .         we saw it first .  les  you tell him we saw it first .         we saw it first before you saw it first .         les  you saw him  he tried to hit me with that oar .         but dad  you   re waving that trident           see the untrustworthy way he attacks us  akhan .      there was a grinding noise from under the keel of both boats and they began to tip as they settled into the sea bottom ooze .      look  father  there is an interesting statue           he has set his foot on klatchian soil .  the squid thief .         get those filthy sandals off ankh morporkian territory .         oh  dad        the two fishermen stopped screaming at each other  mainly in order to get their breath back .  crabs scuttled away .  water drained between the patches of weed  carving runnels in the gray silt .      father  look  there   s still colored tiles on the           mine .         mine .      les caught akhan   s eye .  they exchanged a very brief glance which was nevertheless modulated with a considerable amount of information  beginning with the sheer galactic sized embarrassment of having parents and working up from there .      dad  we don   t have to       les began .      you shut up .  it   s your future i   m thinking about  my lad           yes  but who cares who saw it first  dad .  we   re both hundreds of miles from home .  i mean  who   s going to know  dad .      the two squid fishermen glared at one another .   the dripping buildings rose above them .  there were holes that might well have been doorways  and glassless apertures that could have been windows  but all was darkness within .  now and again  les fancied he could hear something slithering .   solid jackson coughed .     the lad   s right     he muttered .     daft to argue .  just the four of us .         indeed     said arif .   they backed away  each man carefully watching the other .  then  so closely that it was a chorus  they both yelled     grab the boat .      there was a confused couple of moments and then each pair  boat carried over their heads  ran and slithered along the muddy streets .   they had to stop and come back  with mutual cries of    a kidnapper as well  eh .     to get the right sons .   as every student of exploration knows  the prize goes not to the explorer who first sets foot upon the virgin soil but to the one who gets that foot home first .  if it is still attached to his leg  this is a bonus .      the weathercocks of ankh morpork creaked around in the wind .   very few of them were in fact representations of avis domestica .  there were various dragons  fish and miscellaneous animals .  on the roof of the assassins    guild a silhouette of one of the members squeaked into a new position  cloak and dagger at the ready .  on the beggars    guild a tin beggar   s hand asked the wind for a quarter .  on the butchers    guild a copper pig sniffed the air .  on the roof of the thieves    guild a real if rather deceased unlicensed thief turned gently  which shows what you are capable of if you try  or at least if you try stealing without a license .   the one on the library dome of unseen university was running slow and wouldn   t show the change for half an hour yet  but the smell of the sea drifted over the city .   there was a tradition of soap box public speaking in sator square .     speaking    was stretching a point to cover the ranters  haranguers and occasional self absorbed mumblers that spaced themselves at intervals amongst the crowds .  and  traditionally  people said whatever was on their minds and at the top of their voices .  the patrician  it was said  looked kindly on the custom .  he did .  and very closely  too .  he probably had someone make notes .   so did the watch .   it wasn   t spying  commander vimes told himself .  spying was when you crept around peeking in windows .  it wasn   t spying when you had to stand back a bit so that you weren   t deafened .   he reached out without paying attention and struck a match on sergeant detritus .      dat was me  sir     said the troll reproachfully .      sorry  sergeant     said vimes  lighting his cigar .      it not a problem .      they returned their attention to the speakers .   it   s the wind  thought vimes .  it   s bringing something new     usually the speakers dealt with all kinds of subjects  many of them on the cusp of sanity or somewhere in the peaceful valleys on the other side .  but now they were all monomaniacs .         time they were taught a lesson .     screamed the nearest one .     why don   t our so called masters listen to the voice of the people .  ankh morpork has had enough of these swaggering brigands .  they steal our fish  they steal our trade and now they   re stealing our land .      it would have been better if people had cheered  vimes thought .  people generally cheered the speakers indiscriminately  to egg them on .  but the crowd around this man just seemed to nod approval .  he thought  they   re actually thinking about what he said      they stole my merchandise .     shouted a speaker opposite him .     it   s a pirate bloody empire .  i was boarded .  in ankh morpork waters .      there was a general self righteous muttering .      what did they steal  mr .  jenkins .     said a voice from the crowd .      a cargo of fine silks .      the crowd hissed .      ah .  not dried fish offal and condemned meat  then .  that   s your normal cargo  i believe .      mr .  jenkins strained to look for the speaker .      fine silks .     he said .     and what does the city care about that .  nothing .      there were shouts of    shame .         has the city been told .     said the inquiring voice .   people started to crane their heads .  and then the crowd opened a little  to reveal the figure of commander vimes of the city watch .      well  it   s   i       jenkins began .     er   i           i care     said vimes calmly .     shouldn   t be too hard to track down a cargo of fine silks that stink of fish guts .     there was laughter .  ankh morpork people always like some variety in their street theater .   vimes apparently spoke to sergeant detritus  while keeping his gaze locked on jenkins .     detritus  just you go along with mr .  jenkins here  will you .  his ship is the milka  i believe .  he   ll show you all the lading bills and manifests and receipts and things  and then we can sort him out in jig time .      there was a clang as detritus   s huge hand came to rest against his helmet .      yessir .         er   er   you can   t     said jenkins quickly .     they   er   stole the paperwork as well           really .  so they can take the stuff back to the shop if it doesn   t fit .         er   anyway  the ship   s sailed .  yes .  sailed .  got to try and recoup my losses  you know .         sailed .  without its captain .     said vimes .     so mr .  scoplett is in charge .  your first officer .         yes  yes           damn .     said vimes  snapping his fingers theatrically .     that man we   ve got in the cells on a charge of being naughtily drunk last night   we   re going to have to charge him with impersonation as well  then .  i don   t know  more blasted paperwork  the stuff just piles up        mr .  jenkins tried to look away but vimes   s stare kept pulling him back .  the occasional tremble of a lip suggested that he was preparing a riposte  but he was bright enough to spot that vimes   s grin was as funny as the one that moves very fast toward drowning men .  and has a fin on top .   mr .  jenkins made a wise decision  and got down .     i   ll   er   i   ll go and sort   i   d better go and   er       he said  and pushed his way through the mob  which waited a little while to see if anything interesting was going to happen and then  disappointed  sought out other entertainment .      you want i should go an    have a look at his boat .     said detritus .      no  sergeant .  there won   t be any silk  and there won   t be any paperwork .  there won   t be anything except a lingering aroma of fish guts .         wow  dem damn klatchians steals everything that ain   t nailed down  right .      vimes shook his head and strolled on .     they don   t have trolls in klatch  do they .     he said .      nossir .  it   s der heat .  troll brains don   t work in der heat .  if i was to go to klatch     said detritus  his knuckles making little bink bink noises as he dragged them over the cobbles     i   d be really stoopid .         detritus .         yessir .         never go to klatch .         nossir .      another speaker was attracting a much larger crowd .  he stood in front of a large banner that proclaimed  greasy forane hands off leshp .      leshp     said detritus .     now dere   s a name that ain   t got its teef in .         it   s the land that came back up from under the sea last week     said vimes despondently .   they listened while the speaker proclaimed that ankh morpork had a duty to protect its kith and kin on the new land .  detritus looked puzzled .      how come dere   s dese kiff and kin on dere when it only just come up from under der water .     he said .      good question     said vimes .      dey been holding dere breath .         i doubt it .      there was more in the air than the salt of the sea  vimes thought .  there was some other current .  he could sense it .  suddenly  the problem was klatch .   ankh morpork had been at peace with klatch  or at least in a state of non war  for almost a century .  it was  after all  the neighboring country .   neighbors   hah .  but what did that mean .  the watch could tell you a thing or two about neighbors .  so could lawyers  especially the real rich ones to whom    neighbor    meant a man who   d sue for twenty years over a strip of garden two inches wide .  people   d live for ages side by side  nodding at one another amicably on their way to work every day  and then some trivial thing would happen and someone would be having a garden fork removed from their ear .   and now some damn rock had risen up out of the sea and everyone was acting as if klatch had let its dog bark all night .      aagragaah     said detritus  mournfully .      don   t mind me  just don   t spit it on my boot     said vimes .      it mean       detritus waved a huge hand     like   dem things  what only comes in       he paused and looked at his fingers  while his lips moved       fours .  aagragaah .  it mean lit   rally der time when you see dem little pebbles and you jus    know dere   s gonna be a great big landslide on toppa you and it already too late to run .  dat moment  dat   s aagragaah .      vimes   s own lips moved .     forebodings .         dat   s der bunny .         where does the word come from .      detritus shrugged .     maybe it named after der soun    you make just as a t   ousand ton of rock hit you .         forebodings       vimes rubbed his chin .     yeah .  well  i   ve got plenty of them        landslides and avalanches  he thought .  all the little snowflakes land  light as a feather   and suddenly the whole side of a mountain is moving     detritus looked at him slyly .     i know everyone say    dem two short planks  dey   re as fick as detritus        he said     but i know which way der wind is blowin    .      vimes looked at his sergeant with a new respect .      you can spot it  can you .      the troll   s finger tapped his helmet twice  knowingly .      it pretty obvious     he said .     you see up on der roofs dem little chickies and dragons and stuff .  and dat poor bugger on der fieves    guild .  you just has to watch    em .  dey know .  beats me how dey always pointin    der right way .      vimes relaxed a little .  detritus   s intelligence wasn   t too bad for a troll  falling somewhere between a cuttlefish and a line dancer  but you could rely on him not to let it slow him down .   detritus winked .     an    it look to me like dat time when you go an    find a big club and listen to grandad tellin    you how he beat up all dem dwarfs when he was a boy     he said .     somethin    in der wind  right .         er   yes       said vimes .   there was a fluttering above him .  he sighed .  a message was coming in .   on a pigeon .   but they   d tried everything else  hadn   t they .  swamp dragons tended to explode in the air  imps ate the messages and the semaphore helmets had not been a success  especially in high winds .  and then corporal littlebottom had pointed out that ankh morpork   s pigeons were  because of many centuries of depredation by the city   s gargoyle population  considerably more intelligent than most pigeons  although vimes considered that this was not difficult because there were things growing on old damp bread that were more intelligent than most pigeons .   he took a handful of corn out of his pocket .  the pigeon  obedient to its careful training  settled on his shoulder .  in obedience to internal pressures  it relieved itself .      you know  we   ve got to find something better     said vimes  as he unwrapped the message .     every time we send a message to constable downspout he eats it .         well  he are a gargoyle     said detritus .     he fink it lunch arriving .         oh     said vimes     his lordship requires my attendance .  how nice .         lord vetinari looked attentive  because he   d always found that listening keenly to people tended to put them off .   and at meetings like this  when he was advised by the leaders of the city  he listened with great care because what people said was what they wanted him to hear .  he paid a lot of attention to the spaces outside the words  though .  that   s where the things were that they hoped he didn   t know and didn   t want him to find out .   currently he was paying attention to the things that lord downey of the assassins    guild was failing to say in a lengthy exposition of the guild   s high level of training and value to the city .  the voice  eventually  came to a stop in the face of vetinari   s aggressive listening .      thank you  lord downey     he said .     i   m sure we shall all be able to sleep a lot more uneasily for knowing all that .  just one minor point   i believe the word    assassin    actually comes from klatch .         well   indeed           and i believe also that many of your students are  as it turns out  from klatch and its neighboring countries .         the unrivaled quality of our education           quite so .  what you are telling me  in point of fact  is that their assassins have been doing it longer  know their way around our city and have had their traditional skills honed by you .         er        the patrician turned to mr .  burleigh .      we surely have superiority in weapons  mr .  burleigh .         oh  yes .  say what you like about dwarfs  but we   ve been turning out some superb stuff lately     said the president of the guild of armorers .      ah .  that at least is some comfort .         yes     said burleigh .  he looked wretched .     however  the thing about weapons manufacture   the important thing           i believe you are about to say that the important thing about the business of weaponry is that it is a business     said the patrician .   burleigh looked as though he   d been let off the hook on to a bigger hook .      er   yes .         that  in fact  the weapons are for selling .         er   exactly .         to anyone who wishes to buy them .         er   yes .         regardless of the use to which they are going to be put .      the armaments manufacturer looked affronted .      pardon me .  of course .  they   re weapons .         and i suspect that in recent years a very lucrative market has been klatch .         well  yes   the seriph needs them to pacify the outlying regions        the patrician held up his hand .  drumknott  his clerk  gave him a piece of paper .      the    great leveller    cart mounted ten bank     pound crossbow .     he said .     and  let me see   the    meteor    automated throwing star hurler  decapitates at twenty paces  money back if not completely decapitated .         have you ever heard of the d   regs  my lord .     said burleigh .     they say the only way to pacify one of them is to hit him repeatedly with an axe and bury what   s left under a rock .  and even then  choose a heavy rock .      the patrician seemed to be staring at a large drawing of the    dervish    mk iii razor wire bolas .  there was a painful silence .  burleigh tried to fill it up  always a bad mistake .      besides  we provide much needed jobs in ankh morpork     he murmured .      exporting these weapons to other countries     said lord vetinari .  he handed the paper back and fixed burleigh with a friendly smile .      i   m very pleased to see that the industry has done so well     he said .     i will bear this particularly in mind .      he placed his hands together carefully .     the situation is grave  gentlemen .         whose .     said mr .  burleigh .      i   m sorry .         what .  oh   i was thinking about something else  my lord           i was referring to the fact that a number of our citizens have gone out to this wretched island .  as have  i understand  a number of klatchians .         why are our people going out there .     said mr .  boggis of the thieves    guild .      because they are showing a brisk pioneering spirit and seeking wealth and   additional wealth in a new land     said lord vetinari .      what   s in it for the klatchians .     said lord downey .      oh  they   ve gone out there because they are a bunch of unprincipled opportunists always ready to grab something for nothing     said lord vetinari .      a masterly summation  if i may say so  my lord     said mr .  burleigh  who felt he had some ground to make up .   the patrician looked down again at his notes .     oh  i do beg your pardon     he said     i seem to have read those last two sentences in the wrong order   mr .  slant  i believe you have something to say here .      the president of the guild of lawyers cleared his throat .  the sound was like a death rattle and technically it was  since the man had been a zombie for several hundred years although historical accounts suggested that the only difference dying had made to mr .  slant was that he   d started to work through his lunch break .      yes  indeed     he said  opening a large legal tome .     the history of the city of leshp and its surrounding country is a little obscure .  it is known to have been above the sea almost a thousand years ago  however  when records suggest that it was considered part of the ankh morpork empire           what is the nature of these records and do they tell us who was doing the considering .     said the patrician .  the door opened and vimes stepped in .     ah  commander  do take a seat .  continue  mr .  slant .      the zombie did not like interruptions .  he coughed again .     the records relating to the lost country date back several hundred years  my lord .  and they are of course our records .         only ours .         i hardly see how any others could apply     said mr .  slant severely .      klatchian ones  for example .     said vimes  from the far end of the table .      sir samuel  the klatchian language does not even have a word for lawyer     said mr .  slant .      doesn   t it .     said vimes .     good for them .         it is our view     said slant  turning his chair slightly so that he did not have to look at vimes     that the new land is ours by eminent domain  extra territoriality and  most importantly  acquiris quodcumque rapis .  i am given to understand that it was one of our fishermen who first set foot on it this time .         i hear the klatchians claim that it was one of their fishermen     said vetinari .   at the end of the table vimes   s lips were moving .  let   s see  acquiris         you get what you grab    .     he said aloud .      we   re not going to take their word for it  are we .     said slant  pointedly ignoring him .     excuse me  my lord  but i don   t believe that proud ankh morpork is told what to do by a bunch of thieves with towels on their heads .         no  indeed .  it   s about time johnny klatchian was taught a lesson     said lord selachii .     remember all that business last year with the cabbages .  ten damn boatloads they wouldn   t accept .         and everyone knows caterpillars add to the flavor     said vimes  more or less to himself .   the patrician shot him a glance .      that   s right .     said selachii .     good honest protein .  and you remember all that trouble captain jenkins had over that cargo of mutton .  they were going to imprison him .  in a klatchian jail .         surely not .  meat is at its best when it   s going green     said vimes .      it   s not as if it   d taste any different under all that curry     said burleigh .     i was at a dinner in their embassy once  and do you know what they made me eat .  it was a sheep   s           excuse me  gentlemen     said vimes  standing up .     there are some urgent matters i must deal with .      he nodded to the patrician and hurried out of the room .  he shut the door behind him and took a breath of fresh air  although right now he   d have happily inhaled deeply in a tannery .   corporal littlebottom stood up and looked at him expectantly .  she had been sitting next to a box  which cooed peacefully .      something   s up .  run down to   i mean  send a pigeon down to the yard     said vimes .      yes  sir .         all leave is cancelled as of now and i want to see every officer  and i mean every officer  at the yard at  oh  let   s say six o   clock .         right  sir .  that might mean an extra pigeon unless i can write small enough .      littlebottom hurried off .   vimes glanced out of the window .  there was always a certain amount of activity outside the palace but today there was   not so much a crowd as  just  rather more people than you normally saw  hanging around .  as if they were waiting for something .       klatch .   everyone knows it .   old detritus was right .  you could hear the little pebbles bouncing .  it   s not just a few fishermen having a scrap  it   s a hundred years of   well  like two big men trying to fit in one small room  trying to be polite about it  and then one day one of them just has to stretch and pretty soon they   re both smashing the furniture .   but it couldn   t really happen  could it .  from what he   d heard  the present seriph was a competent man who was mostly concerned with pacifying the rowdy edges of his empire .  and there were klatchians living in ankh morpork  for heaven   s sake .  there were klatchians born in ankh morpork .  you saw some lad with a face that   d got camels written all over it  and when he opened his mouth it   d turn out he had an ankhian accent so thick you could float rocks .  oh  there   s all the jokes about funny food and foreigners  but surely     not very funny jokes  come to think of it .   when you hear the bang  there   s no time to wonder how long the little fuse has been fizzing .   there were raised voices when he went back into the rats chamber .      because  lord selachii     the patrician was saying     these are not the old days .  it is no longer considered   nice   to send a warship over there to  as you put it  show johnny foreigner the error of his ways .  for one thing  we haven   t had any warships since the mary jane sank four hundred years ago .  and times have changed .  these days  the whole world watches .  and  my lord  you are no longer allowed to say    what   re you lookin    at .     and black their eyes .     he leaned back .     there   s chimeria  and khanli  and ephebe  and tsort .  and muntab  these days  too .  and omnia .  some of these are powerful nations  gentlemen .  many of them don   t like klatch   s current expansionist outlook  but they don   t like us much  either .         whyever not .     said lord selachii .      well  because during our history those we haven   t occupied we   ve tended to wage war on     said lord vetinari .     for some reason the slaughter of thousands of people tends to stick in the memory .         oh  history     said lord selachii .     that   s all in the past .         a good place for history  agreed     said the patrician solemnly .      i meant  why don   t they like us now .  do we owe them money .         no .  mostly they owe us money .  which is  of course  a far better reason for their dislike .         how about sto lat and pseudopolis and the other cities .     said lord downey .      they don   t like us much  either .         why not .  i mean t   say  we do share a common heritage     said lord selachii .      yes  my lord  but that common heritage largely consists of having had wars with one another     said the patrician .     i can   t see much support there .  which is a little unfortunate because we do not  in fact  have an army .  i am not  of course  a military man but i believe that one of those is generally considered vital to the successful prosecution of a war .      he looked along the table .      the fact is     he went on     that ankh morpork has been violently against a standing army .         we all know why people don   t trust an army     said lord downey .     a lot of armed men  standing around with nothing to do   they start to get ideas        vimes saw the heads turn toward him .      my word     he said  with glassy brightness     can this be a reference to    old stoneface    vimes  who led the city   s militia in a revolt against the rule of a tyrannical monarch in an effort to bring some sort of freedom and justice to the place .  i do believe it is .  and was he commander of the watch at the time .  good heavens  yes  as a matter of fact he was .  was he hanged and dismembered and buried in five graves .  and is he a distant ancestor of the current commander .  my word  the coincidences just pile up  don   t they .     his voice went from manic cheerfulness to a growl .     right .  that   s got that over with .  now   has anyone got any point they wish to make .      there was a general shifting of position and a group clearing of throats .      what about mercenaries .     said boggis .      the problem with mercenaries     said the patrician     is that they need to be paid to start fighting .  and  unless you are very lucky  you end up paying them even more to stop        selachii thumped the table .      very well  then  by jingo .     he snarled .     alone .         we could certainly do with one     said lord vetinari .     we need the money .  i was about to say that we cannot afford mercenaries .         how can this be .     said lord downey .     don   t we pay our taxes .         ah  i thought we might come to that     said lord vetinari .  he raised his hand and  on cue again  his clerk placed a piece of paper in it .      let me see now   ah yes .  guild of assassins   gross earnings in the last year  am            .  taxes paid in the last year  forty seven dollars  twenty two pence and what on examination turned out to be a hershebian half dong  worth one eighth of a penny .         that   s all perfectly legal .  the guild of accountants           ah yes .  guild of accountants  gross earnings am           .  taxes paid  nil .  but  ah yes  i see they applied for a rebate of am         .         and what we received  i may say  included a hershebian half dong     said mr .  frostrip of the guild of accountants .      what goes around comes around     said vetinari calmly .   he tossed the paper aside .     taxation  gentlemen  is very much like dairy farming .  the task is to extract the maximum amount of milk with the minimum of moo .  and i am afraid to say that these days all i get is moo .         are you telling us that ankh morpork is bankrupt .     said downey .      of course .  while  at the same time  full of rich people .  i trust they have been spending their good fortune on swords .         and you have allowed this wholesale tax avoidance .     said lord selachii .      oh  the taxes haven   t been avoided     said lord vetinari .     or even evaded .  they just haven   t been paid .         that is a disgusting state of affairs .      the patrician raised his eyebrows .     commander vimes .         yes  sir .         would you be so good as to assemble a squad of your most experienced men  liaise with the tax gatherers and obtain the accumulated back taxes  please .  my clerk here will give you a list of the prime defaulters .         right  sir .  and if they resist  sir .     said vimes  smiling nastily .      oh  how can they resist  commander .  this is the will of our civic leaders .     he took the paper his clerk proffered .     let me see  now .  top of the list        lord selachii coughed hurriedly .     far too late for that sort of nonsense now     he said .      water under the bridge     said lord downey .      dead and buried     said mr .  slant .      i paid mine     said vimes .      so let me recap  then     said vetinari .     i don   t think anyone wants to see two grown nations scrapping over a piece of rock .  we don   t want to fight  but           by jingo  if we do  we   ll show those       lord selachii began .      we have no ships .  we have no men .  we have no money  too     said lord vetinari .     of course  we have the art of diplomacy .  it is amazing what you can do with the right words .         unfortunately  the right words are more readily listened to if you also have a sharp stick     said lord downey .   lord selachii slapped the table .     we don   t have to talk to these people .  my lords   gentlemen   it   s up to us to show them we won   t be pushed around .  we must re form the regiments .         oh  private armies .     said vimes .     under the command of someone whose fitness for it lies in the fact that he can afford to pay for a thousand funny hats .      someone leaned forward  halfway along the table .  up to that moment vimes had thought he was asleep  and when lord rust spoke it was  indeed  in a sort of yawn .      whose fitness  mister vimes  lies in a thousand years of breeding for leadership     he said .   the    mister    twisted in vimes   s chest .  he knew he was a mister  would always be a mister  was probably a blueprint for mistership  but he   d be damned if he wouldn   t be sir samuel to someone who pronounced years as    hyahs .         ah  good breeding     he said .     no  sorry  don   t have any of that  if that   s what you need to get your own men killed by sheer           gentlemen  please     said the patrician .  he shook his head .     let   s have no fighting  please .  this is  after all  a council of war .  as for re forming the regiments  well  this is of course your ancient right .  the supplying of armed men in times of need is one of the duties of a gentleman .  history is on your side .  the precedents are clear enough  i can   t go against them .  i have to say i cannot afford to .         you   re going to let them play soldiers .     said vimes .      oh  commander vimes     said mr .  burleigh  smiling .     as a military man yourself  you must        sometimes people can attract attention by shouting .  they might opt for thumping a table  or even take a swing at someone else .  but vimes achieved the effect by freezing  by simply doing nothing .  the chill radiated off him .  lines in his face locked like a statue .      i am not a military man .      and then burleigh made the mistake of trying to grin disarmingly .      well  commander  the helmet and armor and everything   it   s really all the same in the end  isn   t it .         no .  it   s not .         gentlemen       lord vetinari put his hands flat on the table  a sign that the meeting had ended .     i can only repeat that tomorrow i shall be discussing the matter with prince khufurah           i   ve heard good reports of him     said lord rust .     strict but fair .  one can only admire what he   s doing in some of those backward regions .  a most           no  sir .  you are thinking of prince cadram     said lord vetinari .     khufurah is the younger brother .  he is arriving here as his brother   s special envoy .         him .  that one .  the man   s a wastrel .  a cheat .  a liar .  they say he takes bri           thank you for your diplomatic input  lord rust     said the patrician .     we must deal with facts as they are .  there is always a way .  our nations have many interests in common .  and of course it says a lot for the seriousness with which cadram is treating this matter that he is sending his own brother to deal with it .  it   s a nod toward the international community .         a klatchian bigwig is coming here .     said vimes .     no one told me .         strange as it may seem  sir samuel  i am occasionally capable of governing this city for minutes at a time without seeking your advice and guidance .         i meant there   s a lot of anti klatchian feeling around           a really greasy piece of work       lord rust whispered to mr .  boggis  in that special aristocratic whisper that carries to the rafters .     it   s an insult to send him here .         i am sure that you will see to it that the streets are safe to walk  vimes     said the patrician sharply .     i know you pride yourself on that sort of thing .  officially he   s here because the wizards have invited him to their big award ceremony .  an honorary doctorate  that sort of thing .  and one of their lunches afterward .  i do like negotiating with people after the faculty of unseen university have entertained them to lunch .  they tend not to move about much and they   ll agree to practically anything if they think there   s a chance of a stomach powder and a small glass of water .  and now  gentlemen   if you will excuse me        the lords and leaders departed in ones and twos  talking quietly as they walked out into the hall .   the patrician shuffled his papers into order  running a thin finger along each edge of the pile  and then looked up .      you appear to be casting a shadow  commander .         you   re not really going to allow them to re form the regiments  are you .     said vimes .      there is absolutely no law against it  vimes .  and it will keep them occupied .  every official gentleman is entitled  in fact i believe used to be required  to raise men when the city required it .  and  of course  any citizen has the right to bear arms .  bear that in mind  please .         arms is one thing .  holding weapons in    em and playing soldiers is another .     vimes put his knuckles on the table and leaned forward .      you see  sir     he said     i can   t help but think that over there in klatch a bunch of idiots are doing the same thing .  they   re saying to the seriph    it   s time to sort out those devils in ankh morpork  offendi .     and when a lot of people are running around with weapons and talking daft stuff about war  accidents happen .  have you ever been in a pub when everyone goes armed .  oh  things are a little polite at first  i   ll grant you  and then some twerp drinks out of the wrong mug or picks up someone else   s change by mistake and five minutes later you   re picking noses out of the beer nuts        the patrician looked down at vimes   s knuckles and stared fixedly until vimes removed them .      vimes  you will be at the wizards    convivium tomorrow .  i sent you a memo about it .         i never       a vision of the piles of unread paperwork on vimes   s desk loomed treacherously in his mind .     ah     he said .      the commander of the watch leads the procession in full dress uniform .  it   s an ancient custom .         me .  walk in front of everyone .         indeed .  very   civic .  as i   m sure you recall .  it demonstrates the friendly alliance between the university and the civil government which  i may say  seems to consist of their promising to do anything we ask provided we promise not to ask them to do anything .  anyway  it is your duty .  tradition decrees it .  and lady sybil has agreed to see to it that you are there with a crisp bright shining morning face .      vimes took a deep breath .     you asked my wife .         certainly .  she is very proud of you .  she believes you are capable of great things  vimes .  she must be a great comfort to you .         well  i   i mean  i   yes           excellent .  oh  just one other thing  vimes .  i do have the assassins and the thieves in agreement on this  but to cover all eventualities   i would consider it a favor if you could see to it that no one throws eggs or something at the prince .  that sort of thing always upsets people .         the two sides watched each other carefully .  they were old enemies .  they had tested strengths many a time  had tasted defeat and victory  had contested turf .  but this time it would go all the way .   knuckles whitened .  boots scraped impatiently .   captain carrot bounced the ball once or twice .      all right  lads  one more try  eh .  and this time  no horseplay .  william  what are you eating .      the artful nudger scowled .  no one knew his name .  kids he   d grown up with didn   t know his name .  his mother  if he ever found out who she was  probably didn   t know his name .  but carrot had found out somehow .  if anyone else had called him    william    they   d be looking for their ear .  in their mouth .      chewing gum  mister .         have you brought enough for everybody .         no  mister .         then put it away  there   s a good chap .  now  let   s   gavin  what   s that up your sleeve .      the one known as scumbag gav didn   t bother to argue .         s a knife  mr .  carrot .         and i bet you brought enough for everybody  eh .            sright  mister .     scumbag grinned .  he was ten .      go on  put them on the heap with the others        constable shoe looked over the wall in horror .  there were about fifty youths in the wide alleyway .  average age in years  about eleven .  average age in cynicism and malevolent evil  about     .  although ankh morpork football doesn   t usually have goals in the normal sense  two had been nevertheless made at each end of the alley using the time honored method of piling up things to mark where the posts would be .   two piles  one of knives  one of blunt instruments .   in the middle of the boys  who were wearing the colors of some of the nastier street gangs  captain carrot was bouncing an inflated pig   s bladder .   constable shoe wondered if he ought to go and get help  but the man seemed quite at ease .      er  captain .     he ventured .      oh  hello  reg .  we were just having a friendly game of football .  this is constable shoe  lads .      fifty pairs of eyes said  we   ll remember your face  copper .   reg edged around the wall and the eyes noted the arrow which had gone straight through his breastplate and protruded several inches from his back .      there   s been a bit of trouble  sir     said reg .     i thought i   d better fetch you .  it   s a hostage situation           i   ll come right away .  okay  lads  sorry about this .  play amongst yourselves  will you .  and i hope i   ll see you all on tuesday for the sing song and sausage sizzle .         yeah  mister     said the artful nudger .      and corporal angua will see if she can teach you the campfire howl .         yeah  right     said scumbag .      but what do we do before we part .     said carrot expectantly .   the bloods of the skats and the mohocks looked bashfully at one another .  usually they were nervous of nothing  it being a banishment matter to show fear in any circumstances .  but when they   d variously drawn up the clan rules  no one had ever thought there   d be someone like carrot .   glaring at one another with i   ll kill you if you ever mention this expressions  they all raised the index fingers of both hands to the level of their ears and chorused     wib wib wib .         wob wob wob     carrot replied heartily .     okay  reg  let   s go .         how   d you do that  captain .     said constable shoe  as the watchmen hurried off .      oh  you just raise both fingers like this     said carrot .     but i   d be obliged if you don   t tell anyone  because it   s meant to be a secret sig           but they   re thugs  captain .  young killers .  villains .         oh  they   re a bit cheeky  but nice enough boys underneath  when you take the time to understand           i heard they never give anyone enough time to understand .  does mr .  vimes know you   re doing this .         he sort of knows  yes .  i said i   d like to start a club for the street kids and he said it was fine provided i took them camping on the edge of some really sheer cliff somewhere in a high wind .  but he always says things like that .  and i   m sure we wouldn   t have him any other way .  now  where are these hostages .         it   s at vortin   s again  captain .  but it   s   sort of worse than that        behind them  the skats and the mohocks looked at one another warily .  then they picked up their weapons and edged away with care .  it   s not that we don   t want to fight  their manner said .  it   s just that we   ve got better things to do right now  and so we   re going to go away and find out what they are .      unusually for the docks  there was not a great deal of shouting and general conversation .  people were too busy thinking about money .   sergeant colon and corporal nobbs leaned against a stack of timber and watched a man very carefully painting the name pride of ankh morpork on the prow of a ship .  at some point he   d realize that he   d left out the    e     and they were idly looking forward to this modest entertainment .      you ever been to sea  sarge .     said nobby .      hah  not me .     said the sergeant .     don   t go flogging the oggin  lad .         i don   t     said nobby .     i have never flogged any oggin .  never in my entire life have i flogged oggin .         right .         i   ve always been very clean in that respect .         except you don   t know what flogging the oggin means  do you .         no  sarge .         it means going to sea .  you can   t bloody trust the sea .  when i was a little lad i had this book about this little kid  he turned into a mermaid  sort of thing  and he lived down the bottom of the sea              the oggin           right  and it was all nice talking fishes and pink seashells and stuff  and then i went on my holidays to quirm and i saw the sea  and i thought  here goes  and if our ma hadn   t been quick on her feet i don   t know what would have happened .  i mean  the kid in the book could breathe under the sea  so how was i to know .  it   s all bloody lies about the sea .  it   s just all yuk with lobsters in it .         my mum   s uncle was a sailor     said nobby .     but after the big plague he got press ganged .  bunch of farmers got him drunk  he woke up next morning tied to a plough .      they lounged some more .      looks like we   re going to be in a fight  sarge     said nobby  as the painter very carefully started on the final    k .         won   t last long .  lot of cowards  the klatchians     said colon .     the moment they taste a bit of cold steel they   re legging it away over the sand .      sergeant colon had had a broad education .  he   d been to the school of my dad always said  the college of it stands to reason  and was now a postgraduate student at the university of what some bloke in the pub told me .      shouldn   t be any trouble to sort out  then .     said nobby .      and o   course  they   re not the same color as what we are     said colon .     well   as me  anyway     he added  in view of the various hues of corporal nobbs .  there was probably no one alive who was the same color as corporal nobbs .      constable visit   s pretty brown     said nobby .     i never seen him run away .  if there   s a chance of giving someone a religious pamphlet ole washpot   s after them like a terrier .         ah  but omnians are more like us     said colon .     bit weird but  basic   ly  just the same as us underneath .  no  the way you can tell a klatchian is  you look an    see if he uses a lot of words beginning with    al     right .     cos that   s a dead giveaway .  they invented all the words starting with    al .     that   s how you can tell they   re klatchian .  like al cohol  see .         they invented beer .         yeah .         that   s clever .         i wouldn   t call it clever     said sergeant colon  realizing too late that he   d made a tactical error .     more  luck  i   d say .         what else did they do .         well  there   s       colon racked his brains .     there   s al gebra .  that   s like sums with letters .  for   for people whose brains aren   t clever enough for numbers  see .         is that a fact .         right     said colon .     in fact     he went on  a little more assertively now he could see a way ahead     i heard this wizard down the university say that the klatchians invented nothing .  that was their great contribution to maffs  he said .  i said    what .     an    he said  they come up with zero .         dun   t sound that clever to me     said nobby .     anyone could invent nothing .  i ain   t invented anything .         my point exactly     said colon .     i told him  it was people who invented numbers like four and  and              seven              right  who were the geniuses .  nothing didn   t need inventing .  it was just there .  they probably just found it .         it   s having all that desert     said nobby .      right .  good point .  desert .  which  as everyone knows  is basically nothing .  nothing   s a natural resource to them .  it stands to reason .  whereas we   re more civilized  see  and we got a lot more stuff around to count  so we invented numbers .  it   s like   well  they say the klatchians invented astronomy           al tronomy     said nobby helpfully .      no  no   no  nobby  i reckon they   d discovered esses by then  probably nicked    em off   f us   anyway  they were bound to invent astronomy     cos there   s bugger all else for them to look at but the sky .  anyone can look at the stars and give    em names .     s going it a bit to call it inventing  in any case .  we don   t go around saying we   ve invented something just because we had a quick dekko at it .         i heard where they   ve got a lot of odd gods     said nobby .      yeah  and mad priests     said colon .     foaming at the mouth  half of    em .  believe all kinds of loony things .      they watched the painter in silence for a moment .  colon was dreading the question that came .      so how exactly are they different from ours  then .     said nobby .     i mean  some of our priests are           i hope you ain   t being unpatriotic     said colon severely .      no  of course not .  i was just asking .  i can see where they   d be a lot worse than ours  being foreign and everything .         and of course they   re all mad for fighting     said colon .     vicious buggers with all those curvy swords of theirs .         you mean  like   they viciously attack you while cowardly running away after tasting cold steel .     said nobby  who sometimes had a treacherously good memory for detail .      you can   t trust    em  like i said .  and they burp hugely after meals .         well   so do you  sarge .         yes  but i don   t pretend it   s polite  nobby .         well  it   s certainly a good job there   s you around to explain things  sarge     said nobby .     it   s amazing the stuff you know .         i surprise myself  sometimes     said colon modestly .   the painter of the ship leaned back to admire his work .  they heard him give a heartfelt little groan  and both of them nodded in satisfaction .      hostage negotiations were always tricky  carrot had learned .  it paid not to rush things .  let the other man talk when he was ready .   so he was whiling away the time sitting behind the upturned cart they were using as a shield from the occasional random arrow and writing his letter home .  the exercise was carried out with much frowning  sucking of the pencil and what commander vimes called a ballistic approach to spelling and punctuation .       dere mum and dade   i hope this letter finds you in good health as i am also .  thank you for the big parcel of dwarf bread you sent me i have sharred it with the other dwarfs on the watch and they say it is better even than ironcrufts     t    bread wi    t    edge     and you carn   t beat the taste of a home forged loaf  so well done mum .   things are going well with the wolf pack that i have told you about but cmdr .  vimes is not happy  i told him they were good lads at heart and it would help them to learn the ways of natchure and the wilderness and he said hah they know them already that is the trouble .  but he gave me    to buy a football which proves he cares deep down .   we have more new faeces in the watch which is just as well with this truble with klatch  it is all looking very grave  i feel it is the clam before the storm and no mistake .   i must brake off now because some robbers have broke into vortin   s dimond warehouse and have taken corporal angua hostage .  i fear there may be terrible bloodshed so    i remain    yr .  loving son    carrot ironfoundersson  captain       ps i will write again tomorrow    carrot folded the letter carefully and slipped it under his breastplate .      i think they have had long enough to consider our suggestion  constable .  what   s next on the list .      constable shoe leafed through a file of grubby paper and pulled out another sheet .      well  we   re down to offenses of stealing pennies off blind beggars now     he said .     oh  no  this is a good one        carrot took the sheet in one hand and a megaphone in the other and raised his head carefully over the edge of the cart .      good morning again .     he said brightly .     we   ve found another one .  theft of jewelery from           yes .  yes .  we did it .     shouted a voice from the building .      really .  i haven   t even said when it was yet     said carrot .      never mind  we did it .  now can we come out  please .     there was another sound behind the voice .  it sounded like a low  continuous growl .      i think you ought to be able to tell me what you stole     said carrot .      er   rings .  gold rings .         sorry  no rings mentioned .         pearl necklace .  yes  that   s what           getting warmer  but no .         earrings .         ooo  you   re so close     said carrot encouragingly .      a crown  was it .  maybe a coronet .      carrot leaned down to the constable .     says here a tiara  reg  can we let    .     he stood up .     we   re prepared to accept    coronet .     well done .      he looked down at constable shoe again .      this is all right  isn   t it  reg .  it   s not coercion  is it .         can   t see how it can be  captain .  i mean  they broke in  they took a hostage           i suppose you   re right           please .  no .  good boy .  down .         seems to be about it  sir     said reg shoe  peering around the edge of the cart .     we   ve got them down for everything but the hide park flasher           we did that .     screamed someone .         and that was a woman           we did it .     this time the voice was a lot higher .     now please can we come out .      carrot stood up and raised the megaphone .     if you gentlemen would care to step out with your hands up .         are you joking .     whimpered someone  against the background of another growl .      well  at least with your hands where i can see them .         you bet  mister .      four men stumbled out into the street .  their torn clothing fluttered in the breeze .  the apparent leader pointed an angry finger back at the doorway as carrot walked toward them .      the owner of that place ought to be prosecuted .     he shouted .     keeping a wild animal like that in his strongroom  it   s disgraceful .  we broke in perfectly peacefully and it just attacked us for no reason at all .         you shot at constable shoe here     said carrot .      only to miss .  only to miss .      constable shoe pointed at the arrow sticking into his breastplate .      right where it shows .     he complained .     it   s a welding job and we have to pay for our own armor repairs and there   ll always be a mark  you know  no matter what i do .      their horrified gaze took in the stitch marks around his neck and on his hands  and it dawned on them that although the human race came in a variety of colors  very few living people were gray with a hint of green .      here  you   re a zombie .         that   s right  kick a man when he   s dead     said constable shoe sharply .      and you took corporal angua hostage .  a lady     said carrot  in the same level voice .  it was very polite .  but it simply suggested that somewhere a fuse was burning  and it would be a good idea not to wait for it to reach the barrel .      yes   sort of   but she must   ve got away when that creature turned up           so you left her in there .     said carrot  still very calm .   the men dropped to their knees .  the leader raised his hand imploringly .      please .  we   re just robbers and thieves .  we   re not bad men .      carrot nodded to constable shoe .     take them down to the yard  constable .         right .     said reg .  there was a mean look in his eye as he cocked his crossbow .     i   m down ten dollars thanks to you .  so you   d better not try to escape .         no  sir .  not us .      carrot wandered into the gloom of the building .  fearful faces peered out of doorways .  he gave them a reassuring smile as he walked toward the strongroom .   corporal angua was adjusting her uniform .      i didn   t bite anyone  before you start     she said  as he appeared in the doorway .     not even flesh wounds .  i just tore at their trousers .  and that was no bed of roses  i might add .      a frightened face appeared round the door .      ah  mr .  vortin     said carrot .     i think you will find that all is in order .  they seem to have dropped everything .      the diamond merchant looked at him in amazement .      but they had a hostage           they saw the error of their ways     said carrot .      and   and there were snarling noises   sounded like a wolf           ah  yes     said carrot .     well  you know  when thieves fall out       which was no kind of explanation  but because the tone of voice suggested that it was  mr .  vortin accepted it as such for fully five minutes after carrot and angua had left .      well  that   s a nice start to the day     said carrot .      thank you  yes  i wasn   t hurt     said angua .      it makes it all seem worthwhile  somehow .         just my hair messed up and another shirt ruined .         well done .         sometimes i might suspect that you don   t listen to anything i say     said angua .      glad to hear it     said carrot .      the entire watch was mustering .  vimes looked down at the sea of faces .   my gods  he thought .  how many have we got now .  a few years ago you could count the watch on the fingers of a blind butcher   s hand  and now     there   s more coming in .   he leaned sideways to captain carrot .     who   re all these people .         watchmen  sir .  you appointed them .         did i .  i haven   t even met some of them .         you signed the paperwork  sir .  and you sign the wage bill every month .  eventually .      there was a hint of criticism in his voice .  vimes   s approach to paperwork was not to touch it until someone was shouting  and then at least there would be someone to help him sort through the stacks .      but how did they join .         usual way  sir .  swore them in  gave them each a helmet           hey  that   s reg shoe .  he   s a zombie .  he falls to bits all the time .         very big man in the undead community  sir     said carrot .      how come he joined .         he came round last week to complain about the watch harassing some bogeymen  sir .  he was very  er  vehement  sir .  so i persuaded him that what the watch needed was some expertise  and so he joined up  sir .         no more complaints .         twice as many  sir .  all from undead  sir  and all against mr .  shoe .  funny  that .      vimes gave his captain a sideways look .      he   s very hurt about it  sir .  he says he   s found that the undead just don   t understand the difficulties of policing in a multi vital society  sir .      good gods  thought vimes  that   s just what i would have done .  but i   d have done it because i   m not a nice person .  carrot is a nice person  he   s practically got medals for it  surely he wouldn   t have     and he knew that he would never know .  somewhere behind carrot   s innocent stare was a steel door .      you enrolled him  did you .         nossir .  you did  sir .  you signed his joining orders and his kit chitty and his posting orders  sir .      vimes had another vision of too many documents  hurriedly signed .  but he must have signed them and they needed the men  true enough .  it was just that it ought to be him who        and anyone of sergeant rank or above can recruit  sir     said carrot  as if reading his mind .     it   s in the general orders .  page twenty two  sir .  just below the tea stain .         and you   ve recruited   how many .         oh  just one or two .  we   re still very shorthanded  sir .         we are with reg .  his arms keep falling off .         aren   t you going to talk to the men  sir .      vimes looked at the assembled   well  multitude .  there was no other word .  well  there were plenty  but none that it would be fair to use .   big ones  short ones  fat ones  troll ones with the lichen still on  bearded dwarf ones  the looming pottery presence of the golem constable dorfl  undead ones   and even now he wasn   t certain if that term should include corporal angua  an intelligent girl and a very useful wolf when she had to be .  waifs and strays  colon had said once .  waifs and bloody strays  because normal people wouldn   t be coppers .   technically they were all in uniform  too  except that mostly they weren   t wearing the same uniform as anyone else .  everyone had just been sent down to the armory to collect whatever fitted  and the result was a walking historical exhibit  funny shaped helmets through the ages .      er   ladies and gentlemen       he began .      be quiet  please  and listen to commander vimes .     bellowed carrot .   vimes found himself meeting the gaze of angua  who was leaning against the wall .  she rolled her eyes helplessly .      yes  yes  thank you  captain     said vimes .  he turned back to the massed array of ankh morpork   s finest .  he opened his mouth .  he stared .  and then he shut his mouth  all but a corner of it .  and said out of that corner     what   s that little lump on constable flint   s head .         that   s probationary constable buggy swires  sir .  he likes to get a good view .         he   s a gnome .         well done  sir .         another one of yours .         ours  sir     said carrot  using his reproachful voice again .     yes  sir .  attached to the chitterling street station since last week  sir .         oh my gods       murmured vimes .   buggy swires saw his stare and saluted .  he was five inches tall .   vimes regathered his mental balance .  the long and the short and the tall   waifs and strays  all of us .      i   m not going to keep you long     he said .     you all know me   well  most of you know me     he added  with a sidelong glance at carrot     and i don   t make speeches .  but i   m sure all of you have noticed the way this leshp business has got people all stirred up .  there   s a lot of loose talk about war .  well  war isn   t our business .  war is soldiers    business .  our business  i think  is to keep the peace .  let me show you this        he stood back and pulled something out of his pocket with a flourish .  at least  that was the intention .  there was a rip as something ceased to be entangled in the lining .      damn   ah        he produced a length of shiny black wood from the ragged pocket .  there was a large silver knob on the end .  the watchmen craned to look .      this   er   this       vimes groped .     this old man turned up from the palace a couple of weeks ago .  gave me this damn thing .  got a label saying    regalia of the watch commandr .   citie of ankh morporke .     you know they never throw anything away up at the palace .      he waved it vaguely .  the wood was surprisingly heavy .      it   s got the coat of arms on the knob  look .     thirty watchmen tried to see .      and i thought   i thought  good grief  this is what i   m supposed to carry .  and i thought about it  and then i thought  no  that   s right  just once someone got it right .  it   s not even a weapon  it   s just a thing .  it ain   t for using  it   s just for having .  that   s what it   s all about .  same thing with uniforms .  you see  a soldier   s uniform  it   s to turn him into part of a crowd of other parts all in the same uniform  but a copper   s uniform is there to        vimes stopped .  perplexed expressions in front of him told him that he was building a house of cards with too few cards on the bottom .   he coughed .      anyway     he went on  with a glare to indicate that everyone should forget the previous twenty seconds     our job is to stop people fighting .  there   s a lot happening on the street .  you   ve probably heard that they   re starting up the regiments again .  well  people can recruit if they like .  but we   re not going to have any mobs .  there   s a nasty mood around .  i don   t know what   s going to happen  but we   ve got to be there when it does .     he looked around the room .     another thing .  this new klatchian envoy or whatever he   s called is arriving tomorrow .  i don   t think the assassins    guild has anything planned but tonight we   re going to check the route the wizards    procession will be taking .  a nice little job for the night shift .  and tonight we   re all on the night shift .      there was a groan from the watch .      as my old sergeant used to say  if you can   t take a joke you shouldn   t have joined     said vimes .     a nice gentle door to door inspection  shaking hands with doorknobs  giving the uniform a bit of an airing .  good old fashioned policing .  any questions .  good .  thank you very much .      there was a general rustling and relaxing among the squad as it dawned on them that they were free to go .   carrot started to clap .   it wasn   t the clap used by middlings to encourage underlings to applaud overlings .   it had genuine enthusiasm behind it which was  somehow  worse .  a couple of the more impressionable new constables picked it up and then  in the same way that little pebbles lead the avalanche  the sound of humanoids banging their hands together filled the room .   vimes glowered .      very inspiring  sir .     said carrot  as the clapping rose to a storm .      rain poured on ankh morpork .  it filled the gutters and overflowed and was then flung away by the wind .  it tasted of salt .   the gargoyles had crept out of their daytime shadows and were perched on every cornice and tower  ears and wings outstretched to sieve anything edible out of the water .  it was amazing what could fall on ankh morpork .  rains of small fish and frogs were common enough  although bedsteads caused comment .   a broken gutter poured a sheet of water down the window of ossie brunt  who was sitting on his bed because there were no chairs or  indeed  any other furniture .  he didn   t mind at the moment .  in a minute or two he might be very angry .  and  then again  possibly not .   it was not that ossie was insane in any way .  friends would have called him a quiet sort who kept himself to himself  but they didn   t because he didn   t have any friends .  there was a group of men who went to practice at the archery butts on tuesday nights  and he sometimes went to a pub with them afterward and sat and listened to them talk  and he   d saved up once and bought a round of drinks  although they probably wouldn   t remember or maybe they   d say     oh   yeah   ossie .     people said that .  people tended to put him out of their minds  in the same way that you didn   t pay much attention to empty space .   he wasn   t stupid .  he thought a lot about things .  sometimes he   d sit and think for hours  just staring at the opposite wall where the rain came in on damp nights and made a map of klatch .   someone hammered on the door .     mr .  brunt .  are you decent .         i   m a bit busy  mrs .  spent     he said  putting his bow under the bed with his magazines .      it   s about the rent .             yes  mrs .  spent .         you know my rules .         i shall pay you tomorrow  mrs .  spent     said ossie  looking toward the window .      cash in my hand by noon or it   s out you go .         yes  mrs .  spent .      he heard her stamp downstairs again .   he counted to fifty  very carefully  and then reached down and pulled out his bow again .      angua was on patrol with nobby nobbs .  this was not an ideal arrangement  but carrot was on swing patrol and on a night like this fred colon  who kept the roster  had an uncanny knack of being on desk duty in the warm .  so the spare partners had been thrown together .  it was a terrible thought .      can i have a word  miss .     said nobby  as they rattled doorknobs and waved their lanterns into alleyways .      yes  nobby .         it   s pers   nal .         oh .         only i   d ask fred  but he wouldn   t understand  and i fink you would understand on account of you being a woman .  most of the time  anyway .  no offense meant .         what do you want  nobby .         it   s about my   sexual nature  miss .      angua said nothing .  rain banged off nobby   s illfitting helmet .      i think it   s time i looked it full in the face  miss .      angua cursed her graphic imagination again .      and  er   how were you thinking of doing that  nobby .         i mean  i sent off for stuff  miss .  creams an    that .         creams     said angua flatly .      that you rub on     said nobby helpfully .      rub on .         and a thing you do exercises with           oh gods           sorry  miss .         what .  oh   i was just thinking of something else .  do go on .  exercises .         yeah .  to build up my biceps and that .         oh  exercises .  really .     nobby did not appear to have any biceps to speak of .  there wasn   t really anything for them to be on .  technically he had arms  because his hands were attached to his shoulders  but that was about all you could say .   horrified interest got the better of her .      why  nobby .      he looked down  sheepishly .      well   i mean   you know   girls an    that        to her amazement  nobby was blushing .      you mean you       she began .     you want to   you   re looking for           oh  i   m not just after   i mean  if you want a thing done properly then   i mean  no     said nobby reproachfully .     what i   m saying is  as you get older  you know  you think about settlin    down  findin    someone who   ll go with you hand in hand down life   s bumpy highway   why   s your mouth open .      angua shut it abruptly .      but i just don   t seem to meet girls     nobby said .     well  i mean  i meet girls  and then they rush off .         despite the cream .         right .         and the exercises .         yes .         well  you   ve covered all the angles  i can see that     said angua .     beats me where you   re going wrong .     she sighed .     what about stamina thrum  in elm street .         she   s got a wooden leg .         well  then   verity pushpram  nice girl  she runs the clam and cockle barrow in rime street .         hammerhead .  stinks of fish all the time .  and she   s got a squint .         she   s got her own business  though .  does wonderful chowder  too .         and a squint .         not exactly a squint  nobby .         yes  but you know what i mean .      angua had to admit that she did .  verity had the opposite of a squint .  both eyes appeared to be endeavoring to see the adjacent ear .  when you talked to her  you had to suppress a feeling that she was about to walk off in two directions .  but she could gut fish like a champion .   she sighed again .  she was familiar with the syndrome .  they said they wanted a soulmate and helpmeet but sooner or later the list would include a skin like silk and a chest fit for a herd of cows .   except for carrot .  that was almost   almost one of the annoying things about him .  she suspected he wouldn   t mind if she shaved her head or grew a beard .  it wasn   t that he wouldn   t notice  he just wouldn   t mind  and for some reason that was very aggravating .      the only thing i can suggest     she said     is that women are quite often attracted to men who can make them laugh .      nobby brightened .     really .     he said .     i ought to be well in there  then .         good .         people laugh at me all the time .      high above  quite oblivious of the rain that had already soaked him to the skin  ossie brunt checked the oilskin cover round his bow and settled down for the long wait .      rain was a copper   s friend .  tonight people were making do with indoor crime .   vimes stood in the lee of one of the fountains in sator square .  the fountain hadn   t worked for years  but he was getting just as wet as if it were in full flow .  he   d never experienced truly horizontal rain before .   there was no one around .  the rain marched across the square like   like an army     now there was an image from his youth .  funny how they hung around in the dark alleys of your brain and suddenly jumped out on you .   rain falling on water     ah  yes   when he was a little lad he   d pretended that the raindrops splashing in the running gutters were soldiers .  millions of soldiers .  and the bubbles that sometimes went floating by were men on horseback .   right now he couldn   t remember what the occasional dead dog had been .  some kind of siege weapon  possibly .   water swirled around his boots and dripped off his cape .  when he tried to light a cigar the wind blew the match out and the rain poured off his helmet and soaked the cigar in any case .   he grinned in the night .   he was  temporarily  a happy man .  he was cold  wet and alone  trying to keep out of the worst of the weather at three o   clock on a ferocious morning .  he   d spent some of the best nights of his life like this .  at such times you could just   sort of hunch your shoulders like this and let your head pull in like this and you became a little hutch of warmth and peace  the rain banging on your helmet  the mind just ticking over  sorting out the world     it was like this in the old days  when no one cared about the watch and all you really had to do was keep out of trouble .  those were the days when there wasn   t as much to do .   but there was as much to do  said an inner voice .  you just didn   t do it .   he could feel the official truncheon hanging heavily in the special pocket that sybil herself had sewn in his breeches .  why is it just a bit of wood .  he   d asked himself when he   d unwrapped it .  why not a sword .  that   s the symbol of power .  and then he   d realized why it couldn   t ever be a sword        ho there  good citizen .  may i ask your business this brisk morning .      he sighed .  there was a lantern appearing through the murk  surrounded by a halo of water .   ho there  good citizen   there was only one person in the city who would say something like that and mean it .      it   s me  captain .      the halo drew nearer and illuminated the damp face of captain carrot .  the young man ripped off a salute   at godsdamn three in the morning  vimes thought   that would have brought a happy tear to the eye of the most psychotic drill sergeant .      what   re you doing out  sir .         i just wanted to   check up on things     said vimes .      you could have left it all to me  sir     said carrot .     delegation is the key to successful command .         really .  is it .     said vimes sourly .     my word  we live and learn  don   t we .     and you certainly learn  he added in the privacy of his head .  and he was almost sure he was being mean and stupid .      we   ve just about finished  sir .  we   ve checked all the empty buildings .  and there will be an extra squad of constables on the route .  and the gargoyles will be up as high as they can .  you know how good they are at watching  sir .         gargoyles .  i thought we just had constable downspout           and constable pediment now  sir .         one of yours .         one of ours  sir .  you signed           yes  yes  i   m sure i did .  damn .      a gust of wind caught the water pouring from an overloaded gutter and dumped it down vimes   s neck .      they say this new island   s upset the air streams     said carrot .      not just the air     said vimes .     a lot of damn fuss over a few square miles of silt and some old ruins .  who cares .         they say it   s strategically very important     said carrot  falling into step beside him .      what for .  we   re not at war with anyone .  hah .  but we might go to war to keep some damn island that   s only useful in case we have to go to war  right .         oh  his lordship will have it all sorted out today .  i   m sure that when moderate mannered men of goodwill can get round a table there   s no problem that can   t be resolved     said carrot cheerfully .   he is  thought vimes glumly .  he really is sure .     know much about klatch .     he said .      i   ve read a little  sir .         very sandy place  they say .         yes  sir .  apparently .      there was a crash somewhere ahead of them  and a scream .  coppers learned to be good at screams .  there was to the connoisseur a world of difference between    i   m drunk and i   ve just trodden on my fingers and i can   t get up .     and    look out .  he   s got a knife .      both men started to run .   light blazed out in a narrow street .  heavy footsteps vanished into the darkness .   the light flickered beyond a shop   s broken window .  vimes stumbled through the doorway  pulled off his sodden cape and threw it over the fire in the middle of the floor .   there was a hiss  and a smell of hot leather .   then vimes stood back and tried to work out where the hell he was .   people were staring at him .  dimly  his mind assembled clues  the turban  the beard  the woman   s jewelry        where did he come from .  who is this man .         er   good morning .     he said .     looks like there   s been a bit of an accident .     he raised the cape gingerly .   a broken bottle lay in a pool of sizzling oil .   vimes looked up at the broken window .     oh        the other two people were a boy almost as tall as his father and a small girl trying to hide behind her mother .   vimes felt his stomach turn to lead .   carrot arrived in the doorway .      i lost them     he panted .     there were three of them  i think can   t see anything in this rain   oh  it   s you  mr .  goriff .  what happened here .         captain carrot .  someone threw a burning bottle through our window and then this beggar man rushed in and put it out .         what   d he say .  what did you say .     said vimes .     you speak klatchian .         not very well     said carrot modestly .     i just can   t get the back of the throat sound to           but   you can understand what he said .         oh  yes .  he just thanked you very much  by the way .  it   s all right  mr .  goriff .  he   s a watchman .         but you speak        carrot knelt down and looked at the broken bottle .      oh  you know how it is .  you come in here on night shift for a hot caraway bun and you just get chatting .  you must have picked up the odd word  sir .         well   vindaloo  maybe  but           this is a firebomb  sir .         i know  captain .         this is very bad .  who would do a thing like this .         right now .     said vimes .     half the city  i should think .      he looked helplessly at goriff .  he vaguely recognized the face .  he vaguely recognized mrs .  goriff   s face .  they were   faces .  they were usually at the other end of some arms holding a portion of curry or a kebab .  sometimes the boy ran the place .  the shop opened very early in the morning and very late at night  when the streets were owned by bakers  thieves and watchmen .   vimes knew the place as mundane meals .  nobby nobbs had said that goriff had wanted a word that meant ordinary  everyday  straightforward  and had asked around until he found one he liked the sound of .      er   tell him   tell him you   re staying here  and i   ll go back to the watch house and send someone out to relieve you     said vimes .      thank you     said goriff .      oh  you underst       vimes felt like an idiot .     of course you do  you must have been here  what  five  six years .         ten years  sir .         really .     said vimes manically .     that long .  really .  my word   well  i   d better get along   good morning to you        he hurried out into the rain .   i must have been going in there for years  he thought  as he splashed through the darkness .  and i know how to say    vindaloo .     and      korma       .  carrot   s hardly been here five minutes and he gargles the language like a native .   good grief  i can get by in dwarfish and i can at least say     put down that rock  you   re under arrest     in troll  but     he stamped into the watch house  water pooling off him .  fred colon was dozing quietly at the desk .  in deference to the fact that he   d known fred all these years  vimes was extra noisy about taking off his cape .   when he officially turned round  the sergeant was sitting at attention .      i didn   t know you were on tonight  mr .  vimes           this is unofficial  fred     said vimes .  he accepted    mr .     from certain people .  in an odd way  they   d earned it .     send someone along to mundane meals in scandal alley  will you .  a bit of trouble there .      he reached the stairs .      you stopping  sir .     said fred .      oh  yes     said vimes grimly .     i   ve got to catch up on the paperwork .         the rain fell on leshp so hard it probably hadn   t been worth the island   s bother of rising from the bottom of the sea .   most of the explorers slept in their boats now .  there were buildings on the risen island  but        the buildings weren   t quite right .   solid jackson peered out from the tarpaulin he   d rigged up on deck .  mist was rising off the soaking ground and was made luminous by the occasional flash of lightning .   the city  by storm light  looked far too malevolent .  there were things he could recognize   columns and steps and archways and so on   but there were others   he shuddered .  it looked as if people had once tried to add human touches to structures that were already ancient     it was because of his son that everyone was staying in the boats .   a party of ankh morpork fishermen had gone ashore that morning to search for the heaps of treasure that everyone knew littered the ocean bottom and had found a tiled floor  washed clean by the rain .  pretty blue and white squares showed a pattern of waves and shells and  in the middle  a squid .   and les had said     that looks pretty big  dad .      and everyone had looked around at the weed covered buildings and had shared the thought  which remained unspoken but was made up of a lot of little thoughts like the occasional ripples in the pools  and the little splashes in the dark water of cellars that made the mind think of claws  winnowing the deeps  and the odd things that sometimes got washed up on beaches or turned up in nets .  sometimes you pulled things over the side that   d put a man off fish for life .   and suddenly no one wanted to explore any more  just in case they found something .   solid jackson pulled his head back under the cover .      why   n   t we going home  dad .     said his son .     you said this place gives you the willies .         all right  but they   re ankh morpork willies  see .  and no foreigner   s going to get his hands on them .         dad .         yes  lad .         who was mr .  hong .         how should i know .         only  when we was all heading back for the boats one of the other men said     we all know what happened to mr .  hong when he opened the three jolly luck take away fish bar on the site of the old fish god temple in dagon street on the night of the full moon  don   t we    .     well  i don   t know .         ah       solid jackson hesitated .  still  les was a big lad now        he   closed up and left in a bit of a hurry  lad .  so quick he had to leave some things behind .         like what .         if you must know   half an earhole and one kidney .         cool .      the boat rocked  and wood splintered .  jackson jerked the cover up .  spray washed over him .  somewhere close in the wet darkness a voice shouted     why you not carrying lights  you second cousin of a jackal .      jackson pulled out the lantern and held it up .      what   re you doing in ankh morpork territorial waters  you camel eating devil .         these waters belong to us .         we were here first .         yeah .  we were here first .         we were here first first .         you damaged my boat .  that   s piracy  that is .      there were other shouts around them .  in the darkness the two flotillas had collided .  bowsprits tore away rigging .  hulls boomed .  the controlled panic that is normal sailing became the frantic panic composed of darkness  spray and too much rigging coming unrigged .   at times like this the ancient traditions of the sea that unite all mariners should come to the fore and see them combine in the face of their common foe  the hungry and relentless ocean .   however  at this point mr .  arif hit mr .  jackson over the head with an oar .         hnh .  wuh .      vimes opened the only eye that appeared to respond .  a horrible sight met it .      i read him his rites  whereupon  he said up  yours copper .  sgnt detritus then  cautioned him  upon which he said  ouch     there may be a lot of things i   m not good at  thought vimes  but at least i don   t treat the punctuation of a sentence like a game of pin the tail on the donkey     he rolled his head away from carrot   s fractured grammar .  the pile of paper shifted under him .   vimes   s desk was becoming famous .  once there were piles  but they had slipped as piles do  forming this dense compacted layer that was now turning into something like peat .  it was said there were plates and unfinished meals somewhere down there .  no one wanted to check .  some people said they   d heard movement .   there was a genteel cough .  vimes rolled his head again and looked up into the big pink face of willikins  lady sybil   s butler .  his butler  too  technically  although vimes hated to think of him like that .      i think we had better proceed with alacrity  sir samuel .  i have brought your dress uniform  and your shaving things are by the basin .         what .  what .         you are due at the university in half an hour .  lady sybil has vouchsafed to me that if you are not there she will utilize your intestines for hosiery accessories  sir .         was she smiling .     said vimes  staggering to his feet and making his way to the steaming basin on the washstand .      only slightly  sir .         oh gods           yes  sir .      vimes made an attempt at shaving while  behind him  willikins brushed and polished .  outside  the city   s clocks began to strike ten .   it must   ve been almost four when i sat down  vimes thought .  i know i heard the shift change at eight  and then i had to sort out nobby   s expenses  that   s advanced mathematics if ever there was some     he tried to yawn and shave at the same time  which is never a good idea .      damn .         i shall fetch some tissue paper directly  sir     said willikins  without looking round .  as vimes dabbed at his chin  the butler went on     i should like to take this opportunity to raise a matter of some import  sir           yes .     vimes stared blearily at the red tights that seemed to be a major item of his dress uniform .      regretfully  i am afraid i must ask leave to give in my notice  sir .  i wish to join the colors .         which colors are these  willikins .     said vimes  holding up a shirt with puffed sleeves .  then his brain caught up with his ears .     you want to become a soldier .         they say klatch needs to be taught a sharp lesson  sir .  a willikins has never been found wanting when his country calls .  i thought that lord venturi   s heavy infantry would do for me .  they have a particularly attractive uniform of red and white  sir .  with gold frogging .      vimes pulled his boots on .     you   ve had military experience  have you .         oh  no  sir .  but i am a quick learner  sir  and i believe i have some prowess with the carving knife .     the butler   s face showed a patriotic alertness .      on turkeys and so on       said vimes .      yes  sir     said willikins  buffing up the ceremonial helmet .      and you   re off to fight the screaming hordes in klatch  are you .         if it should come to that  sir     said willikins .     i think this is adequately polished now  sir .         a very sandy place  so they say .         indeed  sir     said willikins  adjusting the helmet under vimes   s chin .      and rocky .  very rocky .  lots of rocks .  dusty  too .         very parched in parts  sir  i believe you are correct .         and so into this land of sand colored dust and sand colored rocks and sand colored sand you  willikins  will march with your expertise in cutlery and your red and white uniform .         with the gold frogging  sir .     willikins thrust out his jaw .     yes  sir .  if the need arises .         you don   t see anything wrong with this picture .         sir .         oh  never mind .     vimes yawned .     well  we shall miss you  willikins .     others may not  he thought .  especially if they have time for a second shot .      oh  lord venturi says it   ll all be over by hogswatch  sir .         really .  i didn   t know it had started .         vimes ran down the stairs and into a smell of curry .      we saved you some  sir     said sergeant colon .     you was asleep when the lad brought it round .         it was goriff   s kid     said nobby  chasing a bit of rice around his tin plate .     enough for half the shift .         the rewards of duty     said vimes  hurrying toward the door .      bread and mango pickle and everything     said colon happily .     i   ve always said old goriff isn   t that bad for a rag   ead .      a pool of sizzling oil   vimes stopped at the door .  the family  huddling together   he took out his watch .  it was twenty past ten .  if he ran        fred  could you just step up to my office .     he said .     it won   t take a moment .         right  sir .      vimes ushered the sergeant up the stairs and closed the door .   nobby and the other watchmen strained to listen  but there was no sound except for a low murmuring which went on for some time .   the door opened again .  vimes came down the stairs .      nobby  come up to the university in five minutes  will you .  i want to stay in touch and i   m damned if i   m taking a pigeon with this uniform on .         right  sir .      vimes left .   a few moments later sergeant colon walked carefully down to the main office .  he had a slightly glassy look and walked back to his desk with the nonchalance that only the extremely worried try to achieve .  he toyed with some paper for a while and then said      you don   t mind what people call you  do you  nobby .         i   d be minding the whole time if i minded that  sarge     said corporal nobbs cheerfully .      right .  right .  and i don   t mind what people call me  neither .     colon scratched his head .     don   t make sense  really .  i reckon sir sam is missing too much sleep .         he   s a very busy man  fred .         trying to do everything  that   s his trouble .  and   nobby .         yes .         it   s sergeant colon  thanks .         there was sherry .  there was always sherry at these occasions .  sam vimes could regard it dispassionately  since he always drank fruit juice these days .  he   d heard they made sherry by letting wine go rotten .  he couldn   t see the point of sherry .      and you will try to look dignified  won   t you .     said lady sybil  adjusting his cloak .      yes  dear .         what will you try to look .         dignified  dear .         and please try to be diplomatic .         yes  dear .         what will you try to be .         diplomatic  dear .         you   re using your    henpecked    voice  sam .         yes  dear .         you know that   s not fair .         no  dear .     vimes raised a hand in a theatrical gesture of submission .     all right  all right .  it   s just these feathers .  and these tights .     he winced and tried to do some surreptitious rearranging in an effort to prevent himself becoming the city   s first hunchgroin .     i mean  supposing people see me .         of course they   ll see you  sam .  you   re leading the procession .  and i   m very proud of you .      she brushed some lint off his shoulder .    feathers in my hat  vimes thought glumly .  and fancy tights .  and a shiny breastplate .  a breastplate shouldn   t be shiny .  it should be too dented to take a decent polish .  and diplomatic talk .  how should i know how to talk diplomatically .      and now i must go and have a word with lady selachii     said lady sybil .     you   ll be all right  will you .  you keep yawning .         of course .  didn   t get much sleep last night  that   s all .         you promise not to run away .         me .  i never run           you ran away before the big soir  e for the genuan ambassador .  everyone saw you .         i   d just got news that the de bris gang were robbing vortin   s strongroom .         but you don   t have to chase everyone  sam .  you employ people for that now .         we got    em  though     said vimes  with satisfaction .   he   d enjoyed it immensely  too .  it wasn   t just the pursuit that was so invigorating  with his velvet cloak left behind on a tree and his hat in a puddle somewhere  it was the knowledge that while he was doing this he wasn   t eating very small sandwiches and making even smaller talk .  it wasn   t proper police work  vimes considered  unless you were doing something that someone somewhere would much rather you weren   t doing .   when sybil had disappeared into the crowd he found a handy shadow and lurked in it .  it enabled him to see almost the whole of the university   s great hall .   he quite liked the wizards .  they didn   t commit crimes .  not vimes   s type of crimes  anyway .  the occult wasn   t vimes   s beat .  the wizards might well mess up the very fabric of time and space but they didn   t lead to paperwork  and that was fine by vimes .   there were a lot of them in the hall  in all their glory .  and there was nothing finer than a wizard dressed up formally  until someone could find a way of inflating a bird of paradise  possibly by using an elastic band and some kind of gas .  but the wizards were getting a run for their money  because the rest of the guests were either nobles or guild leaders or both  and an occasion like the convivium brought out the peacock in everyone .   his gaze went from face to chatting face  and he wondered idly what each person was guilty of .    quite a few of the ambassadors were there  too .  they were easy to pick out .  they wore their national costumes  but since by and large their national costumes were what the average peasant wore they looked slightly out of place in them .  their bodies wore feathers and silks  but their minds persistently wore suits .   they chatted in small groups .  one or two nodded and smiled to him as they passed .   the world is watching  vimes thought .  if something went wrong and this stupid leshp business started a war  it   s men like these who   d be working out exactly how to deal with the winner  whoever it was .  never mind who started it  never mind how it was fought  they   d want to know how to deal with things now .  they represented what people called the    international community .     and like all uses of the word    community     you were never quite sure what or who it was .   he shrugged .  it wasn   t his world  thank goodness .   he sidled over to corporal nobbs  who was standing by the main doors in the sort of lopsided slouch which was the closest a living nobbs could come to attention .      all quiet  nobby .     he said  out of the corner of his mouth .      yessir .         nothing going on at all .         nossir .  not a pigeon anywhere  sir .         what  nowhere .  nothing .         nossir .         there was trouble all over the place yesterday .         yessir .         you did tell fred he was to send a bird if there was anything at all .         yessir .         the shades .  there   s always something           dead quiet  sir .         damn .      vimes shook his head at the sheer untrustworthiness of ankh morpork   s criminal fraternity .      i suppose you couldn   t take a brick and           lady sybil was very speffic about how you was to stop here     said corporal nobbs  staring straight ahead .      speffic .         yeah  sir .  she come and have a word with me .  gave me a dollar     said nobby .      ah  sir samuel .     said a booming voice behind him     i don   t think you   ve met prince khufurah yet  have you .      he turned .  archchancellor ridcully was bearing down on him  towing a couple of swarthy men .  vimes hurriedly put on his official face .      this is commander vimes  gentlemen .  sam   no  i   m doing this the wrong way round  aren   t i  got the protocol all wrong   so much to sort out  the bursar   s locked himself in the safe again  we don   t know how he manages to get the key in there with him  i mean  it   s not even as if it   s got a keyhole on the inside        the first man held out a hand as ridcully bustled off again .     prince khufurah     he said .     my carpet got in only two hours ago .         carpet .  oh   yes   you flew           yes  very chilly and of course you just can   t get a good meal .  and did you get your man  sir samuel .         what .  pardon .         i believe our ambassador told me you had to leave the reception last week    .     the prince was a tall man who had probably once been quite athletic until the big dinners had finally weighed him down .  and he had a beard .  all klatchians had beards .  this klatchian had intelligent eyes  too .  disconcertingly intelligent .  you looked into them and several layers of person looked back at you .      what .  oh .  yes .  yes  we got    em all right     said vimes .      well done .  he put up a fight  i see .      vimes looked surprised .  the prince tapped his jaw thoughtfully .  vimes   s hand flew up and encountered a little bit of tissue on his own chin .      ah   er   yes           commander vimes always gets his man     said the prince .      well  i wouldn   t say i           vetinari   s terrier  i   ve heard them call you     the prince went on .     always hot on the chase  they say  and he won   t let go .      vimes stared into the calm  knowing gaze .      i suppose  at the end of the day  we   re all someone   s dog     he said  weakly .      in fact it is fortuitous i have met you  commander .         it is .         i was just wondering about the meaning of the word shouted at me as we were on our way down here .  would you be so kind .         er   if i           i believe it was   let me see now   oh  yes   towelhead .      the prince   s eyes stayed locked on vimes   s face .   vimes was conscious of his own thoughts moving very fast  and they seemed to reach their own decision .  we   ll explain later  they said .  you   re too tired for explanations .  right now  with this man  it   s oh so much better to be honest        it   refers to your headdress     he said .      oh .  is it some kind of obscure joke .      of course he knows  thought vimes .  and he knows i know        no .  it   s an insult     he said eventually .      ah .  well  we certainly cannot be held responsible for the ramblings of idiots  commander .     the prince flashed a smile .     i must commend you  incidentally .         i   m sorry .         for your breadth of knowledge .  i must have asked a dozen people that question this morning and  do you know .  not one of them knew what it meant .  and they all seemed to have caught a cough .      there was a diplomatic pause but  in it  someone sniggered .   vimes let his glance drift sideways to the other man  who had not been introduced .  he was shorter and skinnier than the prince and  under his black headdress  had the most crowded face vimes had ever seen .  a network of scars surrounded a nose like an eagle   s beak .  there was a sort of beard and moustache  but the scars had affected the hair growth so much that they stuck out in strange bunches and at odd angles .  the man looked as though he had been hit in the mouth by a hedgehog .  he could have been any age .  some of the scars looked fresh .   all in all  the man had a face that any policeman would arrest on sight .  there was no possible way it could be innocent of anything .   he caught vimes   s expression and grinned  and vimes had never seen so much gold in one mouth .  he   d never seen so much gold in one place .   vimes realized he was staring when he ought to have been making polite diplomatic conversation .      so     he said     are we going to have a scrap over this leshp business or what .      the prince gave a dismissive shrug .      pfui     he said .     a few square miles of uninhabited fertile ground with superb anchorage in an unsurpassed strategic position .  what sort of inconsequence is that for civilized people to war over .      once again vimes felt the gaze on him  reading him .  well  the hell with it .  he said     sorry  i   m not good at this diplomacy business .  did you mean what you just said then .      there was another snigger .  vimes turned and looked at the leering bearded face again .  and was aware of a smell  no  a stench of cloves .   good grief  he chews the stinking things        ah     said the prince     you haven   t met    hour ahmed .      ahmed grinned again and bowed .     offendi     he said  in a voice like a gravel path .   and that seemed to be it .  not    this is    hour ahmed  cultural attach      or       hour ahmed  my bodyguard    or even       hour ahmed  walking strongroom and moth killer .     it was clear that the next move was up to vimes .      that   s   er   that   s an unusual name     he said .      not at all     said the prince smoothly .     ahmed is a very common name in my country .      he leaned forward again .  vimes recognized this as the prelude to a confidential aside .     incidentally  was that beautiful lady i saw just now your first wife .         er   all my wives     said vimes .     that is           could i offer you twenty camels for her .      vimes looked back into the dark eyes for a moment  glanced at    hour ahmed   s    carat grin  and said      this is another test  isn   t it    .      the prince straightened up  looking pleased .      well done  sir samuel .  you   re good at this .  do you know  mr .  boggis of the thieves    guild was prepared to accept fifteen .         for mrs .  boggis .     vimes waggled a hand dismissively .     nah   four camels  maybe four camels and a goat in a good light .  and when she   s had a shave .      the milling guests turned at the sound of the prince   s explosion of laughter .      very good .  very good .  i am afraid  commander  that some of your fellow citizens feel that just because my people invented advanced mathematics and all day camping we are complete barbarians who   d try to buy their wives at the drop of  shall we say  a turban .  i am surprised they   re giving me an honorary degree  considering how incredibly backward i am .         oh .  what degree is that .     said vimes .  no wonder this man was a diplomat .  you couldn   t trust him an inch  he thought in loops  and you couldn   t help liking him despite it .   the prince pulled a letter out of his robe .      apparently it   s a doctorum adamus cum flabello dulci   is there something wrong  sir samuel .      vimes managed to turn the treacherous laugh into a coughing fit .     no  no  nothing     he said .     no .      he desperately wanted to change the subject .  and fortunately there was something here to provide just the opportunity .      why has mr .  ahmed got such a big curved sword slung on his back .     he said .      ah  you are a policeman  you notice such things           it   s hardly a concealed weapon  is it .  it   s nearly bigger than him .  he   s practically a concealed owner .         it   s ceremonial     said the prince .     and he does fret so if he has to leave it behind .         and what exactly is his           ah  there you are     said ridcully .     i think we   re just about ready .  you know you go right at the front  sam           yes  i know     said vimes .     i was just asking his highness what              and if you  your highness  and you  mr .    my word  what a big sword  and you come back here and take your place among the honored guests  and we   ll be ready in a brace of sheiks        what a thing it is to have a copper   s mind  vimes thought  as the great file of wizards and guests tried to form a dignified and orderly line behind him .  just because someone makes himself pleasant and likable you start to be suspicious of him  for no other reason than the fact that anyone who goes out of their way to be nice to a copper has got something on their mind .  of course  he   s a diplomat  but still   i just hope he never studied ancient languages  and that   s a fact .   someone tapped vimes on the shoulder .  he turned and looked right into the grin of    hour ahmed .      if hyou changing your mind  offendi  i give hyou twenty five camels  no problem     he said  pulling a clove from his teeth .     may your hloins be full of fruit .      he winked .  it was the most suggestive gesture vimes had ever seen .     is this another       he began  but the man had vanished into the crowd .      my loins be full of fruit .     he repeated to himself .     good grief .         hour ahmed reappeared at his other elbow in a gust of cloves .     i go  i hcome back     he growled happily .     the prince hsays the degree is doctor of sweet fanny adams .  a hwizard wheeze  yes .  oh  how we are laughing .      and then he was gone .      the convivium was unseen university   s big day .  originally it had just been the degree ceremony  but over the years it had developed into a kind of celebration of the amicable relationship between the university and the city  in particular celebrating the fact that people were hardly ever turned to clams anymore .  in the absence of anything resembling a lord mayor   s show or a state opening of parliament  it was one of the few formal opportunities the citizens had of jeering at their social superiors  or at least at people wearing tights and ridiculous costumes .   it had grown so big that it was now held in the city   s opera house .  distrustful people   that is to say  people like vimes   considered that this was so there could be a procession .  there was nothing like the massed ranks of wizardry walking sedately through the city in a spirit of civic amicability to subtly remind the more thoughtful kind of person that it hadn   t always been this way .  look at us  the wizards seemed to be saying .  we used to rule this city .  look at our big staffs with the knobs on the end .  any one of these could do some very serious damage in the wrong hands so it   s a good thing  isn   t it  that they   re in the right hands at the moment .  isn   t it nice that we all get along so well .   and someone  once  had decided that the commander of the watch should walk in front  for symbolic reasons .  that hadn   t mattered for years because there hadn   t been a commander of the watch  but now there was  and he was sam vimes .  in a red shirt with silly baggy sleeves  red tights  some kind of puffed shorts in a style that went out of fashion  by the look of it  at the time when flint was at the cutting edge of cutting edge technology  a tiny shiny breastplate and a helmet with feathers in it .   and he really did need some sleep .   and he had to carry the truncheon .   he kept his eyes fixed on the damn thing as he walked out of the university   s main gate .  last night   s rain had cleaned the sky .  the city steamed .   if he stared at the truncheon he didn   t have to see who was giggling at him .   the downside was that he had to keep staring at the thing .   it said  on a little tarnished shield that he   d had to clean before reading it  protecter of thee kinge   s piece .   that had brightened the occasion slightly .   feathers and antiques  gold braid and fur     perhaps it was because he was tired  or just because he was trying to shut out the world  but vimes found himself slowing down into the traditional watchman   s walk and the traditional idling thought process .   it was an almost pavlovian response .   the legs swung  the feet moved  the mind began to work in a certain way .  it wasn   t a dream state  exactly .  it was just that the ears  nose and eyeballs wired themselves straight into the ancient    suspicious bastard    node of his brain  leaving his higher brain center free to freewheel .      fur and tights   what kind of wear was that for a watchman .  bashed in armor  greasy leather breeches and a tatty shirt with bloodstains on it  someone else   s for preference   that was the stuff   nice feel of the cobbles through his boots  it was really comforting     behind him  confusion running up and down the ranks  the procession slowed down to keep in step .         hah  protecter of thee kinge   s piece indeed       he   d said to the old man who   d delivered it     which piece did you have in mind .     but that had fallen on stony ears   damn silly thing anyway  he   d thought  a short length of wood with a lump of silver on the end   even a constable got a decent sword  what was he supposed to do  wave it at people .    ye gods  it was months since he   d had a good walk through the streets   lot of people about today   some parade on  wasn   t there    .      oh dear     said captain carrot  in the crowd .     what   s he doing .      next to him an agatean tourist was industriously pulling the lever of his iconograph .   commander vimes stopped and  with a faraway look in his eyes  tucked his truncheon under one arm and reached up to his helmet .   the tourist looked up at carrot and tugged his shirt politely .      please  what is he doing now .     he said .      er   he   s   he   s taking out           oh  no       said angua .         he   s taking the ceremonial packet of cigars out of his helmet     said carrot .     oh   and he   s  he   s lighting one        the tourist pulled the lever a few times .      very historic tradition .         memorable     murmured angua .   the crowd had fallen silent .  no one wanted to break vimes   s concentration .  there was the big gusty silence of a thousand people holding their breath .      what   s he doing now .     said carrot .      can   t you see .     said angua .      not with my hands over my eyes .  oh  the poor man           he   s   he   s just blown a smoke ring              first one of the day  he always does that              and now he   s set off again   and now he   s pulled out the truncheon and he   s tossing it up in the air and catching it again  you know the way he does with his sword when he   s thinking   he looks quite happy           i think he   s going to really treasure this moment of happiness     said carrot .   then the murmur started .  the procession had halted behind vimes .  some of the more impressionable people who weren   t sure what they should be doing  and those who had partaken too heavily of the university   s rather good sherry  started to fumble around on their person for something to throw up in the air and catch .  after all  this was a traditional ceremony .  if you took the view that you were not going to do things because they were apparently ridiculous  you might as well go home right now .      he   s tired  that   s what it is     said carrot .     he   s been running around overseeing things for days .  night and day watches .  you know what a hands on person he is .         let   s hope the patrician will agree to let him stay that way .         oh  his lordship wouldn   t   he wouldn   t  would he .      laughter was starting .  vimes had started to toss the truncheon from one hand to the other .      he can make his sword spin three times and still catch it        vimes   s head turned .  he looked up .  his truncheon clattered on to the cobbles and rolled into a puddle  unheeded .   then he started to run .   carrot stared at him and then tried to see what the man had been looking at .      on top of the barbican       he said .     in that window   isn   t that someone up there .  excuse me  excuse me  sorry  excuse me       he began to push his way through the crowd .   vimes was already a small figure in the distance  his red cloak flying out after him .      well .  there   s lots of people watching the parade from high places     said angua .     what   s so special about           no one should be up there .     said carrot  starting to run now he was free of the crowd .     it   s all sealed up .      angua looked around .  every face was turned toward the street theater  and there was a cart nearby .  she sighed and strolled behind it wearing an expression of suspicious nonchalance .  there was a gasp  a faint but distinctly organic sound  a muffled yelp and then the clank of armor hitting the ground .      vimes didn   t know why he ran .  it was a sixth sense .  it was when the back of the brain picked up out of the ether that something bad was going to happen  and didn   t have time to rationalize  and just took over the spinal cord .   no one could get to the top of the barbican .  the barbican had been the fortified gateway in the days when ankh morpork didn   t regard an attacking army as a marvelous commercial opportunity .  some parts were still in use  but the bulk of it was six or seven stories of ruin  without stairs that any sensible man would trust .  for years it had been used as an unofficial source of masonry for the rest of the city .  bits of it fell off on windy nights .  even gargoyles avoided it .   he was aware that far behind him the noise of the crowd became a lot of shouting .  one or two people screamed .  he didn   t turn round .  whatever was going on  carrot could take care of it .   something overtook him .  it looked like a wolf would look if one of its ancestors had been a long haired klatchistan hunting dog  one of those graceful things that were all nose and hair .   it bounded ahead and through the crumbling gateway .   the creature was nowhere to be seen when vimes arrived .  but the absence was not a matter that grabbed at his attention  because of the more pressing presence of the corpse  lying in a mess of fallen masonry .   one of the things vimes had always said   that is to say  one of the things he said he always said  and no one disagrees with the commanding officer   was that sometimes small details  tiny little details  things that no one would notice in ordinary circumstances  grab your senses by the throat and scream     see me .      there was a lingering  spicy scent in the air .  and in the gap between a couple of cobblestones was a clove .      it was five o   clock .  vimes and carrot sat in the patrician   s outer office  in silence except for the irregular ticking of the clock .   after a while vimes said     let me have a look at that again .      carrot obediently pulled out the small square of paper .  vimes looked at it .  there was no mistaking what it showed .  he tucked it into his own pocket .      er   why do you want to keep it  sir .         keep what .     said vimes .      the iconograph i borrowed from the tourist .         i don   t know what you   re talking about     said vimes .      but you           i can   t see you going very far in the watch  captain  if you go around seeing things that aren   t there .         oh .      the clock seemed to tick louder .      you   re thinking something  sir .  aren   t you .         it is a use to which i occasionally put my brain  captain .  strange as it may seem .         what are you thinking  sir .         what they want me to think     said vimes .      who   s they .         i don   t know yet .  one step at a time .      a bell tinkled .   vimes stood up .     you know what i always say     he said .   carrot removed his helmet and polished it with his sleeve .     yes  sir .     everyone   s guilty of something  especially the ones that aren   t     sir .         no  not that one           er      always take into consideration the fact that you might be dead wrong     sir .         no  nor that one either .         er      how come nobby ever got a job as a watchman .      sir .  you say that a lot .         no .  i meant    always act stupid     carrot .         ah  right  sir .  from now on i shall remember that you always said that  sir .      they put their helmets under their arms .  vimes knocked at the door .      come     said a voice .   the patrician was standing at the window .   sitting or standing around the office were lord rust and the others .  vimes never quite understood how the civic leaders were chosen .  they just seemed to turn up  like a tack on the sole of your shoe .      ah  vimes     said vetinari .      sir .         let us not beat about the bush  vimes .  how did the man get up there when your people had so thoroughly checked everything last night .  magic .         couldn   t say  sir .      carrot  still staring straight ahead  blinked .      your people did check the barbican  i assume .         no  sir .         they didn   t .         no  sir .  i did that myself .         you physically checked it yourself  vimes .     said boggis of the thieves    guild .   captain carrot could feel vimes   s thoughts at this point .      that is correct   boggis     said vimes  without turning his head .     but   we think someone got in where the windows are boarded up and pulled the boards back after him .  dust has been disturbed and           and you didn   t spot this  vimes .      vimes sighed .     it   d be hard enough to spot the nailed back boards in daylight  boggis  let alone in the middle of the night .     not that we did  he added to himself .  angua smelled the scent on them .   lord vetinari sat down at his desk .     the situation is grave  vimes .         yes  sir .         his highness is very seriously injured .  and prince cadram  we understand  is beside himself with rage .         they insist on keeping his brother in the embassy     said lord rust .     a studied insult .  as if we haven   t good surgeons in this city .         that   s right  of course     said vimes .     and many of them could give him a decent shave and a haircut  too .         are you making fun of me  vimes .         certainly not  my lord     said vimes .     in my opinion  no surgeons anywhere have cleaner sawdust on their floors than the ones in this city .      rust glared at him .   the patrician coughed .      you have identified the assassin .     said the patrician .   carrot was expecting vimes to say     alleged assassin  sir     but instead he said      yes .  he is   he was called ossie brunt  sir .  no other name that we know .  lived in market street .  did odd jobs from time to time .  bit of a loner .  no relatives or friends that we can find .  we are making enquiries .         and that   s all you fellows know .     said lord downey .      it took some time to identify him  sir     said vimes stolidly .      oh .  why should that be .         couldn   t give you the technical answer  sir  but it looked to me like they wouldn   t need to make him a coffin  they could just have posted him between two barn doors .         was he acting alone .         we only found the one body  sir .  and a lot of recently fallen masonry  so it looks as           i meant does he belong to any organization .  any suggestion that he   s anti klatchian .         apart from him trying to kill one .  enquiries are continuing .         are you taking this seriously  vimes .         i have put my best men on the job  sir .     who   s looking worried .     sergeant colon and corporal nobbs .     who   s looking relieved .     very experienced men .  the keystones of the watch .         colon and nobbs .     said the patrician .     really .         yes  sir .      their gazes met  very briefly .      we   re getting some very threatening noises  vimes     said vetinari .      what can i say  sir .  i saw someone up on the tower  i ran  someone shot the prince with an arrow and then i found the man at the bottom of the tower very obviously dead  with a broken bow and a lot of rock beside him .  the storm last night probably loosened things up .  i can   t make up facts that don   t exist  sir .      carrot watched the faces round the table .  the general expression was one of relief .      a lone bowman     said vetinari .     an idiot with some kind of mad grudge .  who died in the execution of the  uh  attempted execution .  and  of course  valiant action by our watchmen probably at least prevented an immediately fatal shot .         valiant action .     said downey .     i know captain carrot here ran toward the vips and vimes headed for the tower  but frankly  vimes  your strange behavior beforehand           somewhat immaterial now     said lord vetinari .  once again he adopted a slightly faraway voice  as if reporting to somebody else .     if commander vimes had not slowed down the procession  the wretch would undoubtedly have got a much better shot .  as it was  the man panicked .  yes   the prince  possibly  would accept that .         prince .     said vimes .     but the poor devil           his brother     said the patrician .      ah .  the nice one .         thank you  commander     said the patrician .     thank you  gentlemen .  do not let me detain you .  oh  vimes   just a brief word  if you would be so good .  not you  captain carrot .  i   m sure someone is committing some crime somewhere .      vimes remained staring at the far wall while the room emptied .  vetinari left his chair and went over to the window .      strange days indeed  commander     he said .      sir .         for example  i gather that this afternoon captain carrot was on the roof of the opera house firing arrows down toward the archery butts .         very keen lad  sir .         it could well be that the distance between the opera house and the targets is about the same  you know  as the distance between the top of the barbican and the spot where the prince was hit .         just fancy that  sir .      vetinari sighed .     and why was he doing this .         it   s a funny thing  sir  but he was telling me the other day that in fact it is still law that every citizen should do one hour   s archery practice every day .  apparently the law was made in      and it   s never been           do you know why i sent captain carrot away just now  vimes .         couldn   t say  sir .         captain carrot is an honest young man  vimes .         yes  sir .         and did you know that he winces when he hears you tell a direct lie .         really  sir .     damn .      i can   t stand to see his poor face twitch all the time  vimes .         very thoughtful of you  sir .         where was the second bowman  vimes .      damn .     second bowman  sir .         have you ever had a hankering to go on the stage  vimes .      yes  at the moment i   d leap on it wherever it   s heading  thought vimes .      no  sir .         pity .  i am certain you   re a great loss to the acting profession .  i believe you said the man had put the boards back after him .         yes  sir .         nailed them back .      blast .     yes  sir .         from the outside .      damn .     yes  sir .         a particularly resourceful lone bowman  then .      vimes didn   t bother to comment .  vetinari sat down at his desk  raised his steepled fingers to his lips and stared at vimes over the top of them .      colon and nobbs are investigating this .  really .         yes  sir .         if i were to ask you why  you   d pretend not to understand .      vimes let his forehead wrinkle in honest perplexity .     sir .         if you say    sir .     again in that stupid voice  vimes  i swear there will be trouble .         they   re good men  sir .         however  some people might consider them to be unimaginative  stolid and   how can i put this .    possessed of an inbuilt disposition to accept the first explanation that presents itself and then bunk off somewhere for a quiet smoke .  a certain lack of imagination .  an ability to get out of their depth on a wet pavement .  a tendency to rush to judgment .         i hope you are not impugning my men  sir .         vimes  sergeant colon and corporal nobbs have never been pugn   d in their entire lives .         sir .         and yet   in fact  we do not need complications  vimes .  an ingenious lone madman   well  there are many madmen .  a regrettable incident .         yes  sir .     the man was looking harassed and vimes felt there was room for a pinch of sympathy .      fred and nobby don   t like complications either  sir .         we need simple answers  vimes .         sir .  fred and nobby are good at simple .      the patrician turned away and looked out over the city .      ah     he said  in a quieter voice .     simple men to see the simple truth .         this is a fact  sir .         you are learning fast  vimes .         couldn   t say about that  sir .         and when they have found the simple truth  vimes .         can   t argue with the truth  sir .         in my experience  vimes  you can argue with anything .         when vimes had gone lord vetinari sat at his desk for a while  staring at nothing .  then he took a key from a drawer and walked across to a wall  where he pressed a particular area .   there was a rattle of a counterweight .  the wall swung back .   the patrician walked softly through the narrow passageway beyond .  here and there it was illuminated by a very faint glow from around the edges of the little panels which  if gently slid back  would allow someone to look out through the eyesockets of a handy portrait .   they were a relic of a previous ruler .  vetinari never bothered with them .  looking out of someone else   s eyes wasn   t the trick .   there was a certain amount of travel up dark stairways and along musty corridors .  occasionally he   d make movements the meaning of which might not be readily apparent .  he   d touch a wall here and here  apparently without thinking  as he passed .  along one stone flagged passage  lit only by the gray light from a window forgotten by everyone except the most optimistic flies  he appeared to play a game of hopscotch  robes flying around him and calves twinkling as he skipped from stone to stone .   these various activities did not seem to cause anything to happen .  eventually he reached a door  which he unlocked .  he did this with some caution .   the air beyond was full of acrid smoke  and the steady pop pop sound which he had begun to hear further back along the passage was now quite loud .  it faltered for a moment  was followed by a much louder bang  and then a piece of hot metal whirled past the patrician   s ear and buried itself in the wall .   in the smoke a voice said     oh dear .      it didn   t seem unhappy  but sounded rather like the voice one might use to a sweet and ingratiating little puppy which  despite one   s best efforts  is sitting next to a spreading damp patch on the carpet .   as the billows cleared the indistinct shape of the speaker turned to vetinari with a wan little smile and said     fully fifteen seconds this time  my lord .  there is no doubt that the principle is sound .      that was one of leonard of quirm   s traits  he picked up conversations out of the air  he assumed everyone was an interested friend  and he took it for granted that you were as intelligent as he was .   vetinari peered at a small heap of bent and twisted metal .      what was it  leonard .     he said .      an experimental device for turning chemical energy into rotary motion     said leonard .     the problem  you see  is getting the little pellets of black powder into the combustion chamber at exactly the right speed and one at a time .  if two ignite together  well  what we have is the external combustion engine .         and  er  what would be the purpose of it .     said the patrician .      i believe it could replace the horse     said leonard proudly .   they looked at the stricken thing .      one of the advantages of horses that people often point out     said vetinari  after some thought     is that they very seldom explode .  almost never  in my experience  apart from that unfortunate occurrence in the hot summer a few years ago .     with fastidious fingers he pulled something out of the mess .  it was a pair of cubes  made out of some soft white fur and linked together by a piece of string .  there were dots on them .      dice .     he said .   leonard smiled in an embarrassed fashion .     yes .  i can   t think why i thought they   d help it go better .  it was just  well  an idea .  you know how it is .      lord vetinari nodded .  he knew how it was .  he knew how it was far more than leonard of quirm did  which was why there was one key to the door and he had it .  not that the man was a prisoner  except by dull  humdrum standards .  he appeared rather grateful to be confined in this light  airy attic with as much wood  paper  sticks of charcoal and paint as he desired and no rent or food bills to pay .   in any case  you couldn   t really imprison someone like leonard of quirm .  the most you could do was lock up his body .  the gods alone knew where his mind went .  and  although he had so much cleverness it leaked continually  he couldn   t tell you which way the political wind was blowing even if you fitted him with sails .   leonard   s incredible brain sizzled away alarmingly  an overloaded chip pan on the stove of life .  it was impossible to know what he would think of next  because he was constantly reprogrammed by the whole universe .  the sight of a waterfall or a soaring bird would send him spinning down some new path of practical speculation that invariably ended in a heap of wire and springs and a cry of    i think i know what i did wrong .     he   d been a member of most of the craft guilds in the city but had been thrown out for getting impossibly high marks in the exams or  in some cases  correcting the questions .  it was said that he   d accidentally blown up the alchemists    guild using nothing more than a glass of water  a spoonful of acid  two lengths of wire and a ping pong ball .   any sensible ruler would have killed off leonard  and lord vetinari was extremely sensible and often wondered why he had not done so .  he   d decided that it was because  imprisoned in the priceless  inquiring amber of leonard   s massive mind  underneath all that bright investigative genius was a kind of willful innocence that might in lesser men be called stupidity .  it was the seat and soul of that force which  down the millennia  had caused mankind to stick its fingers in the electric light socket of the universe and play with the switch to see what happened   and then be very surprised when it did .   it was  in short  something useful .  and if the patrician was anything  he was the political equivalent of the old lady who saves bits of string because you never know when they might come in handy .   after all  you couldn   t plan for every eventuality  because that would involve knowing what was going to happen  and if you knew what was going to happen  you could probably see to it that it didn   t  or at least happened to someone else .  so the patrician never planned .  plans often got in the way .   and  finally  he kept leonard around because the man was easy to talk to .  he never understood what lord vetinari was talking about  he had a world view about as complex as that of a concussed duckling and  above all  never really paid attention .  this made him an excellent confidant .  after all  when you seek advice from someone it   s certainly not because you want them to give it .  you just want them to be there while you talk to yourself .      i   ve just made some tea     said leonard .     will you join me .      he followed the patrician   s gaze to a brown stain all up one wall  which ended in a star of molten metal in the plaster .      i   m afraid the automatical tea engine went wrong     he said .     i shall have to make it by hand .         so kind     said lord vetinari .   he sat down amidst the easels and  while leonard busied himself at the fireplace  leafed through the latest sketches .  leonard sketched as automatically as other people scratched  genius   a certain kind of genius   fell off him like dandruff .   there was a picture of a man drawing  the lines catching the figure so accurately it appeared to stand out of the paper .  and around it  because leonard never wasted white space  were other sketches  scattered aimlessly .  a thumb .  a bowl of flowers .  a device  apparently  for sharpening pencils by water power     vetinari found what he was looking for in the bottom left hand corner  sandwiched between a sketch for a new type of screw and a tool for opening oysters .  it  or something very much like it  was always there somewhere .   one of the things that made leonard such a rare prize  and kept him under such secure lock and key  was that he really didn   t see any difference between the thumb and the roses and the pencil sharpener and this .      ah  the self portrait     said leonard  returning with two cups .      yes  indeed     said vetinari .     but my eye was drawn to this little sketch here .  the war machine           oh  that .  a mere nothing .  have you ever noticed the way in which the dew on roses           this bit here   what is it for .     said vetinari  pointing persistently .      oh  that .  that   s just the throwing arm for the balls of molten sulfur     said leonard  picking up a plate of small cakes .     i calculate that one should get a range of almost half a mile  if one detaches the endless belt from the driving wheels and uses the oxen to wind the windlass .         really .     said vetinari  taking in the carefully numbered parts .     and it could be built .         what .  oh  yes .  macaroon .  in theory .         in theory .         no one would ever actually do it .  raining unquenchable fire down upon fellow humans .  hah .     leonard sprayed macaroon crumbs .     you   d never find an artisan to build it  or a soldier who would pull the lever   that   s part   b  on the plan  just here  look           ah  yes     said vetinari .     anyway     he added     i imagine these huge power arms here couldn   t possibly be operated without them breaking           seasoned ash and yew  laminated and held together by special steel bolts     said leonard promptly .     i made a few calculations  just there below the sketch of light on a raindrop .  as an intellectual exercise  obviously .      vetinari ran his eye along several lines of leonard   s spidery mirror writing .      oh  yes     he said glumly .  he put the paper aside .      have i told you that the klatchian situation is intensely political .  prince cadram is trying to do a great deal very fast .  he needs to consolidate his position .  he is depending on support that is somewhat volatile .  there are many plotting against him  i understand .         really .  well  this is the sort of thing people do     said leonard .     incidentally  i   ve recently been examining cobwebs and  i know this will interest you  their strength in relation to their weight is much greater even than our best steel wire .  isn   t that fascinating .         what kind of weapon do you intend to make out of them .     said the patrician .      sorry .         oh  nothing .  i was just thinking aloud .         and you haven   t touched your tea     said leonard .   vetinari looked around the room .  it was full of   things .  tubes and odd paper kites and things that looked like the skeletons of ancient beasts .  one of leonard   s saving graces  in a very real sense from vetinari   s point of view  was his strange attention span .  it wasn   t that he soon got bored with things .  he didn   t seem to get bored with anything .  but since he was interested in everything in the universe all the time the end result tended to be that an experimental device for disemboweling people at a distance then became a string weaving machine and ended up as an instrument for ascertaining the specific gravity of cheese .   he was as easily distracted as a kitten .  all that business with the flying machine  for example .  giant bat wings hung from the ceiling even now .  the patrician had been more than happy to let him waste his time on that idea  because it was obvious to anyone that no human being would ever be able to flap the wings hard enough .   he needn   t have worried .  leonard was his own distraction .  he had ended up spending ages designing a special tray so that people could eat their meals in the air .   a truly innocent man .  and yet always  always  some little part of him would sketch these wretchedly beguiling engines  with their clouds of smoke and carefully numbered engineering diagrams        what   s this .     vetinari said  pointing to yet another doodle .  it showed a man holding a large metal sphere .      that .  oh  something of a toy  really .  makes use of the strange properties of some otherwise quite useless metals .  they don   t like being squeezed .  so they go bang .  with extreme alacrity .         another weapon           certainly not  my lord .  it would be no possible use as a weapon .  i did think it might have a place in the mining industries  though .         really           for when they need to move mountains out of the way .         tell me     vetinari said  putting this paper aside as well     you don   t have any relatives in klatch  do you .         i don   t believe so .  my family lived in quirm for generations .         oh .  good .  but   very clever people in klatch  are they .         oh  in many disciplines they practically wrote the scroll .  fine metalwork  for example .         metalwork       the patrician sighed .      and alchemy  of course .  affir al chema   s principia explosia has been the seminal work for more than a hundred years .         alchemy     said the patrician  glumly .     sulfur and so forth           yes  indeed .         but the way you put it  these major achievements were some considerable time ago       lord vetinari sounded like a man straining to see a light at the end of the tunnel .      certainly .  i would be astonished if they haven   t made considerable progress .     said leonard of quirm happily .      ah .     the patrician sank a little in his chair .  it had turned out that the end of the tunnel was on fire .      a splendid people with much to recommend them     said leonard .     i always thought it was the presence of the desert .  it leads to an urgency of thought .  it makes you aware of the briefness of life .      the patrician glanced at another page .  between a sketch of a bird   s wing and a careful drawing of a ball joint was a little doodle of something with spiked wheels and spinning blades .  and then there was the device for moving mountains aside            the desert is not required     he said .  he sighed again and pushed the pages aside .     have you heard about the lost continent of leshp .     he said .      oh  yes .  i did some sketches there a few years ago     said leonard .     some interesting aspects  i recall .  more tea .  i fear you   ve let that one get cold .  was there anything you particularly wanted .      the patrician pinched the bridge of his nose .      i   m not sure .  there is a small problem developing .  i thought perhaps you could help .  unfortunately     the patrician glanced at the sketches again     i suspect that you can .     he stood up  straightened his robe and forced a smile .     you have everything you require .         some more wire would be nice     said leonard .     and i have run out of burnt umber .         i shall have some sent along directly     said vetinari .     and now  if you will excuse me        he let himself out .   leonard nodded happily as he cleared away the teacups .  the infernal combustion engine was carried to the heap of scrap metal beside the small forge  and he fetched a ladder and removed the piston from the ceiling .   he   d just opened out his easel to start work on a new design when he was aware of a distant pattering .  it sounded like someone running but also occasionally pausing to hop sideways on one leg .   then there was a pause  such as might be made by someone adjusting their clothing and getting their breath back .   the door opened and the patrician returned .  he sat down and looked carefully at leonard of quirm .      you did what .     he said .      vimes turned the clove over and over under the magnifying glass .      i see tooth marks     he said .      yes sir     said littlebottom  who represented in her entirety the watch   s forensic department .     looks like someone was chewing it like a toothpick .      vimes sat back .     i would say     he said     that this was last touched by a swarthy man of about my height .  he had several gold teeth .  and a beard .  and a slight cast in one eye .  scarred .  he was carrying a large weapon .  curved  i   d say .  and you   d have to call what he was wearing a turban because it wasn   t moving fast enough to be a badger .      littlebottom looked astonished .      detectoring is like gambling     said vimes  putting down the clove .     the secret is to know the winner in advance .  thank you  corporal .  write down that description and make sure everyone gets a copy  please .  he goes by the name of    hour ahmed  heaven knows why .  and then go and get some rest .      vimes turned to face carrot and angua  who had crammed into the tiny little room  and nodded at the girl .      i followed the clove smell all the way down to the docks     she said .      and then .         then i lost it  sir .     angua looked embarrassed .     i didn   t have any trouble through the fish market  sir .  or in the slaughterhouse district .  and then it went into the spice market           ah .  i see .  and didn   t come out again .         in a way  sir .  or came out going fifty different ways .  sorry .         can   t be helped .  carrot .         i did what you said  sir .  the top of the opera house is about the right distance from our archery butts .  i used a bow just like the one he used  sir        vimes raised a finger .  carrot stared  and then said slowly        like   the one you found next to him           right .  and .         it   s a burleigh and stronginthearm    shureshotte five     sir .  a bow for the expert .  i   m not a great bowman but i could at least hit the target at that elevation .  but           i   m ahead of you     said vimes .     you   re a big lad  carrot .  our late ossie had arms like nobby .  i could put my hand round them .         yes  sir .  it   s a hundred pound draw .  i doubt if he could even pull the string back .         i   d hate to watch him try .  good grief   the only thing he could be sure of hitting with a bow like that would be his foot .  by the way  do you think anyone saw you up there .         i doubt it  sir .  i was right in among the chimneys and the air vents .      vimes sighed .     captain  i expect if you   d done it in a cellar at midnight his lordship would have said    wasn   t it rather dark down there .     next morning .      he took out the by now rather creased picture .  there was carrot   or at least carrot   s arm and ear   as he ran toward the procession .  and there  among the people in the procession turning to look at him  was the face of the prince .  there was no sign of    hour ahmed .  he   d been at the soir  e  hadn   t he .  but then there   d been all that milling around at the door  people changing places  treading on one another   s robes  nipping back to the privy  walking into one another   he could have gone anywhere .      and the prince fell as you got to him .  with the arrow in his back .  he was still facing you .         yes  sir .  i   m sure of that .  everyone else was milling around  of course           so he was shot in the back by a man in front of him who could not possibly have used the bow that he didn   t shoot him with from the wrong direction        there was a tapping at the window .      that   ll be downspout     said vimes  without looking around .     i sent him on an errand        downspout never quite fitted in .  it wasn   t that he didn   t get on with people  because he hardly ever met people  except those whose activities took them above  say  second floor level .  constable downspout   s beat was the rooftops .  very slowly .  he   d come down for the watch   s hogswatch party and had poured gravy in his ears to show willing  but gargoyles got very nervy indoors at ground level and he had soon exited via the chimney and his paper squeaker had echoed out forlornly amongst the snowy rooftops all night .   but gargoyles were good at watching  and good at remembering  and very  very good at being patient .   vimes opened the window .  moving jerkily  downspout unfolded himself into the room and then quickly scrambled up on to a corner of vimes   s desk  for the comfort that it brought .   angua and carrot stared at the arrow the gargoyle held in his hand .      ah  well done     said vimes  in the same even voice .     where did you find it  downspout .      downspout spluttered a series of guttural syllables only pronounceable by someone with a mouth shaped like a pipe .      in the wall on the second floor of the dress shop in the plaza of broken moons     carrot translated .      eshk     said downspout .      that   s barely halfway to sator square  sir .         yes     said vimes .     a small weak man trying to pull a heavy bow  the arrow wobbling all over the place   thank you very much  downspout .  there will be an extra pigeon for you this week .         nkorr     said downspout  and clambered back out of the window .      excuse me  sir .     said angua .  she took the arrow from vimes and  closing her eyes  sniffed at it gingerly .      oh  yes   ossie     she said .     all over it           thank you  corporal .  it   s as well to be sure .      carrot took the arrow from the werewolf and looked at it critically .     huh .  peacock feathers and a plated point .  it   s the sort of thing an amateur buys because he thinks it   ll magically improve his shot .  showy .         right     said vimes .     you  carrot  and you  angua   you   re on the case .         sir  i don   t understand     said carrot .     i am perplexed .  i thought you said fred and nobby were investigating this .         yes     said vimes .      but           sergeant colon and corporal nobbs are investigating why the late ossie tried to kill the prince .  and do you know what .  they   re going to find lots of clues .  i just know it .  i can feel it in my water .         but we know he couldn   t       said carrot .      isn   t this fun .     said vimes .     i don   t want you to get in fred   s way .  just   ask around .  try done it duncan  or sidney lopsides  hah  there   s a man with his ear to the ground all right .  or the agony aunts  or lily goodtime .  or mr .  slider  haven   t seen him around for a while  but           he   s dead  sir     said carrot .      what  smelly slider .  when .         last month  sir .  he got hit by a falling bedstead .  freak accident  sir .         no one told me .         you were busy  sir .  but you put some money in the envelope when fred brought it round  sir .  ten dollars  which fred remarked was very generous .      vimes sighed .  oh  yes  the envelopes .  fred was always wandering around with an envelope these days .  someone was always leaving  or some friend of the watch was in trouble  or there was a raffle  or the tea money was low again  or some complicated explanation   so vimes just put some money in .  simplest way .   old smelly slider        you should   ve mentioned it     he said reproachfully .      you   ve been working hard  sir .         any other street news you haven   t mentioned  captain .         not that i can think of  sir .         all right .  well   see which way the wind is blowing .  very carefully .  and   trust no one .      carrot looked worried .      er   i can trust angua  can   t i .     he said .      well  of course you           and you  presumably .         me  well  obviously .  that goes without say           corporal littlebottom .  she can be very helpful           cheery  yes  certainly you can trust           sergeant detritus .  i always thought he was very trust           detritus  oh yes  he           nobby .  should i           carrot  i understand what he means     said angua  tugging his arm .   carrot looked a little crestfallen .     i   ve never liked   you know  underhand things     he mumbled .      i don   t want any written reports     said vimes  grateful for that small mercy .     this is   unofficial .  but officially unofficial  if you see what i mean .      angua nodded .  carrot just stayed looking dismal .   she   s a werewolf  thought vimes  of course she understands .  and you   d think a man who is technically a dwarf   d be able to fold his head around the idea of subterfuge .      look  just   listen to the streets     said vimes .     the streets know everything .  talk to   blind hugh           i   m afraid he passed away last month     said carrot .      did he .  no one told me .         i thought i sent you a memo  sir .      vimes glanced guiltily at his overloaded desk  and then shrugged .      have a quiet look at things .  get to the bottom of things .  and trust no   trust practically no one .  all right .  except trustworthy people .            come on  open up .  watch business .      corporal nobbs pulled at sergeant colon   s sleeve and whispered in his ear .      not watch business .     said colon  pounding the door again .     nothing to do with the watch at all .  we are just civilians  all right .      the door opened a crack .      yes .     said a voice that counted its small change .      we have to ask you some questions  missus .         are you the watch .     said the voice .      no .  i think i just made that clear           piss off  copper .      the door slammed .      you sure this is the right place  sarge .         harry chestnuts said he saw ossie going in here .  come on  open up .         everyone   s looking at us  sarge     said nobby .  doors and windows had opened all along the street .      and don   t call me sarge when we   re in plain clothes .         right you are  fred .         that   s       colon hesitated in an agony of status .     well  that   s frederick to you  nobby .         and they   re giggling  fred   er   erick .         we don   t want to make a cock up of this  nobby .         right  frederick .  and that   s cecil  thank you .         cecil .         that is my name     said nobby coldly .      have it your way     said colon .     just remember who   s the superior civilian around here  all right .      he hammered on the door again .      we hear you   ve got a room to let  missus .     he yelled .      brilliant  frederick     said nobby .     that was bloody brilliant .         well  i am the sergeant  right .     colon whispered .      no .         er   yeah   right   well  just you remember that  right .      the door snapped open .   the woman within had one of those faces that had settled over the years  as though it had been made of butter and then left in the sun .  but age hadn   t been able to do much with her hair .  it was a violent ginger and piled up like a threatening thunderhead .      room .  you shoulda said     she said .     two dollars a week  no pets  no cookin     no wimmin after six a . m .   if you don   t want it thousands do  are you with the circus .  you look like you   re with the circus .          we   re       colon began  and then stopped .  there were undoubtedly a large number of things to be apart from policemen  but there and then he couldn   t think of any of them .         actors     said nobby .      then it   s payment a week in advance     said the woman .     and no filthy foreign habits .  this is a respectable house     she added  in defiance of evidence so far .      we ought to see the room first     said colon .      oh  the choosy sort  eh .      she led them upstairs .   the room vacated so terminally by ossie was small and bare .  a few items of clothing hung on nails in the wall  and a heap of wrappers and greasy bags indicated that ossie had been a man who ate  as it were  off the street .      whose is this stuff .     said sergeant colon .      oh  he   s gone now .  i told him he   d be out if he didn   t pay up .  i   ll throw it out afore you settle in .         we   ll get rid of it for you     said sergeant colon .  he fumbled in his pouch and produced a couple of dollars .     here you are  miss    .         mrs .  spent     said mrs .  spent .  she gave them a lopsided look .     are you both stopping here or what .         nah  i   ve just come along as his chaperon     said colon  giving her a friendly grin .     he has to fight women off when they find out about his sexual magnetism .      mrs .  spent gave the shocked nobby a sharp look and bustled out of the room .      what   d you go and say that for .     said nobby .      it   s got rid of her  hasn   t it .         you were having a go at me  don   t deny it .  just because i   m going through a bit of an emotional wossname  eh .         it was just a joke  nobby .  just a joke .      nobby peered under the narrow bed .      wow .     he said  all emotional wossnames forgotten .      what is it .  what is it .     said colon .      it looks like a complete run of bows and ammo .  and       nobby pulled another stack of badly engraved magazines out into the light     here   s warrior of fortune  look .  and practical siege weapons        colon leafed through page after page of very similar looking people holding very similar weapons of personal destruction .      you got to be a bit odd to sit around all day reading this kind of thing     he said .      yeah     said nobby .     here  don   t put that one back  that   s last august   s issue  i ain   t got that one .  hang on  there   s a box right at the back        he wriggled out  towing a small box with him .  it was locked  but the cheap metal gave way when he accidentally levered at the lid .   silver coins gleamed .  lots and lots of them .      whoops       he muttered .     we   re in trouble now           that   s klatchian money  that is .     said colon .     sometimes people slip you one instead of a half dollar in your change .  look  there   s all curly writing on them .         we   re in big trouble     said nobby .      no  no  no  this is a clue what we have found by patient detectoring     said sergeant colon .     and it   s going to be a feather in our caps and no mistake when mister vimes hears about it .         how much do you reckon there is .         got to be hundreds and hundreds of dollars    worth     said colon .     and that   s a lot of money to a klatchian .  you can probably live like a king for a year on a dollar  in klatch .         it wasn   t very patient detectoring     said nobby doubtfully .     all i did was look under the bed .         ah  but that   s because you is trained     said colon .     your basic civilian wouldn   t think of that  right .  ah  it all begins to make sense .         does it .  why would the klatchians give him money to shoot a klatchian .     said nobby .   colon tapped the side of his nose .     politics     he said .      ah  politics     said nobby .     ah  well  politics .  i see .  politics .  right .  so why .         aha     said colon again  tapping the other side of his nose .      why   re you picking your nose  sarge .         i   m tapping it     said colon severely .     that   s to show i   m in the know .         in the nose     said nobby cheerfully .      it   s just the sort of underhand cunning thing they   d do     said colon .      payin    us to kill them .     said nobby .      ah  you see  some klatchian nob gets topped here  and then they can send a snotty note saying     you killed our big nob  you foreign nephews of dogs  this means war .     see .  a perfect excuse .         do you need an excuse to have a war .     said nobby .     i mean  who for .  can   t you just say     you got lots of cash and land but i   ve got a big sword so divvy up right now  chop chop .     that   s what i   d do     said corporal nobbs  military strategist .     and i wouldn   t even say that until after i   d attacked .         ah  but that   s    cos you don   t know about politics     said colon .     you can   t do that stuff anymore .  mark my words  this case has got politics written all over it .  that   s why old vimes put me on it  depend upon it .  politics .  young carrot   s all very well  but you need an experienced man of the world in these delicate political situations .         you   ve certainly got the nose tapping just right     said nobby .     i generally miss .      but he felt troubled  if not in his nose then in whatever small organ propelled his blood around his body .  this didn   t feel right .  nothing much in nobby   s life had ever felt right  so he knew very well how the feeling felt .   he looked up at the bare walls and down at the rough floorboards .      there   s a bit of sand on the floor     he said .      another clue  then     said colon happily .     a klatchian has been here .  bugger all else but sand in klatch .  still got some in his sandals .      nobby opened the window .  it gave on to a gently sloping roof .  someone could get through it easily and be away over the tiles and into the maze of chimneys .      he could   ve gone in and out this way  sarge     he volunteered .      good point  nobby .  write that down .  evidence of conniving and sneaking around .      nobby peered down .     here  there   s glass outside  fred        sergeant colon joined him at the stricken window .  one of the panes had been smashed .  outside  glass glittered on the tiles .      that could be a clue  eh .     said nobby  hopefully .      it certainly is     said sergeant colon .     see the glass fell outside the window .  everyone knows you look at which way the glass falls .  i reckon he was just testing his bow and it went off while it was loaded .         that   s clever  sarge     said nobby .      that   s detectoring     said colon .     it   s no good just looking at things  nobby .  you got to think straight  too .         cecil  sarge .         that   s frederick  cecil .  come on  i think we   ve wrapped this up nicely .  old vimes says he wants a report toot sweet .      nobby looked out of the broken window .  the roof abutted the end wall of a much larger warehouse .  for a moment he found himself thinking bendy rather than straight  but he reasoned that his thinking was only a corporal   s thinking  and worth far less per thought than a sergeant   s thinking  so he kept his private thoughts to himself .   as they went downstairs mrs .  spent watched them suspiciously through a barely opened doorway at the far end of the hall  clearly ready to slam it shut at the first suggestion of any sexual magnetism .      it   s not as if i even know where to get a sexual magnet     nobby muttered .     and she didn   t even laugh .            also  we went to the bow shops in the street of cunning artificers and showed the iconograph to the man in burleigh and stronginthearm  who vouchsafed  that is him  e . g .   he was referring to the diseased        oh  my       vimes   s lips moved slightly as his gaze went back up the page .      also in addition to the klatchian money you could tell one of them had been there because of  e . g .   the sand on the floor        he   d still got sand in his sandals .     murmured vimes .     good grief .         sam .      vimes looked up from his reading .      your soup will be cold     said lady sybil from the far end of the table .     you   ve been holding that spoonful in the air for the last five minutes by the clock .         sorry  dear .         what are you reading .         oh  just a little masterpiece     said vimes  pushing fred colon   s report aside .      interesting  is it .     said lady sybil a little sourly .      practically unparalleled     said vimes .     the only things they haven   t found are the bunch of dates and the camel hidden under the pillow        belatedly  his nuptial radar detected a certain chilliness from the far side of the cruet .      is  er  there something wrong  dear .     he said .      can you remember when we last had dinner together  sam .         tuesday  wasn   t it .         that was the guild of merchants    annual dinner  sam .      vimes   s brow wrinkled .     but you were there  too  weren   t you .      a further subtle change in the dragonhouse quotient told him that this was not a well chosen answer .      and then you rushed off afterward because of that business with the barber in gleam street .         sweeney jones     said vimes .     well  he was killing people  sybil .  the best you could say is that he didn   t mean to .  he was just very bad at shaving           but you didn   t have to go  i   m sure .         policing   s a twenty four hour job  dear .         only for you .  your constables do their ten hours and that   s it .  but you   re always working .  it   s not good for you .  you   re always running around during the day  and when i wake up in the middle of the night there   s always a cold space beside me        the dots hung in the air  the ghosts of words unsaid .  little things  thought vimes .  that   s how a war starts .      there   s so much to do  sybil     he said  as patiently as he could .      there   s always been a lot to do .  and the bigger the watch gets the more there is to do  have you noticed that .      vimes nodded .  that was true .  rotas  receipts  notebooks  reports   the watch might or might not be making a difference in the city  but it was certainly frightening a lot of trees .      you ought to delegate     said lady sybil .      so he tells me     muttered vimes .      pardon .         just thinking aloud  dear .     vimes pushed the paperwork away .     i   ll tell you what   let   s have an evening in     he said .     there   s a nice fire in the drawing room           er   no  sam  there isn   t .         hasn   t young forthright lit it .     forthright was the boy  it came as news to vimes that this was an official servant position  but the boy   s job was to light the fires  clean the privies  help the gardener and take the blame .      he   s gone off to be a drummer boy in the duke of eorle   s regiment     said lady sybil .      him too .  he seemed a bright lad .  isn   t he too young .         he said he was going to lie about his age .         i hope he lies about his musical ability .  i   ve heard him whistling .     vimes shook his head .     whatever possessed him to do such a daft thing .         he thinks the uniform will impress the girls .      sybil gave him a gentle smile .  an evening at home suddenly began to seem very inviting .      well  it won   t take a genius to find the woodshed     said vimes .     and then we can bolt the doors and        one of the aforesaid doors shook to the sound of frantic knocking .   vimes caught sybil   s gaze .      go on  then .  answer it     she sighed  and sat down .   the door admitted corporal littlebottom  seriously out of breath .      you   got to come quick  sir   it   s   murder this   time .      vimes looked helplessly at his wife .      of course you must go     she said .      angua brushed out her hair in front of the mirror .      i don   t like this     said carrot .     it   s not a proper way to behave .      she patted him on the shoulder .     don   t worry     she said .     vimes explained it all .  you   re acting as though we   re doing something wrong .         i like being a watchman     said carrot  still in the mournful depths .     and you   ve got to wear a uniform .  if you don   t wear a uniform it   s like spying on people .  he knows i think that .      angua looked at his short red hair and honest ears .      i   ve taken a lot of the work off his shoulders     carrot went on .     he doesn   t have to go on patrol at all  but he still tries to do everything .         perhaps he doesn   t want you to be quite so helpful .     said angua  as tactfully as possible .      it   s not as if he   s getting any younger  either .  i   ve tried to point that out .         that was kind of you .         and i   ve never worn plainclothes .         on you they   ll never be very plain     said angua  pulling on her coat .  it was a relief to be out of that armor .  as for carrot  there was no disguising him .  the size  the ears  the red hair  the expression of muscular good naturedness        i suppose a werewolf is in plain clothes all the time  when you think about it     said carrot .      thank you  carrot .  and you are absolutely right .         i just don   t feel comfortable  living a lie .         walk a mile on these paws .         pardon .         oh   nothing .         goriff   s son janil had been angry .  he didn   t know why .  the anger was built up of a lot of things .  the fire bomb last night was a big part .  so were some of the words he   d been hearing in the street .  he   d had an argument with his father about sending that food round to the watch house this morning .  they were an official part of the city .  they had those stupid badges .  they had uniforms .  he was angry about a lot of things  including the fact that he was thirteen .   so when  at nine in the evening while his father was baking bread  the door had slammed back and a man had rushed in  janil had pulled his father   s elderly crossbow from under the counter and aimed it where he thought the heart was and pulled the trigger .      carrot stamped his feet once or twice and looked around .      here     he said .     i was standing here .  and the prince was   in that direction .      angua obediently walked across the square .  several people turned to look curiously at carrot .      all right   stop   no  on a bit   stop   turn a little bit to the left   i mean my left   back a bit   now throw your arms up        he walked over to her and followed her gaze .      he was shot from the university .         looks like the library building     said angua .     but a wizard wouldn   t do it  surely .  they keep out of that sort of thing .         oh  it   s not too hard to get in there  even when the gates are shut     said carrot .     let   s try the unofficial way  shall we .         okay .  carrot .         yes .         the false moustache   it   s not you  you know .  and the nose is far too pink .         doesn   t it make me look inconspicuous .         no .  and the hat   i should lose the hat  too .  it is a good hat     she added quickly .     but a brown bowler   it   s not your style .  it doesn   t suit you .         exactly .     said carrot .     if it was my style  people would know it   s me  right .         i mean it makes you look like a twerp  carrot .         do i normally look like a twerp .         no  not           aha .     carrot fumbled in the pocket of his large brown overcoat .     i got this book of disguises from the joke shop in phedre road  look .  funny thing  nobby was in there buying stuff  too .  i asked him why and he said it was desperate measures .  what d   you think he meant by that .         i can   t imagine     said angua .      it   s just amazing the stuff they   ve got .  false hair  false noses  false beards  even false       he hesitated  and began to blush .     even false   you know  chests .  for ladies .  but i can   t imagine for the life of me why they   d want to disguise those .      he probably couldn   t  angua thought .  she took the very small book from carrot and glanced through it .  she sighed .      carrot  these disguises are meant for a potato .         are they .         look  they   re all on potatoes  see .         i thought that was just for display .         carrot  it   s got    mr .  spuddy face    on it .      behind his thick black moustache carrot looked hurt and perplexed .     what does a potato want a disguise for .     he said .   they   d reached the alley alongside the university that had been known informally as scholars    entry for so many centuries that this was now on a nameplate at one end .  a couple of student wizards went past .   the unofficial entrance to the university has always been known only to students .  what most students failed to remember was that the senior members of the faculty had also been students once  and also liked to get out and about after the official shutting of the gates .  this naturally led to a certain amount of embarrassment and diplomacy on dark evenings .   carrot and angua waited patiently as a few more students climbed over  followed by the dean .      good evening  sir     said carrot  politely .      good evening to you  spuddy     said the dean  and ambled off into the night .      you see .         ah  but he didn   t call me carrot     said carrot .     the principle is sound .      they dropped down onto lawns of academia and headed for the library .      it   ll be shut     said angua .      remember  we have a man on the inside     said carrot  and knocked .   the door opened a little way .     ook .      carrot raised his horrible little round hat .      good evening  sir  i wonder if we could come in .  it   s watch business .         ook eek ook .         er           what did he say .     said angua .      if you must know  he said     my goodness me  a walking potato        said carrot .   the librarian wrinkled his nose at angua .  he did not like the smell of werewolves .  but he beckoned them inside and then left them waiting while he knuckled back to his desk and rummaged in a drawer .  he produced a watch special constable   s badge on a string  which he hung around the general area where his neck should have been  and then stood as much to attention as an orangutan can  which is not a great deal .  the central ape gets the idea but outlying areas are slow to catch on .      ook ook .         was that    how may i be of assistance  captain tuber .        said angua .      we need to have a look on the fifth floor  over looking the square     said carrot  a shade coldly .      ook oook   ook .         he says that   s just old storerooms     said carrot .      and that last    ook    .     said angua .         mr .  horrible hat        said carrot .      still  he hasn   t worked out who you are  eh .     said angua .   the fifth floor was a corridor of airless rooms  smelling sadly of old  unwanted books .  they were stacked not on shelves but on wide racks  bundled up with string .  a lot of them were battered and missing their covers .  judging by what remained  though  they were old textbooks that not even the most ardent bibliophile could treasure .   carrot picked up a torn copy of woddeley   s occult primer .  several loose pages fell out .  angua picked one up .         chapter fifteen  elementary necromancy        she read aloud .        lesson one  correct use of shovel           she put it down again and sniffed the air .  the presence of the librarian filled the nasal room like an elephant in a matchbox  but        someone else has been in here     she said .     in the last couple of days .  could you leave us  sir .  when it comes to odors  you   re a bit   forthright           ook .      the librarian nodded at carrot  shrugged at angua and ambled out .      don   t move     said angua .     stay right where you are  carrot .  don   t disturb the air        she inched forward carefully .   her ears told her the librarian was down the corridor  because she could hear the floorboards creaking .  but her nose told her that he was still here .  he was a little fuzzy  but        i   m going to have to change     she said .     i can   t get a proper picture this way .  it   s too strange .      carrot obediently shut his eyes .  she   d forbidden him to watch her en route from a human to a wolf  because of the unpleasant nature of the shapes in between .  back in   berwald people went from one shape to the other as naturally as ordinary humans would put on a different coat  but even there it was considered polite to do it behind a bush .   when he reopened them angua was slinking forward  her whole being concentrated in her nose .   the olfactory presence of the librarian was a complex shape  a mere purple blur where he had been moving but almost a solid figure where he   d been standing still .  hands  face  lips   they   d be just the center of an expanding cloud in a few hours    time  but now she could still smell them out .   there must be only the tiniest air currents in here .  there weren   t even any flies buzzing in the dead air to cause a ripple of disturbance .   she edged nearer to the window .  vision was a mere shadowy presence  providing a charcoal sketch of a room over which the scents painted their glorious colors .   by the window   by the window     yes .  a man had stood there  and by the scent of it he hadn   t moved for some time .  the smell wavered in the air  on the edge of her nasal skill .  the curling  billowing traces said that the window had been opened and closed again  and was there just the merest  tiniest suggestion that he   d held an arm out in front of him .   her nose raced  trying to form original shapes from the patterns hanging in the room like dead smoke     when she   d finished  angua went back to her pile of clothes and coughed politely while she was pulling on her boots .      there was a man standing by the window     she said .     long hair  a bit dry  stinks of expensive shampoo .  he was the man who nailed the boards back after ossie got into the barbican .         are you sure .         is this nose ever wrong .         sorry .  go on .         i   d say he was heavyset  a bit bulky for his height .  he doesn   t wash a lot  but when he does he uses windpike   s soap  the cheap brand .  but expensive shampoo  which is odd .  quite new boots .  and a green coat .         you can smell the color .         no .  the dye .  it comes from sto lat  i think .  and   i think he shot a bow .  an expensive bow .  there   s a hint of silk in the air  and that   s what the strongest bowstrings are made of  isn   t it .  and you wouldn   t put one of those on a cheap bow .      carrot stood by the window .     he got a good view     he said  and looked down at the floor .  and then at the sill .  and on the shelves nearby .      how long was he here .         two or three hours  i   d say .         he didn   t move around much .         no .         or smoke  or spit .  he just stood and waited .  a professional .  mr .  vimes was right .         a lot more professional than ossie     said angua .      green coat     said carrot  as if thinking aloud .     green coat  green coat           oh   and bad dandruff     said angua  standing up .      snowy slopes .  .     shouted carrot .      what .         really bad dandruff .         oh  yes  it           that   s why they call him snowy     said carrot .     daceyville slopes  the man with the reinforced comb .  but i   d heard he   d moved to sto lat        in unison they said        where the dye comes from           is he good with a bow .     said angua .      very good .  he   s good at killing people he never met  too .         he   s an assassin  is he .         oh  no .  he just kills people for money .  no style .  snowy can barely read and write .      carrot scratched his head in sympathetic recollection .     he doesn   t even look at complicated pictures .  we   d have got him last year  but he shook his head fast and got away while we were trying to dig out nobby .  well  well .  i wonder where he   s staying .         don   t ask me to follow him in these streets .  thousands of people will have walked over the trail .         oh  there   s people who will know .  someone sees everything in this town .         mr .  slopes .   snowy slopes gingerly felt his neck  or at least the neck of his soul .  the human soul tends to keep to the shape of the original body for some time after death .  habit is a wonderful thing .      who the hell was he .     he said .   not someone you know .  said death .      well  no .  i don   t know many people who cut my head off .      snowy slopes   s body had knocked against the table as it fell .  several bottles of medicated shampoo now dripped and mixed their contents into the other more intimate fluids from the slopes corpse .      that stuff with the special oil in it cost me nearly four dollars     said snowy .  yet  somehow  it all seemed slightly   irrelevant now .  death happens to other people .  the other person in this case had been him .  that is  the one down there .  not the one standing here looking at it .  in life  snowy hadn   t even been able to spell    metaphysical     but he was already beginning to view life in a different way .  from the outside  for a start .      four dollars     he repeated .     i never even had time to try it .      it wouldn   t have worked  said death  patting the man on a fading shoulder .  but  if i might suggest that you look on the bright side  it will no longer be necessary .      no more dandruff .     said snowy  now quite transparent and fading fast .   ever  said death .  trust me on this .      commander vimes ran down darkened streets  trying to buckle on his breastplate as he ran .      all right  cheery  what   s happening .         they say a klatchian killed someone  sir .  there   s a mob up in scandal alley and it   s looking bad .  i was on the desk and i thought you ought to be told  sir .         right .         and anyway i couldn   t find captain carrot  sir .      a little bit of acid ink scribbled its subtle entry on the ledger of vimes   s soul .      oh  gods   so who   s the officer in charge .         sergeant detritus  sir .      it seemed to the dwarf that she was suddenly standing still .  commander vimes had become a rapidly disappearing blur .      with the calm expression of someone who was methodically doing his duty  detritus picked up a man and used him to hit some other men .  when he had a clear area around him and a groaning heap of former rioters  he climbed the heap and cupped his hands round his mouth .      listen to me  youse people .      a troll shouting at the top of his voice could easily be heard above a riot .  when he seemed to have their attention he pulled a scroll out of his breastplate and waved it over his head .      dis is der riot act     he said .     you know what dat means .  it means if   n i reads it out and youse don   t disb   disp   go away  der watch can use deadly force  you unnerstand .         what did you just use  then .     moaned someone from underneath his feet .      dat was you helpin    der watch     said detritus  shifting his weight .   he unrolled the scroll .   although there was some scuffling in alleyways and shouts from the next street  a ring of silence expanded outward from the troll .  an almost genetic component of the citizens of ankh morpork was their ability to spot an opportunity for amusement .   detritus held the document at arm   s length .  and then a few inches from his face .  he tried turning it round a few times .   his lips moved uneasily .   finally  he leaned down and showed it to constable visit .      what dis word .         that   s    whereby     sergeant .         i knew dat .      he straightened up again .         whereby   it is          beads of the troll equivalent of sweat began to form on detritus   s forehead .        whereby it is   ack no legg ed              acknowledged     whispered constable visit .      i knew dat .     detritus stared at the paper again  and then gave up .     youse don   t want to stand here listenin    to me all day .     he bellowed .     dis is der riot act and you   ve all got to read it  right .  pass it round .         what if we don   t read it .     said a voice in the crowd .      you got to read it .  it legal .         and then what happens .         den i shoot you     said detritus .      that   s not allowed .     said another voice .     you   ve got to shout    stop .  armed watchman .     first .         sure  dat suits me     said detritus .  he shrugged one huge shoulder to bring his crossbow under his arm .  it was a siege bow  intended to be mounted on the cart .  the bolt was six feet long .     it harder to hit runnin    targets .      he released the safety catch .      anyone finishing readin    dat thing yet .         sergeant .      vimes pushed his way through the crowd .  and it was a crowd now .  ankh morpork was always a good audience .   there was a clang as detritus saluted .      were you proposing to shoot these people in cold blood  sergeant .         nossir .  just a warning shot inna head  sir .         really .  just give me a moment to talk to them  then .      vimes looked at the man next to him .  he was holding a flaming torch in one hand and a long length of wood in the other .  he gave vimes the nervously defiant stare of someone who has just felt the ground shift under his feet .   vimes pulled the torch toward him and lit a cigar .     what   s happening here  friend .         the klatchians have been shooting people  mr .  vimes .  unprovoked attack .         really .         people have been killed .         who .         i   there were   everyone knows they   ve been killing people .     the man   s mental footsteps found safer ground .     who do they think they are  coming over           that   s enough     said vimes .  he stood back and raised his voice .      i recognize a lot of you     he said .     and i know you   ve got homes to go to .  see this .     he pulled his baton of office out of his pocket .     this says i   ve got to keep the peace .  so in ten seconds i   m going somewhere else to find some peace to keep  but detritus is going to stay here .  and i just hope he doesn   t do anything to disgrace the uniform .  or get it very dirty  at least .      irony was not a degree level subject among the listeners  but the brighter ones recognized vimes   s expression .  it said that here was a man hanging on to his patience by his teeth .   the mob dispersed  going ragged at the edges as people legged it down side alleys  threw away their makeshift weapons and emerged at the other end walking the grave  thoughtful walk of honest citizens .      all right  what happened .     said vimes  turning to the troll .      we   re hearing where dis boy shot dis man     said detritus .     we got here  next minute it rainin    people from everywhere  shoutin    .         he smote him as hudrun smote the fleshpots of ur     said constable visit .       smote .     said vimes  bewildered .     he killed someone .         not by der way der man was cussing  sir     said detritus .     hit him in der arm .  his friends brought him round der watch house to complain .  he a baker on der night shift .  he said he was late for work  he come runnin    in to pick up his dinner  next minute he flat on der floor .      vimes walked across the street and tried the door of the shop .  it opened a little way  and then fetched up against what seemed to be a barricade .  furniture had been piled up against the window as well .      how many people were there  constable .         a multitude thereof  sir .      and four people in here  thought vimes .  a family .  the door moved a fraction and vimes realized he was ducking even before the crossbow protruded .   there was the thung of the string .  the bolt tumbled rather than sped .  it corkscrewed wildly across the alley and was almost moving sideways when it hit the opposite wall .      look     said vimes  keeping his body down but raising his voice .     anyone who got hit with that  it must have been an accident .  this is the watch .  open the door .  otherwise detritus will open it .  and when he opens a door  it stays open .  you know what i mean .      there was no reply .      all right .  detritus  just step over here        there was a hissed argument inside  and then the sound of scraping as furniture was moved .   he tried the door .  it swung inward .   the family were at the far end of the room .  vimes felt eight eyes on him .  the atmosphere had a hot  worrying feel  spiced with the smell of burnt food .   mr .  goriff was holding the crossbow gingerly  and the expression on his son   s face told vimes a lot of what he needed to know .      all right     he said .     now you all listen to me .  i   m not arresting anyone right now  you hear .  this sounds like one of those things that make his lordship yawn .  but you   d do better spending the rest of the night in the watch house .  i can   t spare the men to stand guard here .  do you understand .  i could arrest you .  but this is just a request .      mr .  goriff cleared his throat .      the man i shot       he began  and left the question and the lie hanging in the air .   vimes forced himself not to glance at the boy .     not badly hurt     he said .      he   ran in     said mr .  goriff .     and after last night           you thought you were being attacked again and grabbed the crossbow .         yes     said the boy  defiantly  before his father could speak .   there was a brief argument in klatchian .  then mr .  goriff said      we must leave the house .         for your own good .  we   ll try to have someone watch it .  now  get something together and go off with the sergeant .  and give me that crossbow .      goriff handed it over with a look of relief .  it was a typical saturday night special  so badly made and erratic that the only safe place to be when it was fired would be directly behind it  and even then you would be running a risk .  and then no one had told its owner that under the counter in a steamy shop and a perpetual rain of grease wasn   t the best place to keep it strung .  the string sagged .  probably the only way you could reliably hurt someone with it was to beat them over the head .   vimes waited until they   d been ushered out and took a last look around the room .  it wasn   t large .  in the kitchen behind the shop something spicy in a pot was boiling dry .  after burning his fingers a couple of times he managed to tip the pot on to the fire to put it out and then  vaguely remembering his mother doing something like this  put the pot under the pump to soak .   then he barricaded the windows as best he could and went out  locking the door behind him .  a discreetly obvious brass thieves    guild plaque over the door told the world that mr .  goriff had conscientiously paid his annual fee   but the world had plenty of less formal dangers and so vimes took a piece of chalk out of his pocket and wrote on the door      under the protection of the watch     as an afterthought he signed it      sgt .  detritus     in the imaginations of the less civically minded the majesty of the rule of law didn   t carry anything like as much weight as the dread of detritus .   the riot act .  where the hell had he dredged that from .  carrot  probably .  it hadn   t been used for as long as vimes could remember  and that was no wonder when you knew what it really did .  even vetinari would hesitate to use it .  now it was nothing more than a phrase .  thank goodness for trollish illiteracy     it was when vimes stood back to admire his handiwork that he saw the glow in the sky over park lane  almost at the same time as he heard the clatter of iron boots on the street .      oh  hello  littlebottom     he said .     what now .  don   t tell me   someone   s set fire to the klatchian embassy .         all right  sir     said the dwarf .  she stood uncertainly in the middle of the alley  looking worried .      well .     said vimes .      er   you said        with a sinking feeling vimes remembered that the generic dwarfish skill with iron was matched only by the fumble fingered grasp of irony .      the klatchian embassy is really on fire .         yes  sir .         mrs .  spent opened the door a crack .      yes .         i   m a friend of       carrot hesitated  wondering if fred would have given his real name .     er   big fat man  suit doesn   t fit           the one who goes around with the sex maniac .         pardon .         skinny little twerp  dresses like a clown .         they said you   d have a room     said carrot desperately .      they   ve got it     said mrs .  spent  trying to shut the door .      they said i could use it           no sublettin    .         they said i should pay you two dollars .      the pressure of the door was released a little .      on top of what they paid .     said mrs .  spent .      of course .         well       she looked carrot up and down and sniffed .     all right .  what shift are you on .         sorry .         you   re a watchman  right .         er    carrot hesitated  and then raised his voice .     no  i am not a watchman .  haha  you think i   m a watchman .  do i look like a watchman .         yes  you do     said mrs .  spent .     you   re captain carrot .  i seen you walking about the town .  still  i suppose even coppers have to sleep somewhere .      on the roof  angua rolled her eyes .      no wimmin  no cookin     no music  no pets     said mrs .  spent  as she led the way up the creaking stairs .   angua waited in the dark until she heard the window open .      she   s gone     carrot hissed .      there   s glass on the tiles out here  just like fred reported     said angua  as she swung herself over the sill .  inside the room she took a deep breath and shut her eyes .   first she had to forget the smell of carrot   anxious sweat  soap  the lingering hints of armor polish        and fred colon  all perspiration with a hint of beer  and then the odd ointment nobby used for his skin condition  and the smells of feet  bodies  clothes  polish  fingernails     after an hour it was possible for the eye of the nose to see someone walk across the room  frozen in time by their smell .  but after a day smells crisscrossed and entangled .  you had to take them apart  remove the familiar pieces  and what you had left        they   re so mixed up .         all right  all right     said carrot soothingly .      at least three people .  but i think one of them is ossie   it   s stronger round the bed   and        she opened her eyes wide and looked down at the floor .     somewhere here .         what .  what is .      angua crouched down with her nose just above the floorboards .      i can smell it but i can   t see it .      a knife appeared in front of her .  carrot got down on his knees and ran the blade along the dust filled crack between the floorboards .   something splintery and brown popped up .  it had been trodden on and rolled underfoot  but at this distance even carrot could pick up traces of the clove smell .     do you think ossie made a lot of apple pies .     he whispered .      no cookin     remember .     said angua  and grinned .      there   s something else        carrot levered out more dirt and dust .  in it  something glittered .     fred said all the glass was outside  didn   t he .         yes .         well  supposing we assume that someone didn   t pick up all the bits when they broke in .         for someone that doesn   t like lying  carrot  you can be quite devious  you know .         just logical .  there   s glass outside the window  but all that means is that there is glass outside the window .  commander vimes always says there   re no such things as clues .  it   s how you look at them .         you think someone broke in and then carefully put the glass outside .         could be .         carrot .  why are we whispering .         no wimmin  remember .         and no pets     said angua .     so she   s got me coming and going .  don   t look like that     she added  when she saw his face .     it   s only bad taste if someone else says it .  i   m allowed .      carrot scratched up some more glass fragments .  angua looked under the bed and pulled out the battered magazines .      ye gods  do people really read this stuff .     she said  flicking through bows and ammo .        testing the locksley reflex    a whole lotta bow         footsore .  we test the ten best caltrops .       and what   s this magazine    .  warrior of fortune .         there   s always little wars somewhere     said carrot  pulling out the box of money .      but will you look at the size of this ax here .     get a head  get a burleigh and stronginthearm    streetsweeper    and win by a neck .     well  it must be true what they say about men who like big weapons           and that is .     said carrot  lifting the lid of the box .   she looked at the top of his head .  as always  carrot radiated innocence like a small sun .  but he   d   they   d   surely he        they  er   they   re rather small     she said .      oh  that   s true     said carrot  picking up some of the klatchian coins .     look at dwarfs .  never happier than with a chopper the same size as them .  and nobby   s fascinated by weapons and he   s practically dwarf sized .         er        technically  angua was sure she knew carrot better than anyone else .  she was pretty sure he cared a lot for her .  he seldom said so  he just assumed that she knew .  she   d known other men  although turning into a wolf for part of the month was one of those little flaws that could put any normal man off and  up until carrot  always had .  and she knew the sort of things men said in what might be called the heat of the moment and then forgot .  but when carrot said things  you knew that he felt that everything was now settled until further notice  so if she made any comment he   d be genuinely surprised that she   d forgotten what it was he had said and would probably quote date and time .   and yet all the time there was this feeling that the greater part of him was always deep  deep inside  looking out .  no one could be so simple  no one could be so creatively dumb  without being very intelligent .  it was like being an actor .  only a very good actor was any good at being a bad actor .      rather a lonely person  our nobby     said carrot .      well  yes           but i   m sure he   ll find the right person for him     carrot added  cheerfully .   probably in a bottle  said angua to herself .  she remembered the conversation with him .  it was a terrible thing to think  but there was something itchy about the thought of nobby being allowed in the gene pool  even at the shallow end .      you know  these coins are odd     said carrot .      how do you mean .     said angua  grateful for the distraction .      why would he be paid in klatchian wols .  he wouldn   t be able to spend them here  and the money changers don   t give very good rates .     carrot tossed a coin in the air and caught it .     when we were leaving  mr .  vimes said to me     make sure you find the bunch of dates and the camel hidden under the pillow .     i think i know what he meant .         sand on the floor     said angua .     now  isn   t that an obvious clue .  you can tell they were klatchian because of the sand in their sandals .         but these cloves       carrot prodded the little bud .     it   s not as if it   s a common habit  even among klatchians .  that   s not a very obvious clue  is it .         it smells newer     said angua .     i   d say he was here last night .         after ossie was dead .         yes .         why .         how should i know .  what kind of name is    hour ahmed .     said angua .   carrot shrugged .     i don   t know .  i think mr .  vimes thinks that someone in ankh morpork wants us to believe that klatchians paid to have the prince killed .  that sounds   nasty but logical .  but i don   t understand why a real klatchian would get involved        their eyes met .      politics .     they said together .      for enough money  a lot of people would do anything     said angua .   there was a sudden and ferocious knocking at the door .      have you got someone in there .     said mrs .  spent .      out of the window .     said carrot .      why don   t i just stay and rip her throat out .     said angua .     all right  all right  it was a joke  all right .     she said  swinging her legs over the sill .      ankh morpork no longer had a fire brigade .  the citizens had a rather disturbingly direct way of thinking at times  and it did not take long for people to see the rather obvious flaw in paying a group of people by the number of fires they put out .  the penny really dropped shortly after charcoal tuesday .   since then they had relied on the good old principle of enlightened self interest .  people living close to a burning building did their best to douse the fire  because the thatch they saved might be their own .   but the crowd watching the burning embassy were doing so in a hollow eyed  distant way  as if it was all taking place on some distant planet .   they moved aside automatically as vimes elbowed his way through to the space in front of the gates .  flames were already licking from every ground floor window  and they could make out scurrying silhouettes in the flickering light .   he turned to the crowd .     come on .  what   s up with you .  get a bucket chain going .         it   s their bloody embassy     said a voice .      yeah .     s klatchian soil  right .         can   t go on klatchian soil .         that   d be an invasion  that would .         they wouldn   t let us     said a small boy holding a bucket .   vimes looked at the embassy gateway .  there were a couple of guards .  their worried glances kept going back from the fire behind them to the crowd in front .  they were nervous men  but it was much worse than that  because they were nervous men holding big swords .   he advanced on them  trying to smile and holding his badge out in front of him .  it had a shield on it .  it was not a very big shield .      commander vimes  ankh morpork city watch     he said  in what he hoped was a helpful and friendly voice .   a guard waved him away .     hyou be off .         ah       said vimes .  he looked down at the cobbles of the gateway and then back up at the guard .  somewhere in the flames someone was screaming .      you .  come here .  you see this .     he shouted at the guard  pointing down .  the man took a hesitant step forward .      that   s ankh morpork soil down there  my friend     said vimes .     and you   re standing on it and you   re obstructing me in my       he rammed his fist as hard as he could into the guard   s stomach       duty .      he was already kicking out as the other guard rushed him .  he caught him on the knee .  something went click .  it felt like vimes   s own ankle .   cursing and limping slightly  he ran on into the embassy and caught a scurrying man by his robe .      are there people still in there .  are there people in there .      the man gave vimes a panicky look .  the armfuls of paper he   d been carrying spilled on to the ground .   someone else grabbed his shoulder .     can you climb  mr .  vimes .         who   re        the newcomer turned to the cowering paper carrier and struck him heavily across the face .     rescuer of paper .      as the man fell back his turban was snatched from his head .      this way .     the figure plunged off through the smoke .  vimes hurried after him until they reached a wall  with a drainpipe attached .      how did you    .         up .  up .      vimes put one foot in the man   s cupped hands  managed to get the other one on a bracket  and forced himself upward .      hurry .      he managed to half climb  half pull himself up the pipe  little fireworks of pain exploding up and down his legs as he reached a parapet and hauled himself over .  the other man rose behind him as if he   d run up the wall .   there was a strip of cloth hiding the lower half of his face .  he thrust another strip toward vimes .      across your nose and mouth .     he commanded .     for the smoke .      it was boiling across the roof .  beside vimes a chimneypot gushed a roaring tongue of flame .   the rest of the unwound turban was thrust into his hands .      you take this side  i   ll take the other     said the apparition  and darted away again into the smoke .      but wh        vimes could feel the heat through his boots .  he edged away across the roof  and heard the shouting coming from below .   when he leaned over the edge here he could see the window some way below him .  someone had smashed a pane  because a hand was waving .   there was more commotion down in the courtyard .  amid a press of figures he could make out the huge shape of constable dorfl  a golem and quite definitely fireproof .  but dorfl was bad enough at stairs as it was .  there weren   t many that could take the weight .   the hand in the smoke stopped waving .   vimes looked down again .   can you fly  mr .  vimes .   he looked at the chimney  belching flame .   he looked at the unwound turban .   a lot of sam vimes   s brain had shut down  although the bits relaying the twinges of pain from his legs were operating with distressing efficiency .  but there were still some thoughts operating down around the core  and they delivered for his consideration the insight      tough looking cloth     he looked back at the chimney .  it looked stout enough .   the window was about six feet below .   vimes began to move automatically .   so  purely theoretically  if a man were to wrap one end of the cloth round the belching stack like this and pay it out like this and lower himself over the parapet like this and kick himself away from the wall like this  then when he swung back again his feet ought to be able to smash his way through the other panes of the window  like this        a cart squeaked along the wet street .  its progress was erratic because no two of its wheels were the same size  so it rocked and wobbled and skidded and probably involved more effort to pull than it saved overall  especially since its contents appeared to be rubbish .  but then  so did its owner .   who was about the size of a man  but bent almost double  and was covered with hair or rags or quite possibly a matted mixture of both that was so felted and unwashed that small plants had taken root on it .  if the thing had stopped walking and crouched down  it would have given an astonishingly good impression of a long neglected compost heap .  as it walked along  it snuffled .   a foot was stuck out to impede its progress .      good evening  stoolie     said carrot as the cart halted .   the heap stopped .  part of it tilted upward .      geroff     it muttered  from somewhere in the thatch .      now  now  stoolie  let   s help one another  shall we .  you help me  and i   ll help you .         b   g   r       ff  c   p   r .         well  you tell me things i want to know     said carrot     and i won   t search your cart .         i hate gnolls     said angua .     they smell awful .         oh  that   s hardly fair .  the streets   d be a lot dirtier without you and yours  eh  stoolie .     said carrot  still speaking quite pleasantly .     you pick up this  you pick up that  maybe bash it against a wall until it stops struggling              s a vile accur   cy     said the gnoll .  there was a bubbling noise that might have been a chuckle .      so i   m hearing you might know where snowy slopes is these days     said carrot .      d   nno n   thin    .         fine .     carrot produced a three tined garden fork and walked round to the cart  which dripped .      d   nno n   thin    ab   t       said the gnoll quickly .      yes .     said carrot  fork poised .      d   nno n   thin    ab   t t    sweetsh   p    n m   ney tr   p l   ne .         the one with the rooms to let sign .         r   t .         well done .  thank you for being a good citizen     said carrot .     incidentally  we passed a dead seagull on the way here .  it   s in brewer street .  i bet if you hurried you could beat the rush .         h   t d   gg   ty     snuffled the gnoll .  the cart started to judder forward .  the watchmen watched it lurch and scrape around the corner .      they   re good fellows at heart     said carrot .     i think it says a lot for the spirit of tolerance in this city that even gnolls can call it home .         they turn my stomach     said angua  as they set off again .     that one had plants growing on him .         mr .  vimes says we ought to do something for them     said carrot .      all heart  that man .         with a flamethrower  he says .         wouldn   t work .  too soggy .  has anyone ever really found out what they eat .         it   s better to think of them as   cleaners .  you certainly don   t see as much rubbish and dead animals on the streets as you used to .         yes  but have you ever seen a gnoll with a brush and shovel .         well  that   s society for you  i   m afraid     said carrot .     everything is dumped on the people below until you find someone who   s prepared to eat it .  that   s what mr .  vimes says .         yes     said angua .  they walked in silence for a while  and then she said     you care a lot about what mr .  vimes says  don   t you    .         he is a fine officer and an example to us all .         and   you   ve never thought of getting a job in quirm or somewhere  have you .  the other cities are headhunting ankh morpork watchmen now .         what  leave ankh morpork .     the tone of voice included the answer .      no   i suppose not     said angua sadly .      anyway  i don   t know what mr .  vimes would do without me running around all the time .         it   s a point of view  certainly     said angua .   it wasn   t far to money trap lane .  it was in a ghetto of what lord rust would probably call    skilled artisans     the people too low down the social scale to be movers and shakers but slightly too high to be easily moved or shook .  the sanders and polishers  generally .  the people who hadn   t got very much but were proud even of that .  there were little clues .  shiny house numbers  for a start .  and  on the walls of houses that were effectively just one long continuous row  after centuries of building and inbuilding  very careful boundaries in the paint where people had brushed up to the very border of their property and not a gnat   s blink to each side .  carrot always said it showed the people were the kind who instinctively realized that civilization was based on a shared respect for ownership  angua thought they were just tight little bastards who   d sell you the time of day .   carrot walked noiselessly down the alley beside the sweetshop .  there was a rough wooden staircase going up to the first floor .  he pointed silently to the midden below it .   it seemed to consist almost entirely of bottles .      big drinker .     angua mouthed .  carrot shook his head .   she crouched down and looked at the labels  but her nose was already giving her a hint .  dibbler   s homoeopathic shampoo .  mere and stingbat   s herbal wash   with herbs .  rinse    n    run scalp tonic   with extra herbs .      there were others .  herbs  she thought .  chuck a handful of weeds in the pot and you   ve got herbs     carrot was starting up the stairs when she put her hand on his shoulder .  there was another smell .  it was one that drove through all the other scents of the streets like a spear .  it was one that a werewolf   s nose is particularly attuned to .   he nodded and went carefully to the door .  then he pointed down .  there was a stain under the gap .   carrot drew his sword and kicked the door open .   daceyville slopes hadn   t taken his condition lightly .  bottles of all shapes and colors occupied most flat surfaces  giving testimony to the alchemist   s art and humanity   s optimism .   the suds of his latest experiment were still in a bowl on the table  and his body on the floor had a towel around his neck .  the watchmen looked down at it .  snowy had cleaned  washed and gone .      i think we can say life is extinct     said carrot .      yuk     said angua .  she grabbed the open shampoo bottle and sniffed deeply .  the sickly scent of marinated herbs assailed her sinuses  but anything was better than the sharp  beguiling smell of blood .      i wonder where his head is at .     said carrot  in a determinedly matter of fact voice .     oh  it   s rolled over there   what   s the horrible smell .         this .     angua flourished the shampoo .     four dollars a bottle  it says .  sheesh .      angua took another deep sniff at the herbal goo  to drown out the call of the wolf .      doesn   t look as if they stole anything     said carrot .     unless they were very neat   what   s the matter .         don   t ask .      she managed to get a window open and sucked down great draughts of comparatively fresh air  while carrot went through the corpse   s pockets .      er   you can   t tell if there   s a clove around  can you .     he said .      carrot .  please .  this is a room with blood all over the floor .  have you any idea .  excuse me        she rushed out and down the steps .  the alley had the generic smell of all alleys everywhere  overlaid on the basic all embracing smell of the city .  but at least it didn   t make your hair grow and your teeth try to lengthen .  she leaned against the wall and fought for control .  shampoo .  she could have saved snowy a hell of a lot of money with just one careful bite .  then he   d know all about a really bad hair day     carrot came down a couple of minutes later  locking the door behind him .      are you feeling better .         a bit           there was something else     said carrot  looking thoughtful .     i think he wrote a note before he died .  but it   s all rather odd .     he waved in the air what looked like a cheap notepad .     this needs careful looking at .     he shook his head .     poor old snowy .         he was a killer .         yes  but that   s a nasty way to die .         decapitation .  with a very sharp sword  by the look of it .  i can think of worse .         yes  but i can   t help thinking that if only the chap had better hair or had found the right shampoo at an early age he   d have led a different life           well  at least he won   t have to worry about dandruff any more .         that was a little tasteless .         sorry  but you know how blood makes me tense .         your hair always looks amazing     said carrot  changing the subject with  angua thought  unusual tact .     i don   t know what you use  but it   s a shame he never tried it .         i doubt if he went to the right shop     said angua .     it says    for a glossy coat    on the bottles i usually buy   what   s the matter .             can you smell smoke .     said carrot .      carrot  it   s going to be five minutes before i can smell anything except        but he was staring past her  at the big red glow in the sky .      vimes coughed .  and then coughed some more .  and eventually opened his streaming eyes in the confident expectation of seeing his own lungs in front of him .      glass of water  mr .  vimes .      vimes peered through the tears at the shifting shape of fred colon .      thanks  fred .  what   s the horrible burning smell .         it   s you  sir .      vimes was sitting on a low wall outside the wreck of the embassy .  cool air washed around him .  he felt like underdone beef .  the heat was radiating off him .      you was passed on for a while there  sir     said sergeant colon helpfully .     but everyone saw you swing in that window  sir .  and you threw that woman out for detritus to catch .  that   ll be a feather in your cap and no mistake  sir .  i bet the ragh   i bet the klatchians   ll be giving you the order of the camel or something for this night   s work  sir .     colon beamed  bursting with pride by association .      a feather in my cap       murmured vimes .  he undid his helmet and with a certain amount of exhausted delight saw that every single plume had been burned to a stub .   he blinked slowly .      what about the man  fred .  did he get out .         what man .         there was       vimes blinked again .  various parts of his body  aware that he hadn   t been taking calls  were ringing in to complain .   there had been   some man .  vimes had landed on a bed or something  and there was a woman clutching at him  and he had smashed out what was left of the window  seen the big  broad and above all strong arms of detritus down below  and had thrown her out as politely as the circumstances allowed .  then the man from the roof had come out of the smoke again  carrying another figure over his shoulder  screamed something at him and beckoned him to follow and        then the floor had given way        there were   two other people in there     he said  coughing again .      they didn   t get out the front way  then     said colon .      how did i get out .     said vimes .      oh  dorfl was stamping on the fire down below  sir .  very handy  a ceramic constable .  you landed right on him  so of course he stopped what he was doing and brought you out .     s gonna be handshakes and buns all round in the morning  sir .      there weren   t any right now  vimes noted .  there were still plenty of people around  carrying bundles  putting out small fires  arguing with one another   but there was a big hole where congratulating the hero of the hour should have been .      oh  everyone   s always a bit preoccupied after something like this  sir     said colon  as if reading his thoughts .      i think i   ll have a nice cold bath     said vimes  to the world in general .     and then some sleep .  sybil   s got some wonderful ointment for burns   ah  hello  you two .         we saw the fire       carrot began  running up .     is it all over .         mr .  vimes saved the day .     said sergeant colon excitedly .     just went straight in and saved everyone  in the finest tradition of the watch .         fred .     said vimes  wearily .      yessir .         fred  the finest tradition of the watch is having a quiet smoke somewhere out of the wind at three a . m .  let   s not get carried away  eh .      colon looked crestfallen .     well       he began .   vimes staggered to his feet and patted his sergeant on the back .      oh  all right  it   s a tradition     he conceded .     you can do the next one  fred .  and now     he steadied himself as he stood up     i   m going down to the yard to write my report .         you   re covered in ash and you   re swaying     said carrot .     i should just get on home  sir .         oh no     said vimes .     got to do the paperwork .  anyone know the time .         bingeley bingeley beep .     said a cheerful voice from his pocket .      damn .     said vimes  but it was too late .      it is     said the voice  which had the squeaky friendly quality that begs to be strangled     about   nineish .         nineish .         yep .  nineish .  precisely about nineish .      vimes rolled his eyes .     precisely about nineish .     he said  pulling a small box out of his pocket and opening the lid .  the demon inside gave him an angry look .      yesterday you said     it said     that if i  and i quote  didn   t stop all that eight fifty six and six seconds precisely business i would be looking at a hammer from below .  and when i said  mr .  insert name here  that this would invalidate my warranty  you said that i could take my warranty and           i thought you   d lost that thing     said carrot .      hah     said the dis organizer     really .  you thought he did .  i don   t call putting something in your trouser pockets just before they go into the wash losing it .         that was an accident     muttered vimes .      oh .  oh .  and dropping me in the dragon   s feeding bowl  that was accidental  too  was it .     the demon mumbled to itself for a moment and then said     anyway  do you want to know your appointments for this evening .      vimes looked at the smoldering wreckage of the embassy .      do tell     he said .      you don   t have any     said the demon sulkily .     you haven   t told me any .         you see .     said vimes .     that   s what drives me livid .  why should i have to tell you .  why didn   t you tell me     eightish  break up riot at mundane meals and stop detritus shooting people     eh .         you didn   t tell me to tell you .         i didn   t know .  and that   s how real life works .  how can i tell you to warn me about things that no one knows are going to happen .  if you were any good  that   d be your job .         he writes in the manual     said the demon nastily .     did you know that  everybody .  he writes in the manual .         well  of course i make notes           he   s actually sneakily trying to keep his diary in the manual so his wife won   t find out he   s never bothered to learn how to use me     said the demon .      what about the vimes manual  then .     snapped vimes .     i notice you   ve never bothered to learn how to use me .      the demon hesitated .     humans come with a manual .     it said .      it   d be a damn good idea .     said vimes .      true     murmured angua .      it could say things like    chapter one  bingeley bingeley beep and other damn fool things to spring on people at six in the morning        said vimes  his eyes wild .     and    troubleshooting  my owner keeps trying to drop me in the privy  what am i doing wrong .     and        carrot patted him gently on the back .     i should sign off now  sir     he said gently .     it   s been a busy few days .      vimes rubbed his forehead .     i daresay i could do with a rest     he said .     come on  there   s nothing more to see here .  let   s go home .         i thought you said you weren   t going       carrot began  but vimes   s mind was already scolding him .      i meant the yard  of course     he said .     i   ll go home afterward .         a ball of lamplight floated through the ramkin library  drifting across the shelves of huge  leather bound books .   many of them had never been read  sybil knew .  various ancestors had simply ordered them from the engravers and put them on the shelves  because a library was something you had to have  don   tcher know  like a stableyard and a servants    wing and some ghastly landscaping mistake created by    bloody stupid    johnson  although in the latter case her grandfather had shot the man before he could do any real damage .   she held the lamp higher .   ramkins looked down their noses at her from their frames  through the brown varnish of the centuries .  portraits were another thing that had been collected out of unregarded habit .   most of them were of men .  they were invariably in armor and always on horseback .  and every single one of them had fought the sworn enemies of ankh morpork .   in recent times this had been quite difficult and her grandfather  for example  had to lead an expedition all the way to howondaland in order to find some sworn enemies  although there was an adequate supply and a lot of swearing by the time he left .  earlier  of course  it had been a lot easier .  ramkin regiments had fought the city   s enemies all over the sto plains and had inflicted heroic casualties  quite often on people in the opposing armies .    there were a few women among the sitters  none of them holding anything heavier than a glove or a small pet dragon .  their job had largely been to roll bandages and await the return of their husbands with  she liked to think  resolution and fortitude and a general hope that said husbands would return with as many of their bits as possible .   the point was  though  that they never thought about it .  there was a war  and off they went .  if there wasn   t a war  they looked for one .  they didn   t even use words like    duty .     it was all built in at bone level .   she sighed .  it was all so difficult these days  and lady sybil came from a class that was not used to difficulty  or at least the kind that couldn   t be sorted out by shouting at a servant .  five hundred years ago one of her ancestors had cut off a klatchian   s head in battle and had brought it home on a pole  and no one thought any the worse of him  given what the klatchians would have cut off if they   d caught him .  that seemed straightforward .  you fought them  they fought you  everyone knew the rules  and if you got your head cut off you jolly well didn   t blub about it afterward .   certainly  things were better now .  but they were just   more difficult .   and of course some of those antique husbands were away for months or years at a time  and for them wives and families were pretty much like the library and stableyard and the johnson exploding pagoda .  you got them sorted out and then didn   t think much about it .  at least sam was home every day .   well  most days .  every night  anyway .   well   part of most nights  certainly .   at least they ate meals together .   well  most meals .   well  at least they made a start on most meals .   well  at least she knew he was never very far away  just somewhere where he was trying to do too much and run too fast and people were trying to kill him .   all in all  she considered  she was jolly lucky .      vimes stared at carrot  who was standing in front of his desk .      so what does all that add up to .     he said .     the man we know didn   t get the prince is dead .  the man who probably did   is dead .  someone tried very clumsily to make it look as if ossie was paid by the klatchians .  okay  i can see why someone might want to do that .  that   s what fred calls politics .  they get snowy to do the real business  and he helps poor dumb ossie who   s there to take the fall  and then the watch proves that ossie was in the pay of the klatchians and that   s another reason for fighting .  and snowy just slopes off .  only someone cured his dandruff for him .         after he   d written something  sir     said carrot .      ah   yes .      vimes looked at the notepad retrieved from snowy   s room .  it was a crude affair  the wads of mismatched bits of scrap that the engravers sold off cheaply .  he sniffed at it .      soap on the edges     he said .      his new shampoo     said carrot .     first time he   d used it .         how do you know .         we looked at all the bottles on the heap  sir .         hmm .  looks like fresh blood here  at the spine  where they   re stitched together           his  sir     said angua .   vimes nodded .  you never argued with angua about blood .      but none of the actual pages have blood on them       said vimes .     which is a bit odd .  messy business  decapitation .  people tend to   spray .  so the top page              has been taken away  sir     said carrot  grinning and nodding .     but that   s not the funny part  sir .  see if you can guess  sir .      vimes glared at him and then moved the lamp closer .     very faint impression of writing on the top page       he muttered .     can   t make it out           we can   t either  sir .  we know he wrote in pencil  sir .  there was one on the table .         very faint traces     said vimes .     blokes like snowy write as though they   re chipping stone .     he flicked the notebook .     someone tore out   not just the page he   d written on but several below it as well .         clever  eh  sir .  everyone knows              you can read the suspicious note by looking at the marks on the page below     said vimes .  he tossed the book on to the table again .     hmm .  there   s a message there  yes           perhaps he was blackmailing whoever   s behind all this .     said angua .      that   s not his style     said vimes .     no  what i meant was        there was a knock on the door  and fred colon entered .      brung you a mug of coffee     he said     and there   s a bunch of wo   klatchians to see you downstairs  mr .  vimes .  probably come to give you a medal and gabble at you in their lingo .  and if you   re on for late supper  mrs .  goriff   s doing goat and rice and foreign gravy .         i suppose i   d better go down and see them     said vimes .     but i haven   t even had time for a wash           that   s evidence of your heroic endeavors     said colon stoutly .      oh  all right .      unease began about halfway down the stairs .  vimes had never run into a group of citizens wishing to give him a medal and so he did not have a lot of experience on this score  but the group waiting for him in a tight cluster near the sergeant   s desk did not look like a committee of welcome .   they were klatchian .  at least  they were wearing foreign looking clothes and one or two of them had caught more sun than you generally got in ankh morpork .  the feeling crept over vimes that klatch was a very big place in which his city and the whole of the sto plains would be lost  and so there must be room in it for all kinds of peoples  including this short chap in the red fez who was practically vibrating with indignation .      are you the man vimes .     the enfezzed one demanded .      well  i   m commander vimes           we demand the release of the goriff family .  and we won   t take any excuses .      vimes blinked .     release .         you have locked them up .  and confiscated their shop .      vimes stared at the man  and then he looked across the room at sergeant detritus .      where did you put the family  sergeant .      detritus saluted .     in der cells  sir .         aha .     said the man in the fez .     you admit it .         excuse me  who are you .     said vimes  blinking with tiredness .      i don   t have to tell you and you can   t beat it out of me .     said the man  sticking out his chest .      oh  thank you for telling me     said vimes .     i do hate wasted effort .         oh  hello  mr .  wazir     said carrot  appearing behind vimes .     did you get the note about that book .      there was one of those silences that happen when everyone has to reprogram their faces .   then vimes said     what .         mr .  wazir sells books in widdy street     said carrot .     only i asked him for some books on klatch  you see  and one of the ones he gave me was the perfumed allotment  or  the garden of delights .  and i didn   t mind because the klatchians invented gardens  sir  so i thought it might be a very useful cultural insight .  get inside the klatchian mind  as it were .  only it  er  it   er   well  it wasn   t about gardening   er       he started to blush .      yes  yes  all right  bring it back if you like     said mr .  wazir  looking a little derailed .      i just thought you ought to know in case you hadn   t   in case you sold   well   it could shock the impressionable  you know  a book like that           yes  fine           corporal angua was so shocked she couldn   t stop laughing     carrot went on .      i will have your money sent round directly     said wazir .  his expression turned vengeful again .  he glared at vimes .      books are unimportant at this time .  we demand you release my countrymen now .         detritus  why the hell did you put them in the cells .     said vimes wearily .      what else we got  sir .  dey   re not locked in and dey got clean blankets .         there   s your explanation     said vimes .     they   re our guests .         in the cells .     said wazir  relishing the word .      they   re free to go whenever they like     said vimes .      i   m sure they are now     said wazir  contriving to indicate that only his arrival had prevented officially sanctioned bloodshed .     you can be sure the patrician will hear about this .         he hears about everything else     said vimes .     but if they leave here  who is going to protect them .         we are .  their fellow countrymen .         how .      wazir almost stood to attention .     by force of arms  if necessary .         oh  good     said vimes .     then there   ll be two mobs           bingeley bingeley beep .         damn .     vimes slapped at his pocket .     i don   t want to know i haven   t got any appointments .         you have one at eleven pee em .  the rats chamber  at the palace     said the dis organizer .      don   t be stupid .         please yourself .         and shut up .         i was just trying to help .         shut up .     vimes turned back to the klatchian bookseller .      mr .  wazir  if goriff wants to leave with you  we won   t stop him           aha .  you may well try .      vimes told himself that there was no reason at all why a klatchian couldn   t be a pompous little troublemaker .  but he felt uneasy about it  like a man edging along the side of a very deep crevasse .      sergeant colon .         yessir .         see to this  will you .         yessir .         diplomatically .         right  sir .     colon tapped the side of his nose .     is this politics  sir .         just   just go and fetch the goriff family and they can       vimes waved a hand vaguely .     they can do whatever they like .      he turned and walked up the stairs .      someone has to protect my people   s rights .     shouted wazir .   they heard vimes stop halfway up the stairs .  the board creaked under his weight for a second .  then he continued upward  and several of the watchmen started breathing again .   vimes shut his office door behind him .   politics .  he sat down and scrabbled through the papers .  it was much easier to think about crime .  give him good honest crime any time .   he tried to shut out the outside world .   someone had beheaded snowy slopes .  that was a fact .  you couldn   t put it down to a shaving accident  or unreasonably strong shampoo .   and snowy had attempted to shoot the prince .   and so had ossie  but ossie only thought he was an assassin .  everyone else thought he was a weird little twerp who was as impressionable as wet clay .   a lovely idea  though .  you used a real murderer  a nice quiet professional  and then you had   vimes smiled grimly   someone else to take the fall .  and if he hadn   t taken a less metaphorical fall the poor twisted little sod would have believed he was the murderer .   and the watch was supposed to believe it was a klatchian plot .   sand in their sandals   the nerve of it .  did they think he was stupid .  he wished fred had carefully swept up the sand  because he was damn well going to find out who   d put it there and they were going to eat it .  someone wanted vimes to chase klatchians .   the man on the burning roof .  did he fit in .  did he have to fit in .  what could vimes recall .  a man in a robe  his face hidden .  and a voice of a man not just used to giving commands   vimes was used to giving commands   but also used to having commands obeyed  whereas a member of the watch treated orders as suggestions .   but some things didn   t have to fit .  that was where    clues    let you down .  and the damn notebook .  that was the oddest thing yet .  so someone had carefully ripped out several pages after snowy had written whatever he   d written .  someone bright enough to know the trick of looking at the pages underneath for faint impressions .   so why not pinch the whole pad .   it was all too complicated .  but somewhere was the one thing that   d make it simple  that would turn it all into sense     he flung down his pencil and wrenched open the door to the stairs .      what the hell   s all this noise .     he yelled .   sergeant colon was halfway up the stairs .      it was mr .  goriff and mr .  wazir having a bit of what you might call an argy bargy  sir .  someone set fire to someone else   s country two hundred years ago  carrot says .         what  just now .            s all klatchian to me  sir .  anyway  wazir   s gone off with his nose in a sling .         wazir comes from smale  you see     said carrot .     and mr .  gorriff comes from elharib  and the two countries only stopped fighting ten years ago .  religious differences .         run out of weapons .     said vimes .      ran out of rocks  sir .  they ran out of weapons last century .      vimes shook his head .     that always chews me up     he said .     people killing one another just because their gods have squabbled           oh  they   ve got the same god  sir .  apparently it   s over a word in their holy book  sir .  the elharibians say it translates as    god    and the smalies say it   s    man .            how can you mix them up .         well  there   s only one tiny dot difference in the script  you see .  and some people reckon it   s only a bit of fly dirt in any case .         centuries of war because a fly crapped in the wrong place .         it could have been worse     said carrot .     if it had been slightly to the left the word would have been    liquorice .         vimes shook his head .  carrot was good at picking up this sort of thing .  and i know how to ask for vindaloo  he thought .  and it turns out that   s just a klatchian word meaning    mouth scalding gristle for macho foreign idiots .         i wish we understood more about klatch     he said .   sergeant colon tapped the side of his nose conspiratorially .      know the enemy  eh  sir .     he said .      oh  i know the enemy     said vimes .     it   s klatchians i want to find out about .         commander vimes .      the watchmen looked round .  vimes narrowed his eyes .      you   re one of rust   s men  aren   t you .      the young man saluted .      lieutenant hornett  sir .     he hesitated .     er   his lordship has sent me to ask you if you and your senior officers would be so good as to come to the palace at your convenience  sir .         really .  those were his words .      the lieutenant decided that honesty was the only policy .      in fact he said     get vimes and his mob up here right now     sir .         oh  did he .     said vimes .      bingeley bingeley beep .     said a small triumphant voice from his pocket .     the time is eleven pee em precisely .         the door opened before nobby knocked  and a small stout woman glared out at him .      yes  i am .     she snapped .   nobby stood with his hand still raised .     er   are you mrs .  cake .     he said .      yes  but i don   t hold with doing it except for money .      nobby   s hand did not move .      er   you can tell the future  right .     said nobby .   they stared at one another .  then mrs .  cake thumped her own ear a couple of times  and blinked .      drat .  left my precognition on again .     her gaze unfocused for a moment as she replayed the recent conversation in the privacy of her head .      i think we   re sorted out     she said .  she looked at nobby and sniffed .     you   d better come in .  mind the carpet  it   s just been washed .  and i can only give you ten minutes    cos i   ve got cabbage boilin .      she led corporal nobbs into her tiny front room .  a lot of it was occupied by a round table covered with a green cloth .  there was a crystal ball on the table  not very well covered by a pink knitted lady in a crinoline dress .   mrs .  cake motioned nobby to sit down .  he obediently did so .  the smell of cabbage drifted through the room .      a bloke in the pub told me about you     nobby mumbled .     said you do mediuming .         would you care to tell me your problem .     said mrs .  cake .  she looked at nobby again and  in a state of certainty that had nothing to do with precognition and everything to do with observation  added     that is  which of your problems do you want to know about .      nobby coughed .     er   it   s a bit   you know   intimate .  affairs of the heart  sort of thing .         are women involved .     said mrs .  cake cautiously .      er   i hope so .  what else is there .      mrs .  cake visibly relaxed .      i just want to know if i   m going to meet any     nobby went on .      i see .     mrs .  cake gave a kind of facial shrug .  it wasn   t up to her to tell people how to waste their money .     well  there   s the tenpenny future .  that   s what you see .  and there   s the ten dollar future .  that   s what you get .         ten dollars .  that   s more   n a week   s pay .  i   d better take the tenpenny one .         a very wise choice     said mrs .  cake .     give me your paw .         hand     said nobby .      that   s what i said .      mrs .  cake examined nobby   s outstretched palm while taking care not to touch it .      are you going to moan and roll your eyes and stuff .     said nobby  a man out to get his tenpenn   orth .      i don   t have to take cheek     said mrs .  cake  without looking up .     that sort of        she peered closer  and then gave nobby a sharp look .      have you been playing with this hand .         pardon .      mrs .  cake whipped the crinoline lady off the crystal and glared into the depths .  after a while she shook her head .      i don   t know  i   m sure   oh  well .     she cleared her throat and spoke in a more sibylic voice .     mr .  nobbs  i see you surrounded by dusky ladies in a hot place .  looks a bit foreign to me .  they   re laughing and chatting with you   in fact  one of them   s just handed you a drink           none of    em are shouting or anything .     said nobby  mystified .      doesn   t look like it     said mrs .  cake  equally fascinated .     they seem quite happy .         you can   t see any   magnets .         what   re they .         dunno     nobby admitted .     i    spect you   d know    em if you saw    em .      mrs .  cake  despite a certain rigidity of character  couldn   t help but be aware of a drift in nobby   s speculation .      some of the ladies look   nubile     she hinted .      ah  right     said nobby  his expression not changing in any way .      if you understand what i mean           right .  yes .  nubile .  right .      mrs .  cake gave up .  nobby counted out ten pennies .      and that   ll be soon  will it .     said nobby .      oh yes .  i can   t see very far for tenpence .         happy young ladies       mused nobby .     nubile  too .  definitely something to think about .      after he   d gone  mrs .  cake went back to her crystal and sneaked a whole ten dollars    worth of precognition for her own curiosity and satisfaction  and laughed about it all afternoon .      vimes was only half surprised when the doors to the rats chamber opened and there  sitting at the head of the table  was lord rust .  the patrician wasn   t there .   he was half surprised .  that is  at a certain shallow level he thought  that   s odd  i thought you couldn   t budge the man with a siege weapon .  but at a dark level  where the daylight seldom penetrated  he thought  of course .  at a time like this men like rust rise to the top .  it   s like stirring a swamp with a stick .  really big bubbles are suddenly on the surface and there   s a bad smell about everything .  nevertheless  he saluted and said      lord vetinari on his holidays  then .         lord vetinari stepped down this evening  vimes     said lord rust .     pro tem  of course .  just for the duration of the emergency .         really .     said vimes .      yes .  and i have to say that he anticipated a certain   cynicism on your part  commander  and therefore asked me to give you this letter .  you will see that it is sealed with his seal .      vimes looked at the envelope .  there was certainly the official seal in the wax  but     he met lord rust   s gaze and at least that suspicion faded .  rust wouldn   t try a trick like that .  men like rust had a moral code of sorts  and some things weren   t honorable .  you could own a street of crowded houses where people lived like cockroaches and the cockroaches lived like kings and that was perfectly okay  but rust would probably die before he   d descend to forgery .      i see  sir     said vimes .     you wanted me .         commander vimes  i must ask you to take the klatchians resident in the city into custody .         on what charge  sir .         commander  we are on the verge of war with klatch .  surely you understand .         no  sir .         we are talking about spying  commander .  sabotage  even     said lord rust .     to be frank   the city is to be placed under martial law .         yessir .  what kind of law   s that  sir .     said vimes  staring straight ahead .      you know very well  vimes .         is it the kind where you shout    stop .     before you fire  sir  or the other kind .         ah .  i see .     rust stood up and leaned forward .      it pleased you to be   smart with lord vetinari  and for some reason he indulged you     he said .     i  on the other hand  know your type .         my type .         it seems to me that the streets are full of crimes  commander .  unlicensed begging  public nuisances   but you seem to turn a blind eye  you seem to think you should have bigger ideas .  but you are not required to have big ideas  commander .  you are a thief taker  nothing more .  are you eyeballing me  vimes .         i was trying not to turn a blind eye  sir .         you seem to feel  vimes  that the law is some kind of big glowing light in the sky which is not subject to control .  and you are wrong .  the law is what we tell it to be .  i   m not going to add    do you understand .     because i know you understand and i am not going to try to reason with you .  i know a rank bad hat when i see one .         bad hat .     said vimes weakly .      commander vimes     he said     i had hoped to avoid this  but the last few days point to a succession of astonishing judgemental errors on your part .  the prince khufurah was shot  and you seemed helpless to prevent this or find the criminal responsible .  mobs appear to run around the city unimpeded  i gather that one of your sergeants proposed to shoot innocent people in the head  and we have just heard that you took it upon yourself to arrest an innocent businessman and lock him in the cells for no reason at all .      vimes heard colon gasp .  but it sounded a long way off .  he could feel everything crumbling under him  but his mind seemed to be flying now  flapping through a pink sky where nothing mattered very much .      oh  i don   t know about that  sir     he said .     he was guilty of repeatedly being klatchian  wasn   t he .  don   t you want me to do that to all of    em .         and if this was not enough     rust went on     we are told  and in other circumstances i would find this very hard to believe  even of a counter jumper like you  that earlier tonight you  being quite unprovoked  assaulted two klatchian guards  trespassed on klatchian soil  entered the women   s quarters  abducted two klatchians from their beds  ordered the destruction of klatchian property and   well  frankly  acted quite disgracefully .      what is the point of arguing .  vimes thought .  why play cards with a shaved deck .  and yet        two klatchians  sir .         it seems prince khufurah has been kidnapped  vimes .  i find it hard to believe that even you would attempt that  but the klatchians seem to be suggesting this .  you were seen entering their property illegally .  and you appear to have dragged a helpless lady from her bed .  what have you got to say about that .         it was on fire at the time  sir .      lieutenant hornett stepped forward and whispered something .  lord rust subsided a bit .      all right .  very well .  there were perhaps mitigating circumstances  but politically it was a most ill advised action  vimes .  i cannot pretend to know what has happened to the prince  but frankly you seem to have taken a positive delight in making matters worse .      can you climb  mr .  vimes .  vimes said nothing .  the other man had been carrying something bulky over his shoulder        you are removed from authority  commander .  and the watch will come under the direct command of this council .  is that understood .      rust turned to carrot .     captain carrot  many of us here have heard   good reports about you  and by due authority i hereby appoint you acting commander of the watch        vimes shut his eyes .   carrot saluted smartly .     no .  sir .      vimes opened his eyes wide .      really .     rust stared at carrot for a few moments  and then gave a little shrug .      ah  well   loyalty is a fine thing .  sergeant colon .         sir .         in the circumstances  and since you are the most experienced noncommissioned officer and have an exemp   and have a military record  you will take command of the watch for the duration of the   emergency .         nossir .         that was an instruction  sergeant .      beads of sweat began to form on colon   s brow .     nossir .         sergeant .         you can put it where the sun does not shine  sir .     said colon desperately .   once again  vimes saw rust   s milky blue stare .  rust never looked surprised .  and since he knew that a mere sergeant would never dare offer cheeky defiance  he erased sergeant colon from the immediate universe .   the gaze turned briefly to detritus .   and he doesn   t know how to speak to a troll  vimes thought .  and he was once again impressed  in the same dark way  by the manner in which rust dealt with the problem .  he dealt with it by making it not be there .      who is the senior corporal in the watch  sir samuel .         that would be corporal nobbs .      the committee went into a huddle .  there was a rush of whispering  in which the words       an absolute little tit       could be heard several times .  finally rust looked up again .      and the next in seniority .         let me see   that would be corporal stronginthearm     said vimes .  he felt oddly light headed .      perhaps he is a man who can take orders .         he   s a dwarf  you idiot .      not a muscle moved on rust   s face .  there was a clink as vimes   s badge was set neatly on the table .      i don   t have to take this     vimes said calmly .      oh  so you   d rather be a civilian  would you .         a watchman is a civilian  you inbred streak of piss .      rust   s brain erased the sounds that his ears could not possibly have heard .      and the keys to the armory  sir samuel     he said .   they jangled as they landed on the table .      and do the rest of you have any empty gestures to make .     said lord rust .   sergeant colon took his grimy badge out of his pocket and was a little disappointed that it didn   t make a defiant tinkle when he threw it on the table but instead bounced and smashed the water jug .      i got my badge carved on my arm     detritus rumbled .     someone c   n try an    take it off if dey likes .      carrot laid his badge down very carefully .   rust raised his eyebrows .     you too  captain .         yes  sir .         i would have thought that you at least        he stopped and looked up in annoyance as the doors opened .  a couple of the palace guards ran in  with a group of klatchians behind them .   the council got to their feet in a hurry .   vimes recognized the klatchian in the center of the group .  he   d seen him around at official functions and  if it hadn   t been for the fact that the man was a klatchian  would have marked him down as a shifty piece of work .      who   s he .     he whispered to carrot .      prince kalif .  he   s the deputy ambassador .         another prince .      the man came to a halt in front of the table  glanced at vimes with no show of recognition and bowed to lord rust .      prince kalif     said lord rust .     your arrival is unannounced but nevertheless           i have grave news  my lord .     even in his stunned state  a part of vimes registered that the voice was different .  khufurah had learned his second language on the street  but this one had had tutors .      at a time like this  what news isn   t .     said rust .      there have been developments on the new land .  regrettable incidents .  and indeed in ankh morpork  too .     he glanced at vimes again .     although here  i must say  reports are confused .  lord rust  i have to tell you we are  technically  at war .         technically at war .     said vimes .      i am afraid events are carrying us forward     said kalif .     the situation is delicate .      they know they   re going to fight  vimes thought .  this is just like the start of a dance  where you hang around looking at your partner        i must tell you that you are being given twelve hours to remove all your citizens from leshp     said kalif .     if that is done  matters will be happily resolved .  for the present .         our response is that you have twelve hours to quit leshp     said rust .     if that is not done  then we will take   steps        kalif bowed slightly .     we understand one another .  a formal document will be with you shortly and  no doubt  we will be receiving one from you .         indeed .         here  hang on  you can   t just       vimes began .      sir samuel  you are no longer commander of the watch and you have no place at these proceedings     said rust sharply .  he turned back to the prince .      it is unfortunate that things have come to this     he said stiffly .      indeed .  but there comes a time when words are no longer sufficient .         i must agree with you .  and then it is time to test one   s strength .      vimes stared in fascinated horror from one face to the other .      we will  of course  allow you time to quit your embassy .  such of it as remains .         so kind .  and of course we will extend to you the same courtesy .     kalif bowed slightly .   so did rust .      after all  just because our countries are at war is no reason why we should not respect one another as friends     said lord rust .      what .  yes  it bloody well is .     said vimes .     i can   t believe this .  you can   t just stand there and   good grief  whatever happened to diplomacy .         war  vimes  is a continuation of diplomacy by other means     said lord rust .     as you would know  if you were really a gentleman .         and you klatchians are as bad     vimes went on .     it   s that green mouldy mutton jenkins sells .  you   ve all got foaming sheep disease .  you can   t just stand there and           sir samuel  you are  as you are at pains to point out  a civilian     said rust .     as such  you have no place here .      vimes didn   t bother with a salute but just turned away and walked out of the room .  the rest of the squad followed him in silence back to pseudopolis yard .      i told him he could put it where the sun didn   t shine     said sergeant colon  as they crossed the brass bridge .      that   s right     said vimes woodenly .     well done .         right to his face .     where the sun don   t shine .     just like that     said colon .  it was a little difficult to tell from his tone whether this was a matter of pride or dread .      i   m afraid lord rust is technically correct  sir     said carrot .      really .         yes  mr .  vimes .  the safety of the city is of paramount importance  so in times of war the civil power is subject to military authority .         hah .         i told him     said fred colon .     right where the sun does not shine  i said .         the deputy ambassador didn   t mention prince khufurah     said carrot .     that was odd .         i   m going home     said vimes .      we   re nearly there  sir     said carrot .      i mean home home .  i need some sleep .         yes  sir .  what shall i tell the lads  sir .         tell them anything you like .         i looked him right in the eye and i told him  i said  you can put it right where the       mused sergeant colon .      you want me an    some of der boys go and sort out dat rust later on .     said detritus .     it no problem .  he bound to be guilty o    somethin    .         no .      vimes   s head felt so light now that he couldn   t touch the ground with a rope .  he left them outside the yard and let his head drag him on and up the hill and round the corner and into the house and past his astonished wife and up the stairs and into the bedroom  where he fell full length on the bed and was asleep before he hit it .      at nine next morning the first recruits for lord venturi   s heavy infantry paraded down broadway .   the watchmen went out to watch .  that was all that was left for them to do .      isn   t that mr .  vimes   s butler .     said angua  pointing to the stiff figure of willikins in the front rank .      yeah  and that   s his kitchen boy banging the drum in front     said nobby .      you were a   military man  weren   t you  fred .     said carrot  as the parade passed by .      yes  sir .  duke of eorle   s first heavy infantry  sir .  the pheasant pluckers .         pardon .     said angua .      nickname for the regiment  miss .  oh  from ages ago .  they were bivvywhacking on some estate and came across a lot of pheasant pens and  well  you know  having to live off the land and everything   anyway  that   s why we always wore a pheasant feather on our helmets .  traditional  see .      already old fred   s face was creasing up in the soft expression of someone who has been mugged in memory lane .      we even had a marching song     he said .     mind you  it was quite hard to sing right .  er   sorry  miss .         oh  it   s all right  sergeant     said angua .     i often start to laugh like that for no reason at all .      fred colon once again stared dreamily at nothing .     and o   course before that i was in the duke of quirm   s middleweight infantry .  saw a lot of action with them .         i   m sure you did     said carrot  while angua entertained cynical thoughts about the actual distance of fred   s vantage point .     your distinguished military career has obviously given you many pleasant memories .         the ladies liked the uniform     said fred colon  with the unspoken rider that sometimes a growing lad needed all the help he could get .     an    it   weelll           yes  sarge .      colon looked awkward  as if the bunched underwear of the past was tangling itself in the crotch of recollection .      it was   more easier  sir .  than being a copper  i mean .  i mean  you   re a soldier  right  and the other buggers is the enemy .  you march into some big field somewhere and all form up into them oblongs  and then a bloke with the feathery helmet gives the order  and you all forms up into big arrows           good gods  do people really do that .  i thought it was just how they drew the battle plans .         well  the old duke  sir  he did it by the book   anyway  it   s just a case of watching your back and walloping any bloke in the wrong uniform .  but       fred colon   s face screwed up in agonized thought     well  when you   re a copper  well  you dunno the good guys from the bad guys without a map  miss  and that   s a fact .         but   there   s military law  isn   t there .         well  yes   but when it   s pissing with rain and you   re up to your tonk   your waist in dead horses and someone gives you an order  that ain   t the time to look up the book of rules  miss .  anyway  most of it   s about when you   re allowed to get shot  sir .         oh  i   m sure there   s more to it than that  sergeant .         oh  prob   ly  sir     colon conceded diplomatically .      i   m sure there   s lots of stuff about not killing enemy soldiers who   ve surrendered  for instance .         oh  yerss  there   s that  captain .  doesn   t say you can   t duff    em up a bit  of course .  give    em a little something to remember you by .         not torture .     said angua .      oh  no  miss .  but       memory lane for colon had turned into a bad road through a dark valley       well  when your best mate   s got an arrow in his eye an    there   s blokes and horses screamin    all round you and you   re scared shi   you   re really scared  an    you come across one of the enemy   well  for some reason or other you   re got this kinda urge to give him a bit of a   nudge  sort of thing .  just   you know   like  maybe in twenty years    time his leg   ll twinge a bit on frosty days and he   ll remember what he done  that   s all .      he rummaged in a pocket and produced a very small book  which he held up for inspection .      this belonged to my great grandad     he said .     he was in the scrap we had against pseudopolis and my great gran gave him this book of prayers for soldiers     cos you need all the prayers you can get  believe you me  and he stuck it in the top pocket of his jerkin     cos he couldn   t afford armor  and next day in battle   whoosh  this arrow came out of nowhere  wham  straight into this book and it went all the way through to the last page before stopping  look .  you can see the hole .         pretty miraculous     carrot agreed .      yeah  it was  i s   pose     said the sergeant .  he looked ruefully at the battered volume .     shame about the other seventeen arrows  really .      the drumming died away .  the remnant of the watch tried to avoid one another   s gaze .   then an imperious voice said     why aren   t you in uniform  young man .      nobby turned .  he was being addressed by an elderly lady with a certain turkey like cast of feature and a capital punishment expression .      me .  got one  missus     said nobby  pointing to his battered helmet .      a proper uniform     snapped the woman  handing him a white feather .     what will you be doing when the klatchians are ravishing us in our beds .      she glared at the rest of the guards and swept on .  angua saw several others like her passing along the crowds of spectators .  here and there was a flash of white .      i   ll be thinking  those klatchians are jolly brave     said carrot .     i   m afraid  nobby  that the white feather is to shame you into joining up .         oh  that   s all right  then     said nobby  a man for whom shame held no shame .     what am i supposed to do with it .         that reminds me   did i tell you what i said to lord rust .     said sergeant colon  nervously .      seventeen times so far     said angua  watching the women with the feathers .  she added  apparently to herself        come back with your shield or on it .            i wonder if i can get the lady to give me any more .     said nobby .      what was that .     said carrot .      these feathers     said nobby .     they look like real goose .  i   ve got a use for a lot more of these           i meant what was it that angua said .     said carrot .      what .  oh   it   s just something women used to say when they sent their men off to war .  come back with your shield  or on it .         on your shield .     said nobby .     you mean like   sledging  sort of thing .         like dead     said angua .     it meant come back a winner or not at all .         well  i always came back with my shield     said nobby .     no problem there .         nobby     sighed colon     you used to come back with your shield  everyone else   s shield  a sack of teeth and fifteen pairs of still warm boots .  on a cart .         we ell  no point in going to war unless you   re on the winning side     said nobby  sticking the white feather in his helmet .      nobby  you was always on the winning side  the reason bein     you used to lurk aroun    the edges to see who was winning and then pull the right uniform off   f some poor dead sod .  i used to hear where the generals kept an eye on what you were wearin    so they   d know how the battle was going .         lots of soldiers have served in lots of regiments     said nobby .      right  what you say is true .  only not usually during the same battle     said sergeant colon .   they trooped back into the watch house .  most of the shift had taken the day off .  after all  who was in charge .  what were they supposed to be doing today .  the only ones left were those who never thought of themselves as off duty  and the new recruits who hadn   t had their keen edge blunted .      i   m sure mr .  vimes   ll think of something     said carrot .     look  i   d better take the goriffs back to their shop .  mr .  goriff says he   s going to pack up and leave .  a lot of klatchians are leaving .  you can   t blame them  either .         dreams rising with him like bubbles  vimes surfaced from the black fathoms of sleep .   normally  these days  he treasured the moment of waking .  it was when solutions presented themselves .  he assumed bits of his brain came out at night and worked on the problems of the previous day  handing him the result just as he opened his eyes .   all that arrived now were memories .  he winced .  another memory turned up .  he groaned .  the sound of his badge bouncing on the table replayed itself .  he swore .   he swung his legs off the covers and groped for the bedside table .      bingeley bingeley beep .         oh  no   all right  what   s the time .         one o   clock pee em .  hello  insert name here .      vimes looked blearily at the dis organizer .  one day  he knew  he really would have to try to understand the manual for the damn thing .  either that or drop it off a cliff .       what       he began  and then groaned again .  the twanging sound made by the unwound turban as it took his weight had just come back to haunt him .      sam .     the bedroom door was pushed open and sybil came in carrying a cup .      yes  dear .         how do you feel .         i   ve got bruises on my brui       another memory crawled up from the pit of guilt .     oh  good grief  did i really call him a long streak of    .         yes     said his wife .     fred colon came round this morning and told me all about it .  and a very good description  i   d say .  i went out with ronnie rust once .  bit of a cold fish .      another recollection burst like a ball of marsh gas in vimes   s head .      did fred tell you where he said rust could put his badge .         yes .  three times .  it seems to be weighing on his mind .  anyway  knowing ronnie  he   d have to use a hammer .      vimes had long ago got used to the fact that the aristocracy all seemed to know one another by their first name .      and did fred tell you anything else .     he said timidly .      yes .  about the shop and the fire and everything .  i   m proud of you .     she gave him a kiss .      what do i do now .     he said .      drink your tea and have a wash and a shave .         i ought to go down to the watch house and           a shave .  there   s hot water in the jug .      when she had left he hauled himself upright and tottered into his bathroom .  there was  indeed  a jug of hot water on the marble washstand .   he looked at the face in the mirror .  unfortunately  it was his .  perhaps if he shaved it first    .  and then he could wash the bits that were left .   fragments of the night before kept on respectfully drawing themselves to his attention .  it was a shame about that guard  but sometimes you just couldn   t stand and argue     he shouldn   t have done that with his badge .  it wasn   t like the old days .  he had responsibilities .  he should   ve stayed on and made things just a little less     no .  that never worked .   he managed to get the lather on his face .  the riot act .  good grief   he stropped his razor thoughtfully .  rust   s milky eyes stared out of his memory .  bastard .  men like that thought  they really thought  that the watch was a kind of sheepdog  to nip at the heels of the flock  bark when spoken to and never  ever  bite the shepherd     oh yes .  vimes knew in his bones who the enemy was .   except     no badge  no watch  no job     another memory arrived  late .   lather still dripping down his shirt  he pulled vetinari   s sealed letter out of his pocket and slit it open with the razor .   there was a blank sheet of paper inside .  he turned it over  and there was nothing on the other side either .  mystified  he glanced at the envelope .   sir samuel vimes  knight .   nice of him to be so precise about it  vimes thought .  what was the point of a message with no message .  some people might absentmindedly have slipped the wrong piece of paper in an envelope  but vetinari wouldn   t .  what was the point of sending him a note telling him he was a knight  for gods    sake  he knew that embarrassing fact well enough     another little memory burst open as silently as a mouse passing wind in a hurricane .   who   d said it .  any gentleman     vimes stared .  well  he was a gentleman  wasn   t he .  it was official .   and then he didn   t shout  and he didn   t run out of the room .  he finished shaving  had a wash and put on a change of underwear  very calmly .   downstairs  sybil had cooked him a meal .  she wasn   t a very good cook .  this was fine by vimes  because he wasn   t a very good eater .  after a lifetime of street meals his stomach wasn   t set up right .  what it craved was little crunchy brown bits  the food group of the gods  and sybil reliably always left the pan too long on the dragon .   she eyed him carefully as he chewed his fried egg and stared into the middle distance .  her manner was that of someone with a portable safety net watching a man on the high wire .   after a while  as she watched him crack open a sausage  he said     do we have any books on chivalry  dear .         hundreds  sam .         is there any one which tells you what   you know  what it   s all about .  i mean  what you have to do if you   re a knight  say .  responsibilities and so on .         most of them  i should think .         good .  i think i shall do a little reading .     vimes hit the bacon with his fork .  it shattered very satisfactorily .   afterward  he went into the library .  twenty minutes later  he came back out for a pencil and some paper .   ten minutes after that  lady sybil took him a cup of coffee .  he was hidden behind a pile of books  and apparently deep in life of chivalrie .  she crept out and went into her own study  where she settled down to update her dragon breeding records .   it was an hour later when she heard him step out into the hall .   he was humming under his breath  tunelessly  with the faraway look of preoccupation that means that some big thought has required the shutting down of all non essential processes .  he was also reradiating the field of angered innocence that was  to her  part of his essential vimesness .      are you going out  sam .         yes .  i   m just going to kick some arse  dear .         oh  good .  just be sure you wrap up well  then .         the goriff family trudged along silently beside carrot .      i   m sorry about your shop  mr .  goriff     he said .   goriff shifted the load he was carrying .     we can start other shops     he said .      we   ll certainly keep an eye on it     said carrot .     and   when all this is over  you can come back .         thank you .      his son said something in klatchian .  there was a brief family argument .      i appreciate your strength of feeling     said carrot  going red     although i must say i think your language was a little strong .         my son is sorry     said goriff automatically .     he did not remember that you speak kl           no  i   m not .  why should we run away .     said the boy .     we live here .  i   ve never seen klatch .         oh  well  that will be something to look forward to     said carrot .     i hear it has many fine           are you stupid .     said janil .  he shook himself free of his father   s grasp and confronted carrot .     i don   t care .  i don   t want all this stuff about the moon rising over the mountains of the sun .  i get that at home all the time .  i live here .         now  you really ought to listen to your parents           why .  my dad works all the time and now he   s being pushed out .  what good   s that .  we ought to stay here and defend what   s ours .         ah  well  you shouldn   t take the law into your own hands           why not .         it   s our job           but you   re not doing it .      there was a rattle of klatchian from mr .  goriff .      he says i   ve got to apologize     said janil sullenly .     i   m sorry .         so am i     said carrot .   the boy   s father gave him that complicated shrug used by adults in a situation involving adolescents .      you   ll be back  i know it     said carrot .      we shall see .      they went down the quay toward a waiting boat .  it was a klatchian ship .  people lined the rails  people who were getting out with what they could carry before they could only get out with what they wore .  the watchmen found themselves under hostile scrutiny .      surely rust isn   t already forcing klatchians out of their homes .     said angua .      we can tell which way the wind is blowing     said goriff calmly .   carrot sniffed the salt air .     it   s blowing from klatch     he said .      for you  perhaps     said goriff .   a whip cracked behind them and they stood aside as several coaches rumbled by .  a blind at the window was pulled aside momentarily .  carrot caught a brief glimpse of a face  all gold teeth and black beard  before the cloth twitched back .      that   s him  isn   t it .      there was a faint grunt from angua .  she had her eyes closed  as she always did when she was letting her nose do the seeing        cloves     she murmured  and then grabbed carrot   s arm .      don   t run after it .  there   s armed men on that ship .  what will they think when they see a soldier running toward them .         i   m not a soldier .         how long do you think they   ll spend working out the difference .      the coach pushed through the press of people on the dock .  the crowd surged back around it .      there   s boxes being unloaded   i can   t quite see       said carrot  shading his eyes .     look  i   m sure they   ll understand if           hour ahmed stepped out on to the dock and looked back toward the watchmen .  there was a momentary sparkle as he grinned .  they saw his hand reach over his shoulder and come back holding the curved sword .      i can   t just let him get away     said carrot .     he   s a suspect .  look  he   s laughing at us .         with diplomatic impunity     said angua .     but there   s a lot of armed men down there .         my strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure     said carrot .      really .  well  there   s eleven of them .         hour ahmed threw his sword in the air .  it spun a couple of times  making a whum whum noise  and then his hand shot out and caught it by the handle as it fell .      that   s what mr .  vimes was doing     said carrot  through gritted teeth .     now he   s taunting us           you will be killed if you go on the ship     said goriff behind him .     i know that man .         you do .  how .         he is feared in the whole of klatch .  that is    hour ahmed .         yes  why is           you haven   t heard of him .  and he is a d   reg .     mrs .  goriff pulled at her husband   s arm .      dreg .     said angua .      a warlike desert tribe     said carrot .     very fierce .  honorable  though .  they say that if a d   reg is your friend he   s your friend for the rest of your life .         and if he   s not your friend .         that   s about five seconds .      he drew his sword .     nevertheless     he added     we can   t let           i have said too much .  we must go     said goriff .  the family picked up their bundles .      look  there might be another way to find out about him     said angua .  she pointed at the carriage .   a couple of lean  long haired and extremely graceful dogs had been let out and were straining at their leashes as they led the way up the gangplank .      klatchistan hunting dogs     she said .     the klatchian nobility are very keen on them  i understand .         they look a bit like       carrot began  and then the penny dropped .     no  i can   t let you go on there by yourself     he said .     something would go wrong .         i stand a much better chance than you would  believe me     said angua quickly .     they won   t be leaving until the tide changes  in any case .         it   s too dangerous .         well  they are supposed to be our enemies .         i meant for you .         why .     said angua .     i   ve never heard of werewolves in klatch  so they probably don   t know how to deal with us .      she undid the little leather collar that held her badge and handed it to carrot .      don   t worry     she said .     if the worst comes to the worst  i   ll dive overboard .         into the river .         even the river ankh can   t kill a werewolf .     angua glanced at the turgid water .     probably  anyway .         sergeant colon and corporal nobbs had gone on patrol .  they weren   t sure why they were patrolling  and what they were supposed to do if they saw a crime  although many years of training had enabled them not to see some quite large crimes .  but they were creatures of habit .  they were watchmen  so they patrolled .  they didn   t patrol with a purpose .  they patrolled  as it were  in pure essence .  nobby   s progress wasn   t helped by the large  leather bound book in his arms .      a war   d do this place good     said sergeant colon  after a while .     put some backbone in people .  everything   s gone all to pot these days .         not like when we were kids  sarge .         not like when we were kids indeed  nobby .         people trusted one another in them days  didn   t they  sarge .         people trusted one another  nobby .         yes  sarge .  i know .  and people didn   t have to lock their doors  did they .         that   s right  nobby .  and people were always ready to help .  they were always in and out of one another   s houses .            sright  sarge     said nobby vehemently .     i know no one ever locked their houses down our street .         that   s what i   m talking about .  that   s my point .         it was    cos the bastards even used to steal the locks .      colon considered the truth of this .      yes  but at least it was each other   s stuff they were nicking  nobby .  it   s not like they was foreigners .         right .      they strolled on for a while  each entangled in his own thoughts .      sarge .         yes  nobby .         where   s nubilia .         nubilia .         it   s got to be a place  i reckon .  pretty warm there  i think .         ah  nubilia     said colon .  he invented desperately .     right .  yes .  it   s one of them klatchian places .  yeah .  got lots of sand .  and mountains .  exports dates .  why   d you want to know .         oh   no reason .         nobby .         yes  sarge .         why are you carrying that huge book .         hah  clever idea  sarge .  i saw what you said about that book of your great grandad  so if there   s any fighting i got this one off   f washpot .  it   s the book of om .  five inches thick .         it   s a bit big for a pocket  nobby .  it   s a bit big for a cart  to be honest .         i thought i could make sort of braces to carry it .  i reckon even a longbow could only get an arrow as far as the apocrypha .      a familiar creak made them look up .   a klatchian   s head was swinging in the breeze .      fancy a pint .     said sergeant colon .     big anjie brews up some that   s a treat .         better not  sarge .  mr .  vimes is in a bit of a mood .      colon sighed .     you   re right .      nobby looked up at the head again .  it was wooden .  it had been repainted many times over the centuries .  the klatchian was smiling very happily for someone who   d never have to buy a shirt ever again .      the klatchian   s head .  my grandad said his grandad remembered when it was still the real one     colon said .     of course  it was about the size of a walnut by then .         bit   nasty  sticking up a bloke   s head for a pub sign     said nobby .      no  nobby .  spoils of war  right .  some bloke came back from one of the wars with a souvenir  stuck it on a pole and opened a pub .  the klatchian   s head .  teach    em not to do it again .         i used to get into enough trouble just for nicking boots     said nobby .      more robust times  nobby .         you ever met a klatchian  sarge .     said nobby  as they began to pace the length of the quiet street .     i mean one of the wild ones .         well  no   but you know what .  they   re allowed three wives .  that   s criminal  that is .         yeah     cos here   s me and i ain   t got one     said nobby .      and they eat funny grub .  curry and that .      nobby gave this some thought .     like   we do  when we   re on late duty .         weelll  yerss   but they don   t do it properly           you mean runny ear wax yellow with peas and currants in  like your mum used to do .         right .  you poke around as much as you like in a klatchian curry and you won   t find a single piece of swede .         and i heard where they eat sheep   s eyeballs  too     said nobby  international gastra gnome .      right again .         not decent ordinary stuff like lambs    fry or sweetbreads  then .         that   s   right .      colon felt that he was being got at in some way .      look  nobby  when all   s said and done they ain   t the right color  and there   s an end to it .         good job you found out  fred .     said nobby  so cheerfully that sergeant colon was almost sure that he meant it .      well  it   s obvious     he conceded .      er   what is the right color .     said nobby .      white  of course .         not brick red  then .     cos you           are you winding me up  corporal nobbs .            course not  sarge .  so   what color am i .      that caused sergeant colon to think .  you could have found  somewhere on corporal nobbs  a shade appropriate to every climate on the disc and a few found only in specialist medical books .      white   s   white   s a state of  you know   mind     he said .     it   s like   doing an honest day   s work for an honest day   s pay  that sort of thing .  and washing regular .         not lazing around  sort of thing .         right .         or   like   working all hours like goriff does .         nobby           and you never see those kids of his with dirty clo           nobby  you   re just trying to get me going  right .  you know we   re better   n klatchians .  otherwise  what   s the point .  anyway  if we   re going to fight    em  you could get locked up for going around talking treachery .         are you going to fight them  fred .      fred colon scratched his chin .     well  as a hexperienced milit   ry man  i suppose i   ll have to           what   re you going to do .  join a regiment and go to the front .         we ell   my fore tay lies in training  so i reckon i   d better stay here and train up the new recruits .         here at the back  you might say .         we all have to do our bit  nobby .  if it was down to me i   d be out there like a shot to give johnny klatchian a taste of cold steel .         their razor sharp swords wouldn   t worry you  then .         i should laugh at them with scorn  nobby .         but s   posing the klatchians attack here .  then you   ll be at the front  and the front will be at the back .         i   ll sort of try for a posting in the middle           the middle of the front or           gentlemen .      they looked round to find that they had been followed by a man of medium height but with an extraordinary head .  it wasn   t that he had gone bald .  he had quite a lot of hair  which was long and curly and reached almost to his shoulders  and his beard was large enough to conceal a small chicken .  but his head had simply risen through his hair  like a kind of intrusive dome .   he gave them a friendly smile .      am i by any chance addressing the heroic sergeant colon and the       the man looked at nobby .  expressions of amazement  dread  interest and charity passed across his otherwise sunny countenance like storm driven clouds .     and the corporal nobbs .     he finished .      that is us  citizen     said colon .      ah  good .  i was very specifically told to find you .  it   s quite amazing  you know .  no one had even broken into the boathouse  although i must say i did design the locks rather well .  and all i   ve had to do is replace the leatherwork around the joints and grease it up   oh  do excuse me  i   ve got rather ahead of myself .  now   there was a message i had to give you   what was it now .    something about your hands       he reached down into the large canvas bag by his feet and pulled out a long tube  which he handed to nobby .      i do apologize about this     he said  producing a smaller tube and handing it to colon .     i had to do things in such a hurry  there really was no time to finish it off properly  and frankly the materials are not very good        colon looked at his tube .  it was pointed at one end .      this is a firework rocket     he said .     look  it   s got    a riot of colored balls and stars    on it           yes  i do so apologize     said the man  lifting a complex little arrangement of wood and metal out of the bag .     may i have the tube back  corporal .     he took it and screwed the arrangement on to one end .     thank you   yes  i   m afraid that without my lathe and  indeed  my forge  i really have had to make do with what i could find lying around   could i have the rocket back  please .  thank you .         they don   t go properly without a stick     said nobby .      oh  in fact they do     said the man .     just not very accurately .      he raised the tube to shoulder height and peered into a small wire grid .      that seems about right     he said .      and they don   t go along     said nobby .     they just go up .         a common misconception     said leonard of quirm  turning to face them .   colon could see the tip of the rocket in the depths of the tube  and had a sudden image of stars and balls .      now  apparently you two have to step into this alley here and come with me     said leonard .     i   m very sorry about this  but his lordship has explained to me at great length how the needs of society as a whole may have to overrule the rights of a particular individual .  oh  and i   ve just remembered .  you have to put your hands up .         sand had been spilled across the big table in the rats chamber .   lord rust felt a sensation akin to pleasure as he surveyed it .  there were the little square boxes for the towns and cities  and cut out palm trees to indicate the known oasisies .  and  although he was uneasy about the word    oasisies     lord rust looked at it and saw that it was good .  especially since it was a map of klatch and everyone knew that klatch was sand anyway  which made it rather satisfying in an existential sort of way  although this sand here had been commandeered from the heap behind chalky the troll   s wholesale pottery and bore the occasional cigarette end and trace of feline incontinence that would probably not be found in the real desert  or certainly not to scale .      here would be a good landing area     he said  pointing with his stick .   his equerry tried to look helpful .     the el kinte peninsula     he said .     that   s the closest point to us  sir .         exactly .  we can be across the straits in jig time .         very good  sir     said lieutenant hornett     but   you don   t think the enemy might be expecting us there .  it being such an obvious landing site .         not obvious at all to the trained military thinker  sir .  they won   t be expecting us there precisely because it is so obvious  d   y   see .         you mean   they   ll think only a complete idiot would land there  sir .         correct .  and they know we   re not complete idiots  sir  and therefore that will be the last place they will be expecting us  d   y   see .  they   ll be expecting us somewhere like      his stick stabbed into the sand      here .      hornett looked closely .  in the street outside  someone started to bang a drum .      oh  you mean eritor     he said .     where i believe there is a concealed landing area  and two days    forced march through good cover would have us at the heart of the empire  sir .         exactly .         whereas landing at el kinte means three days over sand dunes and past the fortified city of gebra           precisely .  wide open spaces .  and that is where we can practice the art of warfare .     lord rust raised his voice above the drumming .     that   s how you settle these things .  one decisive battle .  us on one side  the klatchians on the other .  that is how these things are d        he threw down his pointer .     who the devil is making that infernal noise .      the equerry walked across to the window .     it   s someone else recruiting  sir     he said .      but we   re all here .      the equerry hesitated  as the bearers of bad tidings to short tempered men often do .      it   s vimes  sir           recruiting for the watch .         er   no  my lord .  for a regiment .  er   the banner says    sir samuel vimes   s first of foot     my lord           the arrogance of the man .  go and   no  i   ll go myself .      there was a crowd in the street .  in the center there rose the bulk of constable dorfl  and a key thing about the golem was that if he was banging a drum then no one was going to ask him to stop .  no one except possibly lord rust  who strode up and snatched the drumsticks out of his hands .      yerss  it are species of your choice   s life in der first of foot .     shouted sergeant detritus  unaware of the events going on behind him .     you learnin    a trade .  you learnin    self respek .  also you get spiffy uniform plus all der boots you can eat   here  dat   s my banner .         what   s the meaning of this .     said rust  flinging the homemade banner on to the ground .     vimes can   t do this .      a figure detached itself from the wall  where it had been watching the show .      you know  i rather think i can     said vimes .  he handed rust a piece of paper .     it   s all here  my lord .  with references citing the highest authorities  in case you are in any doubt .         citing the    .         on the role of a knight  my lord .  in fact the duties of a knight  funnily enough .  a lot of it is pretty damn stupid stuff  riding around the place on one of those bloody great horses with curtains round it and so on  but one of them says in time of need a knight has to raise and maintain   you   ll laugh when i tell you this   a body of armed soldiers .  no one could have been more surprised than me  i don   t mind telling you .  seems there   s nothing for it but i have to go out and get some chaps together .  of course  most of the watch have joined  well  you know how it is  disciplined lads  anxious to do their bit  so that saved me a bit of effort .  except for nobby nobbs     cos he says if he leaves it till thursday he   s going to have enough white feathers for a mattress .      rust   s expression would have preserved meat for a year .      this is a nonsense     he said .     and you  vimes  certainly are no knight .  only a king can make           there   s a good few lordships in this city created by the patricians     said vimes .     your friend lord downey  for one .  you were saying .         then if you persist in playing games i will say that before a knight is created he must spend a night   s vigil watching his armor           practically every night of my life     said vimes .     a man doesn   t keep an eye on his armor round here  that man   s got no armor in the morning .         in prayer     said rust sharply .      that   s me     said vimes .     not a night has gone by without me thinking     ye gods  i hope i get through this alive .               and he must have proved himself on the field of combat .  against other trained men  vimes .  not vermin and thugs .      vimes started to undo the strap of his helmet .      well  this isn   t the best of moments  my lord  but if someone   ll hold your coat i can spare you five minutes        in vimes   s eyes rust recognized the fiery gleam of burning boats .      i know what you   re doing  vimes  and i am not going to rise to it     he said  taking a step back .     in any case  you have had no formal training in arms .         that   s true     said vimes .     you   ve got me there  right enough .  no one ever trained me in arms .  i was lucky there .     he leaned closer and lowered his voice so that the watching crowd wouldn   t hear .     y   see  i know what    training in arms    means  ronald .  there hasn   t been a real war in ages .  so it   s all prancing around wearing padded waistcoats and waving swords with knobs on the end so no one   ll really get hurt  isn   t it .  but down in the shades no one   s had any training in arms either .  wouldn   t know an   p  e from a sabre .  no  what they   re good at is a broken bottle in one hand and a length of four by two in the other and when you face    em  ronnie  you know you aren   t going off for a laugh and a jolly drink afterward     cos they want you dead .  they want to kill you  you see  ron .  and by the time you   ve swung your nice shiny broadsword they   ve carved their name and address on your stomach .  and that   s where i got my training in arms .  well   fists and knees and teeth and elbows  mostly .         you  sir  are no gentleman     said rust .      i knew there was something about me that i liked .         can you not even see that you can   t enroll   dwarfs and trolls in an ankh morpork regiment .         it just says    armed soldiers     and dwarfs come with their own axes .  a great saving .  besides  if you   ve ever seen them really fight  then you must   ve been on the same side .         vimes           it   s sir samuel  my lord .      rust seemed to think for a moment .      very well  then     he said .     then you and your   regiment come under my command           strangely  no     said vimes swiftly .     under the command of the king or his duly appointed representative  it says in scavone   s chivalric law and usage .  and  of course  there has been no duly appointed representative ever since some complete bastard cut off the last king   s head .  oh  assorted bods appeared to have been ruling the city  but according to the chivalric tradition        rust stopped to think again .  he had the look of a lawnmower just after the grass has organized a workers    collective .  there was a definite suggestion that  deep inside  he knew this was not really happening .  it could not be happening because this sort of thing did not happen .  any contradictory evidence could be safely ignored .  however  it might be necessary to find some motions to go through .      i think you   ll find that  legally  your position       he began  and his eyes bulged for a moment as vimes interrupted him cheerfully .      oh  there might be a few problems  i grant you .  but if you ask mr .  slant he   ll say    this is a very interesting case     which as you know is lawyer talk for    one thousand dollars a day plus expenses and it   ll take months .     so i   ll leave you to get on with it  shall i .  got such a lot of things to do  you know .  i think the swatches for the new uniforms should be in my office about now  it   s so important to look right on the battlefield  isn   t it .      rust gave vimes another look  and then strode away .   detritus stamped to attention beside vimes and his salute clanged smartly off his helmet .      what we doin    now  sir .         we can pack up now  i think .  all the lads have joined up .         yessir .             you told them it wasn   t compulsory .         yessir .  i said     it ain   t compuls   ry  you just gotta     sir .         detritus  i wanted volunteers .            sright  sir .  they volunteered all right  i saw to that .      vimes sighed as he walked back to his office .  but they were probably safe .  he was pretty sure he was legally sound and if he knew anything about rust  the man would respect the letter of the law .  such men did  in a chilly way .  besides  thirty men in the watch simply didn   t figure in the great scheme of things .  rust could ignore them .   suddenly there   s a war brewing  vimes thought  and they all come back .  civil order is turned upside down  because that   s the rules .  and people like rust are at the top of the heap again .  you have these aristocrats lazing around for years  and suddenly the old armor   s out and the sword is being taken down from over the fireplace .  they think there   s going to be a war and all they can think about is that wars can be won or lost     someone   s behind this .  someone wants to see a war .  someone paid to have ossie and snowy killed .  someone wanted the prince dead .  i   ve got to remember that .  this isn   t a war .  this is a crime .   and then he realized he was wondering if the attack on goriff   s shop had been organized by the same people  and whether those same people had set fire to the embassy .   and then he realized why he was thinking like this .   it was because he wanted there to be conspirators .  it was much better to imagine men in some smoky room somewhere  made mad and cynical by privilege and power  plotting over the brandy .  you had to cling to this sort of image  because if you didn   t then you might have to face the fact that bad things happened because ordinary people  the kind who brushed the dog and told their children bedtime stories  were capable of then going out and doing horrible things to other ordinary people .  it was so much easier to blame it on them .  it was bleakly depressing to think that they were us .  if it was them  then nothing was anyone   s fault .  if it was us  what did that make me .  after all  i   m one of us .  i must be .  i   ve certainly never thought of myself as one of them .  no one ever thinks of themselves as one of them .  we   re always one of us .  it   s them that do the bad things .   around about this time  in his former life  vimes would be taking the cap off a bottle  and wouldn   t be too bothered about the bottle   s contents so long as they crinkled paint        ook .         oh  hello .  what can i do for   oh  yes  i asked about books on klatch   is that all .      the librarian shyly held out a small  battered green book .  vimes had been expecting something bigger  but he took it anyway .  it paid to look at any book the orangutan gave you .  he matched you up to books .  vimes supposed it was a knack  in the same way that an undertaker was very good at judging heights .   on the spine  in very faded gold lettering  were the words    veni vidi vici  a soldier   s life by gen .  a .  tacticus .         nobby and sergeant colon edged along the alley .      i know who he is .     fred hissed .     that   s leonard of quirm  that is .  he went missing five years ago .         so he   s called leonard and he   s from quirm  so what .     said nobby .      he   s a raving genius .         he   s a loony .         yeah  well  they say there   s a thin line between genius and madness           he   s fallen off it  then .      the voice behind them said     oh  dear  this won   t do at all  will it    .  i can   t deny it  you were quite right  the accuracy would be quite unacceptable at any reasonable range .  could you bear to stop a moment  please .      they turned .  leonard was already dismantling the tube .      if you could just hang on to this bit  corporal   and  sergeant  if you would be so good as to hold this piece steady   some sort of fins should do it  i   m sure i had a suitable piece of wood somewhere       leonard began to pat his pockets .   the watchmen realized that the man holding them up had paused to redesign his weapon and had given it to them to hold while he looked for a screwdriver .  this was a thing that did not often happen .   nobby silently took the rocket from colon and pushed it into the tube .      what   s this bit here  mister .     he said .   leonard glanced up briefly in between patting his pockets .      oh  that is the trigger     he said .     which  as you can see  rubs against the flint and           good .      there was a short burst of flame and rather more black smoke .      oh  dear     said leonard .   the watchmen turned  like men dreading what they were about to see .  the rocket had shot the length of the alley and through the window of a house .      ah   putting    this way up    on the projectile would be an important safety point to bear in mind for the new design     said leonard .     now  where   s that notebook    .         i think we   d better leave     said colon  moving backward .     very fast .      inside the house there was an explosion of stars and balls to delight young and old but not the troll who had just opened the door .      ah  really .     said leonard .     well  if speed is required  i have this very interesting design for a two wheeled        acting on an unspoken agreement  the watchmen each put a hand under a shoulder  lifted him off the ground  and ran for it .      oh  dear     said leonard  as he was dragged backward .   the watchmen dived into a side alley  and then jinked and dodged along several others with quiet professionalism .  finally they leaned leonard against a wall and peered round the end of the alley .      all clear     said nobby .     they went the other way .         right     said colon .     now  what was you doing .  i mean  you might be a genius like i heard  mister da quirm  but when it comes to threatening people you   re as clever as an inflatable dartboard .         i appear to have been a bit of a juggins  don   t i .     leonard agreed .     but i do implore you to come with me .  i   m afraid i thought that as warriors you would be more inclined to understand force           well  yes  we   re warriors     said sergeant colon .     but              ere  have you got another one of these rockets .     said nobby  hefting the tube onto his shoulder again .  he had the special gleam in his eye that a small man gets when he   s laid his hands on a big  big weapon .      i may have     said leonard  and the gleam in his eye was the mad twinkle of the naturally innocent when they think they   re being cunning .     why don   t we go and see .  you see  i was told to fetch you by any means necessary .         bribery sounds good     said nobby .  he put his eye to the tube   s sights and started making    whoosh    noises .      who told you to fetch us .     said colon .      lord vetinari .         the patrician wants us .         yes .  he said you have special qualities and must come at once .         to the palace .  i heard he   d done a runner .         oh  no .  to the  er   to the  er   docks           special qualities  eh .     said colon .      er  sarge       nobby began .      now then  nobby     said colon importantly .     it   s about time we were given some recognition  you know that .  hexperienced officers are the backbone of the force .  seems to me     he went on     seems to me that this is a case of cometh the time  cometh the man .         when   s he cometh .         i   m talking about us .  men with special qualities .      nobby nodded  but with a certain amount of reluctance .  in many ways he was a much clearer thinker than his superior officer  and he was worrying about    special qualities .     being picked for something because of your    special qualities    was tantamount to being volunteered .  anyway  what was so special about    special qualities    .  limpets had special qualities .      will we go undercover again .     said colon .   leonard blinked .     there   yes  i think i can say there is a strong under element involved .  yes  indeed .         sarge           you just be quiet  corporal .     colon pulled nobby closer .     undercover means not getting stabbed and shot at  right .     he whispered .     and what   s the most important thing a professional soldier wants not to happen to him .         not getting stabbed and shot     said nobby automatically .      right .  so let   s be going  mr .  quirm .  the call has come .         well done .     said leonard .     tell me  sergeant  are you of a nautical persuasion .      colon saluted again .     nossir .  happily married man  sir .         i meant  have you ploughed the ocean waves at all .      colon gave him a cunning look .      ah  you can   t catch me with that one  sir     he said .     everyone knows the horses would sink .      leonard paused for a moment and retuned his brain to radio colon .      have you  in the past  floated around  on the sea  in a boat  at all .         me  sir .  not me  sir .  it   s the sight of the waves going up and down  sir .         really .     said leonard .     well  happily  that will not be a problem .         all right  start again     assembling facts  that   s what it was about     the world watched .  someone wanted the watch to say that the assassination had been inspired by klatch .  who .   someone had also beheaded snowy slopes where he stood and left him deader than six buckets of fish bait .   a vision of    hour ahmed   s big curved sword presented itself for his attention .  so        let   s assume that ahmed was khufurah   s servant or bodyguard  and he   d found out     no  how could that work .  who   d tell him .   well  maybe he   d found out somehow  and that meant that he might also know who   d paid the man     vimes sat back .  it was still a mystery but he   d solve it  he knew he would .  he   d assemble the facts  analyze them  look at them from every angle with an open mind  and find out exactly how lord rust had organized it .   rank bad hat .  he didn   t have to sit still for something like that  especially from a man who rhymed    house    with    mice .      his eye was caught by the ancient book .  general tacticus .  every kid knew about him .  ankh morpork had ruled a huge empire and a lot of it had been in klatch  thanks to him .  except there wasn   t any thanks for him  strangely enough .  vimes had never quite known why  but the city seemed to be rather ashamed of the general .   one reason  of course  was that he   d ended up fighting ankh morpork .  the city of genua had run out of royalty  inbreeding having progressed to the point where the sole remaining example consisted mostly of teeth  and senior courtiers had written to ankh morpork asking for help .   there   d been a lot of that sort of thing  vimes had been surprised to learn .  the little kingdoms of the sto plains were forever scrounging spare royalty off one another .  the king had sent tacticus out of sheer exasperation .  it   s hard to run a proper empire when you   re constantly getting bloodstained letters on the lines of  dear sire  i beg to inform you that we have conquered betrek  smale and ushistan .  please send am        back pay .  the man never knew when to stop .  so he was hastily made a duke and packed off to genua  whereupon his first action was to consider what was that city   s greatest military threat and then  having identified it  to declare war on ankh morpork .   but what else had anyone expected .  he   d done his duty .  he   d brought back heaps of spoils  lots of captives and  almost uniquely among ankh morpork   s military leaders  most of his men .  vimes suspected that this last fact was one reason why history didn   t approve .  there was a suggestion that this was  in some way  not playing fair .      veni  vidi  vici .     that was what the man was supposed to have said when he   d conquered   where .  pseudopolis  wasn   t it .  or al khali .  or quirm .  maybe sto lat .  that was in the old days when you attacked anyone else   s city on principle  and went back and did them over again if they looked like getting up .  and in those days  you didn   t care if the world watched .  you wanted them to watch  and learn .     veni  vidi  vici .     i came  i saw  i conquered .   as a comment it always struck vimes as a bit too pat .  it wasn   t the sort of thing you came up with on the spur of the moment  was it .  it sounded as if he had worked it out .  he   d probably spent long evenings in his tent  looking up in the dictionary short words beginning with v and trying them out   veni  vermini  vomui  i came  i got ratted  i threw up .  visi  veneri  vamoosi  i visited  i caught an embarrassing disease  i ran away .  it must have been a big relief to come up with three short acceptable words .  he probably made them up first  and then went off to see somewhere and conquer it .   he opened the book at random .      it is always useful to face an enemy who is prepared to die for his country     he read .     this means that both you and he have exactly the same aim in mind .         hah .         bingeley bingeley b        vimes   s hand slammed down on the box .      yes .  what is it .         three oh five pee em  interview with cpl littlebottom re missing sgt colon     said the demon sulkily .      i never arranged anything like   who told you    .  are you telling me that i   ve got an appointment and i don   t know about it .         that   s right .         so how do you know about it .         you told me to know about it .  last night     said the demon .      you can tell me about appointments i don   t know about .     said vimes .      they   re still appointments sine qua appointments     said the demon .     they exist  as it were  in appointment phase space .         what the hell does that mean .         look     said the demon patiently     you can have an appointment at any time  right .  so therefore any appointment exists in potentia           where   s that .         any particular appointment simply collapses the waveform     said the demon .     i merely select the most likely one from the projected matrix .         you   re just making this up     said vimes .     if you were right  then any second now        someone knocked at the door .  it was a polite  tentative tap .   vimes didn   t take his eyes off the smirking demon .      is that you  corporal littlebottom .     he said .      yes  sir .  sergeant colon has sent a pigeon .  i thought you ought to see it  sir .         come in .      a small roll of thin paper was placed on his desk .  he read       have volunteered for a mission of vital importance .  nobby is here also .  there will be statchoos of us when this day   s work is over .  ps someone i can   t tell you who says this note will self destruct in five seconds  he is sorry he hasn   t got good chemicles to do it better       the paper began to crinkle around the edges and then vanished in a small puff of acrid smoke .   vimes stared at the little pile of ash that remained .      i suppose it   s a mercy they didn   t blow up the pigeon  sir     said cheery .      what the hell are they up to .  well  i can   t chase around after them .  thanks  cheery .      the dwarf saluted and departed .      coincidence     said vimes .      all right  then     said the demon .     bingeley bingeley beep .  three fifteen pee em  emergency meeting with captain carrot .         it was a cylinder  tapering to a point at both ends .  at one end the taper was quite complex  the cylinder narrowing in a succession of smaller and smaller rings  overlapping one another until they ended in a large fishtail .  oiled leather could be seen gleaming in the gaps between the metal .   at the other end  extending from the cylinder for all the world like the horn of a unicorn  was a very long and pointed screw thread .   the whole thing was mounted on a crude trolley  which was in turn riding on a pair of iron rails that disappeared into the black water at the far end of the boathouse .      looks like a giant fish to me     said colon .     made of tin .         with an    orn     said nobby .      it   ll never float     said colon .     i can see where you   ve gone wrong there .  everyone knows metal sinks .         not entirely true     said leonard  diplomatically .     in any case  this boat is designed to sink .         what .         propulsion was a major headache  i   m afraid     said leonard  climbing up a stepladder .     i thought of paddles and oars  and even some kind of screw  and then i thought  dolphins  that   s the ticket .  they move extremely fast with barely an effort .  that   s out at sea  of course  we only get the shovel nosed dolphin in our estuary here .  the linkage rods are a bit complicated but i used to be able to get quite a turn of speed .  the pedalling can be somewhat tiresome  but with three of us we should be able to get up to some quite satisfactory accelerations .  it   s amazing what you can do when you imitate nature  i just wish my flying exp   oh   where did you go    .      it would be difficult to establish what part of satisfactorily accelerating nature the watchmen were trying to imitate  but it was a part which tended to get stuck in doors a lot .   they stopped struggling and began to back into the room .      ah  sergeant     said lord vetinari  entering in front of them .     and corporal nobbs  too .  leonard has explained everything to you .         you can   t ask us to go in that thing  sir .  it   ll be suicide .     said colon .   the patrician brought his hands together in front of his lips in the manner of someone praying  and sucked air thoughtfully .      no .  no  i think you are wrong     he said at last  as if reaching a conclusion on some complex metaphysical conundrum .     i think that  in all probability  going into that thing would be a valiant and possibly rewarding deed .  i would venture to suggest that  in fact  it is not going that would be suicidal .  but i would appreciate your views .      lord vetinari was not a heavily built man and  these days  he walked with the aid of an ebony cane .  no one could remember seeing him handle a weapon  and a flash of unaccustomed insight told sergeant colon that this was not in fact a comforting thought at all .  they said he   d been educated at the assassins    school  but no one remembered what weapons he   d learned .  he   d studied languages .  and suddenly  with him in front of you  this didn   t seem like the soft option .   sergeant colon saluted  always a useful thing to do in an emergency such as this  and shouted     corporal nobbs  why aren   t you in the   the metal sinking fish thing .         sarge .         let   s see you get up them steps  lad   hup hup hup        nobby scrambled up the ladder and disappeared .  colon saluted again .  you could usually tell his nervousness by the smartness of his salute .  you could have cut bread with this one .      ready to go  sah .     he shouted .      well done  sergeant     said vetinari .     you   re displaying exactly those special qualities i   m looking for                 ere  sarge     came a metallic voice from the belly of the fish     there   s all chains and cogwheels in here .  what   s this do .     the big auger in front of the thing started to squeak round .   leonard appeared from behind the fish .      i think we should all get in     he said .     i   ve lit the candle that   ll burn down and sever the string that   ll release the weight that   ll pull the blocks out .         er   what is this thing called .     said colon  as he followed the patrician up the ladder .      well  because it is submersed in a marine environment i   ve always called it the going under the water safely device     said leonard  behind him .      but usually i just think of it as the boat .      he reached behind him and shut the lid .   after a moment any listener in the boathouse would have heard a complicated clonk as bolts slid into place .   the candle burned down and severed the string that released the weight that pulled the blocks out and  slowly at first  the boat slid down the rails and into the dark water which  after a second or two  closed over it with a gloop .      no one took any notice of angua as she trotted up the gangplank .  the important thing  she knew  was to look at home .  no one bothered a large dog that looked as though it knew where it was going .   people were milling about on deck in the manner peculiar to nonsailors on board ship  not sure of what they should be doing or where they should refrain from doing it .  some of the more stoic ones had made little camps  defining with bundles and pieces of cloth tiny areas of private property .  they reminded angua of the bicolored drainpipes and microscopically delineated household boundaries in money trap lane  yet another way of drawing a line in the sand .  this is mine  and that is yours .  trespass on mine  and you   ll get yours .   there were a couple of guards standing on either side of the door to the cabins .  they hadn   t been told to stop dogs .   scents led down below .  she could smell the dogs and a strong odor of cloves .   at the end of the narrow passage a door was ajar .  she forced it open with her nose and looked around .   the dogs were lying on a rug on one side of a large cabin .  other dogs might have barked  but these just turned their beautiful heads toward her  sighted down the length of their noses and examined her carefully .   a narrow bed beyond them was half concealed by silk hangings .     hour ahmed was bending over it  but he turned when she entered .   he glanced toward the dogs and gave her a puzzled look .  then  to her amazement  he sat down on the deck in front of her .      and who do you belong to .     he said in perfect morporkian .   angua wagged her tail .  there was someone in the bed  she could smell them  but they wouldn   t be a problem .  jaw muscles strong enough to sever someone   s neck help you to feel relaxed in most situations .   ahmed patted her on the head .  very few people have ever done that to a werewolf without having to get people to cut up their meals for them in future  but angua had learned self control .   then he stood up and went to the door .  she heard him say something to someone outside  and then he came back into the room and smiled at her .      i go  i come back        he opened a small cupboard and took out a jewelled dog collar .     you shall have a collar .  oh  and here is some food     he added  as a servant brought in some bowls .        knick knack  paddywack  give a dog a bone    is a rhyme i hear your ankh morpork children sing  but a paddywack is a ball of gristle suitable only for animal food and who knows what part of the animal is its knick knack        the plate was put in front of angua .  the other dogs stirred  but ahmed snapped a word at them and they settled back again .   the food was   dog food .  in ankh morpork terms  it meant something that you wouldn   t even put in a sausage  and there are very few things that a man with a big enough mincer cannot put in a sausage .   the little central human part of her was revolted  but the werewolf drooled at the sight of every glistening tube and wobbly fat bit     it was on a silver plate .   she looked up .  ahmed was watching her carefully .   of course  the royal dogs were treated like kings  all those diamond collars   it didn   t have to mean he knew        not hungry .     he said .     your mouth says you are .      something snapped around her neck as she spun around to bite .  her teeth closed on a mouthful of greasy cloth but that wasn   t as important as the pain .      his highness has always liked fine collars on his dogs     said    hour ahmed  through the red mist .     rubies  emeralds   and diamonds  miss angua .     his face came down level with hers .     set in silver .               a crucial factor  i have always found  is not the size of the forces .  it is the positioning and commitment of reserves  the bringing of power to a point        vimes tried to concentrate on tacticus .  but there were two distractions .  one was that the grinning face of    hour ahmed looked out at him from every line .  the other was his watch  which he had propped up against the dis organizer .  it was powered by actual clockwork and was much more reliable .  and it never needed feeding .  it ticked quietly .  as far as it was concerned  he could forget his appointments .  he liked it .   the second hand was just curving toward the top of the minute when he heard someone coming up the stairs .      come in  captain     said vimes .  there was a snigger from the box .   carrot   s face was pinker than normal .      something   s happened to angua     said vimes .   the high color drained from carrot   s face .     how did you know that .      vimes firmly closed the lid on the sniggering demon .     let   s call it intuition  shall we .  i   m right  am i .         yes  sir .  she went aboard a klatchian boat and now it   s sailing .  she hasn   t come off .         what the hell did she go on board for .         we were after ahmed .  and he looked as if he was taking someone with him  sir .  someone ill  sir .         he   s left .  but the diplomats are still        vimes stopped .  there was  if you didn   t know carrot  something wrong with the situation .  there were people who  when their girlfriend was spirited away on a foreign ship  would have dived into the ankh  or at least run briskly along the crust  leapt aboard and dealt out merry hell on a democratic basis .  of course  at a time like this that would be a dumb thing to do .  the sensible approach would be to let people know  but even so     but carrot really did believe that personal wasn   t the same as important .  of course  vimes believed the same thing .  you had to hope that when push came to shove you   d act the right way .  but there was something slightly creepy about someone who didn   t just believe it  but lived their life by it .  it was as unnerving as meeting a really poor priest .   obviously  it was a consideration that if someone had captured angua you knew that the rescue you were going to probably wouldn   t be hers .   but     the gods alone knew what would happen if he left now .  the city had gone war mad .  big things were happening .  at a time like this  every cell in his body was telling him that the commander of the watch had responsibilities     he drummed his fingers on the desk .  in times like this  it was vital to make the right decision .  that was what he was paid for .  responsibility     he ought to stay here  and do the best he could .   but   history was full of the bones of good men who   d followed bad orders in the hope that they could soften the blow .  oh  yes  there were worse things they could do  but most of them began right where they started following bad orders .   his eyes went from carrot to the dis organizer and then to the tottering mounds of paperwork on his desk .   blow that .  he was a thief taker .  he   d always be a thief taker .  why lie .      damned if i   ll let ahmed get back to klatch .     he said  standing up .     fast boat  was it .         yes  but it looked pretty heavy in the water .         then maybe we can catch it up before it goes very far        as he hurried forward he had  just for a second  the strange sensation that he was two people .  and this was because  for the merest fraction of a second  he was two people .  they were both called samuel vimes .   to history  choices are merely directions .  the trousers of time opened up and vimes began to hurtle down one leg of them .   and  somewhere else  the vimes who made a different choice began to drop into a different future .   they both darted back to grab their dis organizers .  by the most outrageous of freak chances  quite uniquely  in this split second of decision  they each got the wrong one .   and sometimes the avalanche depends on one snowflake .  sometimes a pebble is allowed to find out what might have happened   if only it had bounced the other way .      the wizards of ankh morpork had been very firm on the subject of printing .  it   s not happening here  they said .  supposing  they said  someone printed a book on magic and then broke up the type again and used it for a book on  say  cookery .  the metal would remember .  spells aren   t just words .  they have extra dimensions of existence .  we   d be up to here in talking souffl  s .  besides  someone might print thousands of the damn things  many of which could well be read by unsuitable people .   the engravers    guild was also against printing .  there was something pure  they said  about an engraved page of text .  it was there  whole  unsullied .  their members could do very fine work at very reasonable rates .  allowing unskilled people to bash lumps of type together showed a disrespect for words and no good would come of it .   the only attempt ever to set up a printing press in ankh morpork had ended in a mysterious fire and the death by suicide of the luckless printer .  everyone knew it was suicide because he   d left a note .  the fact that this had been engraved on the head of a pin was considered an irrelevant detail .   and the patrician was against printing because if people knew too much it would only bother them .   so people relied on word of mouth  which worked very well because the mouths were so close together .  a lot of them were just below the noses of the members of the beggars    guild   citizens generally regarded as reasonably reliable and well informed .  some of them were highly thought of for their sports coverage .   lord rust looked thoughtfully at cumbling michael  a grade ii mutterer .      and what happened next .      cumbling michael scratched his wrist .  he   d recently got his extra grade because he   d finally managed to catch a disfiguring but harmless skin disease .      mr .  carrot was in there about two minutes  m   lord .  then they all come runnin    out  right  an    they           who were they .     said rust .  he fought off an urge to scratch his own arm .      there was carrot an    vimes anna dwarf an    a zombie an    all of them  m   lord .  they ran all the way to the docks  m   lord  and vimes saw captain jenkins and he said              ah  captain jenkins .  this is your lucky day .      the captain looked up from the rope he was coiling .  no one likes being told it   s their lucky day .  that sort of thing does not bode well .  when someone tells you it   s your lucky day  something bad is about to happen .      it is .     he said .      yes  because you have an unrivalled opportunity to aid the war effort .         i have .         and also to demonstrate your patriotism     carrot added .      i do .         we need to borrow your boat     said vimes .      bugger off .         i   m choosing to believe that was a salty nautical expression meaning    why  certainly        said vimes .     captain carrot .         sir .         you and detritus go and look behind that false partition in the hold     said vimes .      right  sir     said carrot  walking toward the ladder .      there   s no false partition in the hold .     snapped jenkins .     and i know the law  and you can   t        there was a crash of timber from below .      if that wasn   t a false partition  our carrot   s gone and knocked a hole in the side     said vimes calmly  watching the captain .      er           i know the law  too     said vimes .  he drew his sword .     see this .     he said  holding it up .     this is military law .  and military law is a sword .  not a two edged sword .  there   s only one edge  and it   s pointing at you .  found anything  carrot .      carrot appeared over the edge of the hold .  there was a crossbow in his hand .      i do declare     said vimes     but that looks to me like a burleigh and stronginthearm    viper    mk    which kills people but leaves buildings standing .         there   s crates and crates of stuff     said carrot .         s no law       jenkins began  but he sounded as if the bottom was dropping out of his world .      you know  i think there probably is some law against selling weapons to the enemy in times of war     said vimes .     of course  there might not be .  tell you what     he added brightly     why don   t we all go along to sator square .  it   s full of people around this time  all very keen on the war and cheering our brave lads   why don   t we go along and put it to them .  you told me i ought to listen to the voice of the people .  odd thing  ain   t it   you meet people one at a time  they seem decent  they got brains that work  and then they get together and you hear the voice of the people .  and it snarls .         that   s mob rule .         oh  no  surely not     said vimes .     call it democratic justice .         one man  one rock     detritus volunteered .   jenkins looked like a man afraid the world was about to drop out of his bottom .  he glared at vimes and then at carrot  and saw no help there .      of course  you   d have nothing to fear from us     said vimes .     although you might trip on your way down the stairs to the cells .         there   s no stairs down to your cells .         stairs can be arranged .         please  mr .  jenkins     said carrot  the good cop .      i wasn   t   taking   the weapons to   klatch     jenkins said slowly  as if he was reading the words very painfully off some interior script .     i had   in fact   bought them to   donate them   to           yes .  yes .     said vimes .         our   brave lads     said jenkins .      well done .     said carrot .      and you   d be happy to    .     vimes prompted .      and   i   d be happy to   lend my boat to the war effort     said jenkins  sweating .      a true patriot     said vimes .   jenkins writhed .      who told you there was a false panel in the hold .     he demanded .     it was a guess  right .         right     said vimes .      aha .  i knew you were only guessing .         patriotic and clever     said vimes .     now   how do you make this thing go fast .         lord rust tapped his fingers on the table .      what did he take the boat for .         dunno  m   lord     said cumbling michael  scratching his head .      damn .  did anyone else see them .         oh  there weren   t many people around  m   lord .         that   s a small mercy  at least .         just me and foul ole ron and the duck man and ringo eyebrows and no way jos   and sidney lopsides and that bastard stoolie and whistling dick and a few others  m   lord .      rust sank back in his chair and put a pale hand over his face .  in ankh morpork the night had a thousand eyes and so did the day  and it also had five hundred mouths and nine hundred and ninety nine ears .       the klatchians must know  then     he said .     a detachment of ankh morpork soldiery has taken ship for klatch .  an invasion force .         oh  you could hardly call it       lieutenant hornett began .      the klatchians will call it that .  besides  the troll detritus is with them     said rust .   hornett looked glum .  detritus was an invasion force all by himself .      what ships have we commandeered .     said rust .      there   s more than twenty now  if you include the indestructible  the indolence and the       lieutenant hornett looked at his list again        and the prid of ankh morpork  sir .         the prid .         i   m afraid so  sir .         we should be able to take more than a thousand men and two hundred horses  then .         why not let vimes go .     said lord selachii .     let the klatchians deal with him  and good riddance .         and give them a victory over ankh morpork forces .  that   s how they will see it .  damn the man .  he forces our hand .  but still  perhaps it is for the best .  we should embark .         are we entirely ready  sir .     said lieutenant hornett  with the special inflection that means    we are not entirely ready  sir .         we had better be .  glory awaits  gentlemen .  in the words of general tacticus  let us take history by the scrotum .  of course  he was not a very honorable fighter .         white sunlight etched dark shadows in prince cadram   s palace .  he  too  had a map of klatch  made of tiny colored tiles set into the floor .  he sat looking at it pensively .      just one boat .     he said .   general ashal  his chief adviser  nodded .  and added     our scryers can   t get a very clear picture over that distance  but we do believe one of the men to be vimes .  you recall the name  sire .         ah  the useful commander vimes .     the prince smiled .      indeed .  and since then there has been a lot of activity all along the docks .  we have to take the view that the expeditionary force is setting out .         i thought we had at least a week  ashal .         it is certainly puzzling .  they cannot possibly be prepared  sire .  something must have happened .      cadram sighed .     oh  well  let us follow where fate points the way .  where will they attack .         gebra  sire .  i   m sure of it .         our most heavily fortified city .  surely not .  only an idiot would do that .         i have studied lord rust in some depth  sire .  remember that he doesn   t expect us to fight  so the size of our forces really doesn   t worry him .     the general smiled .  it was a neat  thin little smile .     and of course in attacking us he is piling infamy upon infamy .  the other coastal states will take note .         a change of plan  then     said cadram .     ankh morpork can wait .         a wise move  sire .  as always .         any news of my poor brother .         alas no  sire .         our agents must search harder .  the world is watching  ashal .         correct  sire .            sarge .         yes  nobby .         tell me again about our special qualities .         shut up and keep pedaling  nobby .         right  sarge .      it was quite dark in the boat .  a candle swung from a bracket over leonard of quirm   s bowed head as he sat steering with two levers .  around nobby  pulleys rattled and little chains clicked .  it was like being inside a sewing machine .  a damp one  too .  condensation dropped off the ceiling in a steady stream .   they had been pedaling for ten minutes .  leonard had spent most of the time talking excitedly .  nobby got the impression he didn   t get out much .  he talked about everything  there were the tanks of air  for example .  nobby was happy to accept that you could squeeze air up really small  and that was what was in the groaning  creaking steel bound casks strapped to the walls .  it was what happened to the air afterward that came as a surprise .      bubbles .     said leonard .     dolphins again  you see .  they don   t swim through the water  they fly through a cloud of bubbles .  which is much easier  of course .  i add a little soap  which seems to improve matters .         he thinks dolphins fly  sarge     whispered nobby .      just keep pedaling .      sergeant colon risked a glance behind him .   lord vetinari was sitting on an upturned box amidst the clicking chains  with several of leonard   s sketches open on his knees .      carry on  sergeant     said the patrician .      right  sir .      the boat was moving faster now they were away from the city .  there was even a brackish light filtering through the little glass windows .      mr .  leonard     said nobby .      yes .         where   re we going .         his lordship wishes to go to leshp .         yes  i thought it   d be something like that     said nobby .     i thought     where don   t i want to go .     and the answer just popped into my head  just like that .  only i don   t think we   ll get there  the reason bein     in about another five minutes my knees are going to fall off           oh  my word  you won   t have to pedal all the way     said leonard .     what did you think the big auger on the nose is for .         that .     said nobby .     i thought that was for drillin    into the bottom of enemy ships           what .     leonard spun around in his seat  a look of horror on his face .      sink ships .  sink ships .  with people on them .         well   yes           corporal nobbs  i think you are a very misguided young   man     said leonard stiffly .     use the boat to sink ships .  that would be terrible .  in any case  no sailor would dream of doing such a dishonorable thing .         sorry           the auger  i would have you know  is for attaching us to passing ships in the manner of the remora  the sucker fish which attaches itself to sharks .  a few turns is all that is necessary for a firm attachment .         so   you couldn   t bore all the way through the hull  then .         only if you were a very careless and extremely thoughtless young man .         the ocean waves may not be ploughable  but the crust of the river ankh downstream from the city was known to sprout small bushes in the summertime .  the milka moved slowly  leaving a furrow behind it .      can   t you go faster .     said vimes .      why  certainly     said jenkins nastily .     where would you like us to put the extra mast .         the ship   s just a dot     said carrot .     why aren   t we gaining on them .         it   s a bigger ship so it has got what we technically call more sails     said jenkins .     and they   re fast hulls on those klatchian boats .  and we   ve got a full hold        he stopped  but it was too late .      captain carrot .     said vimes .      sir .         throw everything overboard     said vimes .      not the crossbows .  they cost more than a hundred dollars ea        jenkins stopped .  vimes   s expression said  very clearly  that there were a whole lot of things that could be thrown off the boat  and it would be a good idea not to be among them .      go and pull some ropes  mr .  jenkins     he said .   he watched the captain stamp off .  a few moments later there was a splash .  vimes looked over the side and saw a crate bob for a moment and then sink .  and he felt happy .  thief taker  rust had called him .  the man had meant it as an insult  but it   d do .  theft was the only crime  whether the loot was gold  innocence  land or life .  and for the thief taker  there was the chase   there were several more splashes .  vimes fancied the ship surged forward .      the chase .  because the chase was simpler than the capture .  once you   d caught someone it got complicated  but the chase was pure and free .  much better than prodding at clues and peering at notebooks .  he flees  i chase .  simple .   vetinari   s terrier  eh .      bingeley bingeley beep .     said his pocket .      don   t tell me     said vimes .     it   s something like    five pee em  at sea     yes .         er   no     said the dis organizer .     says here    violent row with lord rust     insert name here .         aren   t you supposed to tell me what i   m going to do .     said vimes  opening the box .      er   what you should be doing     said the demon  looking very worried .     what you should be doing .  i don   t understand it   er   something seems to be wrong           angua stopped trying to rub the collar off against a bulkhead .  it wasn   t working  and the silver pressing against her skin seemed to freeze her and burn her at the same time .   apart from that   and a silver collar on a werewolf was a fairly major that   she   d been treated well .  they   d left a plate of food  a wooden plate  and she   d let her wolf side eat it while the human side shut its eyes and held its nose .  there was a bowl of water  quite fresh by ankh morpork standards .  she could see the bottom of the bowl  at least .   it was so hard to think in wolf shape .  it was like trying to unlock a door while drunk .  it was possible  but you had to concentrate every step of the way .   there was a sound .   her ears pricked up .   something tapped once or twice under the hull .  she hoped it was a reef .  that meant   land  possibly   with any luck she could swim ashore     something clinked .  she   d forgotten about the chain .  it was hardly necessary .  she felt as weak as a kitten .   there was a rhythmic noise  like something chewing at the wood .   a tiny metal point splintered through the wall just in front of her nose  and rose an inch .   and someone spoke .  it sounded far off and distorted  and perhaps only a werewolf would have heard it  but words were happening  somewhere under her paws .         can stop pedaling now  corporal nobbs .         i am knackered  sarge .  is there anything to eat .         there   s some more of that garlic sausage .  or there   s the cheese .  or cold beans .         we   re in a tin with no air and we   re supposed to eat cheese .  i ain   t even going to comment on the beans .         i   m very sorry  gentlemen .  things were rather rushed and i had to take food which would keep .         it   s just that it   s getting a bit   crowded  if you get my meaning .         i will pay out the rope as soon as it   s dark and we can surface and take on air .         just so long as we get rid of the air we   ve got  that   s all i   m saying        angua   s brows wrinkled as she tried to make sense of this .  the voices were familiar .  even muffled as they were  she recognized the tones .  the vague feeling that fought its way through the mists of animal intellect was  friends .   the tiny little unchangeable center of her thought  good grief  next thing i   ll be licking hands .   she laid her head down near the point again .         way to do it  young man .  there you go again .  sink ships .  i can   t imagine how anyone could think of such a thing .      names .  some of those voices had   names .   thinking was getting harder .  that was the silver at work .  but if she stopped  she might forget how to start again .   she stared at the point of metal .  the point of metal with sharp edges .   the tiny part of her mind raged at the wolf brain  trying to get it to understand what it needed to do .      it was after midnight .   the lookout man knelt on the deck in front of    hour ahmed and trembled .      i know what i saw  wali     he moaned .     and the others saw it  too .  something rose up behind the ship and began chasing us .  a monster .      ahmed looked at the captain  who shrugged .     who knows what lies on the floor of the sea  wali .         its breath .     moaned the seaman .     there was a great roar of breath like the stink of a thousand privies .  and then it spoke .         really .     said ahmed .     this is not usual .  what did it say .         i did not understand .     the man   s face screwed up as he tried to assemble the unfamiliar syllables .     it sounded like       he swallowed  and went on        ye gods  that was better out than in  sarge .         ahmed stared at him .     and what did that mean to you .     he said .      i do not know  wali .         you have not spent much time in ankh morpork .         no  wali .         then return to your post .      the man stumbled out .      we have lost speed  wali     said the captain .      perhaps the sea monster is clutching at our keel .         it pleases you to joke  lord .  but who knows what has been disturbed by the rising of the new land .         i shall have to see for myself     said    hour ahmed .   he walked alone to the stern of the ship .  dark waters sucked and splashed and left a phosphorescent glow edging the wake .   he watched for a long time .  people bad at watching didn   t last long in the desert  where a shadow in the moonlight could be just a shadow or it could be someone anxious to help you on your way to paradise .  the d   regs came across many shadows of the latter persuasion .   d   reg wasn   t their name for themselves  although they tended to adopt it now out of pride .  the word meant enemy .  everyone   s .  and if anyone else wasn   t around  then one another   s .   if he concentrated  he might believe that there was a darker shape about a hundred yards behind the ship  very low in the water .  waves were breaking where waves shouldn   t be .  it looked as though the ship was being followed by a reef .   well  well        hour ahmed was not superstitious .  he was substitious  which put him in a minority among humans .  he didn   t believe in the things everyone believed in but which nevertheless weren   t true .  he believed instead in the things that were true in which no one else believed .  there are many such substitions  ranging from    it   ll get better if you don   t pick at it    all the way up to    sometimes things just happen .      currently he was disinclined to believe in sea monsters  especially ones that spoke in the language of ankh morpork  but he did believe that there were a lot of things in the world that he didn   t know about .   in the far distance he could see the lights of a ship .  it didn   t seem to be gaining on them .   this was much more worrying .   in the darkness    hour ahmed reached over his shoulder and grasped the handle of his sword .   above him  the mainsail creaked in the wind .      sergeant colon knew he was facing one of the most dangerous moments in his career .   there was nothing for it .  he was out of options .      er   if i add this a and this o and this i and this d     he said  the sweat pouring down his pink cheeks     then i can use that v to make    avoid .     er   and that gets me  er  a   what d   you call these blue squares  len .         a    three times ye value of thee letter    score     said leonard of quirm .      well done  sergeant     said lord vetinari .     i do believe that puts you in the lead .         er   i do believe it does  sir     squeaked sergeant colon .      however  i find that you have left me the use of my u  n and a  b  l  e     the patrician went on     which incidentally lands me on this three times the whole worde square and  i rather suspect  wins me the game .      sergeant colon sagged with relief .      a capital game  leonard     said vetinari .     what did you say it was called .         i call it the    make words with letters that have all been mixed up game     my lord .         ah .  yes .  obviously .  well done .         huh  an    i got three points     mumbled nobby .     they was perfectly good words that you wouldn   t let me have  too .         i   m sure the gentlemen don   t want to know those words     said colon severely .      i   d have got ten points for that x .      leonard looked up .     strange .  we seem to have stopped moving        he reached up and opened the hatch .  damp night air poured in  and there was the sound of voices  quite close  echoing loudly as voices do when heard across water .      heathen klatchian talk     said colon .     what are they gabblin    about .            what nephew of a camel cut the rigging .        said lord vetinari  without looking up .        not just the ropes  look at this sail   here  give me a hand              i didn   t know you spoke klatchian  my lord .         not a word     said lord vetinari .      but you           i did not     said vetinari calmly .      ah   right           where are we  leonard .         well  er  my star charts are all out of date  of course  but if you would care to wait until the sun rises  and i   ve invented a device for ascertaining position by reference to the sun  and devised a satisfactorily accurate watch           where are we now  leonard .         er   in the middle of the circle sea  i suspect .         the middle .         pretty close  i should say .  look  if i can measure the wind speed           then leshp should be in this vicinity .         oh  yes  i should           good .  unhitch us from this apparently stricken ship while we still have the cover of darkness and in the morning i wish to see this troublesome land .  in the meantime  i suggest that everyone gets some sleep .      sergeant colon did not get a lot of sleep .  this was partly because he was woken up several times by sawing and banging coming from the front of the boat  and partly because water kept dripping on his head  but mainly because the lull in activity was causing him to consider his position .   sometimes when he woke up he saw the patrician hunched over leonard   s drawings  a gaunt silhouette in the light of the candle   reading  making notes     he was in the immediate company of a man even the assassins    guild was frightened of  another man who would stay up all night in order to invent an alarm clock to wake him up in the morning  and a man who had never knowingly changed his underwear .   and he was at sea .   he tried to look on the bright side .  what was the main reason why he hated boats .  the fact that they sank  right .  but this one had the sinking built in right from the start .  and you didn   t have to watch the waves going up and down  because they were already above you .   all this was logical .  it just wasn   t very comforting .   when he awoke at one point there were faint voices coming from the other end of the vessel .         don   t quite understand  my lord .  why them .         they do what they   re told  they tend to believe the last thing they heard  they   re not bright enough to ask questions  and they have that certain unshakeable loyalty available to those unencumbered by too much intelligence .         i suppose so  my lord .         such men are valuable  believe me .      sergeant colon turned over and tried to make himself comfortable .  glad i   m not like those poor bastards  he thought as he drifted off to sleep on the bosom of the deep .  i   m a man with special qualities .      vimes shook his head .  the stern light of the klatchian ship was barely visible in the gloom .      are we gaining on them .     he said .   captain jenkins nodded .     we might be .  there   s a lot of sea between us .         and has all excess weight been thrown overboard .         yes .  what do you want me to do  shave my beard off .      carrot   s face appeared over the edge of the hold .     all the lads are bedded down  sir .         right .         i   ll turn in for a few hours too  sir  if it   s all right with you .         sorry  captain .         i   ll get my head down  sir .         but   but       vimes waved vaguely at the darkening horizon     we   re in hot pursuit of your girlfriend .  among other things     he added .      yes  sir .         so aren   t you   you mean you can   you want to   captain  you intend to go and have a bit of a nap .         to be fresh for when we catch up with them .  yes  sir .  if i spend the whole night staring out there worrying then i   ll probably be a bit useless when we catch up with them  sir .      it made sense .  it really did make sense .  of course it made sense .  vimes could see the sense all over it .  carrot had actually sat down and thought sensibly about things .      you   ll be able to get to sleep  will you .     he said weakly .      oh  yes .  i owe it to angua .         oh .  well   good night  then .      carrot disappeared into the hold again .      good heavens     said jenkins .     is he real .         yes     said vimes .      i mean   would you go and bang your ear if we was chasing your lady in that ship .      vimes said nothing .   jenkins sniggered .     mind you  if it was lady sybil  she   d be a bit lower on the waterline           you just watch the   the sea .  don   t run into any damn whales or anything     said vimes  and strode up to the sharp end .   carrot  he thought .  if you didn   t know him  you wouldn   t believe it        they   re slowing  mr .  vimes .     jenkins called out .      what .         i reckon they   re slowing down  i said .         good .         so what   re you going to do when we catch them .         er       vimes hadn   t given this a lot of thought .  but he recalled a very bad woodcut he   d once seen in a book about pirates .      we   ll swing across on to them with our cutlasses in our teeth .     he said .      really .     said jenkins .     that   s good .  i haven   t seen that done in years .  only ever seen it done once  in fact .         oh  yes .         yes  this lad   d seen the idea in a book and he swung across into the other ship   s rigging with his cutlass clenched  as you say  between his teeth .         yes .         topless harry  we wrote on his coffin .         oh .         i don   t know if you   ve ever seen a soft boiled egg after you   ve picked up your knife and sli           all right  i see the point .  what do you suggest .         grapnels .  you can   t beat grapnels .  catch    em on the other ship and just pull    em toward you .         and you   ve got grapnels .         oh  yes .  saw some only today  in fact .         good .  then           as i recall     jenkins went on relentlessly     it was when your sergeant detritus was chucking stuff over the side and he said     what shall we do with dese bendy  hooky things  sir .     and someone  can   t recall his name just at this minute  said     they   re dead weight  throw them over .            why didn   t you say something .         oh  well  i didn   t like to     said jenkins .     you were doing so well .         don   t mess me about  captain .  otherwise i   ll clap you in irons .         no  you ain   t going to do that  and i   ll tell you why .  first     cos when captain carrot said     these chains  sir  what shall i do with them .     you said           now  you listen to              and  second  i don   t reckon you know anything about ships  oh deary me .  we don   t clap people in irons  we put them in chains .  do you know how to splice the mainbrace .     cos i don   t .  all that yohoho stuff   s for landlubbers  or it would be if we ever used words like landlubber .  do you know the difference between port and starboard .  i don   t .  i   ve never even drunk starboard .  shiver my timber .         isn   t it    shiver my timbers    .         i   ve been ill .     captain jenkins spun the wheel .     also  this is a frisky wind and me and my crew know how to pull the strings that make the big square canvas things work properly .  if your men tried it you   d soon find out how far it is to land .         how far is it to land .         about thirty fathoms  hereabouts .      the light was noticeably nearer .      bingeley bingeley beep .         good grief  what now .     said vimes .      eight pee em .  er   narrowly escape assassination by klatchian spy .      vimes went cold .     where .     he said  looking around wildly .      corner of brewer street and broadway     said the little sing song voice .      but i   m not there .         what   s the point of having appointments  then .  what   s the point of my making an effort .  you told me you wanted to know what you ought to           listen  you don   t have an appointment for being assassinated .      the demon went silent for a moment  and then said      you mean it should be on your to do list .     its voice was trembling .      you mean like     to do  die    .         look  it   s no good taking it out on me just because you   re not on the right time line .         what the hell does that mean .         aha  i knew you didn   t read the manual .  chapter xvii   c  makes it very clear that sticking to one reality is vitally important  otherwise the uncertainty principle says           forget i asked  all right .      vimes glared at jenkins and at the distant ship .      we   ll do this my way  wherever the hell we are     he said .  he strode to the hold and pulled aside a hatchway .     detritus .         the klatchian sailors struggled with the canvas while their captain screamed at them .      hour ahmed didn   t scream .  he just stood with his sword in his hand  watching .   the captain hurried over to him  trembling with fear and holding a length of rope .      see  wali .     he said .     someone cut it .         who would do that .     said    hour ahmed quietly .      i do not know  but when i find him           the dogs are almost on us     said ahmed .     you and your men will work faster .         who could have done such a thing .     said the captain .     you were here  how could they    .      his gaze flickered from the cut rope to the sword .      was there something you wished to say .     said ahmed .   the captain hadn   t got where he was by being stupid .  he spun round .      get that sail up right now  you festering sons of bitches .     he screamed .      good     said    hour ahmed .      detritus   s crossbow was originally a three man siege weapon  but he had removed the windlass as an unnecessary encumbrance .  he cocked it by hand .  usually the mere sight of the troll pulling the string back with one finger was enough to make the strong willed surrender .   he looked doubtfully at the distant light .      it a million to one chance     he said .     got to be closer   n this .         just hit it below the waterline so they can   t cut the rope     said vimes .      right .  right .         what   s the problem  sergeant .         we headin    for klatch  right .         well  in that direction  yes .         only   i   m gonna be really stoopid in klatch     cos a der heat  right .         i hope we   re going to stop them before we get there  detritus .         i ain   t keen on bein    stoopid .  i know people say  that troll detritus  he ficker than a  than a              brick sandwich       said vimes  staring at the light .      right .  only i hearin    it get really  really hot in der desert        the troll looked so mournful that vimes felt moved to give him a cheerful slap on the back .      then let   s stop them now  eh .     he said  shaking his hand hurriedly to stop the stinging .   the other ship was so close they could see the sailors working feverishly on the deck .  the mainsail billowed in the lamplight .   detritus raised the bow .   a ball of blue green light glowed on the tip of the arrow .  the troll stared at it .   then green fire ran down the masts and  when it hit the deck  burst into dozens of green balls that rolled  cracking and spitting  over the planks .      dey   re usin    magic .     said detritus .  a green flame spluttered over his helmet .      what is this  jenkins .     said vimes .      it ain   t magic  it   s worse   n magic     said the captain  hurrying forward .     all right  lads  get those sails down right now .         you leave them where they are .     shouted vimes .      you know what this is .         it dun   t even feel warm     said detritus  poking the flame on the crossbow .      don   t touch it .  don   t touch it .  that   s st .  ungulant   s fire  that is .  it means we   re going to die in a dreadful storm .      vimes looked up .  clouds were racing across   no  they were pouring into the sky in great twisting billows  like ink streaming into water .  blue light flashed somewhere inside them .  the ship lurched .      look  we got to lose some sail .     shouted jenkins .     that   s the only way           no one touches anything .     shouted vimes .  green fire skimmed along the tops of the waves now .     detritus  arrest any man who touches anything .         right .         we want to go fast  after all     vimes said  above the hissing and the distant crackle of thunder .   jenkins gawped at him as the ship lunged beneath them .      you   re mad .  have you any idea what happens to a ship that tries to   you haven   t got any idea  have you .  this ain   t normal weather .  you have to ride it out careful .  you can   t try to run ahead of it .      something slippery landed on detritus   s head and bounced on to the deck  where it tried to slither away .      and now it   s raining fish .     jenkins moaned .   the clouds formed a yellow haze  lit almost constantly by the lightning .  and it was warm .  that was the strangest thing .  the wind howled like a sack full of cats and the waves were turning into walls on either side of the ship  but the air felt like an oven .      look  even the klatchians are reducing sail .     shouted jenkins  in a shower of shrimp .      good .  we   ll catch them up .         mad .  ouch .      something hard rebounded from his hat  hit the rail and rolled to a stop by vimes   s feet .   it was a brass knob .      oh  no     moaned jenkins  putting his arms over his head .     now it   s bloody bedsteads again .         the captain of the klatchian ship was not an argumentative man when he was anywhere near    hour ahmed .  he just looked at the straining sails and calculated his chances of paradise .      perhaps the dog who cut the sail loose did us a favor .     he shouted  above the roar of the wind .   ahmed said nothing .  he kept looking back .  the occasional burst of electric storm light showed the ship behind  aflame with green light .       then he looked at the cold fire streaming behind their own masts .      can you see that light on the edge of the flames .     he said .      my lord .         can you  man .         er   no           of course you can   t .  but can you see where the light isn   t .      the captain stared at him and then looked up again in terrified obedience .  and there was somewhere where the light wasn   t .  as the fizzing green tongues waved in the wind they seemed to be edged with   blackness  perhaps  or a moving hole in space .      that   s octarine .     shouted ahmed  as another wave sloshed over the deck .     only wizards can see it .  there   s magic in these storms .  that   s why the weather is so bad .         the ship screamed in every joint as it hit the waves again .      we   re coming right out of the water .     wept jenkins .     we   re just going from crest to crest .         good .  it won   t be so bumpy .     shouted vimes .     we should pick up speed again now we   ve got those bedsteads over the side .  does it often rain bedsteads out here .         what do you think .         i   m not a nautical man .         no  rains of bedsteads are not an everyday occurrence .  nor are coal scuttles .     jenkins added  as something black crashed off a rail and over the side .     we just get the normal stuff  you know .  rain .  snow .  sleet .  fish .      another squall blew across the bounding boat and the deck was suddenly covered with flashing silver .      back to fish .     shouted vimes .     that   s better  surely .         no .  it   s worse .         why .      jenkins held up a tin .      these are sardines .      the ship thumped into another wave  groaned  and took flight again .   the cold green fire was everywhere .  every nail of the deck sprouted its flame  every rope and ladder had its green outline .   and the feeling crept over vimes that it was holding the ship together .  he wasn   t at all sure that it was just light .  it moved too purposefully .  it crackled  but it didn   t sting .  it looked as though it was having fun     the ship landed .  water washed over vimes .      captain jenkins .         yes .         why   re we playing with this wheel .  it   s not as if the rudder   s in the water .      they let go .  the spokes blurred for a moment  and then stopped as the fire wrapped itself around them .   then it rained cake .      the watch had tried to make themselves comfortable in the hold  but there were difficulties .  there wasn   t any area of floor which at some point in every ten seconds wasn   t an area of wall .   nevertheless  someone was snoring .      how can anyone sleep in this .     said reg shoe .      captain carrot can     said cheery .  she was hacking at something with her ax .   carrot had wedged himself into a corner .  occasionally he mumbled something  and shifted position .      like a baby .  beats me how he   s managing it     said reg shoe .     of course  any minute this thing is going to fall apart .         yes  but dat shouldn   t worry you  should it .     said detritus .     on account of you bein    dead already .         so .  i end up at the bottom of the sea knee deep in whale droppings .  and it   ll be a long walk home in the dark .  not to mention the problems if a shark tries to eat me .         i shall fear not .  according to the testament of mezerek  the fisherman nonpo spent four days in the belly of a giant fish     said constable visit .   the thunder seemed particularly loud in the silence .      washpot  are we talking miracles here .     said reg eventually .     or just a very slow digestive process .         you would be better employed considering the state of your immortal soul than making jokes     said constable visit severely .      it   s the state of my immortal body that   s worrying me     said reg .      i have a leaflet here which will bring you considerable       visit began .      washpot  is it big enough to be folded into a boat that   ll save us all .      constable visit pounced on the opening .     aha  yes  metaphorically it is           hasn   t this ship got a lifeboat .     said cheery hurriedly .     i   m sure i saw one when we came on .         yeah   lifeboat     said detritus .      anyone want a sardine .     said cheery .     i   ve managed to get a tin open .         lifeboat     detritus repeated .  he sounded like someone exploring an unpleasant truth .     like   a big  heavy thing which would   ve slowed us down    .         yes  i saw it  i know i did     said reg .      yeah   dere was one     said detritus .     dat was a lifeboat  was it .         at the very least we ought to get somewhere sheltered and drop the anchor .         yeah   anchor       mused detritus .     dat   s a big thing kinda hooks on  right .         of course .         kinda heavy thing .         obviously .         right .  an      er   if it was dropped a long time ago  on accounta bein    heavy  dat wouldn   t do us much good now .         hardly .     reg shoe glared through the hatchway .  the sky was a dirty yellow blanket  criss crossed with fire .  thunder boomed continuously .      i wonder how far the barometer   s sunk .     he said .      all der way     said detritus gloomily .     trust me on dis .         it was in the nature of a d   reg to open doors carefully .  there was generally an enemy on the other side .  sooner or later .   he saw the collar lying on the floor  right by a little fountain of water trickling from the hull  and swore under his breath .   ahmed waited just a moment  and then pushed the door back quickly .  it rattled against the wall .      i don   t intend to harm you     he said to the gloom of the bilges .     if that was my intention  by now you   d        she wished she   d used the wolf .  there would have been no problem with the wolf .  that was the problem .  she   d easily win  but then she   d be nervy and frightened .  a human could stay on top of that .  a wolf might not .  she   d do the wrong things  panicky things  animal things .   she pushed him hard as she dropped down from above the door  somersaulted backward  slammed the door and turned the key .   the sword came through the planking like a hot knife through runny lard .   there was a gasp beside her .  she spun round and saw two men holding a net .  they would have thrown it over the wolf .  what they hadn   t been expecting was a naked woman .  the sudden appearance of a naked woman always causes a rethink of anyone   s immediate plans .   she kicked them both hard and ran in the opposite direction  opened the first door at random and slammed it behind her .   it was the cabin with the dogs in it .  they sprang to their feet  opened their mouths   and slunk down again .  a werewolf can have considerable power over other animals  whatever shape she   s in  although it is largely the power to make them cringe and try to look inedible .   she hurried past them and pulled at one of the hangings over the bunk .   the man in the bunk opened his eyes .  he was a klatchian  but pale with weakness and pain .  there were dark rings under his eyes .      ah     he said     it would appear that i have died and gone to paradise .  are you a houri .         i don   t have to take that kind of language  thank you     said angua  ripping the silk in two with a practiced hand .   she was aware that she had a slight advantage over male werewolves in that naked women caused fewer complaints  although the downside was that they got some pressing invitations .  some kind of covering was essential  for modesty and the prevention of inconvenient bouncing  which was why fashioning impromptu clothes out of anything to hand was a lesser known werewolf skill .   angua stopped .  of course  to the unpracticed eye all klatchians looked alike  but then to a werewolf all humans looked alike  they looked appetizing .  she   d learned to discern .      are you prince khufurah .         i am .  and you are    .      the door was kicked open .  angua leapt toward the window and flung aside the bar restraining the shutters .  water funneled into the cabin  drenching her  but she managed to scramble up and out .      just passing through .     the prince murmured .      hour ahmed strode to the window and looked out .  green blue waves edged with fire fought outside as the ship heaved .  no one could stay afloat in a sea like that .   he turned and looked along the hull to where angua was clinging to a trailing line .   she saw him wink at her .  then he turned away and she heard him say     she must have drowned .  back to your posts .      presently  up on the deck  a hatch closed .      the sun rose in a cloudless sky .   a watcher  if such had been out here  would have noticed a slight difference in the way the swells were moving on this tiny patch of sea .   they might even have wondered about the piece of bent piping which turned with a faint squeaking noise .   had they been able to place an ear to it  they would have heard the following         idea while i was dozing off .  piece of pipe  two angled mirrors   the solution to all our steering and air problems .         fascinating .  a seeing things pipe you can breathe down .         my goodness  how did you know it was called that  my lord .         a lucky guess .            ere  someone   s re designed my pedaling seat  it   s comfortable           ah  yes  corporal  i took some measurements while you were asleep and rebuilt it for a better anatomical configu           you took measurements .         oh  yes  i           what  of my   saddlery regions .         oh  please don   t be concerned  anatomy is something of a passion with me           is it .  is it .  well  you can stop being passionate about mine for a start           here  i can see an island of some sort .      the pipe squeaked around .      ah  leshp .  and i see people .  to your pedals  gentlemen .  let us explore the ocean   s bottom           i expect we shall  with him steering           shut up  nobby .      the pipe slid down into the waves .  there was a little flurry of bubbles and a damp argument about whose job it should have been to put the cork in  and then the patch of sea that had been empty was  somehow  a little bit emptier still .      there weren   t any fish .   at a time like this solid jackson would have even been prepared to eat curious squid .   but the sea was empty .  and it smelled wrong .  it fizzed gently .  solid could see little bubbles breaking on the surface  which burst with a smell of sulfur and rotting eggs .  he guessed that the rise of the land must have stirred up a lot of mud .  it was bad enough at the bottom of a pond  all those frogs and bugs and things  and this was the sea     he tried hard to reverse that train of thought  but it kept on rising from the depths like a   like a     why were there no fish .  oh  there   d been the storm last night  but generally you got better fishing in these parts after a storm because it   stirred   up     the raft rocked .   he was beginning to think it might be a good idea to go home  but that   d mean leaving the land to the klatchians  and that   d happen over his dead body .   the treacherous internal voice said  funnily enough  they never found mr .  hong   s body .  not most of the important bits  anyway .      i think  think  i think we   ll be getting back now     he said to his son .      oh  dad     said les .     another dinner of limpets and seaweed .         nothing wrong with seaweed     said jackson .     it   s full of nourishing   seaweed .     s got iron in it .  good for you  iron .         why don   t we boil an anchor  then .         none of your lip  son .         the klatchians have got bread     said les .     they brought flour with them .  and they   ve got firewood .     this was a sore point with jackson .  efforts to make seaweed combust had not been successful .      yeah  but you wouldn   t like their bread     said jackson .     it   s all flat and got no proper crust        a breeze blew the scent of baking over the water .  it carried a hint of spices .      they   re baking bread .  on our property .         well  they say it   s their        jackson grabbed the piece of broken plank he used as an oar and began to scull furiously toward the shore .  the fact that this only made the raft go round in circles added to his fury .      they bloody move in right next to us and all we get is the stink of foreign food           why   s your mouth watering  dad .         and how come they   ve got wood  may i ask .         i think the current takes the driftwood to their side of the island  dad           see .  they   re stealing our driftwood .  our damn driftwood .  hah .  well  we   ll           but i thought we agreed that the bit over there was theirs  and        jackson had finally remembered how to propel a raft with one oar .      that wasn   t an agreement     he said  creating foam as the oar thrashed back and forth     that was just an   an arrangement .  it   s not as if they created the driftwood .  it just turned up .  accident of geography .  it is a natural resource  right .  it don   t belong to anyone        the raft hit something which made a metallic sound .  but they were still a hundred yards from the rocks .   something else  long and bent at the end  rose up with a creaking noise .  it twisted around until it pointed at jackson .      excuse me     it said  in a tinny yet polite voice     but this is leshp  isn   t it .      jackson made a sound in his throat .      only     the thing went on     the water   s a little cloudy and i thought we might have been going the wrong way for the last twenty minutes .         leshp .     squeaked jackson  in an unnaturally high pitched voice .      ah  good .  thank you so much .  good day to you .      the appendage sank slowly into the sea again .  the last sounds from it  erupting on the surface in a cloud of bubbles  were        don   t forget to put the cork in   you   ve forgot to put the cor        the bubbles stopped .   after a while les said     dad  what was    .         it wasn   t anything .     snapped his father .     that sort of thing doesn   t happen .      the raft shot forward .  you could have waterski   d behind it .      another important thing about the boat  thought sergeant colon gloomily as they slipped back into a blue twilight  was that you couldn   t bale out the bilges .  it was the bilges .   he was pedaling with his feet in water and he was suffering simultaneously from claustrophobia and agoraphobia .  he was afraid of everything in here and everything out there at the same time .  plus  there were unpleasantnesses out there  moving past as the boat drifted down the wall of rock .  feelers waved .  there were claws .  things scuttled into the waving weeds .  giant clams watched sergeant colon with their lips .   the boat creaked .      sarge     said nobby  as they looked out at the wonders of the deep .      yes  nobby .         you know they say every tiny part of your body is replaced every seven years .         a well known fact     said sergeant colon .      right .  so   i   ve got a tattoo on my arm  right .  had it done eight years ago .  so   how come it   s still there .      giant seaweeds winnowed the gloom .      interesting point     quavered colon .     er           i mean  okay  new tiny bits of skin float in  but that means it ought to be all new and pink by now .      a fish with a nose like a saw swam past .   in the middle of all his other fears  sergeant colon tried to think fast .      what happens     he said     is that all the blue skin bits are replaced by other blue skin bits .  off   f other people   s tattoos .         so   i   ve got other people   s tattoos now .         er   yes .         amazing .     cos it still looks like mine .     s got the crossed daggers and    wum .            wum .         it was gonna be    mum    but i passed out and needle ned didn   t notice i was upside down .         i should   ve thought he   d notice that           he was pissed  too .  c   mon  sarge  you know it   s not a proper tattoo unless no one can remember how it got there .      leonard and the patrician were staring out at the submarine landscape .      what   re they looking for .     said colon .      leonard keeps talking about hieroglyphs     said nobby .     what   re they  sarge .      colon hesitated  but not for long .     a type of mollusc  corporal .         cor  you know everything  sarge     said nobby admiringly .     that   s what hieroglyphs are  is it .  so  if we go any deeper  they   ll be loweroglyphs .      there was something slightly off putting about nobby   s grin .  sergeant colon decided to go for broke .      don   t be daft  nobby .     loweroglyphs if you go lower       oh  deary me .         sorry  sarge .         everyone knows you don   t get loweroglyphs in these waters .      a couple of curious squid peered at them  curiously .      jenkins   s ship was a floating wreck .   several sails were in tatters .  rigging and other string that vimes refused to learn the nautical names for covered the deck and trailed in the water .   such sail as remained was moving them along in the brisk breeze .   atop the mast the lookout cupped his hands around his mouth and leaned down .      land ahoy .         even i can see that     said vimes .     why does he have to shout .         it   s lucky     said jenkins .  he squinted into the haze .     but your friend ain   t heading for gebra .  wonder where he   s going .      vimes stared at the pale yellow mass on the horizon  and then up at carrot .      we   ll get her back  don   t worry     he said .      i wasn   t actually worrying  sir .  although i am very concerned     said carrot .      er   right       vimes waved his arms helplessly .     er   everyone fit and well .  the men in good heart  are they .         it would help morale no end if you were to say a few words  sir .      the monstrous regiment of watchmen had lined up on the deck  blinking in the sunshine .  oh  dear .  round up the unusual suspects .  one dwarf  one human who was brought up as a dwarf and thinks like a manual of etiquette  one zombie  one troll  me and  oh  no  one religious fanatic     constable visit saluted .     permission to speak  sir .         go ahead     mumbled vimes .      i   m pleased to tell you  sir  that our mission is clearly divinely approved of  sir .  i refer to the rain of sardines which sustained us in our extremity  sir .         we were a little hungry  i wouldn   t say we were in extremi           with respect  sir     said constable visit firmly     the pattern is firmly established  sir .  yes  indeed .  the sykoolites when being pursued in the wilderness by the forces of offlerian mitolites  sir  were sustained by a rain of celestial biscuits  sir .  chocolate ones  sir .         perfectly normal phenomenon     muttered constable shoe .     probably swept up by the wind passing a baker   s shop        visit glared at him  and went on     and the murmurians  when driven into the mountains by the tribes of miskmik  would not have survived but for a magical rain of elephants  sir           elephants .         well  one elephant  sir     visit conceded .     but it splashed .         perfectly normal phenomenon     said constable shoe .     probably an elephant was picked up by a freak           and when they were thirsty in the desert  sir  the four tribes of khanli were succored by a sudden and supernatural rain of rain  sir .         a rain of rain .     said vimes  almost mesmerized by visit   s absolute conviction .      perfectly normal phenomenon     sneered reg shoe .     probably water was evaporated from the ocean  was blown through the sky  condensed around nuclei when it ran into cold air  and precipitated       he stopped  and continued irritably     anyway  i don   t believe it .         so   which particular deity is on our case .     said vimes  hopefully .      i shall definitely inform you as soon as i have ascertained this  sir .         er   very good  constable .      vimes took a step back .     i don   t pretend this is going to be easy  men     he said .     but our mission is to catch up with angua and this bastard ahmed and shake the truth out of him .  unfortunately  this means we will be following him through his own country  with which we are at war .  this is bound to put a few barriers in our way .  but we should not let the prospect of being tortured to death dismay us  eh .         fortune favors the brave  sir     said carrot cheerfully .      good .  good .  pleased to hear it  captain .  what is her position vis    vis heavily armed  well prepared and excessively manned armies .         oh  no one   s ever heard of fortune favoring them  sir .         according to general tacticus  it   s because they favor themselves     said vimes .  he opened the battered book .  bits of paper and string indicated his many bookmarks .     in fact  men  the general has this to say about ensuring against defeat when outnumbered  out weaponed and out positioned .  it is       he turned the page        don   t have a battle .            sounds like a clever man     said jenkins .  he pointed to the yellow horizon .      see all that stuff in the air .     he said .     what do you think that is .         mist .     said vimes .      hah  yes .  klatchian mist .  it   s a sandstorm .  the sand blows about all the time .  vicious stuff .  if you want to sharpen your sword  just hold it up in the air .         oh .         and it   s just as well because otherwise you   d see mount gebra .  and below it is what they call the fist of gebra .  it   s a town but there   s a bloody great fort  walls thirty feet thick .     s like a big city all by itself .     s got room inside for thousands of armed men  war elephants  battle camels  everything .  and if you saw that  you   d want me to turn    round right now .  what   s your famous general got to say about it  eh .         i think i saw something       said vimes .  he flicked to another page .     ah  yes  he says     after the first battle of sto lat  i formulated a policy which has stood me in good stead in other battles .  it is this  if the enemy has an impregnable stronghold  see he stays there .            that   s a lot of help     said jenkins .   vimes slipped the book into a pocket .      so  constable visit  there   s a god on our side  is there .         certainly  sir .         but probably also a god on their side as well .         very likely  sir .  there   s a god on every side .         let   s hope they balance out  then .         the klatchian ship   s boat hit the water with the gentlest of splashes .  this was because    hour ahmed was standing by the winches with his sword at the ready  which had the effect of making the men lowering the boat take some trouble over their task .      when we are away you may take the ship into gebra     he said to the captain .   the captain trembled .     what shall i tell them  wali .         tell them the truth   eventually .  the commander of the garrison is a man of no breeding and will torture you a little bit .  save up the truth until you need it .  that will make him happy .  it will help you to say that i forced you .         oh  i will .  i will   tell that lie     the captain added quickly .   ahmed nodded  slid down the rope into the boat and set it adrift .   the crew watched him row through the surf .   this wasn   t a nice beach .  it was a wrecking coast .  ribcages of broken ships crumbled into the sand .  bones and driftwood and bleached white seaweed mounded along the high tide line .  and beyond  the dunes of the real desert rose .  even down here sand stung the eyes and gritted the teeth .      there   s sudden death on that beach     said the first mate  looking over the rail and trying to blink his eyes clear .      yes     said the captain .     he   s just got out of the boat .      the figure on the beach pulled the other  recumbent figure out of the boat and dragged him out of reach of the waves .  the mate raised his bow .      i could kill him from here  master .  just say the word .         how sure are you .  because you   d better be really sure .  first  if you miss him you   re dead and  second  if you hit him  you   re still dead .  look up there .      on the high distant dunes  dark against the sand filled sky  there were mounted figures .  the mate dropped his bow .      how did they know we were here .         oh  they watch the sea     said the captain .     d   regs like a good shipwreck as much as anyone else .  more  in fact .  a lot more .      as they turned away from the rail  something leapt from the hull and entered the water with barely a splash .      detritus tried to lurk in the shade  but there was not a lot of it about .  the heat came off the high desert ahead of them like a blowtorch .      i   m gonna get fick     he muttered .   there was a shout from the lookout .      he says someone   s climbing the dunes     said carrot .     carrying someone else  he says .         er   female .         look  sir  i know angua .  she   s not the useless type .  she doesn   t stand there and scream helplessly .  she makes other people do that .         well   if you   re sure       vimes turned to jenkins .     don   t bother to chase the ship  captain .  just keep heading for the shore .         i don   t work like that  mister .  for one thing  that   s a damn difficult shore  the wind   s always against you  and there   s some very nasty currents .  many an incautious sailorman has left his bones to bleach on those sands .  no  we   ll stand out a little way and you can lower the   well  if we had a boat any more  you could lower it   and we   ll drop the anchor  oh  no  tell a lie  it turned out to be too heavy  didn   t it           you just keep straight on     said vimes .      we   ll all be killed .         think of it as the lesser of two evils .         what   s the other one .      vimes drew his sword .      me .         the boat squeaked through the mysterious depths of the ocean .  leonard spent a lot of time looking out of the tiny windows  particularly interested in pieces of seaweed which  to sergeant colon  looked like pieces of seaweed .      do you note the fine strands of dropley   s etoliated bladderwrack .     said leonard .     that   s the brown stuff .  a marvelous growth which  of course  you will see as significant .         could we just assume for the moment that i have neglected my seaweed studies in recent years .     said the patrician .      really .  oh  the loss is entirely yours  i assure you .  the point is  of course  that the etoliated bladderwrack is never usually found growing above thirty fathoms  and it   s only ten here .         ah .     the patrician flicked through a stack of leonard   s drawings .     and the hieroglyphs   an alphabet of signs and colors .  colors as a language   what a fascinating idea           an emotional intensifier     said leonard .     but of course we ourselves use something like it .  red for danger and so on .  i never did succeed in translating it  though .         colors as a language       murmured lord vetinari .   sergeant colon cleared his throat .     i know something about seaweed  sir .         yes  sergeant .         yessir .  if it   s wet  sir  it means it   s going to rain .         well done  sergeant     said lord vetinari  without turning his head .     i think it is quite possible that i will never forget you said that .      sergeant colon beamed .  he had made a contribution .   nobby nudged him .     what   re we doing down here  sarge .  i mean  what   s it all about .  poking around  looking at weird marks on the rocks  going in and out of caves   and the smell   well           it   s not me     said sergeant colon .      smells like   sulfur        little bubbles streamed past the window .      it stunk up on the surface  too     nobby went on .      nearly finished  gentlemen     said lord vetinari  putting the papers aside .     one last little venture and then we can surface .  very well  leonard   take us underneath .         er   aren   t we underneath already  sir .     said colon .      only underneath the sea  sergeant .         ah .  right .     colon gave this due consideration .     is there anything else to be under  then  sir .         yes  sergeant .  now we   re going under the land .         the beach was a lot closer now .  the watchmen couldn   t help noticing that the sailors were all hurrying to the blunt end of the ship and hanging on to any small  lightweight and above all buoyant objects they could find .      this seems close enough     said vimes .     right .  stop here .         stop here .  how .         don   t ask me  i   m no sailor .  aren   t there some sort of brakes .      jenkins stared at him .     you   you landlubber .         i thought you never used the word .         i never met one like you before .  you even think we call the bows the sharp en        it was  the crew agreed later  one of the strangest landings in the history of bad seamanship .  the shelving of the beach must have been right and the tide as well  because the ship did not so much hit the beach as sail up it  rising out of the water as the keel debarnacled itself on the sand .  finally the forces of wind  water  impetus and friction all met at the point marked    fall over slowly .      it did so  earning the title of    world   s most laughable shipwreck .         well  that might have been worse     said vimes  when the splintering noises had died away .   he eased himself out of a tangle of canvas and adjusted his helmet with as much aplomb as he could muster .   he heard a groan from the lopsided hold .      is dat you  cheery .         yes  detritus .         is dis me .         no .         sorry .      carrot eased his way down the sloping deck and jumped on to the damp sand .  he saluted .      all present and lightly bruised  sir .  shall we establish a beachhead .         a what .         we have to dig in  sir .      vimes looked both ways along the beach  if such a sunny sounding word could be applied to the forsaken strand .  it was really just a hem to the land .  nothing stirred except the heat haze and  in the distance  one or two carrion birds .      what for .     he said .      establish a defensible position .  it   s just one of those things soldiers do  sir .      vimes glanced at the birds .  they were approaching with a kind of sidling sideways hop  ready to move in just as soon as anyone had been dead for a few days .  then he flicked through tacticus until the word    beachhead    caught his eye .      it says here    if you want your men to spend much time wielding a shovel  encourage them to become farmers        he said .     so i think we   ll press on .  he can   t have got very far .  we   ll be back soon .      jenkins waded out of the surf .  he didn   t look angry .  he was a man who had passed through the fires of anger and was now in some strange peaceful bay beyond them .  he pointed a quivering finger at his stricken ship and said    muh    .         pretty good shape  all things considered     said vimes .      muh .         i   m sure you and your salty sailors will be able to float it again .         muh        jenkins and his wading crew watched the regiment as it slithered and complained its way up the side of the dune .  eventually the crew went into a huddle and drew lots and the cook  who was always unlucky in games of chance  approached the captain .      never mind  captain     he said     we can probably find some decent balks of timber in all this driftwood  and a few days    work with block and tackle should           muh .         only   we   d better get started    cos he said they won   t be long           they won   t be back .     said the captain .     the water they   ve got won   t last a day up there .  they haven   t got the right gear .  and once they   re out of sight of the sea they   ll get lost .         good .         it took half an hour to get to the top of the dune .  the sand had been stamped down but  even as vimes watched  the wind caught the particles and nibbled away at the prints .      camel tracks     said vimes .     well  camels don   t go all that fast .  let   s           i think detritus is having real trouble  sir     said carrot .   the troll was standing with his knuckles on the ground .  the motor of his cooling helmet sounded harsh for a moment in the dry air  and then stopped as the sand got into the mechanism .      feelin    fick     he muttered .     my brain hurts .         quick  hold your shield over his head     said vimes .     give him some shade .         he   s never going to make it  sir     said carrot .     let   s send him back down to the boat .         we need him .  quick  cheery  fan him with your ax .      at which point  the sand stood up and drew a hundred swords .      bingeley bingeley beep .     said a cheerful if somewhat muffled voice .     eleven eh em  get haircut   er   that   s right   isn   t it .         it wasn   t large  but slabs of collapsing building had smashed together in such a way that they made a cistern that the rain had filled half full .   solid jackson slapped his son on the back .      fresh water .  at last .     he said .     well done  lad .         you see  i was looking at these sort of painting things  dad  and then           yeah  yeah  pictures of octopuses  very nice     said jackson .     hah .  the ball is on the other foot now and no mistake .  it   s our water on our side of the island  and i   d just like to see them greasy buggers claim otherwise .  let    em keep their damn driftwood and suck water out of fishes .         yeah  dad     said les .     and we can trade them some of the water for wood and flour  right .      his father waved a hand cautiously .     maybe     he said .     no need to rush into that  though .  we   re pretty close to finding a seaweed that   ll burn .  i mean  what   re our long term objectives here .         cooking meals and keeping warm .     said les hopefully .      well  initially     said jackson .     that   s obvious .  but you know what they say  lad .     give a man a fire and he   s warm for a day  but set fire to him and he   s warm for the rest of his life .     see my point .         i don   t think that   s actually what the saying is           i mean  we can stop here living on water and raw fish for   well  practically forever .  but that lot can   t go without proper fresh water for much longer .  see .  so they   ll have to come begging to us  right .  and then we deal on our terms  eh .      he put his arm around his son   s reluctant shoulders and waved a hand at the landscape .      i mean  i started out with nothing  son  except that old boat that your grandad left me  but              you worked and scraped       said les wearily .         i worked and scraped              and you   ve always kept your head above water              right  i   ve always kept my head above water           and you   ve always wanted to leave me something that   ow .         stop making fun of your dad .     said jackson .     otherwise i   ll wallop the other ear .  look  you see this land .  you see it .         i see it  dad .         it   s a land of opportunity .         but there   s no fresh water and all the ground   s full of salt  dad  and it smells bad .         that   s the smell of freedom  that is .         smells like someone did a really big fart  dad   ow .         sometimes the two are very similar .  and it   s your future i   m thinking of  lad .      les looked at the acres of decomposing seaweed in front of him .   he was learning to be a fisherman like his father before him because that   s how the family had always done it and he was too good natured to argue  although he actually wanted to be a painter like no one in the family had ever been before .  he was noticing things  and they worried him even though he couldn   t quite say why .   but the buildings didn   t look right .  here and there were definite bits of  well  architecture  like morporkian pillars and the remains of klatchian arches  but they   d been added to buildings that looked as though some ham fisted people had just piled rocks on top of one another .  and then in other places the slabs had been stacked on top of ancient brick walls and tiled floors .  he couldn   t imagine who   d done the tiling  but they did like pictures of octopussies .   the feeling was stealing over him that morporkians and klatchians arguing over who owned this piece of old sea bottom was extremely pointless .      er   i   m thinking about my future too  dad     he said .     i really am .         far below solid jackson   s feet  the boat surfaced .  sergeant colon reached automatically for the screws that held the lid shut .      don   t open it  sergeant .     shouted leonard  rising from his seat .      the air   s getting pretty lived in  sir           it   s worse outside .         worse than in here .         i   m almost certain .         but we   re on the surface .         a surface  sergeant     said lord vetinari .  beside him  nobby uncorked the seeing device and peered through it .      we   re in a cave .     said colon .      er   sarge       said nobby .      capital .  well worked out     said lord vetinari .     yes .  a cave .  you could say that .         er   sarge .     said nobby again  nudging colon .     this isn   t a cave  sarge .  it   s bigger than a cave  sarge .         what  you mean   like a cavern .         bigger .         bigger   n a cavern .  more like a   big cavern .         yeah  that   d be about right     said nobby  taking his eye away from the device .     have a look yourself  sarge .      sergeant colon peered into the tube .   instead of the darkness he was half expecting  he saw the sea   s surface  bubbling like a boiling saucepan .  green and yellow flashes of lightning danced across the water  illuminating a distant wall that seemed practically a horizon     the tube squeaked around .  if this was a cave  it was at least a couple of miles across .      how long  do you think .     said lord vetinari  behind him .      well  the rock has a large proportion of tufa and pumice  very light  and once floated up the build up of gas starts to escape very rapidly because of the swell     said leonard .     i don   t know   perhaps another week   and then i think it takes a very long time for a sufficient bubble to build up again           what   re they saying  sarge .     said nobby .     this place floats .         a most unusual natural phenomenon     leonard went on .     i   d have thought it was just a legend had i not seen it for myself           of course it   s not floating     said sergeant colon .     honestly  nobby  how   re you ever going to find out anything when you ask daft questions like that .  land   s heavier than water  right .  that   s why you find it at the bottom of the sea .         yes  but he said pumice  and my gran had a pumice stone that worked a treat for getting tough skin off   f your feet in the tub and that   d float           that sort of thing happens in bath tubs maybe     said colon .     not in real life .  this is just a phenomena .  it   s not real .  next thing you   ll be saying there   s rocks up in the sky .         yeah  but           i am a sergeant  nobby .         yes  sarge .         it puts me in mind     said leonard     of those nautical stories about giant turtles that sleep on the surface  thus causing sailors to think they are an island .  of course  you don   t get giant turtles that small .         hey  mr .  quirm  this is an amazing boat     said nobby .      thank you .         i bet you could even smash up ships with it if you wanted .      there was an embarrassed silence .      altogether an interesting experience     said lord vetinari  making some notes .     and now  gentlemen   downward and onward  please           the watchmen drew their weapons .      they   re d   regs  sir     said carrot .     but   this is all wrong           what do you mean .         we   re not dead yet .      they   re watching us like cats watch mice  thought vimes .  we can   t run away and we can   t win a fight  and they want to see what we   ll do next .      what does general tacticus have to say about this  sir .     said carrot .   there   s a hundred of them  thought vimes .  and six of us .  except that detritus is drifting off and there   s no knowing what particular commandment visit is obeying right now and reg   s arms tend to drop off when he gets excited        i don   t know     he said .     probably something on the lines of don   t allow this to happen .         why don   t you check  sir .     said carrot  not taking his eyes off the watching d   regs .      what .         i said  why don   t you check  sir .         right now .         it might be worth a try  sir .         that   s crazy  captain .         yes  sir .  the d   regs have some very strange notions about crazy people  sir .      vimes pulled out the battered book .  the d   reg nearest to him  with a grin almost as wide and as curved as his sword  had a certain additional swagger that suggested chieftainship .  a huge ancient crossbow was slung on his back .      i say .     said vimes .     could we just delay things a little .     he strode toward the man  who looked very surprised  and waved the book in the air .     this is a book by general tacticus  don   t know if you   ve ever heard of him  quite a big name in these parts once  probably slaughtered your great great great great grandfather in fact  and i just want to take a moment to see what he has to say about this situation .  you don   t mind  do you .      the man gave vimes a puzzled look .      this may take a moment  there   s no index  but i think i saw something        the chieftain took a step backward and looked at the men next to him  who shrugged .      i wonder if you could help me with this word here .     vimes went on  reaching the man   s side and holding the book under his nose .  he got another puzzled grin .   what vimes did next was known in ankh morpork   s alleyways as the friendly handshake  and consisted largely of driving his elbow into the man   s stomach  then bringing his knee up to meet the man   s chin on its way down  gritting his own teeth because of the pain in both knee and ankle  and then drawing his sword and holding it to the d   reg   s throat before he could scramble up .      now  captain     said vimes     i   d like you to say in a loud clear voice that unless they back off a really long way  this gentleman here is going to be in some very serious legal trouble .         mr .  vimes  i don   t think           do it .      the d   reg looked into his eyes while carrot hawked his way through the demand .  the man was still grinning .   vimes couldn   t risk shifting his gaze  but he sensed some puzzlement and confusion among the tribesmen .   then  as one man  they charged .      a klatchian fishing boat  whose captain knew which way the wind was blowing  made its way back to the harbor of al khali .  it seemed to the captain that  despite the favorable wind  he wasn   t making quite the speed he should .  he put it down to barnacles .      vimes awoke with a noseful of camel .  there are far worse awakenings  but not as many as you might think .   by turning his head  which took some effort  he ascertained that the camel was sitting down .  by the sound of things  it was digesting something explosive .   now  how had he got here   oh  gods     but it should have worked   it was classic .  you threatened to cut off the head and the body just folded up .  that was how everyone reacted  wasn   t it .  that was practically how civilization worked     put it down to cultural differences  then .   on the other hand  he wasn   t dead .  according to carrot  knowing the d   regs for five minutes and still being alive at the end of it meant that they really  really liked you .   on the other other hand  he   d just given their head man a handshake  which influenced people without making friends .   well  no sense lying over this saddle bound hand and foot and dying of sunstroke all day .  he ought to start being a leader of men again  and would do so just as soon as he could get this camel out of his mouth .      bingeley bingeley beep .         yes .     said vimes  struggling with his bonds .      would you like to know about the appointments you missed .         no .  i   m trying to get these damn ropes untied .         do you want me to put that on your to do list .         oh  you   ve woken up  sir .      it sounded like carrot   s voice and it was the sort of thing he   d say .  vimes tried to turn his head .   what he saw was mainly a white sheet  but it then became carrot   s face  upside down .      they asked if they should untie you but i said you hadn   t been getting enough rest lately     carrot went on .      captain  my arms and legs have gone to sleep       vimes began .      oh  well done  sir .  that   s a start  at least .         carrot .         yes  sir .         i want you to listen very carefully to the order i am about to give you .         certainly  sir .         the point i   m making is that it won   t be a request or a suggestion or some sort of hint .         understood  sir .         i have  as you know  always encouraged my officers to think for themselves and not blindly obey me  but sometimes in any organization it is necessary for instructions to be followed to the letter and with alacrity .         right  sir .         untie me right now or you   ll bloody well live to regret untying me .         er  sir  i believe there is an inadvertent inconsistency in           carrot .         of course  sir .      his ropes were cut .  he slid down on to the sand .  the camel turned its head  looked at him with its nostrils for a moment  and then looked away .   vimes managed to sit upright while carrot busied himself cutting the rest of his bonds .      captain  why are you wearing a white sheet .         it   s a burnous  sir .  very practical for desert wear .  the d   regs gave them to us .         us .         the rest of us  sir .         everyone   s okay .         oh  yes .         but they attacked           yes  sir .  but they only wanted to take us prisoner  sir .  one of them did accidentally cut reg   s head off  but he did help him sew it on again  so no real harm done there .         i thought d   regs didn   t take prisoners    .         beats me too  sir .  but they say if we try to escape they   ll cut our feet off  and reg says he hasn   t got enough thread for everyone  sir .      vimes rubbed his head .  someone had hit him so hard his helmet was dented .      what went wrong .     he said .     i had their boss down .         as i understand it  sir  the d   regs think that any leader who is stupid enough to be defeated so easily isn   t worth following .  it   s a klatchian thing .      vimes tried to persuade himself that there wasn   t a hint of sarcasm in carrot   s voice as he went on     they   re not really very interested in leaders  sir  to tell you the truth .  they look on them as a sort of ornament .  you know   just someone to shout    charge .     sir .         a leader has to do other things  carrot .         the d   regs think    charge .     pretty well covers all of them  sir .      vimes managed to stand up .  strange muscles twanged in his legs .  he tottered forward .      here  let me give you a hand       said carrot  catching him .   the sun was setting .  ragged tents clustered below one of the dunes  and there was the glow of firelight .  someone was laughing .  it didn   t sound like a prison .  but then  thought vimes  the desert was probably better than bars .  he wouldn   t even know which way to run  feet or no feet .      the d   regs  like all klatchians  are a very hospitable people     said carrot  as if he   d memorized this .     they take hospitality very  very seriously .      their captors were sitting round the fire .  so were the watchmen .  they   d also been persuaded to dress more suitably  which meant that cheery looked like a girl in her mum   s dress  apart from the iron helmet  and reg shoe looked like a mummy  and detritus was a small snow covered mountain .      he   s gone very   insensible in all this heat     whispered carrot .     and that   s constable visit over there  arguing religion .  there are six hundred and fifty three religions on the klatchian continent .         he must be having fun .         and this is jabbar     said carrot .  exhibit a  who looked like a slightly older version of    hour ahmed  stood up and salaamed to vimes .      offendi     he said .      he   s their   well  he   s like an official wise man     said carrot .      oh  so he   s not the one who tells them to charge .     said vimes .  his head buzzed with the heat .      no  that   s the leader     said carrot .     whenever they have one .         so perhaps jabbar tells them when it   s wise to charge .     said vimes brightly .      it   s always wise to charge  offendi     said jabbar .  he bowed again .     my tent is your tent     he said .      it is .     said vimes .      my wives are your wives        vimes looked panicky .     they are .  really .         my food is your food       jabbar went on .   vimes stared down at the dish by the fire .  it looked like a sheep or a goat had been the main course .  and the man bent down  picked up a morsel and handed it to him .   sam vimes looked at the mouthful .  and it looked back .      the best part     said jabbar  and made appreciative sucking noises .  he added something in klatchian .  there was some muffled laughter from the other men around the fire .      this looks like a sheep   s eyeball     said vimes  doubtfully .      yes  sir     said carrot .     but it is unwise to           you know what .     vimes went on .     i think this is a little game called    let   s see what offendi will swallow .     and i   m not swallowing this  my friend .      jabbar gave him an appraising look .   the sniggering stopped .      then it is true that you can see further than most     he said .      so can this food     said vimes .     my father told me never to eat anything that can wink back .      there was one of those little hanging by a thread moments  which might suddenly rock one way or the other into a gale of laughter or sudden death .   then jabbar slapped vimes on the back .  the eyeball shot off his palm and into the shadows .      well done .  extremely good .  first time it have not worked in twenty year .  now sit down and have proper rice and sheep just like mother .      there was a certain feeling of relaxation .  vimes found himself pulled down .  bottoms shuffled aside to make room for him and a big slab of bread dripping with meat was put in front of him .  vimes prodded at it as politely as he dared  and then took the usual view that  if you can recognize at least half of it  it   s probably okay to eat the rest .      so we   re your prisoners  mr .  jabbar .         honored guests .  my tent is           but   how can i put this .    you want us to enjoy your hospitality for some time .         we have tradition     said jabbar .     a man who is a guest in your tent  even if he is your worst enemy  you owe him hospitality for tree dace .         tree dace  eh .     said vimes .      i learn language on       jabbar waved a hand vaguely     you know  wooden ting  a camel of the sea           boat .         right .  but too many water .     he slapped vimes on the back again  so that hot fat spilled into his lap .     any road up  lots speaking morporkian these dace  offendi .  it is language of   merchant .     he put an inflection on the word that suggested it was the same as    earthworm .         so you have to know how to say things like    give us all your money    .     said vimes .      why ask .     said jabbar .     we take it anyway .  but now       he spat at the fire with amazing accuracy       they say  we got to stop  this is wrong .  what harm do we do .         apart from killing people and taking all their merchandise .     said vimes .   jabbar laughed again .     wali said you were a big diplomatic .  but we don   t kill merchants  why should we kill merchants .  what is the sense .  how foolish to be killing gift horse that lays the golden egg .         you could make money exhibiting it  certainly     said vimes .      we kill merchants  we rob too much  they never come back .  dumb .  we let them go  they get rich again  our sons rob them .  such is wisdom .         ah   it   s a sort of agriculture     said vimes .      right .  but if you plant merchants  they don   t grow so good .      vimes realized that it was getting colder as the sun went down .  in fact  a lot colder .  he inched closer to the fire .      why is he called    hour ahmed .     he said .   the murmur of conversation stopped .  suddenly all eyes were on jabbar  except the one that had ended up in the shadows .      not so diplomatic     said jabbar .      we chase him up here  then suddenly we   re ambushed by you .  that seems           i know nothing     said jabbar .      why won   t you    .     vimes began .      er  sir     said carrot urgently .     that would be very unwise  sir .  look  i had a bit of a talk with jabbar while you were   resting .  it   s a bit political  i   m afraid .         what isn   t .         prince cadram is trying to unite the whole of klatch  you see .         dragging it kicking and screaming into the century of the fruitbat .         why  yes  sir  how did    .         just a lucky guess .  go on .         but he has been having trouble     said carrot .      what kind .     said vimes .      us     said jabbar proudly .      none of the tribes like the idea  sir     carrot went on .     they   ve always fought among themselves  and now most of them are fighting him .  historically  sir  klatch isn   t so much an empire as an argument .         he say  you must be educated .  you must be learning to pay taxes .  we do not wish to be educated about taxes     said jabbar .      so you think you   re fighting for your freedom .     said vimes .   jabbar hesitated  and looked at carrot .  there was a brief exchange in klatchian .  then carrot said     that   s a rather difficult question for a d   reg  sir .  you see  their word for    freedom    is the same as their word for    fighting .            they certainly make their language do a lot of work  don   t they    .      vimes was feeling better in the colder air .  he took out a crushed and damp packet of cigars  pulled a coal out of the fire  and took a deep drag .      so   prince charming   s got a lot of troubles at home  has he .  does vetinari know this .         does a camel shit in the desert  sir .         you   re really getting the hang of klatch  aren   t you .     said vimes .   jabbar rumbled something .  there was more laughter .      er   jabbar says a camel certainly does shit in the desert  sir  otherwise you wouldn   t have anything to light your cigar with  sir .      once again  there was one of those moments when vimes felt that he was under close scrutiny .  be diplomatic  vetinari had told him .   he took another deep draw .     improves the flavor     he said .     remind me to take some home .      in jabbar   s eyes  the judges held up at least a couple of grudging eights .      a man on a horse came and said we must fight the foreign dogs           that   s us  sir     said carrot helpfully .         because you have stolen an island that is under the sea .  but what is that to us .  we know no harm of you foreign devils  but the men who oil their beards in al khali we do not like .  so we send him back .         all of him .     said vimes .      we are not barbaric .  he was clearly a madman .  but we kept his horse .         and    hour ahmed told you to keep us  didn   t he .     said vimes .      no one orders the d   regs .  it is our pleasure to keep you here .         and when will it be your pleasure to let us go .  when ahmed tells you .      jabbar stared at the fire .     i will not speak of him .  he is devious and cunning and not to be trusted .         but you are d   regs  too .         yes .     jabbar slapped vimes on the back again .     we know what we are talking about .         the klatchian fishing boat was a mile or two out of harbor when it seemed to its captain that it was suddenly riding better in the water .  perhaps the barnacles have dropped off  he thought .   when his boat was lost in the evening mists a length of bent pipe rose slowly out of the swell and squeaked around until it faced the coast .   a distant tinny voice said     oh  no        and another tinny voice said     what   s up  sarge .         take a look through this .         okay .     there was a pause .   then the second tinny voice said     oh  bugger        what was riding at anchor before the city of al khali wasn   t a fleet .  it was a fleet of fleets .  the masts looked like a floating forest .   down below  lord vetinari took his turn to peer through the pipe .      so many ships     he said .     in such a short time  too .  how very well organized .  very well organized .  one might almost say   astonishingly well organized .  as they say     if you would seek war  prepare for war .            i believe  my lord  the saying is    if you would seek peace  prepare for war        leonard ventured .   vetinari put his head on one side and his lips moved as he repeated the phrase to himself .  finally he said     no  no .  i just don   t see that one at all .      he ducked back into his seat .      let us proceed with care     he said .     we can go ashore under cover of darkness .         er   can we maybe go ashore under cover of cover .     said sergeant colon .      in fact these extra ships will make our plan that much easier     said the patrician  ignoring him .      our plan .     said colon .      people within the klatchian hegemony come in every shape and color .     vetinari glanced at nobby .     practically every shape and color     he added .     so our appearance on the streets should not cause undue comment .     he glanced at nobby again .     to any great extent .         but we   re wearing our uniforms  sir     said sergeant colon .     it   s not like we can say we   re on our way to a fancy dress party .         well  i   m not taking mine off     said nobby firmly .     i   m not running around in my drawers .  not in a port .  sailors are at sea a long time .  you hear stories .         that   d be worse     said the sergeant  without wasting time calculating how long any sailor would need to be at sea before the vision of nobby nobbs would present itself as anything other than a target        cos if we   re not in uniform  we   ll be spies   and you know what happens to spies .         are you going to tell me  sarge .         excuse me  your lordship .     sergeant colon raised his voice .  the patrician looked up from a conversation with leonard .      yes  sergeant .         what do they do to spies in klatch  sir .         er   let me see       said leonard .     oh  yes   i believe they give you to the women .      nobby brightened up .     oh  well  that doesn   t sound too bad           er  no  nobby       colon began .            cos i   ve seen the pictures in that book the perfumed allotment that corporal angua was reading  and              no  listen  nobby  you   ve got the wrong              i mean  blimey  i didn   t know you could do that with a              nobby  listen              and then there   s this bit where she           corporal nobbs .     colon yelled .      yes  sarge .      colon leaned forward and whispered in nobby   s ear .  the corporal   s expression changed  slowly .      they really           yes  nobby .         they really           yes  nobby .         they don   t do that at home .         we ain   t at home  nobby .  i wish we was .         although you hear stories about the agony aunts  sarge .         gentlemen     said lord vetinari .     i am afraid leonard is being rather fanciful .  that may apply to some of the mountain tribes  but klatch is an ancient civilization and that sort of thing is not done officially .  i should imagine they   d give you a cigarette .         a cigarette .     said fred .      yes  sergeant .  and a nice sunny wall to stand in front of .      sergeant colon examined this for any downside .     a nice roll up and a wall to lean against .     he said .      i think they prefer you to stand up straight  sergeant .         fair enough .  no need to be sloppy just because you   re a prisoner .  oh  well .  i don   t mind risking it  then .         well done     said the patrician calmly .     tell me  sergeant   in your long military career  did anyone ever consider promoting you to an officer .         nossir .         i cannot think why .         night poured over the desert .  it came suddenly  in purple .  in the clear air  the stars drilled down out of the sky  reminding any thoughtful watcher that it is in the deserts and high places that religions are generated .  when men see nothing but bottomless infinity over their heads they have always had a driving and desperate urge to find someone to put in the way .   life emerged from the burrows and fissures .  soon  the desert was filled with the buzz and click and screech of creatures which  lacking mankind   s superior brainpower  did not concern themselves with finding someone to blame and instead tried to find someone to eat .   at around three in the morning sam vimes walked out of the tent for a smoke .  the cold air hit him like a door .  it was freezing .  that wasn   t what was supposed to happen in deserts  was it .  deserts were all hot sand and camels and   and   he struggled for a while  as a man whose geographical knowledge got severely cramped once you got off paved road   camels  yes  and dates .  and possibly bananas and coconuts .  but the temperature here made your breath tinkle in the air .   he waved his cigar packet theatrically at a d   reg who was lounging near the tent .  the man shrugged .   the fire was just a heap of gray  but vimes poked around in the vain hope of finding a glowing ember .   he was amazed at how angry he was .  ahmed was the key  he knew it .  and now they were stuck out here in the desert  the man had gone  and they were in the hands of   quiet  likeable people  fair enough .  brigands  maybe  the dry land equivalent of pirates  but carrot would have said they were jolly good chaps for all that .  if you were content to be their guest then they were as nice as pie  or sheep   s eyeball and treacle or whatever you got out here     something moved in the moonlight .  a shadow slipped down the side of a dune .   something howled  out in the desert night .   tiny hairs rose  all down vimes   s back  just like they had for his distant ancestors .   the night is always old .  he   d walked too often down dark streets in the secret hours and felt the night stretching away  and known in his blood that while days and kings and empires come and go  the night is always the same age  always aeons deep .  terrors unfolded in the velvet shadows and while the nature of the talons may change  the nature of the beast does not .   he stood up quietly  and reached for his sword .   it wasn   t there .   they   d taken it away .  they   d not even        a fine night     said a voice beside him .   jabbar was standing by his shoulder .      who is out there .     vimes hissed .      an enemy .         which one .      teeth gleamed in the shadows .      we will find out  offendi .         why would they attack you now .         maybe they think we have something they want  offendi .      more shadows slid across the desert .   and one rose up right behind jabbar  reached down and picked him up .  a huge gray hand dragged his sword out of his belt .      what do you want me to do with him  mr .  vimes .         detritus .      the troll saluted with the hand that still held the d   reg .      all present and correct  sir .         but       and then vimes realized .     it   s freezing cold .  your brain   s working again .         with rather more efficiency  sir .         is this a djinn .     said jabbar .      i don   t know  but i could certainly do with one     said vimes .  he finally managed to locate some matches in his pocket  and lit one .     put him down  sergeant     he said  puffing his cigar into life .     jabbar  this is sergeant detritus .  he could break every bone in your body  including some of the small ones in the fingers which are quite hard to do        the darkness went shwup and something whispered past the back of his neck  just a slice of a second before jabbar cannoned into him and bore him to the ground .      they shoot at the light .         mwwf .      vimes raised his head cautiously and spat out sand and fragments of tobacco .      mr .  vimes .      only carrot could whisper like that .  he associated whispering with concealment and untruth and compromised by whispering very loudly .  to vimes   s horror the man came round the edge of a tent holding a tiny lamp .      put that damn        but he didn   t have time to finish the sentence because  somewhere out in the night  a man screamed .  it was a high pitched scream and was suddenly cut off .      ah     said carrot  crouching down by vimes and blowing out the lamp .     that was angua .         that was nothing like   oh .  yeah  i think i see what you mean     vimes said  uneasily .     she   s out there  is she .         i heard her earlier .  she   s probably enjoying herself .  she doesn   t really get much of a chance to let herself go in ankh morpork .         er   no       vimes had a mental picture of a werewolf letting go .  but surely  angua wouldn   t        you two  uh   you   re getting along okay  are you .     he said  trying to make out shapes in the darkness .      oh  fine  sir .  fine .      so her turning into a wolf occasionally doesn   t worry you .  vimes couldn   t bring himself to say it .      no   problems  then .         oh  not really  sir .  she buys her own dog biscuits and she   s got her own flap in the door .  when it   s full moon i don   t really get involved .      there were shouts in the night and then a shape erupted from the darkness  streaked past vimes  and disappeared into a tent .  it didn   t wait for a door .  it simply hit the cloth at full speed and continued until the tent collapsed around it .      and what is that .     said jabbar .      this may take some explaining     said vimes  picking himself up .   carrot and detritus were already hauling at the collapsed tent .      we are d   regs     said jabbar reproachfully .     we are supposed to fold tents silently in the night  not        there was enough moonlight .  angua sat up and snatched a piece of tent out of carrot   s hands .      thank you     she said  wrapping it around her .     and before anyone says anything  i just bit him on the bum .  hard .  and that was not the soft option  let me tell you .      jabbar looked back into the desert  and then down at the sand  and then at angua .  vimes could see him thinking  and put a fraternal arm around his shoulders .      i   d better explain       he began .      there   s a couple of hundred soldiers out there .     angua snapped .         later .         they   re taking up positions all round you .  and they don   t look nice .  has anyone got any clothes that might fit .  and some decent food .  and a drink .  there   s no water in this place .         they will not dare attack before dawn     said jabbar .      and what will you do  sir .     said carrot .      at dawn we will charge .         ah .  uh .  i wonder if i could suggest an alternative approach .         alternative .  it is right to charge .  charging is what dawn is for .      carrot saluted vimes .     i   ve been reading your book  sir .  while you were   asleep .  tacticus   s got quite a lot to say about how to deal with overwhelming odds  sir .         yes .         he says take every opportunity to turn them into underwhelming odds  sir .  we could attack now .         but it   s dark  man .         it   s just as dark for the enemy  sir .         i mean it   s pitch black .  you wouldn   t know who the hell you were fighting .  half the time you   d be shooting your own side .         we wouldn   t  sir  because there   d only be a few of us .  sir .  all we need to do is crawl out there  make a bit of noise  and then let them get on with it .  tacticus says all armies are the same size in the night  sir .         there might be something in that     said angua .     they   re crawling around in ones and twos  and they   re dressed pretty much like       she waved a hand at jabbar .      this is jabbar     said carrot .     he   s sort of not the leader .      jabbar grinned nervously .     it happens often in your country  where dogs turn into naked women .         sometimes days can go past and it doesn   t happen at all     angua snapped .     i   d like some clothes  please .  and a sword  if there   s going to be fighting .         um  i think klatchians have a very particular view about women fighting       carrot began .      yes .     said jabbar .     we expect them to be good at it  blue eyes .  we are d   regs .         the boat surfaced in the scummy dead water under a jetty .  the lid opened slowly .      smells like home     said nobby .      you can   t trust the water     said sergeant colon .      but i don   t trust the water at home  sarge .      fred colon managed to get a foothold on the greasy wood .  it was  in theory  quite a heroic enterprise .  he and nobby nobbs  the bold warriors  were venturing forth in hostile territory .  unfortunately  he knew they were doing it because lord vetinari was sitting in the boat and would raise his eyebrows in no uncertain manner if they refused .   colon had always thought that heroes had some special kind of clockwork that made them go out and die famously for god  country and apple pie  or whatever particular delicacy their mother made .  it had never occurred to him that they might do it because they   d get yelled at if they didn   t .   he reached down .      come on up  nobby     he said .     and remember we   re doing this for the gods  ankh morpork and       it seemed to colon that a foodstuff would indeed be somehow appropriate .     and my mum   s famous knuckle sandwich .         our mum never made us knuckle sandwiches     said nobby  as he hauled himself on to the planks .     but you   d be amazed at what she could do with a bit of cheese           yeah  all right  but that ain   t much of a battle cry  is it .     for the gods  ankh morpork and amazing things nobby   s mum can do with cheese    .  that   ll strike fear in the hearts of the enemy .     said sergeant colon  as they crept forward .      oh  well  if that   s what you   re after  you want my mum   s distressed pudding and custard     said nobby .      frightening  is it .         they wouldn   t want to know about it  sarge .      the docks of al khali were like docks everywhere  because all docks everywhere are connected .  men have to put things on and off boats .  there are only a limited number of ways to do this .  so all docks look the same .  some are hotter  some are damper  there are always piles of vaguely forgotten looking things .   in the distance there was the glow of the city  which seemed quite unaware of the enemy incursion .         get us some clothes so that we   ll blend in        muttered colon .     that   s all very well to say .         nah  nah  that   s easy     said nobby .     everyone knows how to do that one .  you lurk in an alley somewhere  right  and you wait until a couple of blokes come by and you lure them into the alley  see  and there   s a couple of thumps  and then you come out wearing their clothes .         that works  does it .         never fails  sarge     said nobby confidently .      the desert looked like snow in the moonlight .   vimes found himself quite at ease with the tacticus method of fighting .  it was how coppers had always fought .  a proper copper didn   t line up with a lot of other coppers and rush at people .  a copper lurked in the shadows  walked quietly and bided his time .  in all honesty  of course  the time he bided until was the point when the criminal had already committed the crime and was carrying the loot .  otherwise  what was the point .  you had to be realistic .     we got the man what done it    carries a lot more gravitas than    we got the man what looked as if he was going to do it     especially when people say     prove it .          somewhere off to the left  in the distance  someone screamed .   vimes was a bit uneasy in this robe  though .  it was like going into battle in a nightshirt .   because he wasn   t at all certain he could kill a man who wasn   t actively trying to kill him .  of course  technically any armed klatchian these days was actively trying to kill him .  that was what war was about .  but     he raised his head over the top of the dune .  a klatchian warrior was looking the other way .  vimes crept        bingeley bingeley beep .  this is your seven eh em alarm call  insert name here .  at least i hope           huh .         damn .      vimes reacted first and punched the man on the nose .  since there was no point in waiting to see what effect this would have  he threw himself forward and the two of them rolled down the other side of the freezing dune  struggling and punching .         but my real time function seems erratic at the moment        the klatchian was smaller than vimes .  he was younger  too .  but it was unfortunate for him that he appeared to be too young to have learned the repertoire of dirty fighting that spelled survival in ankh morpork   s back streets .  vimes  on the other hand  was prepared to hit anything with anything .  the point was that the opponent shouldn   t get up again .  everything else was decoration .   they slid to a halt at the bottom of the dune  with vimes on top and the klatchian groaning .      things to do     the dis organizer shrilled     ache .      and then   it was probably throat cutting time .  back home vimes could have dragged him off to the cells  in the knowledge that everything would look better in the morning  but the desert had no such options .   no  he couldn   t do that .  thump the bloke senseless .  that was the merciful way .      vindaloo .  vindaloo .      vimes   s fist stayed raised .      what .         that   s you  isn   t it .  mr .  vimes .  vindaloo .      vimes pulled a fold of cloth away from the figure   s face .      are you goriff   s boy .         i didn   t want to be here  mr .  vimes .     the words came fast  desperate .      all right  all right  i   m not going to hurt you        vimes lowered his fist and stood up  pulling the boy up after him .      talk later     he muttered .     come on .         no .  everyone knows what the d   regs do to their captives .         well i   m their captive and they   ll have to do it to both of us  okay .  keep away from the more amusing food and you   ll probably be okay .      someone whistled in the darkness .      come on  lad .     hissed vimes .     no harm   s going to come to you .  well   less than   d come if you stayed here .  all right .      this time he didn   t give the boy time to argue  but dragged him along .  as he headed toward the d   regs    camp  other figures slid down the dunes .   one of them had an arm missing and had a sword sticking in him .      how did you get on  reg .     said vimes .      a bit odd  sir .  after the first one chopped my arm off and stabbed me  the rest of them seemed to keep out of my way .  honestly  you   d think they   d never seen a man stabbed before .         did you find your arm .      reg waved something in the air .      that   s another thing     he said .     i hit a few of them with it and they ran off screaming .         it   s your type of unarmed combat     said vimes .     it probably takes some getting used to .         is that a prisoner you   ve got there .         in a way .     vimes glanced around .     he seems to have fainted .  i can   t think why .      reg leaned closer .     these foreigners are a bit weird     he said .      reg .         yes .         your ear   s hanging off .         is it .  wretched thing .  you   d think a nail would work  wouldn   t you .         sergeant colon looked up at the stars .  they looked down at him .  at least fred colon had a choice .   beside him  corporal nobbs gave a groan .  but the attackers had left him his pants .  there are some places where the boldest dare not go  and those areas of nobby upward of the knees and downward of the stomach were among them .   well  colon thought of them as attackers .  technically  he supposed they were defenders .  aggressive defenders .      just run all that past me again  will you .     he said .      we find a couple of blokes about our height and weight           we did that .         we lure them into this alley           we did that .         i take a swing at them with a length of wood and hit you by accident in the dark and they get angry and turn out to be thieves and nick all our clothes .         we weren   t supposed to do that .         well it worked basically     said nobby  managing to get to his knees .     we could give it another go .         nobby  you   re in a port in a foreign city clad only in your  and i use this word with feeling  nobby  your unmentionables .  this is not the point to start talking about luring people into alleys .  there could be talk .         angua always says that nakedness is the national costume everywhere  sarge .         she was talking about herself  nobby     said colon  sidling along in the shadows .     it   s different for you .      he peered around the other end of the alley .  there was noise and chatter from the building that formed one of the walls .  a couple of laden donkeys waited patiently outside .      nip out and grab one of those packs  right .         why me  sarge .            cos you   re the corporal and i   m the sergeant .  and you   ve got more on than me .      grumbling under his breath  nobby edged into the narrow street and unfastened a tether as fast as he could .  the animal followed him obediently .   sergeant colon pulled at the pack .      if push comes to shove we can wear the sacks     he said .     that   ll   what   s this .      he held up something red .      flowerpot .     said nobby helpfully .      it   s a fez .  some klatchians wear    em .  looks like we   ve struck lucky .  whoops  here   s another one .  try it on  nobby .  and   looks like one of them nightshirts they wear   and here   s another one of those  too .  we   re home and dry  nobby .         they   re a bit short  sarge .         beggars can   t be choosers     said colon  struggling into the costume .     go on  put your fez on .         it makes me look like a twit  sarge .         look  i   ll put mine on  all right .         then we   ll be fez to fez  sarge .      sergeant colon gave him a severe look .     did you have that one prepared  nobby .         no  sarge  i just made it up in my head right then .         well  look  no calling me sarge .  that doesn   t sound klatchian .         nor does nobby  sa   sorry           oh  i dunno   you could be   knobi   or nhobi   or gnobbee   sounds pretty klatchian to me .         what   s a good klatchian name for you  then .  i don   t know hardly any     said nhobi .   sergeant colon didn   t answer .  he was peering round the corner again .      his lordship did say we was not to hang about     nobby murmured .      yeah  but inside that tin can  well  it smells pretty lived in  if you know what i mean .  what i wouldn   t give for        there was a bellow behind them .  they turned .   there were three klatchian soldiers .  or possibly watchmen .  nobby and sergeant colon didn   t look much further than the swords .   the leader growled a question at them .      what did he say .     nobby quavered .      dunno .         where you from .     said the leader  in morporkian .      what .  oh   er       colon hesitated  waiting for shiny death .      hah  yes .     the guard lowered his sword and jerked a thumb toward the docks .     you get back to your detachment now .         right .     said nobby .      what your name .     one of the guards demanded .      nhobi     said nobby .  this seemed to pass .      and you  fat one .      colon was panicking on the spot .  he sought desperately for any name that sounded klatchian  and there was only one that presented itself and which was absolutely and authentically klatchian .      al     he said  his knees trembling .      you get back right now or there will be trouble .      the watchmen ran for it  dragging the donkey behind them  and didn   t stop until they were on the greasy jetty  which somehow felt like home .      what was that all about  s   al .     said nobby .     all they wanted to do was push us around a bit .  typical watch behavior     he added .     not ours  of course .         i suppose we had the right clothes on           you didn   t even tell them where we came from .  and they spoke our language .         well  they   i mean   anyone ought to be able to speak morporkian     said colon  gradually regaining his mental balance .     even babies learn it .  i bet it comes easy after learning somethin    as complicated as klatchian .         what   re we going to do with the donkey  al .         do you think it can pedal .         i doubt it .         then leave it up here .         but it   ll get pinched  al .         oh  these klatchians   ll pinch anything .         not like us  eh  al .      nobby looked at the forest of masts filling the bay .      looks like even more of    em from here     he said .     you could walk from boat to boat for a mile .  what   re they all here for .         don   t be daft  nobby .  it   s obvious .  they   re to take everyone to ankh morpork .         what for .  we don   t eat that much cur           invasion  nobby .  there   s a war on  remember .      they looked back at the ships .  riding lights gleamed on the water .   the bit of it that was immediately below them bubbled for a moment  and then the hull of the boat rose a few inches above the surface .  the lid unscrewed and leonard   s worried face appeared .      ah  there you are     he said .     we were getting concerned        they lowered themselves down into the fetid interior of the vessel .   lord vetinari was sitting with a pad of paper across his knees  writing carefully .  he glanced up briefly .      report .      nobby fidgeted while sergeant colon delivered a more or less accurate account  although there was some witty repartee with the klatchian guards that the corporal had not hitherto recalled .   vetinari did not look up .  still writing  he said     sergeant  ur is an old country rimward of the kingdom of djelibeybi  whose occupants are a byword for bucolic stupidity .  for some reason  i cannot think why  the guard must have assumed you were from there .  and morporkian is something of a lingua franca even in the klatchian empire .  when someone from hersheba needs to trade with someone from istanzia  they will undoubtedly haggle in morporkian .  this will serve us well  of course .  the force that is being assembled here must mean that practically every man is a distant stranger with outlandish ways .  provided we do not act too foreign  we should pass muster .  this means not asking for curry with swede and currants in it and refraining from ordering pints of winkle   s old peculiar  do i make myself clear .         er   what is it we   re going to do  sir .         we will reconnoiter initially .         ah  right .  yes .  very important .         and then seek out the klatchian high command .  thanks to leonard i have a little   package to deliver .  i hope it will end the war very quickly .      sergeant colon looked blank .  at some point in the last few seconds the conversation had run away with him .      sorry  sir   you said high command  sir .         yes  sergeant .         like   the top brass  or turbans or whatever   all surrounded by crack troops  sir .  that   s where you always put the best troops  around the top brass .         i expect this will be the case  yes .  in fact  i rather hope it is .      sergeant colon  once again  tried to keep up .      ah .  right .  and we   ll go and look for them  will we  sir .         i can hardly ask them to come to us  sergeant .         right  sir .  i can see that .  it could get a bit crowded .      at last  lord vetinari looked up .      is there some problem  sergeant .      and sergeant colon once again knew a secret about bravery .  it was arguably a kind of enhanced cowardice   the knowledge that while death may await you if you advance it will be a picnic compared to the certain living hell that awaits should you retreat .      er   not as such  sir     he said .      very well .     vetinari pushed his paperwork aside .     if there is more suitable clothing in your bag  i will get changed and we can take a look at al khali .         oh  gods           sorry  sergeant .         oh  good  sir .         good .     vetinari began to pull other items out of the liberated sack .  there was a set of juggler   s clubs  a bag of colored balls and finally a placard  such as might be placed to one side of the stage during an artist   s performance .         gulli  gulli and beti        he read .        exotic tricks and dances .     hmm     he added .     it would seem there was a lady among the owners of this sack .      the watchmen looked at the gauzy material that came out of the sack next .  nobby   s eyes bulged .      what are them .         i believe they are called harem pants  corporal .         they   re very           curiously  the purpose of the clothing of the nautch girl or exotic dancer has always been less to reveal and more to suggest the imminence of revelation     said the patrician .   nobby looked down at his costume  and then at sergeant al colon in his costume  and said cheerfully     well  i ain   t sure it   s going to suit you  sir .      he regretted the words immediately .      i hadn   t intended that they should suit me     said the patrician calmly .     please pass me your fez  corporal beti .         the subtle  deceiving dawn before dawn slid over the desert  and the commander of the klatchian detachment wasn   t happy about it .   the d   regs always attacked at dawn .  all of them .  it didn   t matter how many of them there were  or how many of you there were .  anyway  the whole tribe attacked .  it wasn   t just the women and children  but the camels  goats  sheep and chickens  too .  of course you were expecting them and bows could cut them down  but   they always appeared suddenly  as if even the desert had spat them out .  get it wrong  be too slow  and you   d be hacked  kicked  butted  pecked and viciously spat at .   his troops lay in wait .  well  if you could call them troops .  he   d said they were overstretched   well  he hadn   t actually said  because that sort of thing could get you into trouble in this man   s army  but he   d thought it very hard .  half of them were keen kids who thought that if you went into battle shouting and waving your sword in the air the enemy just ran away .  they   d never faced a d   reg chicken coming in at eye height .   as for the rest of it   in the night people had run into one another  ambushed one another by mistake and were now as jittery as peas on a drum .  a man had lost his sword and swore that someone had walked away with it stuck right through him .  and some kind of rock had got up and walked around hitting people .  with other people .   the sun was well up now .      it   s the waiting that   s the worst part     said his sergeant  next to him .      it might be the worst part     said the commander .     or  there again  the bit where they suddenly rise out of the desert and cut you in half might be the worst part .     he stared mournfully at the treacherously empty sand .     or the bit where a maddened sheep tries to gnaw your nose off might be the worst part .  in fact  when you think of all the things that can happen when you   re surrounded by a horde of screaming d   regs  the bit where they aren   t there at all is  i think you   ll find  the best part .      the sergeant wasn   t trained for this sort of thing .  so he said     they   re late .         good .  rather them than us .         sun   s right up now  sir .      the commander looked at his shadow .  it was full day  and the sand was mercifully free of his blood .  the commander had been pacifying various recalcitrant parts of klatch for long enough to wonder why  if he was pacifying people  he always seemed to be fighting them .  experience had taught him never to say things like    i don   t like it  it   s too quiet .     there was no such thing as too quiet .      they might have decamped in the night  sir     said the sergeant .      that doesn   t sound like the d   regs .  they never run away .  anyway  i can see their tents .         why don   t we rush    em  sir .         you haven   t fought d   regs before  sergeant .         no  sir .  i   ve been pacifying the mad savatars in uhistan  though  and they   re           the d   regs are worse  sergeant .  they pacify right back at you .         i didn   t say how mad the savatars were  sir .         compared to the d   regs  they were merely slightly vexed .      the sergeant felt that his reputation was being impugned .      how about i take a few men and investigate  sir .      the commander glanced at the sun again .  already the air was too hot to breathe .      oh  very well .  let   s go .      the klatchians advanced on the camp .  there were the tents  and the ash of fires .  but there were no camels and horses  merely a long scuffed trail leading off among the dunes .   morale began to rise a little .  attacking a dangerous enemy who isn   t there is one of the more attractive forms of warfare  and there was a certain amount of assertion about how lucky the d   regs were to have run away in time  and some extemporizing on the subject of what the soldiers would have done to the d   regs if they   d caught them        who   s that .     said the sergeant .   a figure appeared between the dunes  riding on a camel .  his white robes fluttered in the breeze .   he slid down when he reached the klatchians  and waved at them .      good morning  gentlemen .  may i persuade you to surrender .         who are you .         captain carrot  sir .  if you would be kind enough to lay down your weapons no one will get hurt .      the commander looked up .  blobs were appearing along the tops of the dunes .  they rose  and turned out to be heads .      they   re   d   regs  sir .     said the sergeant .      no .  d   regs would be charging  sergeant .         oh  sorry .  shall i tell them to charge .     said carrot .     is that what you   d prefer .      the d   regs were all along the dunes now .  the climbing sun glittered off metal .      are you telling me     the commander began slowly     that you can persuade d   regs not to charge .         it was tricky  but i think they   ve got the idea     said carrot .   the commander considered his position .  there were d   regs on either side .  his troop were practically huddling together .  and this red headed  blue eyed man was smiling at him .      how do they feel about the merciful treatment of prisoners .     he ventured .      i think they could get the hang of it .  if i insist .      the commander glanced at the silent d   regs again .      why .     he said .     why aren   t they fighting us .     he said .      my commander says he doesn   t want unnecessary loss of life  sir     said carrot .     that   s commander vimes  sir .  he   s sitting on that dune up there .         you can persuade armed d   regs not to charge and you have a commander .         yes  sir .  he says this is a police action .      the commander swallowed .     we give in     he said .      what  just like that  sir .     said his sergeant .     without a fight .         yes  sergeant .  without a fight .  this man can make water run uphill and he has a commander .  i love the idea of giving in without a fight .  i   ve fought for ten years and giving in without a fight is what i   ve always wanted to do .         water dripped off the boat   s metal ceiling and blobbed on to the paper in front of leonard of quirm .  he wiped it away .  it might have been boring  waiting in a small metal can under a nondescript jetty  but leonard had no concept of the term .   absentmindedly  he jotted a brief sketch of an improved ventilation system .   he started to watch his own hand .  almost without his guidance  taking its instructions from somewhere else in his head  it drew a cutaway of a much larger version of the boat .  here  here and here   there could be a bank of a hundred oars rather than pedals  each one manned   his pencil caressed the paper   by a well muscled and not overdressed young warrior .  a boat that would pass unseen under other boats  take men wherever they needed to go .  here a giant saw  affixed to the roof  so that when rowed at speed it could cut the hulls of enemy ships .  and here and here a tube     he stopped and stared at his drawing for a while .  then he sighed and started to tear it up .      vimes watched from the dune .  he couldn   t hear much from up here  but he didn   t need to .   angua sat down beside him .     it   s working  isn   t it .     she said .      yes .         what   s he going to do .         oh  he   ll take their weapons and let    em go  i suppose .         why do people follow him .     said angua .      well  you   re his girlfriend  you ought           that   s different .  i love him because he   s kind without thinking about it .  he doesn   t watch his own thoughts like other people do .  when he does good things it   s because he   s decided to do them  not because he   s trying to measure up to something .  he   s so simple .  anyway  i   m a wolf living with people  and there   s a name for wolves that live with people .  if he whistled  i   d come running .      vimes tried not to show his embarrassment .   angua smiled .     don   t worry  mr .  vimes .  you   ve said it yourself .  sooner or later  we   re all someone   s dog .         it   s like hypnotism     said vimes hurriedly .     people follow him to see what   s going to happen next .  they tell themselves that they   re just going along with it for a while and can stop any time they want to  but they never want to .  it   s damn magic .         no .  have you ever really watched him .  i bet he   d found out everything about jabbar by the time he   d talked to him for ten minutes .  i bet he knows the name of every camel .  and he   ll remember it all .  people don   t take that much interest in other people  usually .     her fingers idly traced a pattern in the sand .     so he makes you feel important .         politicians do that       vimes began .      not the way he does  believe me .  i expect lord vetinari remembers facts about people           oh  you   d better believe that .            but carrot takes an interest .  he doesn   t even think about it .  he makes space in his head for people .  he takes an interest  and so people think they   re interesting .  they feel   better when he   s around .      vimes glanced down .  her fingers were drawing aimlessly in the sand again .  we   re all changing in the desert  he thought .  it   s not like the city  hemming your thoughts in .  you can feel your mind expand to the horizons .  no wonder this is where religions start .  and suddenly here i am  probably not legally  just trying to do my job .  why .  because i   m too damn stupid to stop and think before i give chase  that   s why .  even carrot knew better than to do that .  i   d have just chased after ahmed   s ship without a thought  but he was bright enough to report back to me first .  he did what a responsible officer ought to do  but me        vetinari   s terrier     he said aloud .     chase first  and think about it afterward        his eye caught the distant bulk of gebra .  out there was a klatchian army  and somewhere over there was the ankh morpork army  and he was with a handful of people and no plan because he   d chased first and        but i had to     he said .     any copper wouldn   t have let a suspect like ahmed get        once again he had the feeling that the problem he was facing wasn   t really a problem at all .  it was something very obvious .  he was the problem .  he wasn   t thinking right .   come to think of it  he hadn   t really thought at all .   he glanced down again at the trapped company .  they had stripped down to their loincloths and were looking very sheepish  as men generally do in their underwear .   carrot   s white robe still flapped in the breeze .  he hasn   t been here a day  thought vimes  and already he   s wearing the desert like a pair of sandals .         er   bingeley bingeley beep .         is that your demon diary .     said angua .   vimes rolled his eyes .     yes .  although it seems to be talking about someone else .            er   three pee em     the demon muttered slowly        day not filled in   check wall defences           see .  it thinks i   m in ankh morpork .  it cost sybil three hundred dollars and it can   t even keep track of where i am .      he flicked his cigar butt away and stood up .      i   d better get down there     he said .     after all  i am the boss .      he slithered his way down the dune and strolled toward carrot  who salaamed to him .      a salute would do  captain  thanks all the same .         sorry  sir .  i think i got a bit carried away .         why   ve you made them strip off .         makes them a bit of a laughingstock when they return  sir .  a blow to their pride .     he leaned closer and whispered     i   ve let their commander keep his clothes on  though .  it doesn   t do to show up the officers .         really .     said vimes .      and some want to join us  sir .  there   s goriff   s lad and a few others .  they were just dragooned into the army yesterday .  they don   t even know why they   re fighting .  so i said they could .      vimes took the captain aside .     er   i don   t remember suggesting that any of the prisoners joined us     he said quietly .      well  sir   i thought  what with our army approaching  and since quite a lot of these lads are from various corners of the empire and don   t like the klatchians any more than we do  i thought that a flying column of guerrilla fighters           we aren   t soldiers .         er  i thought we were soldiers           yes  yes  all right .  in a way   but really we   re coppers  like we   ve always been .  we don   t kill people unless        ahmed .  everyone   s slightly on edge when he   s around  he worries people  he gets information from all over the place  he seems to go where he pleases  and he   s always around when there   s trouble   damn damn damn     he ran through the crowd until he reached jabbar  who was watching carrot with the usual puzzled smile that carrot caused in innocent bystanders .      tree dace     said vimes .     three days .  that   s seventy two hours .         yes  offendi .     said jabbar .  it was the voice of someone who recognized dawn  noon and sunset  and just let everything in between happen whenever it liked .      so why   s he called    hour ahmed .  what   s so special about the extra hour .      jabbar grinned nervously .      did he do something after seventy one hours .     said vimes .   jabbar folded his arms .     i will not say .         he told you to keep us here .         yes .         but not to kill us .         oh  i would not kill my friend sir sam mule           and don   t give me all that eyeball rubbish     said vimes .     he wanted time to get somewhere and do something  right .         i will not say .         you don   t need to     said vimes .     because we are leaving .  and if you kill us   well  probably you can .  but    hour ahmed would not like that  i expect .      jabbar looked like a man making a difficult decision .      he will be coming back .     he said .     tomorrow .  no problem .         i   m not waiting .  and i don   t think he wants me killed  jabbar .  he wants me alive .  carrot .      carrot hurried over .     yes  sir .      vimes was aware that jabbar was staring at him in horror .      we   ve lost ahmed     he said .     even angua can   t pick up his trail with the sand blowing all over the place .  we   ve got no place here .  we   re not needed here .         but we are  sir .     carrot burst out .     we could help the desert tribes           oh  you want to stay and fight .     said vimes .     against the klatchians .         against the bad klatchians  sir .         ah  well  that   s the trick  isn   t it .  when one of them comes screaming at you waving a sword  how do you spot his moral character .  well  you can stay if you like and fight for the good name of ankh morpork .  it should be a pretty short fight .  but i   m off .  jenkins probably hasn   t got afloat again .  okay  jabbar .      the d   reg was staring at the desert sand between his feet .      you know where he is now  don   t you .     vimes prompted .      yes .         tell me .         no .  i swore to him .         but d   regs are oath breakers .  everyone knows that .      jabbar gave vimes a grin .     oh  oaths .  stupid things .  i gave him my word .         he won   t break it  sir     said carrot .     d   regs are very particular about things like that .  it   s only when they swear on gods and things that they   ll ever break an oath .         i will not tell you where he is     said jabbar .     but       he grinned again  but there was no humor in it     how brave are you  mr .  vimes .            stop complaining  nobby .         i   m not complaining .  i   m just sayin    these trousers are a bit draughty  that   s all i   m saying .         they look good on you  though .         and what   re these tin bowls supposed to be doing .         they   re supposed to be protecting the bits you haven   t got  nobby .         the way this breeze is blowing  i could do with some to protect the bits i have .         just try and act ladylike  will you  nobby .      which would be hard  sergeant colon had to admit .  the lady for whom the clothes had been made had been quite tall and somewhat full figured  whereas nobby without his armor could have hidden behind a short stick if you attached a toast rack to it about two thirds of the way up .  he looked like a gauzy accordion with a lot of jewelry .  in theory  the costume would have been quite revealing  if corporal nobbs was something you wished to see revealed  but there were so many billows and folds now that all one could reliably say was that he was in there somewhere .  he was leading the donkey  which seemed to like him .  animals tended to like nobby .  he didn   t smell wrong .      and them boots don   t work     sergeant colon went on .      why not .  you kept yours on .         yeah  but i   m not supposed to be a flower of the desert  right .  a moon of someone   s delight shouldn   t kick up sparks when she walks  am i right .         they belonged to my gran  i ain   t leaving    em around for anyone to nick  and i ain   t mooning for anyone   s delight     said nobby sulkily .   lord vetinari strode on ahead .  the streets were already filling up .  al khali liked to get the business of the day started in the cool of dawn  before full day flamethrowered the landscape .  no one paid the newcomers any attention  although a few people did turn round to watch corporal nobbs .  goats and chickens ambled out of the way as they passed .      watch out for people trying to sell you dirty postcards  nobby     said colon .     my uncle was here once and he said some bloke tried to sell him a pack of dirty postcards for five dollars .  disgusted  he was .         yeah     cos you can get    em in the shades for two dollars     said nobby .      that   s what he said .  and they were ankh morpork ones .  trying to flog us our own dirty postcards .  i call that disgusting  frankly .         good morning  sultan .     said a cheerful and somehow familiar voice .     new in town  are we .      all three of them turned to a figure that had magically appeared from the mouth of an alleyway .      indeed  yes     said the patrician .      i could see you were .  everyone is  these days .  and it is your lucky day  shah .  i am here to help  right .  you want something  i got it .      sergeant colon had been staring at the newcomer .  he said  in a faraway voice     your name   s going to be something like   al jibla or something  right .         heard about me  have you .     said the trader jovially .      sort of  yeah     said colon slowly .     you   re amazingly   familiar .      lord vetinari pushed him aside .     we are strolling entertainers     he said .     we were hoping to get an engagement at the prince   s palace   perhaps you could help .      the man rubbed his beard thoughtfully  causing various particles to cascade into the little bowls in his tray .      dunno about the palace     he said .     what   s it you do .         we practice juggling  fire eating  that sort of thing     said vetinari .      do we .     said colon .   al jibla nodded at nobby .     what does              she       said lord vetinari helpfully .         she do .         exotic dancing     said vetinari  while nobby scowled .      pretty exotic  i should think     said al jibla .      you   d be amazed .      a couple of armed men had drifted over to them .  sergeant colon   s heart sank .  in those bearded faces he saw himself and nobby  who at home would always saunter over to anything on the street that looked interesting .      you are jugglers  are you .     said one of them .     let   s see you juggle  then .      lord vetinari gave them a blank look and then glanced down at the tray around al jibla   s neck .  among the more identifiable foodstuffs were a number of green melons .      very well     he said  and picked up three of them .   sergeant colon shut his eyes .   after a few seconds he opened them again because a guard had said     all right  but anyone can do it with three .         in that case perhaps mr .  al jibla will throw me a few more .     said the patrician  as the balls spun through his hands .   sergeant colon shut his eyes again .   after a short while a guard said     seven is pretty good .  but it   s just melons .      colon opened his eyes .   the klatchian guard twitched his robe aside .  half a dozen throwing knives glinted .  and so did his teeth .   lord vetinari nodded .  to colon   s growing surprise he did not seem to be watching the tumbling melons at all .      four melons and three knives     he said .     if you would care to give the knives to my charming assistant beti           who .     said nobby .      oh .  why not seven knives  then .         kind sirs  that would be too simple     said lord vetinari .      i am but a humble tumbler .  please let me practice my art .         beti .     said nobby  glowering under his veils .   three fruits arced gently out of the green whirl and thumped on to al jibla   s tray .   the guards looked carefully  and to colon   s mind nervously  at the cross dressed figure of the cross corporal .      she   s not going to do any kind of dance  is she .     one of them ventured .      no .     snapped beti .      promise .       nobby grabbed three of the knives and tugged them out of the man   s belt .      i   ll give them to his lor   to him  shall i  beti .     said colon  suddenly quite sure that keeping the patrician alive was almost certainly the only way to avoid a brief cigarette in the sunshine .  he was also aware that other people were drifting over to watch the show .      to me  please   al     said the patrician  nodding .   colon tossed him the knives  slowly and gingerly .  he   s going to try to stab the guards  he thought .  it   s a ruse .  and then everyone   s going to tear us apart .   now the circling blur glinted in the sunlight .  there was a murmur of approval from the crowd .      yet somehow dull     said the patrician .   and his hands moved in a complex pattern that suggested that his wrists must have moved through one another at least twice .   the tangled ball of hurtling fruit and cutlery leapt into the air .   three melons dropped to the ground  cut cleanly in two .   three knives thudded into the dust a few inches from their owner   s sandals .   and sergeant colon looked up and into a growing  greenish  expanding     the melon exploded  and so did the audience  but both their laughter and the humor was slightly lost on colon as he scraped over ripe pith out of his ears .   the survival instinct cut in again .  stagger around backward  it said .  so he staggered around backward  waving his legs in the air .  fall down heavily  it said .  so he sat down  and almost squashed a chicken .  lose your dignity  it said  of all the things you   ve got  it   s the one you can most afford to lose .   lord vetinari helped him up .     our very lives depend on your appearing to be a stupid fat idiot     he hissed  putting colon   s fez back on his head .      i ain   t very good at acting  sir           good .         yessir .      the patrician scooped up three melon halves and positively skipped over to a stall that a woman had just set up  snatching an egg from a basket as he went past .  sergeant colon blinked again .  this was not   real .  the patrician didn   t do this sort of thing        ladies and gentlemen .  you see   an egg .  and here we have a   melon rind .  egg  melon .  melon  egg .  we put the melon over the egg .     his hands darted across the three halves  switching them at bewildering speed .     round and round they go  just like that .  now   where   s the egg .  what about you  shah .      al jibla smirked .         s the one on the left     he said .     it always is .      lord vetinari lifted the melon .  the board below was eggless .      and you  noble guardsman .            s got to be the one in the middle     said the guard .      yes  of course   oh dear  it isn   t        the crowd looked at the last melon .  they were street people .  they knew the score .  when the object can be under one of three things  and it   s already turned out not to be under two of them  then the one place it was certainly not going to be was under the third .  only some kind of gullible fool would believe something like that .  of course there was going to be a trick .  there always was a trick .  but you watched it  in order to see a trick done well .   lord vetinari raised the melon nevertheless  and the crowd nodded in satisfaction .  of course it wasn   t there .  it   d be a pretty poor day for street entertainment if things were where they were supposed to be .   sergeant colon knew what was going to happen next  and he knew this because for the last minute or so something had been pecking at his head .   aware that this was probably his moment  he raised his fez and revealed a very small fluffy chick .      have you got a towel .  i am afraid it has just gone to the toilet on my head  sir .      there was laughter  some applause and  to his amazement  a tinkling of coins around his feet .      and finally     said the patrician     the beautiful beti will do an exotic dance .      the crowd fell silent .   then someone at the back said     how much do we have to pay for her not to .         right .  i   ve just about had enough of this .     veils flying out behind her  bangles jingling  elbows waving viciously and boots kicking up sparks  the lovely beti strode into the crowd .     which of you said that .      people shrank away from her .  armies would have retreated .  and there  revealed like a jellyfish deserted by a suddenly ebbing tide  was a small man about to fry in the wrath of the ascendant nobbs .      i meant no offense  oh  doe eyed one           oh .  pastry faced  am i .     nobby flung out an arm in a crash of bracelets and knocked the man over .     you   ve got a lot to learn about women  young man .     and then  because a nobbs could never resist a prone target  the petite beti drew back a steel capped boot        beti .     snapped the patrician .      oh  right  yeah  right     said nobby  with veiled contempt .     everyone can tell me what to do  right .  just because i happen to be the woman around here i   m just supposed to accept it all  eh .         no  you just ain   t supposed to kick him inna fork     hissed colon  pulling him away .     it don   t look good .     although  he noted  the women in the crowd seemed to be disappointed by the sudden curtailment of the performance .      and there are many strange stories we can tell you .     shouted the patrician .      beti certainly could     murmured colon  and was kicked sharply on his ankle .      and many strange sights we can show you .         beti cert   aargh .         but for now we will seek the shade of yonder caravanserai           what   re we doing .         we   re going to the pub .      the crowd began to disperse  but with occasional amused glances back at the trio .   one of the guards nodded at colon .     nice show     he said .     especially the bit where your lady didn   t remove any veils       he darted behind his colleague as nobby spun round like an avenging angel .      sergeant     the patrician whispered .     it is very important that we learn the current whereabouts of prince cadram  do you understand .  in taverns  people talk .  let us keep our ears open .      the tavern wasn   t colon   s idea of a pub .  for one thing  most of it had no roof .  arched walls surrounded a courtyard .  a grapevine grew out of a huge cracked urn and had been teased overhead on trellises .  there was the gentle sound of tinkling water  and unlike the mended drum this was not because the bar backed onto the privies but because of a small fountain in the middle of the cobbles .  and it was cool  much cooler than in the street  even though the vine leaves scarcely hid the sky .      didn   t know you could juggle  sir     colon whispered to lord vetinari .      you mean you can   t  sergeant .         nossir .         how strange .  it   s hardly a skill  is it .  one knows what the objects are and where they want to go .  after that it   s just a case of letting them occupy the correct positions in time and space .         you   re dead good at it  sir .  practice often  do you .         until today  i   ve never tried .     lord vetinari looked at colon   s astonished expression .     after ankh morpork  sergeant  a handful of flying melons present a very minor problem indeed .         i   m amazed  sir .         and in politics  sergeant  it is always important to know where the chicken is .      colon raised his fez .     is this one still on my head .         it seems to have gone to sleep .  i wouldn   t disturb it  if i were you .            ere  you  juggler   she can   t come in here .      they looked up .  someone with a face and apron that said    barman    in seven hundred languages was standing over them  a wine jug in each hand .      no women in here     he went on .      why not .     said nobby .      no women asking questions  neither .         why not .            cos it is written  that   s why .         where   m i supposed to go  then .      the barman shrugged .     who knows where women go .         off you go  beti     said the patrician .     and   listen for information .      nobby grabbed the cup of wine from colon and gulped it down .      i dunno     he moaned     i   ve only been a woman ten minutes and already i hate you male bastards .         i dunno what   s got into him  sir     whispered colon as nobby stamped out .     he ain   t like this normally .  i thought klatchian women did what they were told .         does your wife do what she   s told  sergeant .         well  yeah  obviously  a man   s got to be the master in his own house  that   s what i always say           so why are you  i hear  always putting up kitchen furniture .         well  obviously  you   ve got to listen to           in fact klatchian history is full of famous examples of women who even went to war with their men     said the patrician .      what .  on the same side .         prince arkven   s wife tistam used to ride into the battle with her husband and  according to legend  killed ten thousand thousand men .         that   s a lot of men .         legends are prone to inflation .  however  i believe there is good historical evidence that queen sowawondra of sumtri had more than thirty thousand people put to death during her reign .  she could be quite touchy  they say .         you should hear my wife if i don   t put the plates away     said sergeant colon gloomily .      now we are integrated with the local population  sergeant     said the patrician     we must find out what is happening .  although an invasion is clearly planned  i feel sure prince cadram will have reserved some forces in case of land attack .  it would be nice to know where they are  because that   s where he will be .         right .         you think you can handle this .         yessir .  i know klatchians  sir .  don   t you worry about that .         here   s some money .  buy drinks for people .  mingle .         right .         not too many drinks  but as much mingling as you are capable of .         i   m a good mingler  sir .         off you go  then .         sir .         yes .         i   m a bit worried about   beti  sir .  going off like that .  anything might happen to hi   her .     but he spoke with some hesitation .  there wasn   t much you could imagine happening to corporal nobbs .      i   m sure we shall hear about it if there are any problems     said the patrician .      you   re right there  sir .      colon sidled over to a group of men who were sitting in a rough circle on the floor  talking quietly amongst themselves and eating from a large dish .   he sat down .  the men on either side of him obediently shuffled along .   now then  how did you   ah  right   anyone knew how klatchians talked        greetings  fellow brothers of the dessert     he said .     i don   t know about you  but i could just do with a plate of sheep   s eyeballs  eh .  i bet you boys can   t wait to be back on your camels  i know i can   t .  i spit upon the defiling dogs of ankh morpork .  anyone had any baksheesh lately .  you can call me al .            excuse me  are you the lady who is with the clowns .      corporal nobbs  who had been trudging along gloomily  looked up .  he was being addressed by a pleasant faced young woman .  a woman actually talking to him by choice was a novelty .  smiling while doing so was unheard of .      er   yeah .  right .  that   s me .     he swallowed .     beti .         my name is bana .  would you like to come and talk with us .      nobby looked past her .  there were a number of women of varying ages sitting around a large well .  one of them waved at him shyly .   he blinked .  this was uncharted territory .  he looked down at his clothes  which were already the worse for wear .  his clothes always looked the worse for wear five minutes after he   d put them on .      oh  don   t worry     said the girl .     we know how it is .  but you looked so alone .  and perhaps you can help us        they were among the group now .  there were women of every legitimate shape and size  and so far none of them had said    yuk     an experience hitherto unchronicled in nobby   s personal history .  in a detached  light headed way  corporal nobbs felt that he was entering paradise  and it was only an unfortunate detail that he   d come in via the wrong door .      we are trying to comfort netal     said the girl .     her betrothed won   t marry her tomorrow .         the swine     said nobby .   one of the girls  eyes red with crying  looked up sharply .      he wanted to     she sobbed .     but he   s been taken off to fight in gebra .  all over some island no one   s heard of .  and all my family are here .         who took him off .     said nobby .      he took himself off     snapped an older woman .  clothing differences aside  there was something hauntingly familiar about her  and nobby realized that if you cut her in half the words    mother in law    would be all the way through .      oh  mrs .  atbar     said netal     he said it was his duty .  anyway  all the boys have had to go .         men .     said nobby  rolling his eyes .      i expect you   d know a lot about the pleasures of men  then     said mother in law sourly .      mother .         who  me .     said nobby  forgetting himself for a moment .     oh  yeah .  lots .         you do .         why not .  beer   s favorite     said nobby .     but you can   t beat a good cigar  as long as it   s free .         hah .     mother in law picked up a basket of washing and stamped away  followed by most of the older women .  the others laughed .  even the disappointed netal smiled .      i think that   s not what she meant     said bana .  to a chorus of giggles  she leaned down and whispered in nobby   s ear .   his expression did not change but it did seem to solidify .      oh  that     he said .   there were some worlds of experience which nobby had only contemplated on a map  but he knew what she was talking about .  of course he   d patrolled certain parts of the shades in his time   the ones where young ladies tended to hang around without very much to do  and probably catching cold too   but those areas of police work that in other places might be of interest to a vice squad now tended to be looked after by the guild of seamstresses themselves .  people who neglected to obey the   no  not the law as such  call them the unwritten rules   as laid down by mrs .  palm and her committee of very experienced ladies  attracted the attention of the agony aunts  dotsie and sadie  and might or might not be seen again .  even mr .  vimes approved of the arrangement .  it didn   t cause paperwork .      oh  yeah     said nobby  still staring at some inner screen .   of course  he knew what        oh  that     he mumbled .     well  i   ve seen a thing or two     he added .  largely on postcards  he had to admit .      it must be wonderful to have so much freedom     said bana .      er        netal burst out crying again .  her friends fluttered around her .      i don   t see why the men have to go off like this     said bana .     my betrothed has gone  too .      there was a cackle from a very old woman sitting by the well .     i can tell you why  dears .  because it   s better than growing melons all day .  it   s better than women .         men think war is better than women .         it   s always fresh  it   s always young  and you can make a good fight last all day .         but they get killed .         better to die in battle than in bed  they say .     she cracked a toothless grin .     but there are good ways for a man to die in bed  eh  beti .      nobby hoped the glow of his ears wasn   t singeing his veil .  suddenly  he felt he   d caught up with his future .  ten damn pence    worth of it hit him in the face .         scuse me     he said .     are any of you nubilians .         what are nubilians .     said bana .      it   s a country round here     said nobby .  he added hopefully     isn   t it .      not a single face suggested that this was so .   nobby sighed .  his hand reached up to his ear for a cigarette end  but it came down again empty .      i   ll tell you this  girls     he said .     i wish i   d settled for the ten dollar version .  don   t you just sometimes want to sit down and cry .         you look even sadder than netal     said bana .     isn   t there some way we can cheer you up .      nobby stared at her for a moment  and then started to sob .      everyone was staring at colon  their food halfway to their lips .      did i just hear him say that .  faifal .  what do i want to be on a camel for .  i   m a plumber .         he is the down with the juggler .  i think the poor man is several palms short of an oasis .         i mean the bloody things spit and they   re a bugger to get up the stairs with your toolbox           now  come on it   s not his fault  let   s show a little charity .     the speaker cleared his throat .     good morning  friend     he said .     may we invite you to share our couscous .      sergeant colon peered at the bowl  and then dipped in a finger and tasted it .      hey  this is semolina .  you   ve got semolina .  it   s just ordinary semol       he stopped  and coughed .     yeah  right .  thanks .  got any strawberry jam .      the host looked at his friends .  they shrugged .      we know not of this    strawberry hjam    of which you speak     he said carefully .     we prefer it with lamb .     he offered colon a long wooden skewer .      oh  you gotta have strawberry jam     said colon  carried away .     when we were kids we   d stir it in and   and       he looked at their faces .     o   course  that was back in ur     he said .   the men nodded at one another .  suddenly it was all clear .   colon belched loudly .   from the looks he got from everyone else  he was the only one who   d heard of this common klatchian custom .      so     he said     where   s the army these days .  approximately .         why do you ask  o full of gas one .         oh  we thought we could make a bit of cash entertaining the troops     said colon .  he was immensely proud of this idea .     you know   a smile  a song  a lack of exotic dancing .  but that means we got to know where they are  see .         excuse me  fat one  but can you understand what i am saying .         yes  it   s very tasty     colon hazarded .      ah  i thought so .  so he   s a spy .  but whose .         really .  who would be so stupid as to use a joke like this as a spy .         ankh morpork .         oh  come on .  he   s pretending to be an ankh morpork spy  perhaps .  but they   re cunning over there        you think .  a people who make curry out of something called powder and you think they   re clever .         i reckon he   s from muntab .  they   re always watching us .         and pretending to be from ankh morpork .         well  if you were trying to look like a joke morporkian pretending to be klatchian  wouldn   t you look like that .         but why   d he pretend to be from there .         ah   politics .         let   s call the watch  then .         are you mad .  we   ve been talking to him .  they will be   inquisitive .         good point .  i know        faifal gave colon a big grin .      i did hear the entire army has marched away to en al sams la laisa     he said .     but don   t tell anyone .         have they .     colon glanced at the other men .  they were watching him with curiously deadpan expressions .      sounds like a massive place  with a name like that     he said .      oh  huge     said his neighbor .  one of the other men made a noise that you might think was a suppressed chuckle .      it   s a long way  is it .         no  very close .  you   re practically on top of it     said faifal .  he nudged a colleague  whose shoulders were shaking .      oh  right .  big army  is it .         could easily be very big  yes .         fine .  fine     said colon .     er   anyone got a pencil .  i could   ve sworn i had one when        there was a noise outside the tavern .  it was the sound of many women laughing  which is always a disquieting noise to men .   customers peered suspiciously through the vines .   colon and the rest of the crowd looked around an urn at the group by the well .  an old lady was rolling on the ground  laughing  and various younger ones were leaning against one another for support .   he heard one of them say     what did he say again .         he said     that   s funny  it   s never done that when i   ve tried it .            yeah  that   s true .     cackled the old woman .     it never does .            that   s funny  it   s never done that when i   ve tried it        nobby repeated .   colon groaned .  that was the voice and tone of corporal nobbs in storytelling mode  when wood could scorch at ten yards .         scuse me     he muttered  and forced his way through the press to the gateway .      have you heard the one about the ki   the sultan who was afraid his wife   one of his wives   would be unfaithful to him while he was away .         we haven   t heard any stories like these  beti .     bana gasped .      really .  oh  i   ve got a thousand and one of    em .  well  anyway  he went and saw the wise old blacksmith  right  and he said           you can   t go round telling stories like that  cor   beti     colon panted as he lumbered to a halt .   nobby realized that a change had come over the group .  now he was surrounded by women who were in the presence of a man .  a known man  he corrected himself .   several of them were blushing .  they hadn   t blushed before .      why not .     said beti nastily .      you   ll offend people     said colon uncertainly .      er  we are not offended  sir     said bana  in a small humble voice .     we think beti   s stories are very   instructive .  especially the one about the man who went into the tavern with the very small musician .         and that was pretty hard to translate     said nobby     because they don   t really know what a piano is in klatch .  but it turns out there   s this kind of stringed           and it was very interesting about the man with his arms and legs in plaster     said netal .      yeah  and they laughed even though they don   t have the same kind of doorbells here     said nobby .     here  you don   t have to go        but the group around the well was dispersing .  water jugs were being picked up and carried away .  a kind of preoccupied busyness came over the women .   bana nodded at beti .     er   thank you .  it   s been very   interesting .  but we must go .  it was so kind of you to talk to us .         er  no  don   t go        a faint suggestion of perfume hung in the air .   beti glared at colon .     sometimes i really want to give you a right ding alongside the lughole     she growled .     my first bloody chance in years and you        she stopped .  there was a crowd of puzzled yet disapproving faces behind colon .   and things might have ended otherwise had it not been for the braying of the donkey  from above .   the stolen donkey  easily pulling away from nobby   s inexpert tether  had wandered off in search of food .  she vaguely associated this with the doorway to her stable and therefore with doorways in general  and so had wandered through the nearest open one .   there had been some narrow spiral stairs inside  but her stall was pretty narrow and steps didn   t worry a donkey that was used to the streets of al khali .   it was only a disappointment when the steps came to an end and there was still no hay .      oh no     said someone behind colon .     there   s a donkey up the minaret again .      there were groans all round .      what   s wrong with that .  what goes up must come down     said colon .      you don   t know .     said one of his dining companions .     you don   t have minarets in ur .         er       said colon .      we have plenty of donkeys     said lord vetinari .  there was general laughter  most of it directed at colon .   one of the men pointed to the dim interior of the minaret .      look   see .         a very narrow  winding staircase     said the patrician .     so    .         there   s nowhere to turn at the top  right .  oh  any fool can get a donkey up a minaret .  but have you ever tried getting an animal to go backward down a narrow staircase in the dark .  can   t be done .         there   s something about a rising staircase     said someone else .     it attracts donkeys .  they think there   s something at the top .         we had to push the last one off  didn   t we .     said one of the guards .      right .  it splashed     said his comrade in arms .      no one is pushing valerie off   f anything     snarled beti .     any one of you tries anything like that and  s   welp me  you   ll feel the wrong end of       he stopped  and a wide horrible grin appeared behind the veil .     i mean  i   ll give you a great big soppy kiss .      several men at the back of the crowd took to their heels .      there   s no need to get nasty     said the guard .      i mean it .     said beti  advancing .   the cowering guard cringed .     can   t you do anything with her  sirs .         us .     said lord vetinari .        fraid not .  oh  dear   it   s going to be like that business in djelibeybi all over again  al .         oh dear     said colon  mugging loyally .  the crowd  or at least that part that thought itself sufficiently far away from beti  started to grin .  this was street theater .      i don   t know if they ever got that man down off the flagpole     vetinari went on .      oh  most of    im  they did     said colon .      tell you what  tell you what     said the guard hurriedly     suppose we get a rope round it              her       beti growled .      her  right  and then           you   d need at least three men up there and there ain   t no room .         sir  i   ve got an idea     whispered one of the guards .      i should make it quick     said colon .        cos there   s no stopping beti once she gets going .      the guards held a whispered argument .      we   d get into trouble if we do that .  you know all that stuff we were told about the war effort .  that   s why they were all confiscated .         no one will miss it for five minutes .         yeah  but you want to tell the prince we lost one .         all right  but do you want to explain to her .      they both looked at beti .      and they   re easy to steer  after all     one whispered .      valerie .     said sergeant colon .      there is a problem .     beti demanded .      no .  no .  it   s a fine name for a donkey  n   beti .         no one is to do anything     said one of the guards .     we will return .         what was all that about .     said colon  watching them go .      oh  they   ve probably gone to get a carpet     said someone .      very nice  but i don   t see how that   d help     said beti .      a flying one .         oh  right     said colon .     they   ve got one of those up at the university           ur has a university .         oh  indeed     said the patrician .     how do you think al learned what a donkey looks like .      once again  laughter dispelled doubt .  colon grinned uncertainly .      i   m really getting good at this stupid idiot stuff  aren   t i .     he said .     it just sort of happens .         marvelous     said lord vetinari .   there was another angry braying from far above .      trouble is  they   re all locked up because of the war effort     said someone behind them .   a piece of mud brick shattered on the ground nearby .      the way it   s thrashing around up there  it   s going to fall off anyway .         perhaps i should persuade her to come down     said the patrician .      can   t be done  offendi .  you can   t get past on the stairs  you can   t turn it round  and it won   t come down backward .         i shall consider the situation     said the patrician .   he ambled back into the tavern for a moment  and returned .  they saw him enter the door and they heard him climbing the staircase .      should be good     said a man behind colon .   after a while the braying stopped .      can   t turn around  see .  far too narrow     said the elevated donkey expert .     can   t turn around  won   t go backward .  well known fact .         there   s always a know all  right  beti .     said colon .      yeah .  always .      the tower was full of silence .  several members of the crowd found their attention drawn to it .      i mean  if you could get three or four men up the stairs  which you can   t  you could sort of move it a leg at a time  if you didn   t mind being kicked and bitten to death           all right  all right  back away from the tower  will you .      the guards were back .  one of them was carrying a rolled up carpet .      all right  all right  give us room           i can hear hooves     said someone .      oh  yeah  like our friend in the fez is getting the donkey down the stairs .         hang on  i can hear them  too     said colon .   now all eyes stared at the door .   lord vetinari emerged  holding a length of rope .   the voice behind colon said     all right  it   s just a bit of rope .  he was probably banging a couple of coconut shells together .         you mean  ones that he found in the minaret .         he had them with him  obviously .         you mean  he carries coconut shells around .         you can   t turn a donkey round in   all right  that   s a fake donkey head           it   s moving its ears .         on a string  on a string   all right  it   s a donkey  okay  but it   s not the same donkey .  it   s one he had in a hidden pocket   well  no need to look at me like that .  i   ve seen them do it with doves        then even the unbeliever fell silent .      donkey  minaret     said lord vetinari .     minaret  donkey .         just like that .     said a guard .     how did you do it .  it was a trick  right .         of course it was a trick     said lord vetinari .      i knew it was just a trick .         that   s right  it was just a trick     said lord vetinari .      so   how did you do it  then .         you mean you can   t spot it .      the crowd craned to see .      er   you had an inflatable donkey           can you think of any reason why i should go around with an inflatable donkey .         well  you           one that you wouldn   t mind explaining to your own dear mother .         if you   re going to put it like that              s easy     said al jibla .     there   s a secret compartment in the minaret .  must be .         no  you   ve got it all wrong  it   s just an illusion of a donkey   well  all right  it   s a good illusion        by now half the people were around the donkey and the others were clustered in the doorway of the minaret  looking for secret panels .      i think  al and beti  this is where we walk away     said lord vetinari  behind colon .     just down this little alley here .  and when we turn that corner  we run .         what   ve we got to run for .     said beti .      because i   ve just picked up the magic carpet .         vimes was already lost .  oh  there was the sun  but that was just a direction .  he could feel it on the side of his face .   and the camel rocked from side to side .  there was no real way of judging distance  except by hemorrhoids .   i   m blindfolded on the back of a camel ridden by a d   reg  who everyone says are the most untrustworthy people in the world .  but i   m almost positive he   s not going to kill me .      so     he said  as he rocked gently from side to side     you may as well tell me .  why    hour ahmed .         he killed a man     said jabbar .      and d   regs object to a little thing like that .         in the man   s own tent .  when he had been his guest for nearly tree dace .  if he had but waited an hour           oh  i see .  definitely bad manners .  had the man done anything to deserve it .         nothing .  although           yes .         the man had killed el ysa .     the d   reg   s tone suggested that this wasn   t much of a mitigating circumstance  but that it ought to be mentioned out of completeness .      who was she .         el ysa was a village .  he poisoned a well .  there had been a dispute over religion     he added .     one thing led to another   but even so  to break the tradition of hospitality           yes  i can see that   s a terrible thing .  almost   impolite .         the hour was important .  some things should not be done .         you   re right there  at least .      by mid afternoon jabbar let him take off the blindfold .  wind carved heaps of black rock stood out of the sand .  vimes thought it was the most desolate place he   d ever seen .      they say once it was green     said jabbar .     a well watered land .         what happened .         the wind changed .      at sunset they reached a wadi between more wind scoured rocks  and it was only the length of the shadows  deepening the shallow indentations  that began to give them back an ancient shape .      they   re buildings  aren   t they .     said vimes .      there was a city here  a long time ago .  did you not know .         why should i know .         your people built it .  it was called tacticum .  after a warrior of yours .      vimes looked at the crumbled walls and fallen pillars .      he had a city named after him       he said to no one in particular .   jabbar nudged him .     ahmed is watching you     he said .      i can   t see him anywhere .         of course .  get down .  and i hope we meet again in whatever is your paradise .         right  right        jabbar turned the camel round .  it left much faster than it had arrived .   vimes sat on a rock for a while .  there was no sound but the hissing of the wind in the rocks and the cry of some bird  far away .   he thought he could hear his own heart beating .      bingeley   bingeley   beep       the dis organizer sounded worried and uncertain .   vimes sighed .     yes .  appointment with    hour ahmed  eh .         er   no       said the demon .     er   klatchian fleet sighted   er           ships of the desert  eh .         er   beep   error code      divergent temporal instability        vimes shook the box .     something wrong with you .     he demanded .     you   re still giving me someone else   s appointments  you idiot box .         er   the appointments are correct for commander samuel vimes           that   s me .         which one of you .     said the demon .      what .            beep        it refused to say more .  vimes considered throwing it away  but sybil would be hurt if she found out .  he thrust it back into his pocket and tried to concentrate on the scenery again .   his seat might have been part of a pillar once .  vimes saw other pieces some way away  and then realized that a heap of apparent rubble was a fallen wall .  he followed this  his footsteps echoing off the cliffs  and realized that he was walking between old buildings  or where buildings had been .  here was the wreck of some stairs  there the stump of a pillar .   one was a little higher than the others .  he pulled himself up and found  on its flat top  two huge feet .  a statue must have stood here .  it probably stood  if vimes knew anything about statues  in some kind of noble attitude .  now it had gone  and there were just feet  broken off at the ankles .  they weren   t exceptionally noble .   as he lowered himself again he saw  protected because this side was out of the wind  some lettering carved deeply into the plinth .  he tried to make it out in the fading light         ab hoc possum videre domum tuum        well      domum tuum    was    your house     wasn   t it .    and    videre    was    i see           what .     he said aloud .        i can see your house from up here    .  what kind of a noble sentiment is that .         i believe it was meant to be a boast and a threat  sir samuel     said    hour ahmed .     somewhat typical of ankh morpork  i   ve always thought .      vimes stood very still .  the voice had been right behind him .   and it was ahmed   s voice .  but it lacked that hint of camel spit and gravel that it had possessed in ankh morpork .  now it was the drawl of a gentleman .      it   s the echoes here     ahmed went on .     i could be anywhere .  i could have a crossbow aimed at you right now .         you won   t fire it  though .  we   ve both got too much at stake .         oh  there is honor among thieves  is there .         i don   t know     said vimes .  oh  well   time to see if he was dead right or just dead .     is there honor among policemen .         sergeant colon   s eyes went big .      swing my weight to one side .     he said .      that   s how magic carpets are steered     said lord vetinari calmly .      yes  but supposing i swing myself off .         we   ll have a lot more room     said beti unfeelingly .     c   mon  sarge  you know how to throw your weight around .         i ain   t throwing my weight anywhere     said colon firmly .  he was lying full length on the carpet  both hands gripping it as hard as possible .     it   s not natural  just a bit of broadloom between you and certain splash .      the patrician looked down .     we   re not over water  sergeant .         i know what i meant  sir .         can we slow down a bit .     said beti .     the breeze is invading my privacy  if you get my drift .      lord vetinari sighed .     we   re not going very fast as it is .  i suspect this is a very old carpet .         there   s a frayed bit here     said beti .      shut up     said colon .      look  i can poke my finger right through           shut up .         notice how it kind of wobbles when you move .         shut up .         here  look  those palm trees down there look really small .         nobby  you   re scared of heights     said colon .     i know you   re scared of heights .         that   s sexual stereotyping .         no  it   s not .         yes  it is .  you   ll be expecting me to break my ankle a lot and scream all the time next .  it   s my job to prove to you that a woman can be as good as a man .         practically identical in your case  nobby .  you   ve caught too much sun  that   s what it is .  you are not female  nobby .      beti sniffed .     that   s just the sort of sexist remark i   d expect from you .         well  you   re not .         it   s the principle of the thing .         well  at least we now have transport     said lord vetinari  his tone suggesting that the show was over .     unfortunately  i had no time to find out where the army is .         ah .  i can help you there  sir .     colon tried to salute  and then made a grab for the carpet again .     i found out by cunning  sir .         really .         yessir .  it   s at a place called   er   en al sams la laisa  sir .      the carpet drifted onward for a moment  in silence .         the place where the sun shineth not    .     said the patrician .   there was more silence .  colon was trying not to look at anyone .      is there a somewhere called gebra .     said nobby  sulkily .      yes  be   corporal .  there is .         they   ve gone there .  of course  you   ve only got a woman   s word for it .         well done  corporal .  we shall head up the coast .      lord vetinari relaxed .  in a busy and complex life he   d never met people quite like nobby and colon .  they talked all the time yet there was something almost   restful about them .   he watched the dusty horizon carefully as the ancient carpet curved around .  under his arm was the metal cylinder leonard had made for him .   drastic times required drastic measures .      sir .     said colon  his voice muffled by the carpet .      yes  sergeant .         i   ve got to know   how did you   you know   get the donkey down .         persuasion  sergeant .         what .  just talking .         yes  sergeant .  persuasion .  and  admittedly  a sharp stick .         ah .  i knew           the trick of getting donkeys down from minarets     said the patrician  as the desert unwound below them     is always to find that part of the donkey which seriously wishes to get down .         the wind had settled .  the bird up on the cliffs had shut down for the night .  all vimes could hear was the sizzle of the little desert creatures .   then ahmed   s voice said     i am genuinely impressed  sir samuel .      vimes took a deep breath .     you know  you really fooled me     he said .        may your loins be full of fruit .     that was a good one .  i really thought you were just       he stopped .  but ahmed continued         just another camel driver with a towel on his head .  oh  dear .  and you   d been doing so well up to now  sir samuel .  the prince was very impressed .         oh  come on .  you were all but making suggestive comments about melons .  what was i supposed to think .         don   t fret  sir samuel .  i consider it all a compliment .  you can turn around .  i wouldn   t dream of harming you unless you do something   foolish .      vimes turned .  he could just make out a shape in the afterglow .      you were admiring this place     said ahmed .     tacticus   s men had it built when he tried to conquer klatch .  it   s not really a city by today   s standards  of course .  it was really just making a point .     here we are and here we stay     as it were .  and then the wind changed .         you murdered snowy slopes  didn   t you .         the term is executed .  i can show you the confession he signed beforehand .         of his own free will .         more or less .         what .         let us say  i pointed out to him the alternatives to signing the confession .  i was kind enough to leave you the pad .  after all  i wanted to keep your interest .  and don   t look like that  sir samuel .  i need you .         how can you tell how i look .         i can guess .  the assassins    guild had a contract on him in any case .  and by a happy chance i am a guild member .         you .     vimes tried to bite down on the word .  and then  why not him .  kids got sent a thousand miles to be taught in the assassins    guild school        oh  yes .  the best years of my life  they tell me .  i was in viper house .  up school .  up school .  right up school .     he sighed like a prince and spat like a camel driver .     if i shut my eyes i can still recall the taste of that peculiar custard we used to get on mondays .  dear me  how it all comes back   i remember every soggy street .  does mr .  dibbler still sell his horrible sausages inna bun in treacle mine road .         yes .         still the same old dibbler  eh .         still the same sausages .         once tasted  never forgotten .         true .         no  don   t move too quickly  sir samuel .  otherwise i   m afraid i shall be cutting your own throat .  you don   t trust me  and i don   t trust you .         why did you drag me here .         drag you .  i had to sabotage my own ship so you wouldn   t lose me .         yes  but   you   knew how i   d react .     vimes   s heart began to sink .  everyone knew how sam vimes would react        yes .  would you like a cigarette  sir samuel .         i thought you sucked those damn cloves .         in ankh morpork  yes .  always be a little bit foreign wherever you are  because everyone knows foreigners are a little bit stupid .  besides  these are rather good .         fresh from the desert .         hah .  yes  everyone knows klatchian cigarettes are made from camel dung .     a match flared  and for a moment vimes caught a glimpse of the hooked nose as ahmed lit the cigarette for him .     that is one area where  i regret to say  prejudice has some evidence on its side .  no  these are all the way from sumtri .  an island where  it is said  the women have no souls .  personally  i doubt it .      vimes could make out a hand  holding the packet .  just for a moment he wondered if he could grab and        how is your luck .     said ahmed .      running out  i suspect .         yes .  a man should know the length of his luck .  shall i tell you how i know you are a good man  sir samuel .     in the light of the rising moon vimes saw ahmed produce a cigarette holder  insert one  and light up almost fastidiously .      do tell .         after the attempt on the prince   s life i suspected everyone .  but you suspected only your own people .  you couldn   t bring yourself to think the klatchians might have done it .  because that   d line you up with the likes of sergeant colon and all the rest of the klatchian cigarettes are made of camel dung brigade .         whose policeman are you .         i draw my pay  let us say  as the wali of prince cadram .         i shouldn   t think he   s very happy with you right now  then .  you were supposed to be guarding his brother  weren   t you .     so was i  vimes thought .  but what the hell        yes .  and we thought the same way  sir samuel .  you thought it was your people  i thought it was mine .  the difference is  i was right .  khufurah   s death was plotted in klatch .         oh  really .  that   s what they wanted the watch to think           no  sir samuel .  the important thing is what someone wanted you to think .         really .  well  you   ve got that wrong .  all the stuff with the glass and the sand on the floor  i saw through   that   straight   away        his voice faded into silence .   after a while ahmed said  almost sympathetically     yes  you did .         damn .         oh  in some ways you were right .  ossie was paid in dollars  originally .  and then  later on  someone broke in  making sure they dumped most of the glass outside  and swapped the money .  and distributed the sand .  i must say that i thought the sand was going a bit too far  too .  no one would be that stupid .  but they wanted to make sure it looked like a bungled attempt .         who was it .     said vimes .      oh  a small time thief .  bob bob hardyoyo .  he didn   t even know why he was doing it  except that someone was willing to pay him .  i commend your city  commander .  for enough money  you can find someone to do anything .         someone must have paid him .         a man he met in a pub .      vimes nodded glumly .  it was amazing how many people were prepared to do business with a man they   d met in a pub .      i can believe that     he said .      you see  if even the redoubtable commander vimes  who is known even to some senior klatchian politicians as an unbendingly honest and thorough man  if somewhat lacking in intelligence   if even he protested that it was done by his own people   well  the world is watching .  the world would soon find out .  starting a war over a rock .  well   that sort of thing makes countries uneasy .  they   ve all got rocks off their coast .  but starting a war because some foreign dog had killed a man on a mission of peace   that  i think  the world would understand .         lacking in intelligence .     said vimes .      oh  don   t be too depressed  commander .  that business with the fire at the embassy .  that was sheer bravery .         it was bloody terror .         well  the dividing line is narrow .  that was one thing i hadn   t expected .      in the rolling  clicking snooker table of vimes   s mind the black ball hit a pocket .      you had expected the fire  then .         the building should have been almost empty        vimes moved .  ahmed was lifted off his feet and slammed against a pillar  with both of vimes   s hands around his neck .      that woman was trapped in there .         it   was   necessary .     said ahmed hoarsely .     there   had   to be a   diversion .  his   life was   in danger  i had to get him out .  i did   not know   about the   woman until too late   i give you my word        through the red veil of anger vimes became aware of a prickle in the region of his stomach .  he glanced down at the knife that had appeared magically in the other man   s hand .      listen to me       hissed ahmed .     prince cadram ordered his brother   s death   what better way to demonstrate the   perfidy of the sausage eaters   killing a peace maker           his own brother .  you expect me to believe that .         messages were sent to   the embassy   in code           to the old ambassador .  i don   t believe that .      ahmed stood quite still for a moment .      no  you really don   t  do you .     he said .     be generous  sir samuel .  truly treat all men equally .  allow klatchians the right to be scheming bastards  hmm .  in fact the ambassador is just a pompous idiot .  ankh morpork has no monopoly on them .  but his deputy sees the messages first .  he is   a young man of ambition        vimes relaxed his grip .     him .  i thought he was shifty as soon as i saw him .         i suspect that you thought he was klatchian as soon as you saw him  but i take your point .         and you could read this code  could you .         oh  come now .  don   t you read vetinari   s paperwork upside down when you   re standing in front of his desk .  besides  i am prince cadram   s policeman           so he   s your boss  right .         who is your boss  sir samuel .  when push comes to shove .      the two men stood locked together .  ahmed   s breath wheezed .   vimes stood back .     these messages   you   ve got them .         oh  yes .  with his seal on them .     ahmed rubbed his neck .      good grief .  the originals .  i   d have thought they   d be under lock and key .         they were .  in the embassy .  but in the fire many hands were needed to carry important documents to safety .  it was a very   useful fire .         a death warrant for his own brother   well  you can   t argue against that in court           what court .  the king is the law .     ahmed sat down .     we are not like you .  you kill kings .         the word is    execute .     and we only did it once  and that was a long time ago     said vimes .     is that why you brought me here .  why all this drama .  you could have come to see me in ankh morpork .         you are a suspicious man  commander .  would you have believed me .  besides  i had to get prince khufurah out of there  before he  ahah     died of his wounds .            where   s the prince now .         close .  and safe .  he is safer in the desert than he would ever be in ankh morpork  i can assure you .         and well .         getting better .  he is being looked after by an old lady whom i trust .         your mother .         ye gods  no .  my mother is a d   reg .  she   d be terribly offended if i trusted her .  she   d say she hadn   t brought me up right .      he saw vimes   s expression this time .     you think i am an educated barbarian .         let   s just say i   d have given snowy slopes a running start .         really .  look around you  sir samuel .  your   beat   is a city you can walk across in half an hour .  mine is two million square miles of desert and mountain .  my companions are a sword and a camel and  frankly  neither are good conversationalists  believe me .  oh  the towns and cities have their guards  of a sort .  they are uncomplicated thinkers .  but it is my job to go into the waste places and chase bandits and murderers  five hundred miles from anyone who would be on my side  so i must inspire dread and strike the first blow because i will not have a chance to strike a second one .  i am an honest man of a sort  i think .  i survive .  i survived seven years in an ankh morpork public school patronized by the sons of gentlemen .  compared to that  life among the d   regs holds no terrors  i assure you .  and i administer justice swiftly and inexpensively .         i heard about how you got your name        ahmed shrugged .     the man had poisoned the water .  the only well for twenty miles .  that killed five men  seven women  thirteen children and thirty one camels .  and some of them were very valuable camels  mark you .  i had evidence from the man who sold him the poison and a trustworthy witness who had seen him near the well on the fateful night .  once i had testimony from his servant  why wait even an hour .         sometimes we have trials     said vimes brightly .      yes .  your lord vetinari decides .  well  five hundred miles from anywhere the law is me .     ahmed waved a hand .     oh  no doubt the man would suggest there were mitigating circumstances  that he had an unhappy childhood or was driven by compulsive well poisoning disorder .  but i have a compulsion to behead cowardly murderers .      vimes gave up .  the man had a point .  the man had a whole sword .      different strokes for different folks     he said .      i find the one at shoulder height generally suffices     said ahmed .     don   t grimace  it was a joke .  i knew the prince was plotting and i thought  this is not right .  had he killed some ankh morpork lord  that would just be politics .  but this   i thought  why do i chase stupid people into the mountains when i am part of a big crime .  the prince wants to unite the whole of klatch .  personally  i like the little tribes and countries  even their little wars .  but i don   t mind if they fight ankh morpork because they want to  or because of your horrible personal habits  or your unthinking arrogance   there   s a lot of reasons for fighting ankh morpork .  a lie isn   t one of them .         i know what you mean     said vimes .      but what can i do alone .  arrest my prince .  i am his policeman  as you are vetinari   s .         no .  i   m an officer of the law .         all i know is  there must be a policeman  even for kings .      vimes looked pensively at the moonlit desert .   somewhere out there was the ankh morpork army  what there was of it .  and somewhere waiting was the klatchian army .  and thousands of men who might have quite liked one another had they met socially would thunder toward one another and start killing  and after that first rush you had all the excuses you needed to do it again and again     he remembered listening  when he was a kid  to old men in his street talking about war .  there hadn   t been many wars in his time .  the city states of the sto plains mainly tried to bankrupt one another  or the assassins    guild sorted everything out on a one to one basis .  most of the time people just bickered  and while that was pretty annoying it was a lot better than having a sword stuck in your liver .   what he remembered most  among the descriptions of puddles filled with blood and the flying limbs  was the time one old man said     an    if your foot caught in something  it was always best not to look and see what it was  if    n you wanted to hold on to your dinner .     he   d never explained what he meant .  the other old men seemed to know .  anyway  nothing could have been worse than the explanations vimes thought of for himself .  and he remembered that the three old men who spent most of their days sitting on a bench in the sun had  between them  five arms  five eyes  four and a half legs and two and three quarter faces .  and seventeen ears  crazy winston would bring out his collection for a good boy who looked suitably frightened  .      he wants to start a war       vimes had to open his mouth because otherwise there was no room to get his head around such a crazy idea .  this man who everyone said was honest  noble and good wanted a war .      oh  certainly     said ahmed .     nothing unites people like a good war .      how could you deal with someone who thought like that .  vimes asked himself .  a mere murderer  well  you had a whole range of options .  he could deal with a mere murderer .  you had criminals and you had policemen  and there was a sort of see saw there which balanced out in some strange way .  but if you took a man who   d sit down and decide to start a war  what in the name of seven hells could you balance him with .  you   d need a policeman the size of a country .   you couldn   t blame the soldiers .  they   d just joined up to be pointed in the right direction .   something clicked against the fallen pillar .  vimes glanced down and pulled the baton out of his pocket .  it glinted in the moonlight .   what damn good was something like this .  all it really meant was that he was allowed to chase the little criminals  who did the little crimes .  there was nothing he could do about the crimes that were so big you couldn   t even see them .  you lived in them .  so   safer to stick to the little crimes  sam vimes .      all right  my sons .  let    em have it right up the jography .      figures bounded over the fallen pillars .   there was a metallic whirr as ahmed unsheathed his sword .   vimes saw a halberd coming toward him   an ankh morpork halberd .    and street reaction took over .  he didn   t waste time sneering at someone stupid enough to use a pike on a foot soldier .  he dodged the blade  caught the shaft  and pulled it so hard that its owner stumbled right into his upswinging boot .   then he jerked away  struggling to untangle his sword from the unfamiliar robes .  he ducked another shadowy figure   s wild slice and managed to make an elbow connect with something painful .   as he rose he looked into the face of a man with an upraised sword        there was a silken sound        and the man swayed backward  his head looking surprised as it fell away from the body .   vimes dragged his headdress off .      i   m from ankh morpork  you stupid sods .      a huge figure sprang in front of him  a sword in each hand .      i   ll cut yer tonker off   f yer yer greasy   oh  is that you  sir samuel .         huh .  willikins .         indeed  sir .     the butler straightened up .      willikins .         do excuse me one moment  sir knock it off you motherlovin sons of bitches i had no apprehension of your presence  sir        this one   s fightin    back  sarge .      ahmed had his back to a pillar .  a man already lay at his feet .  three others were trying to get close enough to the wali while staying away from the whirling wall he was creating with his sword .      ahmed .  these are on our side .     vimes yelled .      oh  really .  pardon me .      ahmed lowered his sword and removed the cigarette holder from his mouth .  he nodded at one of the soldiers who had been trying to attack him and said     good morning to you .            ere  are you one of ours  too .         no  i   m one of           he   s with me     vimes snapped .     how come you   re here  willikins .  sergeant willikins  i see .         we were on patrol  sir  and were attacked by some klatchian gentlemen .  after the ensuing unpleasantness              you should   ve seen    im  sir .     e bit one bastard   s nose right orf .     a soldier supplied .      it is true that i endeavored to uphold the good name of ankh morpork  sir .  anyway  after we              and one bloke  sarge  stabbed    im right in the           please  private bourke  i am apprising sir samuel of events     said willikins .      sarge ort to get a medal  sir .         those few of us who survived tried to get back  sir  but we had to conceal ourselves from other patrols and were just considering lying up until dawn in this edifice when we espied you and this gentleman here .      ahmed was watching him with his mouth open .      how many were in this klatchian patrol  sergeant .     he said .      nineteen men  sir .         that   s a very precise count  in this light .         i was able to enumerate them subsequently  sir .         you mean they were all killed .         yes  sir     said willikins calmly .     however  we ourselves lost five men  sir .  not including privates hobbley and webb  sir  who regrettably seem to have passed away as a result of this unfortunate misunderstanding .  with your permission  sir  i will remove them .         poor devils     said vimes  aware that it was not enough but that nothing else would be  either .      the fortunes of war  sir .  private hobbley  ginger to his friends  was nineteen and lived in ettercap street  where until recently he made bootlaces .     willikins took the dead man   s arms and pulled .     he was courting a young lady called grace  a picture of whom he was kind enough to show me last night .  a maid at lady venturi   s  i was given to understand .  if you would be good enough to pass me his head  sir  i will get on with things smudger who told you to sit down get on yore feet right now get out yore shovel take off yore helmet show some respect get diggingha .      a cloud of smoke rolled past vimes   s ear .      i know what you are thinking     said ahmed .     but this is war  sir samuel .  wake up and smell the blood .         but   one minute they   re alive           your friend here knows how it works .  you don   t .         he   s a butler .         so .  it   s kill or be killed  even for butlers .  you   re not a natural warrior  sir samuel .      vimes thrust the baton in his face .      i   m not a natural killer .  see this .  see what it says .  i   m supposed to keep the peace  i am .  if i kill people to do it  i   m reading the wrong manual .      willikins appeared silently  hefting the other corpse .     i was not privileged to know much about this young man     he said  as he carried him behind a rock .     we called him spider  sir     he went on  straightening up .     he played the harmonica rather badly and spoke longingly of home .  will you be taking tea  sir .  private smith is having a brew up .  er       the butler coughed politely .      yes  willikins .         i hardly like to broach the subject  sir           broach it  man .         do you have such a thing as a biscuit about you  sir .  i hesitate to provide tea without biscuits  but we have not eaten for two days .         but you were on patrol .         forage party  sir .     willikins looked embarrassed .   vimes was bewildered .     you mean rust didn   t even wait to take on food .         oh  yes  sir .  but as it transpired           we knew there was somethin    wrong when the mutton barrels started to explode     muttered private bourke .     the biscuits was pretty lively  too .  turned out bloody rust   d bought a lot of stuff even a rag   ead wouldn   t eat           and we eat anything     said    hour ahmed solemnly .      private bourke you orrible man speakin of yore commandin officer like that you will be on a charge i apologize  sir  but we are feeling a little faint .         long time between noses  eh .     said    hour ahmed .      ahahaha  sir     said willikins .   vimes sighed .     willikins   when you   ve finished  i want you and your men to come with me .         very good  sir .      vimes nodded at ahmed .      and you  too     he said .     push has come to shove .         the hot wind flapped the banners .  the sunlight sparkled off the spears .  lord rust surveyed his army and found that it was good .  but small .   he leaned toward his adjutant .      let us not forget  though  that even general tacticus was outnumbered ten to one when he took the pass of al ibi     he said .      yes  sir .  although i believe his men were all mounted on elephants  sir     said lieutenant hornett .     and had been well provisioned     he added meaningfully .      possibly  possibly .  but then lord pinwoe   s cavalry once charged the full might of the pseudopolitan army and are renowned in song and story .         but they were all killed  sir .         yes  yes  but it was a famous charge  nevertheless .  and every child knows  do they not  the story of the mere one hundred ephebians who defeated the entire tsortean army .  a total victory  hey .  hey .         yes  sir     said the adjutant glumly .      oh  you admit it .         yes  sir .  of course  some commentators believe the earthquake helped .         at least you will admit that the seven heroes of hergen beat the big footed people although outnumbered by a hundred to one .         yes  sir .  that was a nursery story  sir .  it never really happened .         are you calling my nurse a liar  boy .         no  sir     said lieutenant hornett hurriedly .      then you   ll concede that baron mimbledrone single handedly beat the armies of the plum pudding country and ate their sultana .         i envy him  sir .     the lieutenant looked at the lines again .  the men were very hungry  although rust would probably have called them sleek .  things would have been even worse if it hadn   t been for the fortuitous shower of boiled lobsters on the way over .     er   you don   t think  sir  since we have a little time in hand  we should look to the disposition of the men  sir .         they look well disposed to me .  plucky men  eager to be at the fray .         yes  sir .  i meant   more   well   positioned  sir .         nothing wrong with    em  man .  beautifully lined up .  hey .  a wall of steel poised to thrust at the black heart of the klatchian aggressor .         yes  sir .  but   and i realize this is a remote chance  sir   it might be that while we   re thrusting at the heart of the klatchian aggressor              black heart       rust corrected him .         black heart of the klatchian aggressor  sir  the arms of the klatchian aggressor  those companies there and there  sir  will sweep around in the classic pincer movement .         the thrusting wall of steel served us magnificently in the second war with quirm .         we lost that one  sir .         but it was a damn close run thing .         we still lost  sir .         what did you do as a civilian  lieutenant .         i was a surveyor  sir  and i can read klatchian .  that   s why you made me an officer .         so you don   t know how to fight .         only how to count  sir .         pah .  show a little courage  man .  although i   ll wager you won   t need to .  no stomach for a battle  johnny klatchian .  once he tastes our steel  he   ll be off .         i certainly hear what you say  sir     said the adjutant  who had been surveying the klatchian lines and had formed his own opinion about the matter .   his opinion was this  the main force of the klatchian army had  in recent years  been fighting everyone .  that suggested  to his uncomplicated mind  that by now the surviving soldiers were the ones who were in the habit of being alive at the end of battles .  and were also very experienced at facing all kinds of enemies .  the stupid ones were dead .   the current ankh morpork army  on the other hand  had never faced an enemy at all  although day to day experience of living in the city might count for something there  at least in the rougher areas .  he believed  along with general tacticus  that courage  bravery and the indomitable human spirit were fine things which nevertheless tended to take second place to the combination of courage  bravery  the indomitable human spirit and a six to one superiority of numbers .   it had all sounded straightforward in ankh morpork  he thought .  we were going to sail into klatch and be in al khali by teatime  drinking sherbet with pliant young women in the rhoxi .  the klatchians would take one look at our weapons and run away .  well  the klatchians had taken a good look this morning .  so far they hadn   t run .  they appeared to be sniggering a lot .      vimes rolled his eyes .  it worked   but how did it work .   he   d heard plenty of good speakers  and captain carrot was not among them .  he hesitated  lost the thread  repeated himself and in general made a mess of the whole thing .   and yet     and yet     he watched the faces that were watching carrot .  there were the d   regs  and some of the klatchians who had stayed behind  and willikins and his reduced company .  they were listening .   it was a kind of magic .  he told people they were good chaps  and they knew they weren   t good chaps  but the way he told it made them believe it for a while .  here was someone who thought you were a noble and worthy person  and somehow it would be unthinkable to disappoint them .  it was a mirror of a speech  reflecting back to you what you wanted to hear .  and he meant it all .   even so  men occasionally glanced up at vimes and ahmed and he could see them thinking  in their separate ways     it must be all right if they   re in on it .     that  he was ashamed to realize  was one of the advantages of armies .  people looked to other people for orders .      this is a trick .     said ahmed .      no .  he doesn   t know any tricks like that     said angua .     he really doesn   t .  uh oh        there was a scuffle in the ranks .   carrot strode forward and reached down  bringing up private bourke and a d   reg  each man held by the collar in one big fist .      what   s going on  you two .         he called me the brother of a pig  sir .         liar .  you called me a greasy dishcloth head .      carrot shook his head .     and you were both doing so well  too     he said sadly .     there really is no call for this .  now i want you  hashel  and you  vincent  to shake hands  right .  and apologize  yes .  we   ve all had a rather trying time  but i know you   re both fine fellows underneath it all        vimes heard ahmed murmur .     oh  well  now it   s all over              so if you   ll just shake hands we   ll say no more about it .      vimes glanced at    hour ahmed .  the man wearing a sort of waxen grin .   the two scufflers very gingerly touched hands  as if they were expecting a spark to leap the gap .      and now you  vincent  apologize to mr .  hashel        there was a reluctant       ry .         and we   re sorry for what .     carrot prompted .         sorry for calling him a greasy dishcloth head           well said .  and you  hashel  apologize to private bourke .      the d   reg   s eyes scurried around their sockets  looking to find a way out that would allow their body to come too .  then he gave up .         ry           for    .            ry for calling him a brother of a pig        carrot lowered both men .      good .  i   m sure you   ll get along splendidly once you get to know each other           i didn   t just see that  did i .     said ahmed .     i didn   t just see him talk like a little schoolteacher to hashel who  i happen to know  once hit a man so hard his nose ended up in one of his ears .         yes  you did     said angua .     and now watch them .      when the rest of the men turned their attention back to carrot the scufflers looked at one another  as unfortunates who had both been through the same baptism of fiery embarrassment .   private bourke gingerly offered hashel a cigarette .      it only works around him     said angua .     but it does work .      let it go on working  vimes prayed .   carrot walked over to a kneeling camel and climbed into the saddle .      that   s    evil brother in law of a jackal        said ahmed .     jabbar   s camel .  it bites everyone who tries to ride it .         yes  but this is carrot .         it even bites jabbar .         and you notice how he knew how to get on a camel .     said vimes .     how he wears the robes .  he   s fitting in .  the boy was raised in a dwarf mine .  it took him about a month to know my own damn city better than i do .      the camel rose .  now the flag  vimes thought  give him the flag .  when you go to war  there   s got to be a flag .   on cue  constable shoe passed up the spear with the tightly rolled cloth around it .  the constable looked proud .  he   d stitched the thing in conditions of great secrecy half an hour before .  one thing about a zombie  you always knew someone who had a needle and thread .   but don   t unfurl it  vimes thought .  don   t let them see it .  it   s enough for them to know they   re marching under a flag .   carrot brandished the spear .      and i promise you this     he shouted     if we succeed  no one will remember .  and if we fail  no one will forget .      probably one of the worst rallying cries  vimes thought  since general pidley   s famous    let   s all get our throats cut  boys .     but it got a huge cheer .  and once again he speculated that there was magic going on at some bone deep level .  people followed carrot out of curiosity .      all right  you   ve got an army  i suppose     said ahmed .     and now .         i   m a policeman .  so are you .  there   s going to be a crime .  saddle up  ahmed .      ahmed salaamed .     i am happy to be led by a white officer  offendi .         i didn   t mean           have you ever ridden a camel before  sir samuel .         no .         ah .     ahmed smiled faintly .     then just give it a prod to get started .  and when you want to stop  hit it very hard with the stick and shout    huthuthut .            you hit it with a stick to make it stop .         is there any other way .     said    hour ahmed .   his camel looked at vimes  and then spat in his eye .      prince cadram and his generals surveyed the distant enemy  from horseback .  the various klatchian armies were drawn up in front of gebra .  compared to them  the ankh morpork regiments looked like a group of tourists who had missed their coach .      is that all .     he said .      yes  sire     said general ashal .     but  you see  they believe that fortune favors the brave .         that is a reason to field such a contemptible little army .         ah  sire  but they believe that we will turn and run as soon as we taste some cold steel .      the prince looked back at the distant banners .     why .         i couldn   t say  sire .  it appears to be an item of faith .         strange .     the prince nodded to one of his bodyguards .     fetch me some cold steel .      after some hurried discussion a sword was handed up very gingerly  handle first .  the prince peered at it  and then licked it with theatrical care .  the watching soldiers laughed .      no     he said at last .     no  i have to say that i don   t feel the least apprehensive .  is this as cold as steel gets .         lord rust was probably being metaphorical  sire .         ah .  he is the sort who would be .  well  let us go forward and meet him .  we must be civilized  after all .      he urged his horse forward .  the generals fell in behind him .   the prince leaned down toward general ashal again .      and why are we going out to meet him before battle commences .         it   s a   it   s a goodwill gesture  sire .  warriors honoring one another .         but the man   s a complete incompetent .         indeed  sire .         and we   re about to set thousands of our countrymen against one another  aren   t we .         indeed  sire .         so what does the maniac want to do .  tell me there   s no hard feelings .         broadly speaking  sire   yes .  i understand the motto of his old school was    it matters not that you won or lost  but that you took part .         the prince   s lips moved as he tried this out once or twice .  finally he said     and  knowing this  people still take orders from him .         it would seem so  sire .      prince cadram shook his head .  we can learn from ankh morpork  his father had said .  sometimes we can learn what not to do .  and so he   d set out to learn .   first he   d learned that ankh morpork had once ruled quite a slice of klatch .  he   d visited the ruins of one of its colonies .  and so he   d found out the name of the man who had been audacious enough to do this  and had got agents in ankh morpork to find out as much about him as possible .   general tacticus  he   d been called .  and prince cadram had read a lot and remembered everything  and    tactics    had been very  very useful in the widening of the empire .  of course  this had its own drawbacks .  you had a border  and across the border came bandits .  so you sent a force to quell the bandits  and in order to stamp them out you had to take over their country  and soon you had another restless little vassal state to rule .  and now that had a border  over which came  sure as sunrise  a fresh lot of raiders .  so your new tax paying subjects were demanding protection from their brother raiders  neglecting to pay their taxes  and doing a little light banditry on the side .  and so once again you stretched your forces  whether you wanted to or not     he sighed .  for the serious empire builder there was no such thing as a final frontier .  there was only another problem .  if only people would understand     nor was there such a thing as a game of war .  general tacticus knew that .  learn about your opposite number  yes  and respect his abilities if he had them  certainly .  but never pretend that afterward you were going to meet up for a drink and charge by charge replay .      he could well be insane  sire     the general went on .      oh  good .         however  i   m told that he recently referred to klatchians as the finest soldiers in the world  sire .         really .         he added    when led by white officers     sire .         oh .         and we are offering him breakfast  sire .  it would be most impolite of him to refuse .         what a good idea .  have we got an adequate supply of sheeps    eyes .         i took the liberty of telling the cooks to save some up for this very eventuality  sire .         then we must see he gets them .  after all  he will be our honored guest .  well  let us do this thing properly .  please try to look as if you hate the taste of cold steel .      the klatchians had set up an open sided tent on the sand between the two armies .  in the welcome shade a low table had been laid .  lord rust and his company were already waiting  and had been for more than half an hour .   they stood up and bowed awkwardly as prince cadram entered .  around the tent the klatchian and ankh morpork honor guards eyed one another suspiciously  every man trying to get the drop on the others .      tell me   do any of you gentleman speak klatchian .     said prince cadram  after the lengthy introductions .   lord rust   s grin stayed fixed .     hornett .     he hissed .      i   m not quite certain what he said  sir     said the lieutenant nervously .      i thought you knew klatchian .         i can read it  sir .  that   s not the same           oh  don   t worry     said the prince .     as we say in klatch  this clown   s in charge of an army .      around the tent  the klatchian generals suddenly went poker faced .      hornett .         er   something about   to own  to control   er        cadram smiled at lord rust .     i   m not entirely familiar with this custom     he said .     you often meet your enemies before battle .         it is considered honorable     said lord rust .     i believe that on the night before the famous battle of pseudopolis officers from both sides attended a ball at lady selachii   s  for example .      the prince glanced questioningly at general ashal  who nodded .      really .  obviously we have so much to learn .  as the poet mosheda says  i can   t believe this man .         ah  yes     said lord rust .     klatchian is a very poetic language .         excuse me  sir     said lieutenant hornett .      what is it  man .         there   s   er   something going on        there was a column of dust in the distance .  something was approaching fast .      one moment     said general ashal .   he came back from his saddle with an ornate metal tube  covered in the curly klatchian script .  he squinted into one end and pointed the other at the cloud .      mounted men     he said .     camels and horses .         that   s a make things bigger device  isn   t it .     said lord rust .     my word  you are up to date .  they were invented only last year .         i didn   t buy this  my lord .  i inherited it from my grandfather       the general looked through the eyepiece again .     about forty men  i   d say .         dear me     murmured prince cadram .     reinforcements  lord rust .         they   ve   the rider in the lead is holding a   a banner  i think  still rolled up           certainly not  sire .     said lord rust .  behind him  lord selachii rolled his eyes .         ah  now he   s unfurling it   it   s   a white flag  sire .         someone wishes to surrender .      the general lowered his telescope .     it doesn   t   i don   t   they seem to be in a great hurry to do so  sire .         send a squad to apprehend them     said prince cadram .      we will do so  too     added lord rust hurriedly  nodding to the lieutenant .      ah  a joint effort     said the prince .   a few seconds later groups of men detached themselves from each army and rode out on an interception course .   everyone saw the sudden glints of sunlight from the approaching cloud .  weapons had been drawn .      fighting under a flag of surrender .  that   s   immoral .     said lord rust .      novel  certainly     said the prince .   the three companies would have met  had it not been that even experts find it hard to judge how much ground a running camel can cover .  by the time both commanders realized they should start to turn  they should have already been turning .      it seems your people misjudged things  sire     said lord rust .      i knew i should have had them led by white officers     said the prince .     but   oh dear  it seems your men have been equally unlucky        he stopped .  some confusion had resulted .  the foray parties had their instructions  but no one had told them what to do if they ran into the other foray party .  and it was composed  after all  of men they were about to fight  and everyone knew they were treacherous greasy towel heads or perfidious untrustworthy sausage eating madmen .  and this was a battlefield .  and everyone was frightened and  therefore  angry .  and everyone was armed .   sam vimes heard the shouting behind him but had other things on his mind at this point .  it is impossible to ride a running camel without concentrating on your liver and kidneys  in the hope that they won   t be pounded out of your body .   the thing   s legs weren   t moving right  he was sure .  nothing on normal legs could be jolting him around so much .  the horizon jerked backward and forward and up and down .   what was it ahmed had said .   vimes hit the camel hard and yelled     huthuthut .      it accelerated .  the jolts ran together  so that his body was no longer being jolted but was in effect in a permanent state of jolt .   vimes thrashed it again and tried to yell     huthuthut .     although the word came out more like    hngngngn .     in any case  the camel found some extra knees somewhere .   there was more shouting behind him .  turning his head as much as he dared  he saw several of his accompanying d   regs falling behind .  he was certain he heard carrot yell  but he couldn   t be certain because of his own screaming .      stop  you bastard .     he yelled .   the tent was coming up fast .  vimes slapped the stick down again and hauled on the reins and  clearly now judging with special camel sensitivity that this was the most embarrassing moment to stop  the camel stopped .  vimes slid forward  flung his arms round a neck that was apparently thatched with old doormats  and half fell  half dropped on to the sand .   other camels were thudding to a halt around him .  carrot grabbed his arm .      are you all right  sir .  that was amazing .  you really impressed the d   regs  screaming defiance like that .  and you were still shouting for the camel to go faster when it was already galloping .         gngn .      the guards around the tent were hesitating  but that wouldn   t last long .   the wind caught the white flag on carrot   s lance  making it snap .      sir  this is all right  isn   t it .  i mean  usually a white flag           might as well show what we   re fighting for  eh .         i suppose so  sir .      d   regs had surrounded the tent .  the air was full of dust and screams .      what happened back there .         a bit of a fracas  sir .  our       carrot hesitated and then corrected himself .     that is  ankh morpork soldiers and klatchians have started fighting  sir .  and the d   regs are fighting both of them .         what  before the battle   s officially declared .  can   t you get disqualified for that .      vimes looked back at the guards and pointed to the flag .      you know what this flag is .     he said .     well  i want you to           aren   t you mr .  vimes .     said one of the morpor kians .     and that   s captain carrot  isn   t it .         oh  hello  mr .  smallblank     said carrot .     feeding you well  are they .         yessir .      vimes rolled his eyes .  that was carrot again  knowing everyone .  and the man had called him    sir           we just need to go through     said carrot .     we won   t be a minute .         well  sir  these tow       smallplank hesitated .  certain words didn   t come so easily when the subjects were standing very close to you  looking very big and tooled up .     these klatchians are on guard  too  you see        a stream of blue smoke was blown past vimes   s ear .      good morning  gentlemen     said    hour ahmed .  he had a d   reg crossbow in each hand .     you will note that the soldiers behind me are also well armed .  good .  my name is    hour ahmed .  i will shoot the last man to drop his weapons .  you have my word on it .      the morporkians looked puzzled .  the klatchians began to whisper urgently .      put    em down  boys     said vimes .   the morporkians threw their swords down hurriedly .  the klatchians dropped theirs very shortly afterward .      a tie between the gentleman on the left and the tall one with the squint     said    hour ahmed  raising both crossbows .      hey     said vimes     you can   t        the bows twanged .  the men dropped  yelling .      however     said ahmed  handing the bows to a d   reg behind him  who handed him another loaded one     out of deference to the sensibilities of commander vimes here  i   m settling for one in the thigh and one in the toes .  we are  after all  on a mission of peace .      he turned to vimes .     i   m sorry  sir samuel  but it   s important that people know where they stand with me .         these two don   t     said vimes .      they   ll live .      vimes moved closer to the wali .      huthuthut .     he hissed .     you told me that it meant           i thought it would prove a good example to all if you were in the lead     ahmed whispered .     the d   regs will always follow a man who is in a hurry for the fray .      lord rust stepped out into the sunlight and glared at vimes .      vimes .  what the hell are you doing .         not turning a blind eye  my lord .      vimes pushed past and into the shade .  there was prince cadram  still seated .  and there were a lot of armed men .  these  he noted almost in passing  didn   t have the look of ordinary soldiers .  they had the much tougher look of loyal bodyguards .      so     said the prince     you come in here armed  under a flag of peace .         are you prince cadram .     said vimes .      and you  too  ahmed .     said the prince  ignoring vimes .   ahmed nodded  and said nothing .   oh  not now  thought vimes .  tough as leather and vicious as a wasp  but now he   s in the presence of his king        you   re under arrest     he said .   the prince made a little sound between a cough and a laugh .      i   m what .         i am arresting you for conspiracy to murder your brother .  and there may be other charges .      the prince put his hands over his face for a moment and then pulled them down toward his chin  in the action of a tired man endeavoring to come to grips with a trying situation .      mr .     .     he began .      sir samuel vimes  ankh morpork city watch     said vimes .      well  mr .  samuel  when i raise my hand the men behind me will cut you d           i will kill the first man that moves     said ahmed .      then the second man that moves will kill you  traitor .     shouted the prince .      they   ll have to move very fast     said carrot  drawing his sword .      any volunteers to be the third man .     said vimes .     anyone .      general ashal moved  but only very gently  holding up a hand .  the bodyguards relaxed slightly .      what was that   lie you uttered about a murder .     he said .      have you gone mad  ashal .     said the prince .      oh  sire  before i can disbelieve these pernicious lies  i do need to know what they are .         vimes  you have gone insane     said rust .     you can   t arrest the commander of an army .         actually  mr .  vimes  i think we could     said carrot .     and the army  too .  i mean  i don   t see why we can   t .  we could charge them with behavior likely to cause a breach of the peace  sir .  i mean  that   s what warfare is .      vimes   s face split in a manic grin .     i like it .         but in fairness our   that is  the ankh morpork army   are also           then you   d better arrest them  too     said vimes .     arrest the lot of    em .  conspiracy to cause an affray     he started to count on his fingers     going equipped to commit a crime  obstruction  threatening behavior  loitering with intent  loitering within tent  hah  traveling for the purposes of committing a crime  malicious lingering and carrying concealed weapons .         i don   t think that one       carrot began .      i can   t see    em     said vimes .      vimes  i order you to come to your senses this minute .     roared lord rust .     have you been out in the sun .         that   s one count of offensive behavior to his lordship as well     said vimes .   the prince was still staring at vimes .      you seriously think that you can arrest an army .     he said .     perhaps you think you have a bigger army .         don   t need one     said vimes .     power at a point  that   s what tacticus says .  and here it   s the one right on the end of ahmed   s crossbow .  that wouldn   t frighten a d   reg  but you   i reckon you don   t think like them .  tell your men to stand down .  i want the order to go out right now .         even ahmed would not shoot his prince in cold blood     said prince cadram .   vimes snatched the crossbow .     i wouldn   t ask him to .     he took aim .     give that order .      the prince stared at him .      count of three .     shouted vimes .   general ashal leaned down and whispered something to the prince .  the man   s expression stiffened and he glanced back at vimes again .      that   s right     said vimes .     it runs in the family .         it would be murder .         would it .  in wartime .  i   m from ankh morpork .  aren   t i supposed to be at war with you .  can   t be murder if there   s a war on .  that   s written down somewhere .      the general leaned down and whispered .      one     said vimes .   now there was a hurried argument .      two .         myprincewishesmetosay       the general began .      all right  slow down     said vimes .      if it makes you any happier  i will send out the order     said the general .     let the messengers leave .      vimes nodded and lowered the bow .  the prince shifted uneasily .      and the ankh morpork army will stand down as well     said vimes .      but  vimes  you   re on our side       rust began .      bloody hell  i   m going to shoot someone today and it could just be you  rust     vimes snarled .      sir .     lieutenant hornett tugged at his commander   s jacket .     may i have a word .      vimes heard them whispering  and then the young man left .      all right  we are all disarmed     said rust .     we are all    under arrest .     and now  commander .         i ought to read them their rights  sir     said carrot .      what are you talking about .     said vimes .      the men out there  sir .         oh .  yeah .  right .  do it  then .      oh gods  i arrested an entire battlefield  vimes thought .  and you can   t do that .   but i   ve done it .  and we   ve only got six cells back at the yard  and we keep the coal in one of them .   you can   t do it .   was this the army that invaded your country  ma   am .  no  officer  they were taller than that     how about this one .  i   m not sure   get them to march up and down a bit     carrot   s voice could be heard outside  slightly muffled      now   can you all hear me .  you gentlemen in the back there .  anyone who can   t hear me  please raise   all right  has anyone got a megaphone .  some cardboard i could roll up .  in that case i   ll shout           what now .     said the prince .      i   m taking you back to ankh morpork           i don   t think so .  that would be an act of war .         you are making a mockery of the whole business  vimes .     said lord rust .      so long as i   m doing something right  then .     vimes nodded at ahmed .      then you can answer for your crime here  sire     he said .      in what court .     said the prince .   ahmed leaned closer to vimes .     what was your plan from here on .     he whispered .      i never thought we   d get this far .         ah .  well   it has been interesting  sir samuel .      prince cadram smiled at vimes .     would you like some coffee while you are considering your next move .     he said .  he gestured to an ornate silver pot on the table .      we   ve got proof .     vimes said .  but he could feel the world dropping away .  the point about burning your boats is that you shouldn   t be standing on them when you drop the match .      really .  fascinating .  and to whom will you show this proof  sir samuel .         we   ll have to find a court .         intriguing .  a court in ankh morpork  perhaps .  or a court here .         someone told me that the world watches     said vimes .   there was silence except for the muffled sounds of carrot  outside  and the occasional buzz of a fly .         bingeley bingeley beep       the dis organizer   s voice had lost its chirpy little edge  and sounded sleepy and bewildered .   heads turned .         seven eh em   organize defenders at river gate   seven twenty five   hand to hand fighting in peach pie street   seven forty eight eight eight   rally survivors in sator square   things to do today  build build build barricades        he was aware of surreptitious movement behind him  and then slight pressure .  ahmed was standing back to back with him .      what is that thing talking about .         search me .  sounds like it   s in a different world  doesn   t it    .      he could feel events racing toward a distant wall .  sweat filled his eyes .  he couldn   t remember when he   d last had a proper sleep .  his legs twinged .  his arms ached  pulled down by the heavy bow .         bingeley   eight oh two eh em  death of corporal littlebottombottom   eight oh three eh em   death of sergeant detritus   eight oh threethreethree eh em and seven seconds seconds   death of constable visit   eight oh three eh em and nineninenine seconds   death of death of death of           they say that in ankh morpork one of your ancestors killed a king     said the prince .     and he also came to no good end .      vimes wasn   t listening .         death of constable dorfl   eight oh three eh em and fourteenteenteen seconds        the figure in the throne seemed to take up the whole world .         death of captain carrot ironfoundersson   beep        and vimes thought  i nearly didn   t come .  i nearly stayed in ankh morpork .   he had always wondered how old stoneface had felt  that frosty morning when he picked up the axe that had no legal blessing because the king wouldn   t recognize a court even if a jury could be found  that frosty morning when he prepared to sever what people thought was a link between men and deity           beep   things to do today today today  die        the sensation flowed into his veins like fresh warm blood .  it was the feeling that you got when the law ran out  and you looked into a mocking face on the other side of it and you decided that you couldn   t go on living if you did not step over the line and do one clean thing     there was shouting outside .  he blinked away the sweat .      ah   commander vimes       said a voice somewhere back over the border .   he kept his aching gaze sighted along the bow .     yes .      a hand darted down and grabbed the arrow out of its groove .  vimes blinked .  his finger automatically squeezed the trigger .  the string slamed back with a thunk .  and the look on the prince   s face  he knew  would keep him warm on cold nights  if there were ever cold nights again .   he   d heard them all die .  but they weren   t dead .  and yet the damn thing had sounded so   accurate     lord vetinari dropped the arrow fastidiously  like a society lady who has had to handle something sticky .      well done  vimes .  i see you   ve got the donkey up the minaret .  good morning  gentlemen .     he gave the company a happy smile .     i see i am not too late .         vetinari .     said rust  seeming to wake up .     what are you doing here .  this is a battlefield           i wonder .     the patrician gave him a very brief smile of his very own .     outside there seem to be a lot of men sitting around .  many of them seem to be having what i believe is known in military parlance as a brew up .  and captain carrot is organizing a football match .         he   s what .     said vimes  lowering the bow .  suddenly the world had to be real again .  if carrot was doing something as dumb as that  things were normal .      quite a large number of fouls so far  i   m afraid .  but i wouldn   t call it a battlefield .         who   s winning .         ankh morpork  i believe .  by two hacked shins and a broken nose .      for the first time in ages vimes felt a little pang of patriotism .  everything else in life was in the privy  but when it came to gouging and kicking he knew which side he was on .      besides     vetinari went on     i believe quite a large number of people are technically under arrest .  and clearly a state of war is not  in practical fact  in being .  it is merely a state of football .  therefore  i believe  i am  shall we say   back .  excuse me  sire  but this won   t take a moment .      he held up a metal cylinder and began to unscrew the end .   for some reason vimes felt inclined to take a few steps away from it .     what   s that .         i thought this might become necessary     said vetinari .     it took some preparation  but i am certain it will work .  i hope they   re readable .  we did our best to keep the damp off them .      a thick roll of paper dropped out on to the floor .      commander  have you nothing you should be doing .     he added .     refereeing  perhaps .      vimes picked up the roll and read the first few lines .      whereas   heretofore  etc .   etc    .  city of ankh morpork   surrender .         what .     said rust and the prince together .      yes  surrender     said vetinari cheerfully .     a little piece of paper and it   s all over .  i think you   ll find it all in order .         you can   t       rust began .      you can   t       said the prince .      unconditionally .     said general ashal sharply .      yes  i think so     said vetinari .     we give up all claim to leshp in favor of klatch  we withdraw all troops from klatch and our citizens from the island  and as for reparations   shall we say a quarter of a million dollars .  plus various favorable trade arrangements  most favored nation status and so on and so on .  it   s all here .  feel free to read it at your leisure .      he passed the document over the head of the prince and into the hands of the general  who flicked through the pages .      but we haven   t got       vimes began .  perhaps i did get killed  he thought .  i   m on the other side  or someone hit me very hard on the head and this is all some kind of mirage        it   s a forgery .     snapped the prince .     it   s a trick .         well  sire  this man certainly does appear to be lord vetinari and these do seem to be the official seals of ankh morpork     said the general .        whereas   whereby   without prejudice   ratification within four days   way of trade      yes  this does  i have to say  look genuine .         i won   t accept it .         i see  sire .  it does  though  appear to cover all the points which in your speech last week you           i certainly wouldn   t accept it .     rust shouted .  he waved a finger under vetinari   s nose .     you   ll be banished for this .      but we haven   t got that money  vimes repeated  but this time to himself .  we   re a very rich city  but we haven   t got any actual money .  the wealth of ankh morpork is in its people  we   re told .  and you couldn   t remove it with big pliers .   he felt the wind change .   and vetinari watching him .   and there was something about general ashal .  a certain hunger        i agree with rust     he said .     this is dragging the good name of ankh morpork in the mud .     to his mild surprise he managed to say that without smiling .      we lose nothing  sire     general ashal insisted .     they withdraw from klatch and leshp           damned if we will .     screamed lord rust .      right .  and have everyone know we   ve been beaten .     said vimes .     outwitted .      he looked at the prince  whose gaze was hunting from man to man  but occasionally staring at nothing  as if he was watching some inner vision .      a quarter of a million is not enough     the prince said .   lord vetinari shrugged .     we can discuss it .         there is much that i need to buy .         things of a sharp metallic nature  no doubt     said vetinari .     of course  if we are talking about goods rather than money  there is room for   flexibility        and now we   re going to arm him  too  vimes thought .      you   ll be out of the city in a week .     rust screamed .   vimes thought the general smiled briefly .  ankh morpork without vetinari   ruled by people like rust .  his future was looking bright indeed .      the surrender will need to be ratified and formally witnessed  however     said ashal .      may i suggest ankh morpork .     said lord vetinari .      no .  on neutral territory  of course     said the general .      but where  between ankh morpork and klatch  is there such a thing .     said vetinari .      i suppose   there is leshp     said the general thoughtfully .      what a good idea     said the patrician .     that would not have occurred to me .         the place is ours anyway .     snapped the prince .      will be  sire .  will be     said the general soothingly .     we will take possession .  quite legally .  while the world watches .         and that   s it .  what about my arrest .     said vimes .     i   m not going to           these are matters of state     said vetinari .     and there are   diplomatic considerations .  i am afraid the good ordering of international affairs cannot hinge upon your concerns over the doings of one man .      once again vimes felt that the words he was hearing were not the words that were being said .      i won   t       he began .      there are larger issues here .         but           sterling work  nevertheless .         there are big crimes and little crimes  is that it .     said vimes .      why don   t you take some well earned rest  sir samuel .  you are     vetinari flashed one of his lightning fast smiles     a man of action .  you deal in swords  and chases  and facts .  now  alas  it is the time for the men of words  who deal in promises and mistrust and opinions .  for you the war is over .  enjoy the sunshine .  i trust we shall all be returning home shortly .  i would like you to stay  lord rust        vimes realized that he   d been switched off .  he spun round and marched out of the tent .   ahmed followed him .     that   s your master  is it .         no .  he   s just the man who pays my wages .         often hard to know the difference     said ahmed sympathetically .   vimes sat down on the sand .  he wasn   t certain how he   d been managing to stand up .  there was some kind of a future now .  he hadn   t the faintest idea what was in it  but there was one .  there hadn   t been one five minutes ago .  he wanted to talk now .  that way  he didn   t have to think about the dis organizer   s death roll .  it had sounded so   accurate        what   s going to happen to you .     he said  to drive the thought out of his mind .     when this is over  i mean .  your boss isn   t going to be pleased with you .         oh  the desert can swallow me .         he   ll send people after you .  he looks the type .         the desert will swallow them .         without chewing .         believe it .         it shouldn   t have to be like this .     vimes shouted  at the sky in general .     you know .  sometimes i dream that we could deal with the big crimes  that we could make a law for countries and not just for people  and people like him would have        ahmed pulled him upright and patted him on the shoulder .      i know how it is     he said .     i dream  too .         you do .         yes .  generally of fish .      there was a roar from the crowd .      someone   s scored a convincing foul  by the sound of it     said vimes .   they slid and staggered up the side of a dune  and watched .   someone broke from the scrum and  punching and kicking  staggered toward the klatchian goal .      isn   t that man your butler .     said ahmed .      yes .         one of your soldiers said he bit a man   s nose off .      vimes shrugged .     he   s got a very pointed look if i don   t use the sugar tongs  i know that .      a white figure marched authoritatively through the mill of players  blowing a whistle .      and that man  i believe  is your king .         no .         really .  then i am queen punjitrum of sumtri .         carrot   s a copper  same as me .         a man like that could inspire a handful of broken men to conquer a country .         fine .  just so long as he does it on his day off .         and he too takes orders from you .  you are a remarkable man  sir samuel .  but you would not  i think  have killed the prince .         no .  but you   d have killed me if i had .         oh  yes .  flagrant murder in front of witnesses .  i am  after all  a copper .      they   d reached the camels .  one looked round as ahmed prepared to mount  thought better of spitting at him  and hit vimes instead .  with great precision .   ahmed looked back at the footballers .      up in klatchistan the nomads play a game very similar to that     he said .     but on horseback .  the aim is to get the object around the goal .         object .         probably best just to think of it as an    object     sir samuel .  and now  i think  i shall head that way .  there are thieves in the mountains .  the air is clear up there .  as you know  there is always work for policemen .         you thinking of returning to ankh morpork at any time .         you   d like to see me there  sir samuel .         it   s an open city .  but be sure to call in at pseudopolis yard when you arrive .         ah  and we can reminisce about old times .         no .  so you can hand over that sword .  we   d give you a receipt and you can pick it up when you leave .         i   d take some persuading  sir samuel .         oh  i think i   d only ask once .      ahmed laughed  nodded at vimes and rode away .   for a few minutes he was a shape at the base of a column of dust  and then a shifting dot in the heat haze  and then the desert swallowed him .       the day wore on .  various klatchian officials and some of the ankh morpork people were summoned to the tent .  vimes wandered close to it a few times and heard the sound of voices raised in dispute .   meanwhile  the armies dug in .  someone had already erected a crude signpost  its arms pointing to various soldiers    homes .  since these were all in part of ankh morpork the arms all pointed exactly the same way .   he found most of the watch sitting out of the wind  while a wizened klatchian woman cooked quite a complicated meal over a small fire .  they all seemed to be fully alive  with the usual slight question mark in the case of reg shoe .      where   ve you been  sergeant colon .     said vimes .      been sworn to secrecy about that  sir .  by his lordship .         right .     vimes didn   t press the point .  getting information out of colon was like getting water out of a flannel .  it could wait .     and nobby .         right here  sir .     the wizened woman saluted in a clash of bangles .      that   s you .         yessir .  doing the dirty work as per the woman   s role in life  sir  despite the fact that there is less senior watchmen present  sir .         now then  nobby     said colon .     cheery can   t cook  we can   t let reg do it because bits fall into the pan  and angua              doesn   t do cookery     said angua .  she was lying back on a rock with her eyes closed .  the rock was the slumbering shape of detritus .      anyway  you just started doing the cooking like you was expecting to have to do it     said colon .      kebab  sir .     said nobby .     there   s plenty .         you certainly got a lot of food from somewhere     said vimes .      klatchian quartermaster  sir     said nobby  grinning beneath his veil .     used my sexual wiles on him  sir .      vimes   s kebab stopped halfway to his mouth and dripped lamb fat on to his legs .  he saw angua   s eyes slam open and stare in horror at the sky .      i told him i   d take my clothes off and scream if he didn   t give me some grub  sir .         that   d scare the daylights out of me  sure enough     said vimes .  he saw angua breathe out again .      yeah  i reckon if i played my cards right i could be one of them fatal femmies     said nobby .     i   ve only got to wink at a man and he runs a mile .  could be useful  that .         i told him he could change back into his uniform  but he says he feels more comfortable like this     whispered colon to vimes .     i   m getting a bit worried  to tell you the truth .      i can   t handle this  vimes thought .  this isn   t in the book of rules .      er   how can i explain this    .     he began .      i don   t want any of them in you endoes     said nobby .     it   s a good idea to walk a mile in someone else   s shoes  that   s all i   m saying .         well  so long as it   s just sh           i   ve just been gettin    in touch with my softer side  all right .  seein    the other man   s point of view  sort of thing  even if he   s a woman .      he looked at their faces and waved his hands vaguely .     all right  all right  i   ll put my uniform on after i   ve tidied up around the camp .  will that make you all happy .         something smells nice .      carrot ran up  bouncing his football .  he   d stripped to his waist .  the whistle bounced on its string around his neck .      i   ve declared half time     he said  sitting down .     so i   ve sent some of the lads into gebra to get four thousand oranges .  shortly the combined ankh morpork regimental bands will put on a display of counter marching while playing a selection of military favorites .         have they practiced counter marching .     said angua .      i don   t think so .         should be good  then .         carrot     said vimes     i don   t wish to pry  but how  in the middle of a desert  did you find a football .     and the voice in the back of his mind insisted  you heard him die  you heard them all die   somewhere else .      oh  these days i carry a deflated one in my pack  sir .  a very pacifying object  a football .  are you all right  sir .         eh .  what .  oh .  yes .  just a bit   tired .  so who   s winning .     vimes patted his pockets  and found his last cigar .      it   s broadly speaking a tie  sir .  i had to send four hundred and seventy three men off  though .  klatch is now well ahead on fouls  i   m sorry to say .         sport as a substitute for war  eh .     said vimes .  he rootled in the ashes of nobby   s fire and pulled out a half consumed   well  it helped to think of it as a desert coal .   carrot gave him a solemn look .     yes  sir .  no one   s using weapons .  and have you noticed how the klatchian army is getting smaller .  some of the chiefs from distant parts are taking their men away .  they say there   s no point in staying if there   s not going to be a war .  i don   t think they really wanted to be here in any case  to tell you the truth .  and i don   t think it   s going to be easy to get them to come back        there was shouting behind them .  men were coming out of the tent  arguing .  lord rust was among them .  he looked around  talking to his companions .  then he spotted vimes and rocketed furiously toward him .      vimes .      vimes looked up  hand halfway to his cigar .      we would have won  you know     growled rust .     we would have won .  but we were betrayed on the brink of success .      vimes stared at him .      and it   s your fault  vimes .  we   ll be the laughingstock of klatch .  you know the value these people put on face  and we won   t have any .  vetinari is finished .  and so are you .  and so is your stupid  mongrel  cowardly watch .  what do you say to that  vimes .  eh .      the watchmen sat like statues  waiting for vimes to say something .  or even move .      eh .  vimes .      rust sniffed .     what   s that smell .      vimes slowly shifted his gaze to his fingers .  smoke was rising .  there was a faint sizzling .   he stood up and brought his fingers up in front of rust   s face .      take it     he said .      that   s   just some trick           take it     said vimes .   mesmerized  rust licked his fingers and gingerly took the ember .     it doesn   t hurt           yes  it does     said vimes .      in fact it   aargh .      rust jumped back  dropped the ember and sucked his blistered fingers .      the trick is not to mind that it hurts     said vimes .     now go away .         you won   t last long     rust sneered .     you wait until we   re back in the city .  you just wait .     he strode off  holding his stricken hand .   vimes went back and sat down by the fire .  after a while he said     where   s he gone now .         back to the lines  sir .  i think he   s ordering the men home .         can he see us .         no .         you sure .         there   s too many people in the way  sir .         you   re quite sure .         not unless he can see through camels  sir .         good .     vimes stuck his fingers in his mouth .  sweat was pouring down his face .     damn damn damn .  has anyone got any cold water .         captain jenkins had got his ship afloat again .  it had taken a lot of digging  and some careful work with balks of timber and the assistance of a klatchian captain who had decided not to let patriotism stand in the way of profit .   he and his crew were resting on the shore when a greeting rang out from over them .   he squinted into the sun .      that   that can   t be vimes  can it .      the crew stared .      let   s get aboard right now .      a figure started down the face of the dune .  it moved very fast  much faster than a man could run on the shifting sand  and moved in a zig zag fashion .  as it drew nearer  it turned out to be a man standing on a shield .   it slid to a halt a few feet away from the astonished jenkins .      good of you to wait  captain .     said carrot .     very many thanks .  the others will be down in a minute .      jenkins looked back to the top of the dune .  there were other  darker figures there now .      those are d   regs .     he shouted .      oh  yes .  lovely people .  have you met them at all .      jenkins stared at carrot .     did you win .     he said .      oh  yes .  on penalties  in the end .         green blue light filtered through the tiny windows of the boat .   lord vetinari pulled the steering levers until he was pretty certain that they were heading toward a suitable ship and said      what is it i can smell  sergeant colon .         it   s bet   it   s nobby  sir     said colon  pedaling industriously .      corporal nobbs .      nobby almost blushed .     i bought a bottle of scent  sir .  for my young lady .      lord vetinari coughed .     what exactly do you mean by    your young lady    .     he said .      well  for when i get one     said nobby .      ah .     even lord vetinari sounded relieved .      on account of i expect i shall now  me having fully explored my sexual nature and now feeling fully comfortable with myself     said nobby .      you feel comfortable with yourself .         yessir .     said nobby happily .      and when you find this lucky lady  you will give her this bottle of              s called    kasbah nights     sir .         of course .  very   floral  isn   t it .         yessir .  that   s    cos of the jasmine and rare ungulants in it  sir .         and yet at the same time curiously   penetrative .      nobby grinned .     good value for money  sir .  a little goes a long way .         not far enough  possibly .      but nobby rusted even irony .     i got it in the same shop that sarge got the hump  sir .         ah   yes .      there wasn   t very much space in the boat  and most of it was taken up with sergeant colon   s souvenirs .  he   d been allowed a brief shopping expedition    to take home something for the wife  sir  otherwise i   ll never hear the last of it .         mrs .  colon will like a stuffed camel hump  will she  sergeant .     said the patrician doubtfully .      yessir .  she can put things on it  sir .         and the set of nested brass tables .         to put things on  sir .         and the      there was a clanking      set of goat bells  ornamental coffee pot  miniature camel saddle and this   strange glass tube with little bands of different colored sand in it   what are these for .         conversation pieces  sir .         you mean people will say things like    what are they for .      do you .      sergeant colon looked pleased with himself .      see  sir .  we   re talking about    em already .         remarkable .      sergeant colon coughed and indicated with a tilt of his head the hunched figure of leonard  who was sitting in the stern with his head in his hands .      he   s a bit quiet  sir     he whispered .     can   t seem to get a word out of him .         he has a lot on his mind     said the patrician .   the watchmen pedaled onward for a while  but the close confines of the boat encouraged a confidentiality that would never have been found on land .      sorry to hear you   re getting the sack  sir     said colon .      really     said lord vetinari .      you   d definitely get my vote  if we had elections .         capital .         i think people want the thumbscrew of firm government  myself .         good .         your predecessor  lord snapcase  now he was mental .  but  like i   ve always said  people know where they stand with lord vetinari           well done .         they might not like where they   re standing  of course        lord vetinari looked up .  they were under a boat now and it seemed to be going in the right direction .  he steered the boat until he heard the thunk of hull hitting hull  and gave the auger a few turns .      am i being sacked  sergeant .     he said  sitting back .      well  eh  i heard lord rust   s people say that if you rat   rat           ratify     said lord vetinari .      yeah  if you ratify that surrender next week  they   ll get you exiled  sir .         a week is a long time in politics  sergeant .      colon   s face widened in what he thought of as a knowing grin .  he tapped the side of his nose .      ah  politics     he said .     ah  you should   ve said .         yeah  they   ll laugh at the other foot then  eh .     said nobby .      got some secret plan  i   ll be bound     said colon .     you know where the chicken is all right .         i can see there   s no fooling such skilled observers of the carnival that is life     said lord vetinari .     yes  indeed  there is something i intend to do .      he adjusted the position of the camel hump pouffe  which in fact smelled of goat and was beginning to leak sand  and lay back .      i   m going to do nothing .  wake me up if anything interesting happens .         nautical things happened .  the wind spun about so much that a weathercock might as well be harnessed to grinding corn .  at one point there was a fall of anchovies .   and commander vimes tried to sleep .  jenkins showed him a hammock  and vimes realized that this was another sheep   s eyeball .  no one could possibly sleep in something like that .  sailors probably kept them up for show and had real beds tucked away somewhere .   he tried to make himself comfortable in the hold  and dozed while the others talked in the corner .  they were very politely keeping out of his way .         ordship wouldn   t give the whole thing away  would he .  what were we fighting for .         he   ll have a hard job hanging on to the job after this  that   s for sure .  it   s dragging the good name of ankh morpork in the mud  like mr .  vimes said .         for ankh morpork  mud is up .     that was angua .      on der other han     everyone is still breathin    .     that was detritus .      that   s a vitalist remark           sorry  reg .  what you scratchin    for .         i think i picked up a filthy foreign disease .         sorry .     angua again .     what can a zombie catch .         don   t like to say           you   re talking to someone who knows every brand of flea powder they sell in ankh morpork  reg .         oh  if you must know   mice  miss .  it   s shameful .  i keep myself clean  but they just find a way           have you tried everything .         excepting ferrets .         if his lordship goes  who   ll take over .     that was cheery .     lord rust .         he   d last five minutes .         maybe the guilds will get together and           they   ll fight like              ferrets     said reg .     the cure   s worse than the disease .         cheer up  there   ll still be a watch .     that was carrot .      yes  but mr .  vimes   ll be out on his ear .     cos of politics .      vimes decided to keep his eyes closed .      a silent crowd was waiting on the quayside when the ship finally docked .  they watched vimes and his men walk down the gangway .  there were one or two coughs  and then someone called out      say it ain   t so  mr .  vimes .      at the foot of the gangplank constable dorfl saluted stiffly .      lord rust   s ship got in this morning  sir     the golem said .      anyone seen vetinari .         no  sir .         afraid to show his face .     someone shouted .      lord rust said you were to do your duty  damn you     said dorfl .  golems had a certain literalness of speech .   he handed vimes a sheet of paper .  vimes grabbed it and read the first few lines .      what   s this .     emergency council .     and this .    treason .  against vetinari .  i   m not carrying this out .         can i see  sir .     said carrot .   it was angua who noticed the wave  while the others were staring at the warrant .  even in human form a werewolf   s ears are pretty sensitive .   she wandered back to the quayside and looked downriver .   a wall of white water a few feet high was running up the ankh .  as it passed  boats were lifted and rocked .   it sloshed by her  sucking at the quay and making jenkins   s boat dance for a moment .  there was a crash of crockery somewhere aboard .   then it was gone  a line of surf heading toward the next bridge .  for a moment the air smelled not of the ankh   s eau de latrine but of sea winds and salt .   jenkins appeared out of his cabin and looked over the side .      what was that .  the tide changing .     angua called up .      we came up on the tide     said jenkins .     beats me .  one of those phenomena  i expect .      angua went back to the group .  vimes was already red in the face .      it has been signed by quite a lot of the major guilds  sir     carrot was saying .     in fact they   re all here except the beggars and the seamstresses .         really .  well  piss on    em .  who are they to give me an order like that .      angua saw the look of pain cross carrot   s face .      uh   someone has to give us orders  sir .  in a general sort of way .  we aren   t supposed to make up our own .  that   s sort of   the point .         yes   but   not like           and i suppose they represent the will of the people           that bunch .  don   t give me that rubbish .  we   d have been slaughtered if we   d fought .  and then we   d be in just the same position as we           this does look legal  sir .         it   s   ridiculous .         it   s not as if we are accusing him  sir .  we just have to make sure he turns up at the rats chamber .  look  sir  you   ve had a very trying time           but   arrest vetinari .  i can   t        vimes stopped  because his ears had caught up .  and because that was the point  wasn   t it .  if you could arrest anyone  then that   s what you had to do .  you couldn   t turn round and say    but not him .     ahmed would snigger .  old stoneface would turn in all five of his graves .      i can  can   t i .     he said  sadly .     oh  all right .  put out a description  dorfl .         that will not be necessary  sir .      the crowds moved aside as lord vetinari walked along the quay  with nobby and colon behind him .  at least  if it wasn   t sergeant colon it was a very strangely deformed camel .      i think i caught quite a lot of that  commander     said lord vetinari .     please do your duty .         all you   ve got to do is go to the palace  sir .  let   s           you   re not going to handcuff me .      vimes   s mouth dropped open .     why should i do that .         treason is very nearly the ultimate crime  sir samuel .  i think i should demand handcuffs .         all right  if you insist .     vimes nodded at dorfl .     cuff him  then .         you haven   t any shackles  by any chance .     said lord vetinari  as dorfl produced a pair of handcuffs .     we may as well do this thing properly           no .  we don   t have any shackles .         i was only trying to help  sir samuel .  shall we be going .      the crowd weren   t jeering .  that was almost frightening .  they were just waiting  like an audience watching to see how the trick was going to be done .  they parted again as the patrician headed toward the center of the city .  he stopped and turned .      what was the other thing   oh yes  i don   t have to be dragged on a hurdle  do i .         only if you   re actually executed  my lord     said carrot  cheerfully .     traditionally  traitors are dragged to their place of execution on a hurdle .  and then you   re hung  drawn and quartered .     carrot looked embarrassed .     i know about the hanging and quartering but i   m not sure how you   re drawn  sir .         are you any good with a pencil  captain .     said lord vetinari innocently .      no  he   s not .     said vimes .      do you actually have a hurdle .         no .     snapped vimes .      oh .  well  i believe there   s a sports equipment shop in sheer street .  just in case  sir samuel .         a figure walked across the trampled sand near gebra  and paused when a voice very near ground level said  hopefully     bingeley bingeley beep .      the dis organizer felt itself being picked up .   what kind of a thing are you .      i am the dis organizer mk ii  with many handy hard to use features  insert name here .      such as .   even the dis organizer   s tiny mind felt slightly uneasy .  the voice it was speaking to didn   t sound right .      i know what time it is everywhere     it ventured .   so do i .      er   i can maintain an up to the minute contacts directory       the dis organizer felt movements that suggested the new owner had mounted a horse .   really .  i have a great many contacts .      there you are  then     said the demon  trying to hold on to its rapidly draining enthusiasm .     so i make a note of them  and when you want to contact them again        that is generally not necessary .  mostly  they stay contacted .      well   do you have many appointments .     there were hoofbeats  and then no sound but rushing wind .   more than you could possibly imagine .  no   i think  perhaps  your talents could be better employed elsewhere     there was more rushing wind  and then a splash .      the rats chamber was crowded .  guild leaders were entitled to be there  but there were plenty of other people who considered they had a right to be in at the death  too .  there were even some of the senior wizards .  everyone wanted to be able to say to their grandchildren    i was there .          i feel certain i ought to be wearing more chains     said vetinari  as they paused in the doorway and looked at the assembled crowd .      are you taking this seriously  sir .     said vimes .      incredibly seriously  commander  i assure you .  but if by some chance i survive  i authorize you to buy some shackles .  we must learn to do this sort of thing properly .         i shall keep them handy  i assure you .         good .      the patrician nodded at lord rust  who was flanked by mr .  boggis and lord downey .      good morning     he said .     can we make this quick .  it   s going to be a busy day .         it pleases you to continue to make ankh morpork a laughingstock     rust began .  his glance flicked to vimes for a moment  and wrote him out of the universe .     this is not a formal trial  lord vetinari .  it is an arraignment so that the charges may be known .  mr .  slant tells me that it will be many weeks before a full trial can be mounted .         expensive weeks no doubt .  shall we get on with it .     said vetinari .      mr .  slant will read the charges     said rust .     but in a nutshell  as you are well aware  havelock  you are charged with treason .  you surrendered most ignobly              but i did not                 and quite illegally waived all rights to our sovereignty of the country known as leshp              but there is no such place .      lord rust paused .     are you quite sane  sir .         the surrender terms were to be ratified on the island of leshp  lord rust .  there is no such place .         we passed it on the way here  man .         has anyone looked recently .      angua tapped vimes on the shoulder .      a strange wave came up the river just after we arrived  sir        there was some urgent conversation among the wizards  and archchancellor ridcully stood up .      there seems to be a bit of a problem  your lordships .  the dean says it really isn   t there .         it   s an island .  are you suggesting someone   s stolen it .  are you sure you know where it is  man .         we do know where it is  and it isn   t there .  there   s just a lot of seaweed and wreckage     said the dean coldly .  he stood up  holding a small crystal ball in his hands .     we   ve been watching it most evenings .  for the fights  you know .  of course  the picture is pretty bad at this distance        rust stared at him .  but the dean was too large to be written out of the scene .      but an entire island can   t just vanish     said rust .      in theory they can   t just appear either  my lord  but this one did .         perhaps it   s sunk again     said carrot .   now rust glared at vetinari .      did you know about this .     he demanded .      how could i know something like that .      vimes watched the faces around the room .      you do know something about this .     said rust .  he glanced toward mr .  slant  who was leafing hurriedly through a large volume .      all i know  my lord  is that prince cadram has  at a politically dangerous time for him  given up a huge military advantage in exchange for an island which seems to have sunk under the sea     said lord vetinari .     the klatchians are a proud people .  i wonder what they will think .      and vimes thought about general ashal  standing beside prince cadram   s throne .  klatchians like successful leaders  he thought .  i wonder what happens to the unsuccessful ones .  i mean  look at what we do when we think     someone nudged him .         s us  sir     said nobby .     they said they didn   t have any hurdles but they do a ping pong table for ten dollars .  there   s a small trampoline we could drag him on but sarge thinks that   d be a bit ridiculous .      vimes walked out of the room  dragging nobby with him  and pushed the little man against the wall .      where did you get to with vetinari  corporal .  and remember i know when you tell me lies .  your lips move .         we   we   we   just went on a little voyage  sir .  he said i wasn   t to say we went under the island  sir .         so you   under leshp .         nossir .  we didn   t go down there .  stinking hole it was  too .  stunk of rotten eggs  the whole bloody cave  and as big as the city  believe me .         i bet you   re glad you didn   t go  then .      nobby looked relieved .     that   s right  sir .      vimes sniffed .     are you using some kind of aft         he corrected himself      some kind of insteadofshave  nobby .         no  sir .         something smells of fermented flowers .         oh  it   s just a souvenir i picked up in foreign parts  sir .  it kind of lingers  if you know what i mean .      vimes shrugged and went back into the rats chamber .         and i resent most strongly the suggestion that i would have negotiated with his highness in the knowledge that   ah  sir samuel .  the keys to the handcuffs  please .         you knew .  you knew all the time .     rust shouted .      is lord vetinari charged with anything .     said vimes .   mr .  slant was scrabbling through another volume .  he looked quite flustered  for a zombie .  his gray green shade was distinctly greener .      not as such       he muttered .      but he will be .     said lord rust .      well  when you find out what it is you be sure and let me know  and i   ll go and arrest him for it     said vimes  unlocking the handcuffs .   he was aware of cheering outside .  nothing stayed secret very long in ankh morpork .  the damn island wasn   t there anymore .  and  somehow  it had all worked out .   he met vetinari   s eyes .     piece of luck for you  eh .     he said .      oh  there   s always a chicken  sir samuel .  if you look hard enough .         the day turned out to be nearly as trying as war .  at least one carpet made the flight from klatch  and there was a constant stream of messages between the palace and the embassy .  a crowd still hung around outside the palace .  things were happening  and even if they did not know what they were they weren   t going to miss them .  if any history was going to occur  they wanted to watch it .   vimes went home .  to his amazement  the door was answered by willikins .  he had his sleeves rolled up and was wearing a long green apron .      you .  how the hell did you get back so quickly .     said vimes .     sorry .  i didn   t mean to be impolite           i inveigled myself onto lord rust   s ship in the general confusion  sir .  i did not wish to let things go to rack and ruin here .  the silverware is frankly disgusting  i am afraid .  the gardener does not have the least idea how to do it .  allow me to apologize in advance for the shocking condition of the cutlery  sir .         a few days ago you were biting people   s noses off .         ah  you must not believe private bourke  sir     said the butler  as vimes stepped in .     it was only one nose .         and now you   ve hurried back to polish the silver .         it does not do to let standards slip  sir .     he stopped .     sir .         yes .         did we win .      vimes looked into the round pink face .      er   we didn   t lose  willikins     he said .      we couldn   t let a foreign despot raise a hand to ankh morpork  could we  sir .     said the butler .  there was a slight tremble in his voice .      i suppose not           so it was right  what we did .         i suppose so           the gardener was saying that lord vetinari put one over on the klatchians  sir           i don   t see why not .  he   s done it with everyone else .         that would be very satisfactory  sir .  lady sybil is in the slightly pink drawing room  sir .      she was knitting inexpertly when vimes came in  but rose and gave him a kiss .      i heard the news     she said .     well done .     she looked him up and down .  as far as she could see  he was all there .      i   m not sure that we won           getting you back alive counts as a win  sam .  although of course i wouldn   t say that in front of lady selachii .     sybil waved the knitting at him .     she   s organized a committee to knit socks for our brave lads at the front  but it turns out you   re back .  and i haven   t even worked out how to turn a heel yet .  she   s probably going to be annoyed .         er   how long do you think my legs are .         um       she looked at the knitting .     do you need a scarf .      he kissed her again .      i   m going to have a bath and then something to eat     he said .   the water was only lukewarm .  vimes had some hazy idea that sybil thought that really hot baths might be letting the side down while there was a war on .   he was lying with his nose just above the surface when he heard  with the addition of that special gloinggloing sound that comes from listening with your ears underwater  some distant talking .  then the door opened .      fred   s here .  vetinari wants you     said sybil .      already .  but we haven   t even started dinner .         i   m coming with you  sam .  he can   t keep on calling you out at all hours  you know .      sam vimes tried to look as serious as any man can when he   s holding a loofah .      sybil  i   m the commander of the watch and he   s the ruler of the city .  it   s not like going to complain to the teacher because i   m not doing well in geography           i said i   m coming with you  sam .         the boat slipped down its rails and into the water .  a stream of bubbles came up .   leonard sighed .  he had very carefully refrained from putting the cork in .  the current might roll it anywhere .  he hoped it   d roll to the deepest pit of the ocean  or even right over the rim .   he walked unnoticed through the crowds until he came to the palace .  he let himself into the secret corridor and avoided the various traps without thinking  since he himself had designed them .   he reached the door to his airy room and unlocked it .  when he was inside he locked it again  and pushed the key back under the door .  and then he sighed .   so that was the world  was it .  clearly a mad place  with madmen in it .  well  from now on he   d be careful .  it was clear that some men would try to turn anything into a weapon .   he made himself a cup of tea  a process slightly delayed while he designed a better sort of spoon and a small device to improve the circulation of the boiling water .   then he sat back in his special chair and pulled a lever .  counterweights dropped .  somewhere  water sloshed from one tank to another .  bits of the chair creaked and slid into a comfortable position .   leonard stared bleakly out of the skylight .  a few seabirds turned lazily in the blue square  circling  hardly moving their wings     after a while  his tea growing cold  leonard began to draw .         lady sybil .  this is an unexpected surprise     said lord vetinari .     good evening  sir samuel  and may i say what a nice scarf you   re wearing .  and captain carrot .  please sit down .  we have a lot of business to finish .      they sat .      firstly     said lord vetinari     i have just drafted a proclamation for the town criers .  the news is good .         the war is officially over  is it .     said carrot .      the war  captain  never happened .  it was a   misunderstanding .         never happened .     said vimes .     people got killed .         quite so     said lord vetinari .     and this suggests  does it not  that we should try to understand one another as much as possible .         what about the prince .         oh  i am sure we can do business with him  vimes .         i don   t think so .         prince khufurah .  i thought you rather liked the man .         what .  what happened to the other one .         he appears to have gone on a long visit to the country     said the patrician .     at some speed .         you mean the kind of visit where you don   t even stop to pack .         that kind of visit  yes .  he seems to have upset people .         do we know which country .     said vimes .      klatchistan  i believe   i   m sorry  did i say something funny .         oh  no .  no .  just a thought crossed my mind  that   s all .      vetinari leaned back .     and so once again peace spreads her tranquil blanket .         i shouldn   t think the klatchians are very happy  though .         it is in the nature of people to turn on their leaders when they fail to be lucky     vetinari added  his expression not changing .     oh  there will no doubt be problems .  we will just have to   discuss them .  prince khufurah is an amiable man .  very much like most of his ancestors .  a flask of wine  a loaf of bread and thou  or at least a selection of thous  and he   d not be too interested in politics .         they   re as clever as us     said vimes .      we just have to stay ahead of them  then     said vetinari .      a brain race  sort of     said vimes .      better than an arms race .  cheaper  too     said the patrician .  he flicked through the papers in front of him .     now then  what was   oh  yes .  the matter of traffic .         traffic .     vimes   s brain tried to do a u turn .      yes .  our ancient streets are becoming very congested these days .  i hear there is a carter in kings    way who settled down and raised a family while in the queue .  and the responsibility for keeping the streets clear is  in fact  one of the most ancient ones incumbent on the watch .         maybe  sir  but these days           so you will set up a department  vimes  to regulate matters .  to deal with things .  stolen carts and so on .  and keeping the major crossroads clear .  and perhaps to fine carters who park for too long and impede the flow .  and so on .  sergeant colon and corporal nobbs would  i think  be eminently fitted for this work which  i suspect  should easily be self financing .  what is your opinion .      a chance to be    self financing    and not get shot at  thought vimes .  they   ll think they   ve died and gone to heaven .      is this some sort of a reward for them  sir .         let us say  vimes  that where one finds one has a square peg  one should look for a square hole .         i suppose that   s all right  sir .  of course  that means i   ll have to promote someone           i am sure i can leave the details to you .  a small bonus for each of them would not be out of order .  ten dollars  say .  oh  there is one other thing  vimes .  and i am particularly glad that lady sybil is here to hear this .  i am persuaded to change the title of your office .         yes .            commander    is rather a mouthful .  so i have been reminded that a word that originally meant commander was    dux .            dux vimes .     said vimes .  he heard sybil gasp .   he was aware of a waiting hush around him  such as may be found between the lighting of a fuse and the bang .  he rolled the word over and over in his mind .      duke .     he said .     oh  no   sybil  could you wait outside .         why .  sam .         i need to discuss this very personally with his lordship .         have a row  you mean .         a discussion .      lady sybil sighed .     oh  very well .  it   s up to you  sam .  you know that .         there are   associated matters     said lord vetinari  when the door closed behind her .      no .         perhaps you should hear them .         no .  you   ve done this to me before .  we   ve got the watch set up  we   ve almost got the numbers  the widows and orphans fund is so big the men are queueing up for the dangerous beats  and the dartboard we   ve got is nearly new .  you can   t bribe me into accepting this time .  there is nothing we want .         stoneface vimes was a much maligned man  i   ve always thought     said vetinari .      i   m not accepting   what .     vimes skidded in mid anger .      i   ve always thought that  too     said carrot loyally .   vetinari stood up and went to stand by the window  looking down at broad way with his hands behind his back .      the thought occurs that this might be time for   reconsideration of certain ancient assumptions     said vetinari .   the meaning enveloped vimes like a chilly mist .      you   re offering to change history .     he said .     is that it .  rewrite the           oh  my dear vimes  history changes all the time .  it is constantly being reexamined and reevaluated  otherwise how would we be able to keep historians occupied .  we can   t possibly allow people with their sort of minds to walk around with time on their hands .  the chairman of the guild of historians is in full agreement with me  i know  that the pivotal role of your ancestor in the city   s history is ripe for fresh   analysis .         discussed it with him  have you .     said vimes .      not yet .      vimes opened and shut his mouth a few times .  the patrician went back to his desk and picked up a sheet of paper .      and  of course  other details would have to be taken care of       he said .      such as .     vimes croaked .      the vimes coat of arms would be resurrected  of course .  it would have to be .  i know lady sybil was extremely upset when she found you weren   t entitled to one .  and a coronet  i believe  with knobs on           you can take that coronet with the knobs on and              which i hope you will wear on formal occasions  such as  for example  the unveiling of the statue which has for so long disgraced the city by its absence .      for once  vimes managed to get ahead of the conversation .      old stoneface again .     he said .     that part of it  is it .  a statue to old stoneface .         well done     said lord vetinari .     not of you  obviously .  putting up a statue to someone who tried to stop a war is not very  um  statuesque .  of course  if you had butchered five hundred of your own men out of arrogant carelessness  we   d be melting the bronze already .  no .  i was thinking of the first vimes who tried to make a future and merely made history .  i thought perhaps somewhere in peach pie street        they watched one another like cats  like poker players .      top of broad way     vimes said hoarsely .     right in front of the palace .      the patrician glanced out of the window .     agreed .  i shall enjoy looking at it .         and right up close to the wall .  out of the wind .         certainly .      vimes looked nonplussed for a moment .     we lost people           seventeen  caught in skirmishes of one sort or another     said lord vetinari .      i want           financial arrangements will be made for widows and dependants .      vimes gave up .      well done  sir .     said carrot .   the new duke rubbed his chin .      but that means i   ll have to be married to a duchess     he said .     that   s a big fat word  duchess .  and sybil   s never been very interested in that sort of thing .         i bow to your knowledge of the female psyche     said vetinari .     i saw her face just now .  no doubt when she next takes tea with her friends  who i believe include the duchess of quirm and lady selachii  she will be entirely unmoved and not faintly smug in any way .      vimes hesitated .  sybil was an amazingly levelheaded woman  of course  and this sort of thing   she   d left it entirely up to him  hadn   t she .    this sort of thing wouldn   t   well  of course she wouldn   t  she   of course she would  wouldn   t she .  she wouldn   t swank  she   d just be very comfortable knowing that they knew that she knew that they knew        all right     he said     but  look  i thought only a king could make someone a duke .  it   s not like all these knights and barons  that   s just  well  political  but something like a duke needs a        he looked at vetinari .  and then at carrot .  vetinari had said that he   d been reminded        i   m sure  if ever there is a king in ankh morpork again  he will choose to ratify my decision     said vetinari smoothly .     and if there never is a king  well  i see no practical problems .         i   m bought and sold  aren   t i .     said vimes  shaking his head .     bought and sold .         not at all     said vetinari .      yes  i am .  we all are .  even rust .  and all those poor buggers who went off to get slaughtered .  we   re not part of the big picture  right .  we   re just bought and sold .      vetinari was suddenly in front of vimes  his chair hitting the floor behind his desk .      really .  men marched away  vimes .  and men marched back .  how glorious the battles would have been that they never had to fight .     he hesitated  and then shrugged .     and you say bought and sold .  all right .  but not  i think  needlessly spent .     the patrician flashed one of those sharp  fleeting little smiles to say that something that wasn   t very funny had nevertheless amused him .     veni  vici   vetinari .         seaweed floated away on aimless currents .  apart from the driftwood  there was nothing to show that leshp had ever been .   seabirds wheeled .  but their cries were more or less drowned out by the argument going on just above sea level .      it is entirely our wood  you nodding acquaintance of a dog .         oh .  really .  on your side of the island  is it .  i don   t think so .         it floated up .         how do you know we didn   t have some driftwood on our side of the island .  anyway  we   ve still got a barrel of fresh water  camel breath .         all right .  we   ll share .  you can have half the raft .         aha .  aha .  want to negotiate  eh  now we   ve got you over a barrel .         can we just say yes  dad .  i   m fed up with treading water .         and you   ll have to do your share of the paddling .         of course .      the birds glided and turned  white scribbles against the clear blue sky .      to ankh morpork .         to klatch .      down below  as the sunken mountain of leshp settled further onto the sea bed  the curious squid jetted back along its curious streets .  they had no idea why  at enormous intervals  their city disappeared up into the sky  but it never went away for very long .  it was just one of those things .  things happened  or sometimes they didn   t .  the curious squid just assumed that it all worked out  sooner or later .   a shark swam by .  if anyone had risked placing an ear to its side  they would have heard     bingeley bingeley beep .  three pee em   eat  hunger  swim .  things to do today  swim  hunger  eat .  three oh five pee em  feeding frenzy        it wasn   t the most interesting of schedules  but it was very easy to organize .      unusually  sergeant colon had put himself on the patrol roster .  it was good to get out in the cool air .  and also  for some reason  the news had got around that the watch were somehow bound up with what seemed  in some indefinable way  to have been a victory  which meant that a watch uniform was probably good for the odd free pint at the back door of the occasional pub .   he patrolled with corporal nobbs .  they walked with the confident tread of men who had been places and seen things .   with a true copper   s instinct  the tread took them past mundane meals .  mr .  goriff was cleaning the windows .  he stopped when he saw them and darted inside .      call that gratitude .     sniffed colon .   the man reappeared carrying two large packages .      my wife made this specially for you     he said .  he added     she said she knew you   d be along .      colon pulled aside the waxed paper .      my word     he said .      special ankh morpork curry     said mr .  goriff .     containing yellow curry powder  big lumps of swede  green peas and soggy sultanas the              size of eggs .     said nobby .      thank you very much     said colon .     how   s your lad  then  mr .  goriff .         he says you have set him an example and now he will be a watchman when he grows up .         ah  right     said colon happily .     that   ll please mr .  vimes .  you just tell him           in al khali     said goriff .     he is staying with my brother .         oh .  well   fair enough  then .  er   thanks for the curry  anyway .         what sort of example do you think he meant .     said nobby  as they strolled away .      the good sort  obviously     said colon  through a mouthful of mildly spiced swede .      yeah  right .      chewing slowly and walking even slower  they headed toward the docks .      i was gonna write bana a letter     said nobby  after a while .      yeah  but   she thought you was a woman  nobby .         right .  so she saw  like  my inner self  shorn of       nobby   s lips moved as he concentrated     shorn of surface thingy .  that   s what angua said .  anyway  then i thought  well  her boyfriend   ll be coming back  so i thought i   d be noble about it and give her up .            cos he might be a big stroppy bloke  too     said sergeant colon .      i never thought about that  sarge .      they paced for a while .      it   s a far  far better thing i do now than i have ever done before     said nobby .      right     said sergeant colon .  they walked on in silence for a while and he added     o    course  that   s not difficult .         i still got the hanky she gave me  look .         very nice  nobby .         that   s genuine klatchian silk  that is .         yeah  it looks very nice .         i   m never going to wash it  sarge .         you soppy old thing  nobby     said fred colon .   he watched corporal nobbs blow his nose .      so   you   re going to stop using it  are you .     he said  doubtfully .      it still bends  sarge .  see .     nobby demonstrated .      yeah  right .  silly of me to ask  really .      overhead  the weathervanes started to creak round .      made me a lot more understanding about women  that experience     said nobby .   colon  a much married man  said nothing .      i met verity pushpram this afternoon     nobby went on     and i said how about coming out with me tonight and i don   t mind about the squint at all and i   ve got this expensive exotic perfume which   ll totally disguise your smell  and she said bugger off and threw an eel at me .         not good  then     said colon .      oh  yeah  sarge     cos she used to just cuss when she saw me .  and i   ve still got the eel  and there   s a good feed off it  so i look upon it as a very positive step .         could be .  could be .  just so long as you give someone that scent soon  eh .  only even the people across the street are starting to complain .      their feet  moving like bees toward a flower  had found their way to the waterfront .  they looked up at the klatchian   s head  on its spike .      it   s only wooden     said colon .   nobby said nothing .      and it   s  like  part of our traditional heritage an    that     colon went on  but hesitantly  as if he didn   t believe his own voice .   nobby blew his nose again  an exercise which  with all its little arpeggios and flourishes  went on for some time .   the sergeant gave in .  some things didn   t seem quite the same any more  he had to admit .     i   ve never really liked the place .  let   s go to the bunch of grapes then  all right .      nobby nodded .      anyway  the beer here is frankly piss     said colon .      lady sybil held her handkerchief in front of her husband .      spit .     she commanded .   then she carefully cleaned a smut off his cheek .      there .  now you look very              ducal     said vimes gloomily .     i thought i   d done this once already           they never actually had the convivium after all that fuss     said lady sybil  picking some microscopic lint off his doublet .     it   s got to be held .         you   d think if i   m a duke i wouldn   t have to wear all this damn silly outfit  wouldn   t you .         well  i did point out that you could wear the official ducal regalia  dear .         yes  i   ve seen it .  white silk stockings are not me .         well  you   ve got the calves for them           i think i   ll stick with the commander   s costume     said vimes quickly .   archchancellor ridcully hurried up .     ah  we   re ready for you now  lord vi           call me sir samuel     said vimes .     i can just about live with that .         well  we   ve found the bursar in one of the attics  so i think we can make a start .  if you   d take your place        vimes walked to the head of the procession  feeling every gaze on him  hearing the whispers .  maybe you could get chucked out of the peerage .  he   d have to look that up .  although  considering what lords had got up to in the past  it would have to be for something really  really awful .   still  the drawings of the statue looked good .  and he   d seen what was going to go in the history books .  making history  it turned out  was quite easy .  it was what got written down .  it was as simple as that .      jolly good     ridcully bellowed  above the buzz .     now  if we all step smartly and follow lor   com   sir samuel we ought to be back here for lunch no later than half past one .  is the choir ready .  no one is treading on anyone else   s robes .  then orf we go .      vimes set out at the mandatory slow walking pace .  he heard the procession start up behind him .  there were no doubt problems  as there always are on civic occasions which have to involve the old and deaf and the young and stupid .  several people were probably already walking in the wrong direction .   as he stepped out into sator square there were the jeers and various flatulent noises and murmurs of    oozee then  oozee finkee izz .     that are the traditional crowd responses on these occasions .  but there were one or two cheers  too .   he tried to look straight ahead .   silk stockings .  with garters .  well  they were out .  there were a lot of things he   d do for sybil  but if garters figured anywhere in the relationship they weren   t going to be on him .  and everyone said he had to wear a purple robe lined with vermine .  they could forget that  too .   he   d spent a desperate hour in the library  and all that stuff about the gold knobs and silk stockings was so much marsh gas .  tradition .  he   d show them tradition .  what the original dukes wore  as far as he could see  was good sensible chain mail with blood on it  preferably other people   s     there was a scream from the crowd .  his head jerked round and he saw a stout woman sitting on the ground  waving her arms .         e stole my bag .  and    e never showed me    is thieves    guild badge .      the procession shunted to a halt as vimes stared at the figure legging it across sator square .      you stop right there  sidney pickens .     he yelled  and leapt forward .   and  of course  very few people do know how tradition is supposed to go .  there   s a certain mysterious ridiculousness about it by its very nature   once there was a reason why you had to carry a posy of primroses on soul cake tuesday  but now you did it because   that   s what was done .  besides  the intelligence of that creature known as a crowd is the square root of the number of people in it .   vimes was running  so the university choir hurried after him .  and the people behind the choir saw the gap opening up and responded to the urge to fill it .  and then everyone was just running  because everyone else was running .   there were occasional whimpers from those whose heart  lungs or legs weren   t up to this kind of thing  and a bellow from the archchancellor who had tried to stand firm in the face of the frantic stampede and was now having his head repeatedly trodden into the cobbles .   and apprentice thief sidney pickens ran because he   d taken one look over his shoulder and seen the whole of ankh morpork society bearing down on him  and that sort of thing has a terrible effect on a growing lad .   and sam vimes ran .  he tore off his cloak and whirled away his plumed hat  and he ran and ran .   there would be trouble later on .  people would ask questions .  but that was later on   for now  gloriously uncomplicated and wonderfully clean  and hopefully with never an end  under a clear sky  in a world untarnished   there was only the chase .       about the author   terry pratchett   s novels have

as if to say    we   re going to have some applause here or else the whole school is in detention .            women always do this .         the possibility that they were not guilty of anything was one that he didn   t even think worthy of consideration .         a term invented by the wizard denephew boot    .  who had found that by a system of rewards and punishments he could train a dog  at the ringing of a bell  to immediately eat a strawberry meringue          his parents  who were uncomplicated country people  had wanted a girl .  they were expecting to call her denise .         plain clothes was the problem .  both the men had been used to uniforms all their lives .  sergeant colon   s only suit had been bought by a man two stone lighter and ten years younger  so the buttons creaked under tension  and nobby   s idea of plain clothes was the ribbon and bell bedecked costume he wore as a leading member of the ankh morpork folk dance and song society .  small children had followed them in the street to see where the show was going to be .         constable visit the ungodly with explanatory pamphlets was a good copper  vimes always said  and that was his highest term of praise .  he was an omnian with his countrymen   s almost pathological interest in evangelical religion and spent all his wages on pamphlets  he even had his own printing press .  the results were handed out to anyone interested and everyone who wasn   t interested as well .  even detritus couldn   t clear a crowd faster than visit  vimes said .  and on his days off he could be seen tramping the streets with his colleague  smite the unbeliever with cunning arguments .  so far they hadn   t made a single convert .  vimes thought that visit was probably a really nice man underneath it all  but somehow he could never face the task of finding out .         and would not  therefore  be officially burgled .  ankh morpork had a very direct approach to the idea of insurance .  when the middleman was cut out  that wasn   t a figure of speech .         it is a long cherished tradition among a certain type of military thinker that huge casualties are the main thing .  if they are on the other side then this is a valuable bonus .         one of the universal rules of happiness is  always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual .         thinking up good names was  oddly enough  one area where leonard of quirm   s genius tended to give up .         except in the particular case of sidney lopsides  who was paid two dollars a day from city funds to wear a sack over his head .  it wasn   t that he was spectacularly deformed  as such  it was merely that anyone who saw him spent the rest of the day with an unnerving feeling that they were upside down .         sidney lopsides again .         jugglers will tell you that juggling with items that are identical is always easier than a mixture of all shapes and sizes .  this is even the case with chainsaws  although of course when the juggler misses the first chainsaw it is only the start of his problems .  some more will be along very shortly .         corporal nobbs   s appearance could best be summarized this way .   one of the minor laws of the narrative universe is that any homely featured man who has  for some reason  to disguise himself as a woman will apparently become attractive to some otherwise perfectly sane men with  as the ancient scrolls say  hilarious results .   in this case the laws were fighting against the fact of corporal nobby nobbs  and gave up .         and mr .  harris of the blue cat club .  his admission caused a lot of argument in the guild  who knew competition when they saw it  but mrs .  palm overruled opposition on the basis  she said  that unnatural acts were only natural .         usually because they suspect the joke   s on them .         although of course wizards aren   t allowed to  because they   re not supposed to have grandchildren .
