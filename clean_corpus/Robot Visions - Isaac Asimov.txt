robots in combination      introduction   the robot chronicles    what is a robot .  we might define it most briefly and comprehensively as    an artificial object that resembles a human being .      when we think of resemblance  we think of it  first  in terms of appearance .  a robot looks like a human being .   it could  for instance  be covered with a soft material that resembles human skin .  it could have hair  and eyes  and a voice  and all the features and appurtenances of a human being  so that it would  as far as outward appearance is concerned  be indistinguishable from a human being .   this  however  is not really essential .  in fact  the robot  as it appears in science fiction  is almost always constructed of metal  and has only a stylized resemblance to a human being .   suppose  then  we forget about appearance and consider only what it can do .  we think of robots as capable of performing tasks more rapidly or more efficiently than human beings .  but in that case any machine is a robot .  a sewing machine can sew faster than a human being  a pneumatic drill can penetrate a hard surface faster than an unaided human being can  a television set can detect and organize radio waves as we cannot  and so on .   we must apply the term robot  then  to a machine that is more specialized than an ordinary device .  a robot is a computerized machine that is capable of performing tasks of a kind that are too complex for any living mind other than that of a man  and of a kind that no non computerized machine is capable of performing .   in other words to put it as briefly as possible     robot   machine   computer    clearly  then  a true robot was impossible before the invention of the computer in the     s  and was not practical  in the sense of being compact enough and cheap enough to be put to everyday use  until the invention of the microchip in the       .   nevertheless  the concept of the robot an artificial device that mimics the actions and  possibly  the appearance of a human being is old  probably as old as the human imagination .   the ancients  lacking computers  had to think of some other way of instilling quasi human abilities into artificial objects  and they made use of vague supernatural forces and depended on god like abilities beyond the reach of mere men .   thus  in the eighteenth book of homer   s iliad  hephaistos  the greek god of the forge  is described as having for helpers     a couple of maids .  .  . made of gold exactly like living girls  they have sense in their heads  they can speak and use their muscles  they can spin and weave and do their work .  .  .  .     surely  these are robots .   again  the island of crete  at the time of its greatest power  was supposed to possess a bronze giant named talos that ceaselessly patrolled its shores to fight off the approach of any enemy .   throughout ancient and medieval times  learned men were supposed to have created artificially living things through the secret arts they had learned or uncovered   arts by which they made use of the powers of the divine or the demonic .       the medieval robot story that is most familiar to us today is that of rabbi loew of sixteenth century prague .  he is supposed to have formed an artificial human being   a robot   out of clay  just as god had formed adam out of clay .  a clay object  however much it might resemble a human being  is    an unformed substance     the hebrew word for it is    golem      since it lacks the attributes of life .  rabbi loew  however  gave his golem the attributes of life by making use of the sacred name of god  and set the robot to work protecting the lives of jews against their persecutors .   there was  however  always a certain nervousness about human beings involving themselves with knowledge that properly belongs to gods or demons .  there was the feeling that this was dangerous  that the forces might escape human control .  this attitude is most familiar to us in the legend of the    sorcerer   s apprentice     the young fellow who knew enough magic to start a process going but not enough to stop it when it had outlived its usefulness .   the ancients were intelligent enough to see this possibility and be frightened by it .  in the hebrew myth of adam and eve  the sin they commit is that of gaining knowledge  eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil  i . e .   knowledge of everything  and for that they were ejected from eden and  according to christian theologians  infected all of humanity with that    original sin .      in the greek myths  it was the titan  or prometheus  who supplied fire  and therefore technology  to human beings and for that he was dreadfully punished by the infuriated zeus  who was the chief god .     in early modern times  mechanical clocks were perfected  and the small mechanisms that ran them     clockwork       the springs  gears  escapements  ratchets  and so on   could also be used to run other devices .   the     s was the golden age of    automatons .     these were devices that could  given a source of power such as a wound spring or compressed air  carry out a complicated series of activities .  toy soldiers were built that would march  toy ducks that would quack  bathe  drink water  eat grain and void it  toy boys that could dip a pen into ink and write a letter  always the same letter  of course  .  such automata were put on display and proved extremely popular  and  sometimes  profitable to the owners  .   it was a dead end sort of thing  of course  but it kept alive the thought of mechanical devices that might do more than clockwork tricks  that might be more nearly alive .   what   s more  science was advancing rapidly  and in       the italian anatomist  luigi galvani  found that under the influence of an electric spark  dead muscles could be made to twitch and contract as though they were alive .  was it possible that electricity was the secret of life .   the thought naturally arose that artificial life could be brought into being by strictly scientific principles rather than by reliance on gods or demons .  this thought led to a book that some people consider the first piece of modern science fiction   frankenstein by mary shelley  published in      .   in this book  victor frankenstein  an anatomist  collects fragments of freshly dead bodies and  by the use of new scientific discoveries  not specified in the book   brings the whole to life  creating something that is referred to only as the    monster    in the book .   in the movie  the life principle was electricity .    however  the switch from the supernatural to science did not eliminate the fear of the danger inherent in knowledge .  in the medieval legend of rabbi loew   s golem  that monster went out of control and the rabbi had to withdraw the divine name and destroy him .  in the modern tale of frankenstein  the hero was not so lucky .  he abandoned the monster in fear  and the monster  with an anger that the book all but justifies  in revenge killed those frankenstein loved and  eventually  frankenstein himself .   this proved a central theme in the science fiction stories that have appeared since frankenstein .  the creation of robots was looked upon as the prime example of the overweening arrogance of humanity  of its attempt to take on  through misdirected science  the mantle of the divine .  the creation of human life  with a soul  was the sole prerogative of god .  for a human being to attempt such a creation was to produce a soulless travesty that inevitably became as dangerous as the golem and as the monster .  the fashioning of a robot was  therefore  its own eventual punishment  and the lesson     there are some things that humanity is not meant to know     was preached over and over again .     no one used the word    robot     however  until       the year  coincidentally  in which i was born  .  in that year  a czech playwright  karel capek  wrote the play r . u . r .   about an englishman  rossum  who manufactured artificial human beings in quantity .  these were intended to do the arduous labor of the world so that real human beings could live lives of leisure and comfort .   capek called these artificial human beings    robots     which is a czech word for    forced workers     or    slaves .     in fact  the title of the play stands for    rossum   s universal robots     the name of the hero   s firm .   in this play  however  what i call    the frankenstein complex    was made several notches more intense .  where mary shelley   s monster destroyed only frankenstein and his family  capek   s robots were presented as gaining emotion and then  resenting their slavery  wiping out the human species .   the play was produced in      and was sufficiently popular  though when i read it  my purely personal opinion was that it was dreadful  to force the word    robot    into universal use .  the name for an artificial human being is now    robot    in every language  as far as i know .   through the     s and     s  r u . r .  helped reinforce the frankenstein complex  and  with some notable exceptions such as lester del rey   s    helen o   loy    and eando binder   s    adam link    series  the hordes of clanking  murderous robots continued to be reproduced in story after story .   i was an ardent science fiction reader in the     s and i became tired of the ever repeated robot plot .  i didn   t see robots that way .  i saw them as machines   advanced machines    but machines .  they might be dangerous but surely safety factors would be built in .  the safety factors might be faulty or inadequate or might fail under unexpected types of stresses  but such failures could always yield experience that could be used to improve the models .   after all  all devices have their dangers .  the discovery of speech introduced communication   and lies .  the discovery of fire introduced cooking   and arson .  the discovery of the compass improved navigation   and destroyed civilizations in mexico and peru .  the automobile is marvelously useful   and kills americans by the tens of thousands each year .  medical advances have saved lives by the million    and intensified the population explosion .   in every case  the dangers and misuses could be used to demonstrate that    there are some things humanity was not meant to know     but surely we cannot be expected to divest ourselves of all knowledge and return to the status of the australopithecines .  even from the theological standpoint  one might argue that god would never have given human beings brains to reason with if he hadn   t intended those brains to be used to devise new things  to make wise use of them  to install safety factors to prevent unwise use   and to do the best we can within the limitations of our imperfections .   so  in       at the age of nineteen  i determined to write a robot story about a robot that was wisely used  that was not dangerous  and that did the job it was supposed to do .  since i needed a power source i introduced the    positronic brain .     this was just gobbledygook but it represented some unknown power source that was useful  versatile  speedy  and compact   like the as yet uninvented computer .   the story was eventually named    robbie     and it did not appear immediately  but i proceeded to write other stories along the same line   in consultation with my editor  john w .  campbell  jr .   who was much taken with this idea of mine   and eventually  they were all printed .   campbell urged me to make my ideas as to the robot safeguards explicit rather than implicit  and i did this in my fourth robot story     runaround     which appeared in the march      issue of astounding science fiction .  in that issue  on page      in the first column  about one third of the way down  i just happen to remember  one of my characters says to another     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics .      this  as it turned out  was the very first known use of the word    robotics    in print  a word that is the now accepted and widely used term for the science and technology of the construction  maintenance  and use of robots .  the oxford english dictionary  in the  rd supplementary volume  gives me credit for the invention of the word .   i did not know i was inventing the word  of course .  in my youthful innocence  i thought that was the word and hadn   t the faintest notion it had never been used before .      the three fundamental rules of robotics    mentioned at this point eventually became known as    asimov   s three laws of robotics     and here they are     .  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   those laws  as it turned out  and as i could not possibly have foreseen   proved to be the most famous  the most frequently quoted  and the most influential sentences i ever wrote .   and i did it when i was twenty one  which makes me wonder if i   ve done anything since to continue to justify my existence .    my robot stories turned out to have a great effect on science fiction .  i dealt with robots unemotionally   they were produced by engineers  they presented engineering problems that required solutions  and the solutions were found .  the stories were rather convincing portrayals of a future technology and were not moral lessons .  the robots were machines and not metaphors .   as a result  the old fashioned robot story was virtually killed in all science fiction stories above the comic strip level .  robots began to be viewed as machines rather than metaphors by other writers  too .  they grew to be commonly seen as benevolent and useful except when something went wrong  and then as capable of correction and improvement .  other writers did not quote the three laws   they tended to be reserved for me   but they assumed them  and so did the readers .   astonishingly enough  my robot stories also had an important effect on the world outside .   it is well known that the early rocket experimenters were strongly influenced by the science fiction stories of h .  a .  wells .  in the same way  early robot experimenters were strongly influenced by my robot stories  nine of which were collected in      to make up a book called i  robot .  it was my second published book and it has remained in print in the four decades since .   joseph f .  engelberger  studying at columbia university in the     s  came across i  robot and was sufficiently attracted by what he read to determine that he was going to devote his life to robots .  about that time  he met george c .  devol  jr .   at a cocktail party .  devol was an inventor who was also interested in robots .   together  they founded the firm of unimation and set about working out schemes for making robots work .  they patented many devices  and by the mid     s  they had worked out all kinds of practical robots .  the trouble was that they needed computers that were compact and cheap   but once the microchip came in  they had it .  from that moment on  unimation became the foremost robot firm in the world and engelberger grew rich beyond anything he could have dreamed of .   he has always been kind enough to give me much of the credit .  i have met other roboticists such as marvin minsky and shimon y .  nof  who also admitted  cheerfully  the value of their early reading of my robot stories .  nof  who is an israeli  had first read i  robot in a hebrew translation .   the roboticists take the three laws of robotics seriously and they keep them as an ideal for robot safety .  as yet  the types of industrial robots in use are so simple  essentially  that safety devices have to be built in externally .  however  robots may confidently be expected to grow more versatile and capable and the three laws  or their equivalent  will surely be built in to their programming eventually .   i myself have never actually worked with robots  never even as much as seen one  but i have never stopped thinking about them .  i have to date written at least thirty five short stories and five novels that involve robots  and i dare say that if i am spared  i will write more .   my robot stories and novels seem to have become classics in their own right and  with the advent of the    robot city    series of novels  have become the wider literary universe of other writers as well .  under those circumstances  it might be useful to go over my robot stories and describe some of those which i think are particularly significant and to explain why i think they are .     .     robbie     this is the first robot story i wrote .  i turned it out between may    and may    of       when i was nineteen years old and was just about to graduate from college .  i had a little trouble placing it  for john campbell rejected it and so did amazing stories .  however  fred pohl accepted it on march           and it appeared in the september      issue of super science stories  which he edited .  fred pohl  being fred pohl  changed the title to    strange playfellow     but i changed it back when i included it in my book i  robot and it has appeared as    robbie    in every subsequent incarnation .   aside from being my first robot story     robbie    is significant because in it  george weston says to his wife in defense of a robot that is fulfilling the role of nursemaid     he just can   t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he   s a machine   made so .     this is the first indication  in my first story  of what eventually became the    first law of robotics     and of the basic fact that robots were made with built in safety rules .     .     reason        robbie    would have meant nothing in itself if i had written no more robot stories  particularly since it appeared in one of the minor magazines .  however  i wrote a second robot story     reason     and that one john campbell liked .  after a bit of revision  it appeared in the april      issue of astounding science fiction  and there it attracted notice .  readers became aware that there was such a thing as the    positronic robots     and so did campbell .  that made everything afterward possible .     .     liar .      in the very next issue of astounding  that of may       my third robot story     liar .     appeared .  the importance of this story was that it introduced susan calvin  who became the central character in my early robot stories .  this story was originally rather clumsily done  largely because it dealt with the relationship between the sexes at a time when i had not yet had my first date with a young lady .  fortunately  i   m a quick learner  and it is one story in which i made significant changes before allowing it to appear in i  robot .     .     runaround     the next important robot story appeared in the march      issue of astounding .  it was the first story in which i listed the three laws of robotics explicitly instead of making them implicit .  in it  i have one character  gregory powell  say to another  michael donovan     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics   the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot   s positronic brain .     he then recites them .   later on  i called them the laws of robotics  and their importance to me was threefold   a  they guided me in forming my plots and made it possible to write many short stories  as well as several novels  based on robots .  in these  i constantly studied the consequences of the three laws .   b  it was by all odds my most famous literary invention  quoted in season and out by others .  if all i have written is someday to be forgotten  the three laws of robotics will surely be the last to go .   c  the passage in    runaround    quoted above happens to be the very first time the word    robotics    was used in print in the english language .  i am therefore credited  as i have said  with the invention of that word  as well as of    robotic        positronic     and    psychohistory     by the oxford english dictionary  which takes the trouble   and the space   to quote the three laws .   all these things were created by my twenty second birthday and i seem to have created nothing since  which gives rise to grievous thoughts within me .      .     evidence     this was the one and only story i wrote while i spent eight months and twenty six days in the army .  at one point i persuaded a kindly librarian to let me remain in the locked library over lunch so that i could work on the story . it is the first story in which i made use of a humanoid robot .  stephen byerley  the humanoid robot in question  though in the story i don   t make it absolutely clear whether he is a robot or not   represents my first approach toward r .  daneel olivaw  the humaniform robot who appears in a number of my novels .     evidence    appeared in the september      issue of astounding science fiction .     .     little lost robot     my robots tend to be benign entities .  in fact  as the stories progressed  they gradually gained in moral and ethical qualities until they far surpassed human beings and  in the case of daneel  approached the god like .  nevertheless  i had no intention of limiting myself to robots as saviors .  i followed wherever the wild winds of my imagination led me  and i was quite capable of seeing the uncomfortable sides of the robot phenomena .   it was only a few weeks ago  as i write this  that i received a letter from a reader who scolded me because  in a robot story of mine that had just been published  i showed the dangerous side of robots .  he accused me of a failure of nerve .   that he was wrong is shown by    little lost robot    in which a robot is the villain  even though it appeared nearly half a century ago .  the seamy side of robots is not the result of a failure in nerve that comes of my advancing age and decrepitude .  it has been a constant concern of mine all through my career .     .     the evitable conflict     this was a sequel to    evidence    and appeared in the june      issue of astounding .  it was the first story i wrote that dealt primarily with computers  i called them    machines    in the story  rather than with robots per se .  the difference is not a great one .  you might define a robot as a    computerized machine    or as a    mobile computer .      you might consider a computer as an    immobile robot .     in any case  i clearly did not distinguish between the two  and although the machines  which don   t make an actual physical appearance in the story  are clearly computers  i included the story  without hesitation  in my robot collection  i  robot  and neither the publisher nor the readers objected .  to be sure  stephen byerley is in the story  but the question of his roboticity plays no role .     .     franchise     this was the first story in which i dealt with computers as computers  and i had no thought in mind of their being robots .  it appeared in the august      issue of it worlds of science fiction  and by that time i had grown familiar with the existence of computers .  my computer is    multivac     designed as an obviously larger and more complex version of the actually existing    univac .      in this story  and in some others of the period that dealt with multivac  i described it as an enormously large machine  missing the chance of predicting the miniaturization and etherealization of computers .     .     the last question     my imagination didn   t betray me for long  however .  in    the last question     which appeared first in the november      issue of science fiction quarterly  i discussed the miniaturization and etherealization of computers and followed it through a trillion years of evolution  of both computer and man  to a logical conclusion that you will have to read the story to discover .  it is  beyond question  my favorite among all the stories i have written in my career .      .     the feeling of power     the miniaturization of computers played a small role as a side issue in this story .  it appeared in the february      issue of if and is also one of my favorites .  in this story i dealt with pocket computers  which were not to make their appearance in the marketplace until ten to fifteen years after the story appeared .  moreover  it was one of the stories in which i foresaw accurately a social implication of technological advance rather than the technological advance itself .   the story deals with the possible loss of ability to do simple arithmetic through the perpetual use of computers .  i wrote it as a satire that combined humor with passages of bitter irony  but i wrote more truly than i knew .  these days i have a pocket computer and i begrudge the time and effort it would take me to subtract     from     .  i use the darned computer .     the feeling of power    is one of the most frequently anthologized of my stories .   in a way  this story shows the negative side of computers  and in this period i also wrote stories that showed the possible vengeful reactions of computers or robots that are mistreated .  for computers  there is    someday     which appeared in the august      issue of infinity science fiction  and for robots  in automobile form  see    sally     which appeared in the may june      issue of fantastic .      .     feminine intuition     my robots are almost always masculine  though not necessarily in an actual sense of gender .  after all  i give them masculine names and refer to them as    he .     at the suggestion of a female editor  judylynn del rey  i wrote    feminine intuition     which appeared in the october      issue of the magazine of fantasy and science fiction .  it showed  for one thing  that i could do a feminine robot  too .  she was still metal  but she had a narrower waistline than my usual robots and had a feminine voice  too .  later on  in my book robots and empire  there was a chapter in which a humanoid female robot made her appearance .  she played a villainous role  which might surprise those who know of my frequently displayed admiration of the female half of humanity .      .     the bicentennial man     this story  which first appeared in      in a paperback anthology of original science fiction  stellar     edited by judy lynn del rey  was my most thoughtful exposition of the development of robots .  it followed them in an entirely different direction from that in    the last question .      what it dealt with was the desire of a robot to become a man and the way in which he carried out that desire  step by step .  again  i carried the plot all the way to its logical conclusion .  i had no intention of writing this story when i started it .  it wrote itself  and turned and twisted in the typewriter .  it ended as the third favorite of mine among all my stories .  ahead of it come only    the last question     mentioned above  and    the ugly little boy     which is not a robot story .      .     the caves of steel     meanwhile  at the suggestion of horace l .  gold  editor of galaxy  i had written a robot novel .  i had resisted doing so at first for i felt that my robot ideas only fit the short story length .  gold  however  suggested i write a murder mystery dealing with a robot detective .  i followed the suggestion partway .  my detective was a thoroughly human elijah baley  perhaps the most attractive character i ever invented  in my opinion   but he had a robot sidekick  r .  daneel olivaw .  the book  i felt  was the perfect fusion of mystery and science fiction .  it appeared as a three part serial in the october  november  and december      issues of galaxy  and doubleday published it as a novel in      .   what surprised me about the book was the reaction of the readers .  while they approved of lije baley  their obvious interest was entirely with daneel  whom i had viewed as a mere subsidiary character .  the approval was particularly intense in the case of the women who wrote to me .   thirteen years after i had invented daneel  the television series star trek came out  with mr .  spock resembling daneel quite closely in character   something which did not bother me   and i noticed that women viewers were particularly interested in him  too .  i won   t pretend to analyze this .       .     the naked sun     the popularity of lije and daneel led me to write a sequel  the naked sun  which appeared as a three part serial in the october  november  and december      issues of astounding and was published as a novel by doubleday in      .  naturally  the repetition of the success made a third novel seem the logical thing to do .  i even started writing it in       but things got in the way and  what with one thing and another  it didn   t get written till      .      .     the robots of dawn     this  the third novel of the lije baley r .  daneel series  was published by doubleday in      .  in it  i introduced a second robot  r .  giskard reventlov  and this time i was not surprised when he turned out to be as popular as daneel .      .     robots and empire     when it was necessary to allow lije baley to die  of old age   i felt i would have no problem in doing a fourth book in the series  provided i allowed daneel to live .  the fourth book  robots and empire  was published by doubleday in      .  lije   s death brought some reaction  but nothing at all compared to the storm of regretful letters i received when the exigencies of the plot made it necessary for r .  giskard to die .   of the short stories i have listed as    notable    you may have noticed that three      franchise        the last question     and    the feeling of power      are not included in the collection you are now holding .  this is not an oversight  nor is it any indication that they are not suitable for collection .  the fact is that each of the three is to be found in an earlier collection  robot dreams  that is a companion piece for this one .  it wouldn   t be fair to the reader to have these stories in both collections .   to make up for that  i have included in robot visions nine robot stories that are not listed above as    notable .     this in no way implies that these nine stories are inferior  merely that they broke no new ground .   of these nine stories     galley slave    is one of my favorites  not only because of the word play in the title  but because it deals with a job i earnestly wish a robot would take off my hands .  not many people have gone through more sets of galleys than i have .      lenny    shows a human side of susan calvin that appears in no other story  while    someday    is my foray into pathos .     christmas without rodney    is a humorous robot story  while    think .     is a rather grim one .     mirror image    is the only short story i ever wrote that involves r .  daneel olivaw  the co hero of my robot novels .     too bad .     and    segregationist    are both robot stories based on medical themes .  and  finally     robot visions    is written specifically for this collection .   so it turns out that my robot stories have been almost as successful as my foundation books  and if you want to know the truth  in a whisper  of course  and please keep this confidential  i like my robot stories better .   finally  a word about the essays in this book .  the first essay was written in      .  all the others have appeared in      and thereafter .  why the eighteen year gap .   easy .  i wrote my first robot story when i was nineteen  and i wrote them  on and off  for over thirty years without really believing that robots would ever come into existence in any real sense   at least not in my lifetime .  the result was that i never once wrote a serious essay on robotics .  i might as well expect myself to have written serious essays on galactic empires and psychohistory .  in fact  my      piece is not a serious discussion of robotics but merely a consideration of the use of robots in science fiction .   it was not till the mid     s  with the development of the microchip  that computers grew small enough  versatile enough  and cheap enough to allow computerized machinery to become practical for industrial use .  thus  the industrial robot arrived   extremely simple compared to my imaginary robots  but clearly en route .   and  as it happened  in       just as robots were becoming real  i began to write essays on current developments in science  first for american way magazine and then for the los angeles times syndicate .  it became natural to write an occasional piece on real robotics .  in addition  byron preiss visual publications  inc .   began to put out a remarkable series of books under the general title of isaac asimov   s robot city  and i was asked to do essays on robotics for each of them .  so it came about that before       i wrote virtually no essays on robotics  and after      quite a few .  it   s not my fault  after all  if science finally catches up to my simpler notions .         you are now ready to plunge into the book itself .  please remember that the stories  written at different times over a period of half a century  may be mutually inconsistent here and there .  as for the concluding essays   written at different times for different outlets   they are repetitious here and there .  please forgive me in each case .       robot visions    i suppose i should start by telling you who i am .  i am a very junior member of the temporal group .  the temporalists  for those of you who have been too busy trying to survive in this harsh world of      to pay much attention to the advance of technology  are the aristocrats of physics these days .   they deal with that most intractable of problems   that of moving through time at a speed different from the steady temporal progress of the universe .  in short  they are trying to develop time travel .   and what am i doing with these people  when i myself am not even a physicist  but merely a    .  well  merely a merely .   despite my lack of qualification  it was actually a remark i made some time before that inspired the temporalists to work out the concept of vpit     virtual paths in time     .   you see  one of the difficulties in traveling through time is that your base does not stay in one place relative to the universe as a whole .  the earth is moving about the sun  the sun about the galactic center  the galaxy about the center of gravity of the local group   well  you get the idea .  if you move one day into the future or the past   just one day   earth has moved some   .   million kilometers in its orbit about the sun .  and the sun has moved in its journey  carrying earth with it  and so has everything else .   therefore  you must move through space as well as through time  and it was my remark that led to a line of argument that showed that this was possible  that one could travel with the space time motion of the earth not in a literal  but in a    virtual    way that would enable a time traveler to remain with his base on earth wherever he went in time .  it would be useless for me to try to explain that mathematically if you have not had temporalist training .  just accept the matter .   it was also a remark of mine that led the temporalists to develop a line of reasoning that showed that travel into the past was impossible .  key terms in the equations would have to rise beyond infinity when the temporal signs were changed .   it made sense .  it was clear that a trip into the past would be sure to change events there at least slightly  and no matter how slight a change might be introduced into the past  it would alter the present  very likely drastically .  since the past should seem fixed  it makes sense that travel back in time is impossible .   the future  however  is not fixed  so that travel into the future and back again from it would be possible .   i was not particularly rewarded for my remarks .  i imagine the temporalist team assumed i had been fortunate in my speculations and it was they who were entirely the clever ones in picking up what i had said and carrying it through to useful conclusions .  i did not resent that  considering the circumstances  but was merely very glad   delighted  in fact   since because of that  i think  they allowed me to continue to work with them and to be part of the project  even though i was merely a   well  merely .   naturally  it took years to work out a practical device for time travel  even after the theory was established  but i don   t intend to write a serious treatise on temporality .  it is my intention to write of only certain parts of the project  and to do so for only the future inhabitants of the planet  and not for our contemporaries .   even after inanimate objects had been sent into the future   and then animals   we were not satisfied .  all objects disappeared  all  it seemed  traveled into the future .  when we sent them short distances into the future   five minutes or five days   they eventually appeared again  seemingly unharmed  unchanged  and  if alive to begin with  still alive and in good health .   but what was wanted was to send something far into the future and bring it back .      we   d have to send it at least two hundred years into the future     said one temporalist .     the important point is to see what the future is like and to have the vision reported back to us .  we have to know whether humanity will survive and under what conditions  and two hundred years should be long enough to be sure .  frankly  i think the chances of survival are poor .  living conditions and the environment about us have deteriorated badly over the last century .       there is no use in trying to describe which temporalist said what .  there were a couple of dozen of them altogether  and it makes no difference to the tale i am telling as to which one spoke at anyone time  even if i were sure i could remember which one said what .  therefore  i shall simply say    said a temporalist     or    one said     or    some of them said     or    another said     and i assure you it will all be sufficiently clear to you .  naturally  i shall specify my own statements and that of one other  but you will see that those exceptions are essential .    another temporalist said rather gloomily     i don   t think i want to know the future  if it means finding out that the human race is to be wiped out or that it will exist only as miserable remnants .         why not .     said another .     we can find out in shorter trips exactly what happened and then do our best to so act  out of our special knowledge  as to change the future in a preferred direction .  the future  unlike the past  is not fixed .      but then the question arose as to who was to go .  it was clear that the temporalists each felt himself or herself to be just a bit too valuable to risk on a technique that might not yet be perfected despite the success of experiments on objects that were not alive  or  if alive  objects that lacked a brain of the incredible complexity that a human being owned .  the brain might survive  but  perhaps  not quite all its complexity might .   i realized that of them all i was least valuable and might be considered the logical candidate .  indeed  i was on the point of raising my hand as a volunteer  but my facial expression must have given me away for one of the temporalists said  rather impatiently     not you .  even you are too valuable .      not very complimentary .      the thing to do     he went on     is to send rg    .      that did make sense .  rg    was a rather old fashioned robot  eminently replaceable .  he could observe and report   perhaps without quite the ingenuity and penetration of a human being   but well enough .  he would be without fear  intent only on following his orders  and he could be expected to tell the truth .   perfect .   i was rather surprised at myself for not seeing that from the start  and for foolishly considering volunteering myself .  perhaps  i thought  i had some sort of instinctive feeling that i ought to put myself into a position where i could serve the others .  in any case  it was rg    that was the logical choice  indeed  the only one .   in some ways  it was not difficult to explain what we needed .  archie  it was customary to call a robot by some common perversion of his serial number  did not ask for reasons  or for guarantees of his safety .  he would accept any order he was capable of understanding and following  with the same lack of emotionality that he would display if asked to raise his hand .  he would have to  being a robot .   the details took time  however .      once you are in the future     one of the senior temporalists said     you may stay for as long as you feel you can make useful observations .  when you are through  you will return to your machine and come back with it to the very moment that you left by adjusting the controls in a manner which we will explain to you .  you will leave and to us it will seem that you will be back a split second later  even though to yourself it may have seemed that you had spent a week in the future  or five years .  naturally  you will have to make sure the machine is stored in a safe place while you are gone  which should not be difficult since it is quite light .  and you will have to remember where you stored the machine and how to get back to it .      what made the briefing even longer lay in the fact that one temporalist after another would remember a new difficulty .  thus  one of them said suddenly     how much do you think the language will have changed in two centuries .      naturally  there was no answer to that and a great debate grew as to whether there might be no chance of communication whatever  that archie would neither understand nor make himself understood .   finally  one temporalist said  rather curtly     see here  the english language has been becoming ever more nearly universal for several centuries and that is sure to continue for two more .  nor has it changed significantly in the last two hundred years  so why should it do so in the next two hundred .  even if it has  there are bound to be scholars who would be able to speak what they might call    ancient english .      and even if there were not  archie would still be able to make useful observations .  determining whether a functioning society exists does not necessarily require talk .      other problems arose .  what if he found himself facing hostility .  what if the people of the future found and destroyed the machine  either out of malevolence or ignorance .   one temporalist said     it might be wise to design a temporal engine so miniaturized that it could be carried in one   s clothing .  under such conditions one could at any time leave a dangerous position very quickly .         even if it were possible at all     snapped another     it would probably take so long to design so miniaturized a machine that we   or rather our successors   would reach a time two centuries hence without the necessity of using a machine at all .  no  if an accident of some sort takes place  archie simply won   t return and we   ll just have to try again .          this was said with archie present  but that didn   t matter  of course .  archie could contemplate being marooned in time  or even his own destruction  with equanimity  provided he were following orders .  the second law of robotics  which makes it necessary for a robot to follow orders  takes precedence over the third  which makes it necessary for him to protect his own existence .   in the end  of course  all had been said  and no one could any longer think of a warning  or an objection  or a possibility that had not been thoroughly aired .   archie repeated all he had been told with robotic calmness and precision  and the next step was to teach him how to use the machine .  and he learned that  too  with robotic calmness and precision .   you must understand that the general public did not know  at that time  that time travel was being investigated .  it was not an expensive project as long as it was a matter of working on theory  but experimental work had punished the budget and was bound to punish it still more .  this was most uncomfortable for scientists engaged in an endeavor that seemed totally    blue sky .      if there was a large failure  given the state of the public purse  there would be a loud outcry on the part of the people  and the project might be doomed .  the temporalists all agreed  without even the necessity of debate  that only success could be reported  and that until such a success was recorded  the public would have to learn very little  if anything at all .  and so this experiment  the crucial one  was heart stopping for everyone .   we gathered at an isolated spot of the semi desert  an artfully protected area given over to project four .   even the name was intended to give no real hint of the nature of the work  but it always struck me that most people thought of time as a kind of fourth dimension and that someone ought therefore guess what we were doing .  yet no one ever did  to my knowledge .    then  at a certain moment  at which time there was a great deal of breath holding  archie  inside the machine  raised one hand to signify he was about to make his move .  half a breath later   if anyone had been breathing   the machine flickered .   it was a very rapid flicker .  i wasn   t sure that i had observed it .  it seemed to me that i had merely assumed it ought to flicker  if it returned to nearly the instant at which it left   and i saw what i was convinced i ought to see .  i meant to ask the others if they  too  had seen a flicker  but i always hesitated to address them unless they spoke to me first .  they were very important people  and i was merely   but i   ve said that .  then  too  in the excitement of questioning archie  i forgot the matter of the flicker .  it wasn   t at all important .   so brief an interval was there between leaving and returning that we might well have thought that he hadn   t left at all  but there was no question of that .  the machine had definitely deteriorated .  it had simply faded .   nor was archie  on emerging from the machine  much better off .  he was not the same archie that had entered that machine .  there was a shopworn look about him  a dullness to his finish  a slight unevenness to his surface where he might have undergone collisions  an odd manner in the way he looked about as though he were re experiencing an almost forgotten scene .  i doubt that there was a single person there who felt for one moment that archie had not been absent  as far as his own sensation of time was concerned  for a long interval .   in fact  the first question he was asked was     how long have you been away .      archie said     five years  sir .  it was a time interval that had been mentioned in my instructions and i wished to do a thorough job .         come  that   s a hopeful fact     said one temporalist .     if the world were a mass of destruction  surely it would not have taken five years to gather that fact .      and yet not one of them dared say  well  archie  was the earth a mass of destruction .   they waited for him to speak  and for a while  he also waited  with robotic politeness  for them to ask .  after a while  however  archie   s need to obey orders  by reporting his observations  overcame whatever there was in his positronic circuits that made it necessary for him to seem polite .   archie said      all was well on the earth of the future .  the social structure was intact and working well .         intact and working well .     said one temporalist  acting as though he were shocked at so heretical a notion .     everywhere .         the inhabitants of the world were most kind .  they took me to every part of the globe .  all was prosperous and peaceful .      the temporalists looked at each other .  it seemed easier for them to believe that archie was wrong  or mistaken  than that the earth of the future was prosperous and peaceful .  it had seemed to me always that  despite all optimistic statements to the contrary  it was taken almost as an article of faith  that earth was on the point of social  economic  and  perhaps  even physical destruction .   they began to question him thoroughly .  one shouted     what about the forests .  they   re almost gone .         there was a huge project     said archie     for the reforestation of the land  sir .  wilderness has been restored where possible .  genetic engineering has been used imaginatively to restore wildlife where related species existed in zoos or as pets .  pollution is a thing of the past .  the world of      is a world of natural peace and beauty .         you are sure of all this .     asked a temporalist .      no spot on earth was kept secret .  i was shown all i asked to see .      another temporalist said  with sudden severity      archie  listen to me .  it may be that you have seen a ruined earth  but hesitate to tell us this for fear we will be driven to despair and suicide .  in your eagerness to do us no harm  you may be lying to us .  this must not happen  archie .  you must tell us the truth .      archie said  calmly     i am telling the truth  sir .  if i were lying  no matter what my motive for it might be  my positronic potentials would be in an abnormal state .  that could be tested .         he   s right there     muttered a temporalist .   he was tested on the spot .  he was not allowed to say another word while this was done .  i watched with interest while the potentiometers recorded their findings  which were then analyzed by computer .  there was no question about it .  archie was perfectly normal .  he could not be lying .   he was then questioned again .     what about the cities .         there are no cities of our kind  sir .  life is much more decentralized in      than with us  in the sense that there are no large and concentrated clumps of humanity .  on the other hand  there is so intricate a communication network that humanity is all one loose clump  so to speak .         and space .  has space exploration been renewed .      archie said     the moon is quite well developed  sir .  it is an inhabited world .  there are space settlements in orbit about the earth and about mars .  there are settlements being carved out in the asteroid belt .         you were told all this .     asked one temporalist  suspiciously .      this is not a matter of hearsay  sir .  i have been in space .  i remained on the moon for two months .  i lived on a space settlement about mars for a month  and visited both phobos and mars itself .  there is some hesitation about colonizing mars .  there are opinions that it should be seeded with lower forms of life and left to itself without the intervention of the earthpeople .  i did not actually visit the asteroid belt .      one temporalist said     why do you suppose they were so nice to you  archie .  so cooperative .         i received the impression  sir     said archie     that they had some notion i might be arriving .  a distant rumor .  a vague belief .  they seemed to have been waiting for me .      did they say they had expected you to arrive .  did they say there were records that we had sent you forward in time .         no  sir .         did you ask them about it .         yes  sir .  it was impolite to do so but i had been ordered carefully to observe everything i could  so i had to ask them   but they refused to tell me .      another temporalist put in     were there many other things they refused to tell you .         a number  sir .      one temporalist stroked his chin thoughtfully at this point and said     then there must be something wrong about all this .  what is the population of the earth in       archie .  did they tell you that .         yes  sir .  i asked .  there are just under a billion people on earth in      .  there are     million in space .  the numbers on earth are stable .  those in space are growing .         ah      said a temporalist     but there are nearly ten billion people on earth now  with half of them in serious misery .  how did these people of the future get rid of nearly nine billion .         i asked them that  sir .  they said it was a sad time .         a sad time .         yes  sir .         in what way .         they did not say  sir .  they simply said it was a sad time and would say no more .      one temporalist who was of african origin said coldly     what kind of people did you see in      .         what kind  sir .         skin color .  shape of eyes .      archie said     it was in      as it is today  sir .  there were different kinds  different shades of skin color  hair form  and so on .  the average height seemed greater than it is today  though i did not study the statistics .  the people seemed younger  stronger  healthier .  in fact  i saw no undernourishment  no obesity  no illness   but there was a rich variety of appearances .         no genocide  then .         no signs of it  sir     said archie .  he went on     there were also no signs of crime or war or repression .         well     said one temporalist  in a tone as though he were reconciling himself  with difficulty  to good news     it seems like a happy ending .         a happy ending  perhaps     said another     but it   s almost too good to accept .  it   s like a return of eden .  what was done  or will be done  to bring it about .  i don   t like that    sad time .             of course     said a third     there   s no need for us to sit about and speculate .  we can send archie one hundred years into the future  fifty years into the future .  we can find out  for what it   s worth  just what happened  i mean  just what will happen .         i don   t think so  sir     said archie .     they told me quite specifically and carefully that there are no records of anyone from the past having arrived earlier than their own time   the day i arrived .  it was their opinion that if any further investigations were made of the time period between now and the time i arrived  that the future would be changed .      there was almost a sickening silence .  archie was sent away and cautioned to keep everything firmly in mind for further questioning .  i half expected them to send me away  too  since i was the only person there without an advanced degree in temporal engineering  but they must have grown accustomed to me  and i  of course  didn   t suggest on my own that i leave .      the point is     said one temporalist     that it is a happy ending .  anything we do from this point on might spoil it .  they were expecting archie to arrive  they were expecting him to report  they didn   t tell him anything they didn   t want him to report  so we   re still safe .  things will develop as they have been .         it may even be     said another  hopefully     that the knowledge of archie   s arrival and the report they sent him back to make helped develop the happy ending .         perhaps  but if we do anything else  we may spoil things .  i prefer not to think about the sad time they speak of  but if we try something now  that sad time may still come and be even worse than it was   or will be   and the happy ending won   t develop  either .  i think we have no choice but to abandon temporal experiments and not talk about them  either .  announce failure .         that would be unbearable .         it   s the only safe thing to do .         wait     said one .     they knew archie was coming  so there must have been a report that the experiments were successful .  we don   t have to make failures of ourselves .         i don   t think so     said still another .     they heard rumors  they had a distant notion .  it was that sort of thing  according to archie .  i presume there may be leaks  but surely not an outright announcement .      and that was how it was decided .  for days  they thought  and occasionally discussed the matter  but with greater and greater trepidation .  i could see the result coming with inexorable certainty .  i contributed nothing to the discussion  of course   they scarcely seemed to know i was there   but there was no mistaking the gathering apprehension in their voices .  like those biologists in the very early days of genetic engineering who voted to limit and hedge in their experiments for fear that some new plague might be inadvertently loosed on unsuspecting humanity  the temporalists decided  in terror  that the future must not be tampered with or even searched .   it was enough  they said  that they now knew there would be a good and wholesome society  two centuries hence .  they must not inquire further  they dared not interfere by the thickness of a fingernail  lest they ruin all .  and they retreated into theory only .   one temporalist sounded the final retreat .  he said     someday  humanity will grow wise enough  and develop ways of handling the future that are subtle enough to risk observation and perhaps even manipulation along the course of time  but the moment for that has not yet come .  it is still long in the future .     and there had been a whisper of applause .   who was i  less than any of those engaged in project four  that i should disagree and go my own way .  perhaps it was the courage i gained in being so much less than they were   the valor of the insufficiently advanced .  i had not had initiative beaten out of me by too much specialization or by too long a life of too deep thought .   at any rate  i spoke to archie a few days later  when my own work assignments left me some free time .  archie knew nothing about training or about academic distinctions .  to him  i was a man and a master  like any other man and master  and he spoke to me as such .   i said to him     how did these people of the future regard the people of their past .  were they censorious .  did they blame them for their follies and stupidities .      archie said     they did not say anything to make me feel this  sir .  they were amused by the simplicity of my construction and by my existence  and it seemed to me they smiled at me and at the people who constructed me  in a good humored way .  they themselves had no robots .         no robots at all  archie .         they said there was nothing comparable to myself  sir .  they said they needed no metal caricatures of humanity .         and you didn   t see any .         none  sir .  in all my time there  i saw not one .      i thought about that a while  then said     what did they think of other aspects of our society .         i think they admired the past in many ways  sir .  they showed me museums dedicated to what they called the    period of unrestrained growth .      whole cities had been turned into museums .         you said there were no cities in the world of two centuries hence  archie .  no cities in our sense .         it was not their cities that were museums  sir  but the relics of ours .  au of manhattan island was a museum  carefully preserved and restored to the period of its peak greatness .  i was taken through it with several guides for hours  because they wanted to ask me questions about authenticity .  i could help them very little  for i have never been to manhattan .  they seemed proud of manhattan .  there were other preserved cities  too  as well as carefully preserved machinery of the past  libraries of printed books  displays of past fashions in clothing  furniture  and other minutiae of daily life  and so on .  they said that the people of our time had not been wise but they had created a firm base for future advance .         and did you see young people .  very young people  i mean .  infants .         no  sir .         did they talk about any .         no  sir .      i said     very well  archie .  now  listen to me        if there was one thing i understood better than the temporalists  it was robots .  robots were simply black boxes to them  to be ordered about  and to be left to maintenance men   or discarded   if they went wrong .  i  however  understood the positronic circuitry of robots quite well  and i could handle archie in ways my colleagues would never suspect .  and i did .   i was quite sure the temporalists would not question him again  out of their newfound dread of interfering with time  but if they did  he would not tell them those things i felt they ought not to know .  and archie himself would not know that there was anything he was not telling them .   i spent some time thinking about it  and i grew more and more certain in my mind as to what had happened in the course of the next two centuries .   you see  it was a mistake to send archie .  he was a primitive robot  and to him people were people .  he did not   could not   differentiate .  it did not surprise him that human beings had grown so civilized and humane .  his circuitry forced him  in any case  to view all human beings as civilized and human  even as god like  to use an old fashioned phrase .   the temporalists themselves  being human  were surprised and even a bit incredulous at the robot vision presented by archie  one in which human beings had grown so noble and good .  but  being human  the temporalists wanted to believe what they heard and forced themselves to do so against their own common sense .   i  in my way  was more intelligent than the temporalists  or perhaps merely more clear eyed .   i asked myself if population decreased from ten billion to one billion in the course of two centuries  why did it not decrease from ten billion to zero .  there would be so little difference between the two alternatives .   who were the billion who survived .  they were stronger than the other nine billion  perhaps .  more enduring .  more resistant to privation .  and they were also more sensible  more rational  and more virtuous than the nine billion who died as was quite clear from archie   s picture of the world of two hundred years hence .   in short  then  were they human at all .   they smiled at archie in mild derision and boasted that they had no robots  that they needed no metal caricatures of humanity .   what if they had organic duplicates of humanity instead .  what if they had humaniform robots  robots so like human beings as to be indistinguishable from them  at least to the eyes and senses of a robot like archie .  what if the people of the future were humaniform robots  all of them  robots that had survived some overwhelming catastrophe that human beings had not .   there were no babies .  archie had seen none .  to be sure  population was stable and long lived on earth  so there would be few babies in any case .  those few would be taken care of  made much of  be well guarded  and might not be distributed carelessly through society .  but archie had been on the moon for two months and population there was growing   and he had still seen no babies .   perhaps these people of the future were constructed rather than born .   and perhaps this was a good thing .  if human beings had died out through their own rages  hatreds  and stupidities  they had at least left behind a worthy successor  a kind of intelligent being that valued the past  preserved it  and moved on into the future  doing their best to fulfill the aspirations of humanity  in building a better  kinder world and in moving out into space perhaps more efficiently than we    real    human beings would have .   how many intelligent beings in the universe had died out leaving no successor .  perhaps we were the first ever to leave such a legacy .   we had a right to feel proud .   ought i to tell all this to the world .  or even to the temporalists .  i did not consider that for a moment .   for one thing  they were likely not to believe me .  for another  if they did believe me  in their rage at the thought of being replaced by robots of any kind  would they not turn on them and destroy every robot in the world and refuse ever to build others .  this would mean that archie   s vision of the future  and my own vision  would never come to pass .  that  however  would not stop the conditions that were to destroy humanity .  it would just prevent a replacement  stop another group of beings  made by humans and honoring humans  from carrying human aspirations and dreams through all the universe .   i did not want that to happen .  i wanted to make sure archie   s vision  and my own improvement of it  would come to pass .   i am writing this  therefore  and i will see to it that it will be hidden  and kept safe  so that it will be opened only two hundred years from now  a little sooner than the time at which archie will arrive .  let the humaniform robots know that they should treat him well and send him home safely  carrying with him only the information that would cause the temporalists to decide to interfere with time no more  so that the future can develop in its own tragic happy way .   and what makes me so sure i am right .  because i am in a unique position to know that i am .   i have said several times that i am inferior to the temporalists .  at least i am inferior to them in their eyes  though this very inferiority makes me more clear eyed in certain respects  as i have said before  and gives me a better understanding of robots  as i have also said before .   because  you see  i  too  am a robot .   i am the first humaniform robot  and it is on me and on those of my kind that are yet to be constructed that the future of humanity depends .       too bad .     the three laws of robotics    .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where that would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     gregory arnfeld was not actually dying  but certainly there was a sharp limit to how long he might live .  he had inoperable cancer and he had refused  strenuously  all suggestions of chemical treatment or of radiation therapy .   he smiled at his wife as he lay propped up against the pillows and said     i   m the perfect case .  tertia and mike will handle it .      tertia did not smile .  she looked dreadfully concerned .     there are so many things that can be done  gregory .  surely mike is a last resort .  you may not need it .         no  no .  by the time they   re done drenching me with chemicals and dowsing me with radiation  i would be so far gone that it wouldn   t be a reasonable test .  .  .  . and please don   t call mike    it .            this is the twenty second century  greg .  there are so many ways of handling cancer .         yes  but mike is one of them  and i think the best .  this is the twenty second century  and we know what robots can do .  certainly  i know .  i had more to do with mike than anyone else .  you know that .         but you can   t want to use him just out of pride of design .  besides  how certain are you of miniaturization .  that   s an even newer technique than robotics .      arnfeld nodded .     granted  tertia .  but the miniaturization boys seem confident .  they can reduce or restore planck   s constant in what they say is a reasonably foolproof manner  and the controls that make that possible are built into mike .  he can make himself smaller or larger at win without affecting his surroundings .         reasonably foolproof     said tertia with soft bitterness .      that   s an anyone can ask for  surely .  think of it  tertia .  i am privileged to be part of the experiment .  i   ll go down in history as the principal designer of mike  but that will be secondary .  my greatest feat will be that of having been successfully treated by a minirobot   by my own choice  by my own initiative .         you know it   s dangerous .         there   s danger to everything .  chemicals and radiation have their side effects .  they can slow without stopping .  they can allow me to live a wearying sort of half life .  and doing nothing win certainly kin me .  if mike does his job properly  i shall be completely healthy  and if it recurs       arnfeld smiled joyously      mike can recur as well .      he put out his hand to grasp hers .     tertia  we   ve known this was coming  you and i .  let   s make something out of this   a glorious experiment .  even if it fails   and it won   t fail   it will be a glorious experiment .      louis secundo  of the miniaturization group  said     no  mrs .  arnfeld .  we can   t guarantee success .  miniaturization is intimately involved with quantum mechanics  and there is a strong element of the unpredictable there .  as mik    reduces his size  there is always the chance that a sudden unplanned reexpansion will take place  naturally killing the   the patient .  the greater the reduction in size  the tinier the robot becomes  the greater the chance of reexpansion .  and once he starts expanding again  the chance of a sudden accelerated burst is even higher .  the reexpansion is the really dangerous part .      tertia shook her head .     do you think it will happen .         the chances are it won   t  mrs .  arnfeld .  but the chance is never zero .  you must understand that .         does dr .  arnfeld understand that .         certainly .  we have discussed this in detail .  he feels that the circumstances warrant the risk .      he hesitated .     so do we .  i know that you   ll see we   re not all running the risk  but a few of us will be  and we nevertheless feel the experiment to be worthwhile .  more important  dr .  arnfeld does .         what if mike makes a mistake or reduces himself too far because of a glitch in the mechanism .  then reexpansion would be certain  wouldn   t it .         it never becomes quite certain .  it remains statistical .  the chances improve if he gets too small .  but then the smaller he gets  the less massive he is  and at some critical point  mass will become so insignificant that the least effort on his part will send him flying off at nearly the speed of light .         well  won   t that kill the doctor .         no .  by that time  mike would be so small he would slip between the atoms of the doctor   s body without affecting them .         but how likely would it be that he would reexpand when he   s that small .         when mik    approaches neutrino size  so to speak  his half life would be in the neighborhood of seconds .  that is  the chances are fifty fifty that he would reexpand within seconds  but by the time he reexpanded  he would be a hundred thousand miles away in outer space and the explosion that resulted would merely produce a small burst of gamma rays for the astronomers to puzzle over .  still  none of that will happen .  mik    will have his instructions and he will reduce himself to no smaller than he will need to be to carry out his mission .        mrs .  arnfeld knew she would have to face the press one way or another .  she had adamantly refused to appear on holovision  and the right to privacy provision of the world charter protected her .  on the other hand  she could not refuse to answer questions on a voice over basis .  the right to know provision would not allow a blanket blackout .   she sat stiffly  while the young woman facing her said      aside from all that  mrs .  arnfeld  isn   t it a rather weird coincidence that your husband  chief designer of mike the microbot  should also be its first patient .         not at all  miss roth     said mrs .  arnfeld wearily .     the doctor   s condition is the result of a predisposition .  there have been others in his family who have had it .  he told me of it when we married  so i was in no way deceived in the matter  and it was for that reason .  that we have had no children .  it is also for that reason that my husband chose his lifework and labored so assiduously to produce a robot capable of miniaturization .  he always felt he would be its patient eventually  you see .        mrs .  arnfeld insisted on interviewing mike and  under the circumstances  that could not be denied .  ben johannes  who had worked with her husband for five years and whom she know well enough to be on first name terms with  brought her into the robot   s quarters .   mrs .  arnfeld had seen mike soon after his construction  when he was being put through his primary tests  and he remembered her .  he said  in his curiously neutral voice  too smoothly average to be quite human     i am pleased to see you  mrs .  arnfeld .      he was not a well shaped robot .  he looked pinheaded and very bottom heavy .  he was almost conical  point upward .  mrs .  arnfeld knew that was because his miniaturization mechanism was bulky and abdominal and because his brain had to be abdominal as well in order to increase the speed of response .  it was an unnecessary anthropomorphism to insist on a brain behind a tall cranium  her husband had explained .  yet it made mike seem ridiculous  almost moronic .  there were psychological advantages to anthropomorphism  mrs .  arnfeld thought  uneasily .      are you sure you understand your task  mike .     said mrs .  arnfeld .      completely  mrs .  arnfeld     said mike .     i will see to it that every vestige of cancer is removed .      johannes said     i   m not sure if gregory explained it  but mike can easily recognize a cancer cell when he is at the proper size .  the difference is unmistakable  and he can quickly destroy the nucleus of any cell that is not normal .         i am laser equipped  mrs .  arnfeld     said mike  with an odd air of unexpressed pride .      yes  but there are millions of cancer cells all over .  it would take how long to get them  one by one .         not quite necessarily one by one  tertia     said johannes .     even though the cancer is widespread  it exists in clumps .  mike is equipped to burn off and close capillaries leading to the clump  and a million cells could die at a stroke in that fashion .  he will only occasionally have to deal with cells on an individual basis .         still  how long would it take .      johannes   s youngish face went into a grimace as though it were difficult to decide what to say .     it could take hours  tertia  if we   re to do a thorough job .  i admit that .         and every moment of those hours will increase the chance of reexpansion .      mike said     mrs .  arnfeld  i will labor to prevent reexpansion .      mrs .  arnfeld turned to the robot and said earnestly     can you  mike .  i mean  is it possible for you to prevent it .           not entirely  mrs .  arnfeld .  by monitoring my size and making an effort to keep it constant  i can minimize the random changes that might lead to a reexpansion .  naturally  it is almost impossible to do this when i am actually reexpanding under controlled conditions .         yes  i know .  my husband has told me that reexpansion is the most dangerous time .  but you will try  mike .  please .         the laws of robotics ensure that i will  mrs .  arnfeld     said mike solemnly .   as they left  johannes said in what mrs .  arnfeld understood to be an attempt at reassurance     really  tertia  we have a holo sonogram and a detailed cat scan of the area .  mike knows the precise location of every significant cancerous lesion .  most of his time will be spent searching for small lesions undetectable by instruments  but that can   t be helped .  we must get them all  if we can  you see  and that takes time .  mike is strictly instructed  however  as to how small to get  and he will get no smaller  you can be sure .  a robot must obey orders .         and the reexpansion  ben .         there  tertia  we   re in the lap of the quanta .  there is no way of predicting  but there is a more than reasonable chance that he will get out without trouble .  naturally  we will have him reexpand within gregory   s body as little as possible   just enough to make us reasonably certain we can find and extract him .  he will then be rushed to the safe room where the rest of the reexpansion will take place .  please  tertia  even ordinary medical procedures have their risk .        mrs .  arnfeld was in the observation room as the miniaturization of mike took place .  so were the holovision cameras and selected media representatives .  the importance of the medical experiment made it impossible to prevent that  but mrs .  arnfeld was in a niche with only johannes for company  and it was understood that she was not to be approached for comment  particularly if anything untoward occurred .   untoward .  a full and sudden reexpansion would blow up the entire operating room and kill every person in it .  it was not for nothing the observation room was underground and half a mile away from the viewing room .   it gave mrs .  arnfeld a somewhat grisly sense of assurance that the three miniaturists who were working on the procedure  so calmly  it would seem   so calmly  were condemned to death as firmly as her husband was in case of   anything untoward .  surely  she could rely on them protecting their own lives to the extreme  they would not  therefore  be cavalier in the protection of her husband .   eventually  of course  if the procedure were successful  ways would be worked out to perform it in automated fashion  and only the patient would be at risk .  then  perhaps  the patient might be more easily sacrificed through carelessness   but not now  not now .  mrs .  arnfeld keenly watched the three  working under imminent sentence of death for any sign of discomposure .   she watched the miniaturization procedure  she had seen it before  and saw mike grow smaller and disappear .  she watched the elaborate procedure that injected him into the proper place in her husband   s body .   it had been explained to her that it would have been prohibitively expensive to inject human beings in a submarine device instead .  mike  at least  needed no life support system .    then matters shifted to the screen  in which the appropriate section of the body was shown in holosonogram .  it was a three dimensional representation  cloudy and unfocused  made imprecise through a combination of the finite size of the sound waves and the effects of brownian motion .  it showed mike dimly and noiselessly making his way through gregory arnfeld   s tissues by way of his bloodstream .  it was almost impossible to tell what he was doing  but johannes described the events to her in a low  satisfied manner  until she could listen to him no more and asked to be led away .     she had been mildly sedated  and she had slept until evening  when johannes came to see her .  she had not been long awake and it took her a moment to gather her faculties .  then she said  in sudden and overwhelming fear     what has happened .      johannes said  hastily     success  tertia .  complete success .  your husband is cured .  we can   t stop the cancer from recurring  but for now he is cured .      she fell back in relief .     oh  wonderful .         just the same  something unexpected has happened and this will have to be explained to gregory .  we felt that it would be best if you did the explaining .           i .     then  in a renewed access of fear     what has happened .     johannes told her .     it was two days before she could see her husband for more than a moment or two .  he was sitting up in bed  looking a little pale  but smiling at her .      a new lease on life  tertia     he said buoyantly .      indeed  greg  i was quite wrong .  the experiment succeeded and they tell me they can   t find a trace of cancer in you .         well  we can   t be too confident about that .  there may be a cancerous cell here and there  but perhaps my immune system will handle it  especially with the proper medication  and if it ever builds up again  which might well take years  we   ll call on mike again .      at this point  he frowned and said     you know  i haven   t seen mike .      mrs .  arnfeld maintained a discreet silence .   arnfeld said     they   ve been putting me off .         you   ve been weak  dear  and sedated .  mike was poking through your tissues and doing a little necessary destructive work here and there .  even with a successful operation you need time for recovery .         if i   ve recovered enough to see you  surely i   ve recovered enough to see mike  at least long enough to thank him .         a robot doesn   t need to receive thanks .         of course not  but i need to give it .  do me a favor  tertia .  go out there and tell them i want mike right away .      mrs .  arnfeld hesitated  then came to a decision .  waiting would make the task harder for everyone .  she said carefully      actually  dear  mike is not available .         not available .  why not .         he had to make a choice  you see .  he had cleaned up your tissues marvelously well  he had done a magnificent job  everyone agrees  and then he had to undergo reexpansion .  that was the risky part .         yes  but here i am .  why are you making a long story out of it .         mike decided to minimize the risk .          naturally .  what did he do .         well  dear  he decided to make himself smaller .          what .  he couldn   t .  he was ordered not to .         that was second law  greg .  first law took precedence .  he wanted to make certain your life would be saved .  he was equipped to control his own size  so he made himself smaller as rapidly as he could  and when he was far less massive than an electron he used his laser beam  which was by then too tiny to hurt anything in your body  and the recoil sent him flying away at nearly the speed of light .  he exploded in outer space .  the gamma rays were detected .      arnfeld stared at her .     you can   t mean it .  are you serious .  mike is dead .         that   s what happened .  mike could not refuse to take an action that might keep you from harm .         but i didn   t want that .  i wanted him safe for further work .  he wouldn   t have reexpanded uncontrollably .  he would have gotten out safely .         he couldn   t be sure .  he couldn   t risk your life  so he sacrificed his own .         but my life was less important than his .         not to me  dear .  not to those who work with you .  not to anyone .  not even to mike .     she put out her hand to him .        come  greg  you   re alive .  you   re well .  that   s all that counts .      but he pushed her hand aside impatiently .     that   s not all that counts .  you don   t understand .  oh  too bad .  too bad .      robbie       ninety eight     ninety nine     one hundred .     gloria withdrew her chubby little forearm from before her eyes and stood for a moment  wrinkling her nose and blinking in the sunlight .  then  trying to watch in all directions at once  she withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against which she had been leaning .   she craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the right and then withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark recesses .  the quiet was profound except for the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird  braving the midday sun .   gloria pouted     i bet he went inside the house  and i   ve told him a million times that that   s not fair .      with tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her forehead  she moved determinedly toward the two story building up past the driveway .   too late she heard the rustling sound behind her  followed by the distinctive and rhythmic clump clump of robbie   s metal feet .  she whirled about to see her triumphing companion emerge from hiding and make for the home tree at full speed .   gloria shrieked in dismay .     wait  robbie .  that wasn   t fair  robbie .  you promised you wouldn   t run until i found you .     her little feet could make no headway at all against robbie   s giant strides .  then  within ten feet of the goal  robbie   s pace slowed suddenly to the merest of crawls  and gloria  with one final burst of wild speed  dashed pantingly past him to touch the welcome bark of home tree first .   gleefully  she turned on the faithful robbie  and with the basest of ingratitude  rewarded him for his sacrifice by taunting him cruelly for a lack of running ability .      robbie can   t run     she shouted at the top of her eight year old voice .     i can beat him any day .  i can beat him any day .     she chanted the words in a shrill rhythm .   robbie didn   t answer  of course     not in words .  he pantomimed running instead  inching away until gloria found herself running after him as he dodged her narrowly  forcing her to veer in helpless circles  little arms outstretched and fanning at the air .      robbie     she squealed     stand still .         and the laughter was forced out of her in breathless jerks .   until he turned suddenly and caught her up  whirling her round  so that for her the world fell away for a moment with a blue emptiness beneath  and green trees stretching hungrily downward toward the void .  then she was down in the grass again  leaning against robbie   s leg and still holding a hard  metal finger .   after a while  her breath returned .  she pushed uselessly at her disheveled hair in vague imitation of one of her mother   s gestures and twisted to see if her dress were torn .   she slapped her hand against robbie   s torso     bad boy .  i   ll spank you .      and robbie cowered  holding his hands over his face so that she had to add     no  i won   t  robbie .  i won   t spank you .  but anyway  it   s my turn to hide now because you   ve got longer legs and you promised not to run till i found you .      robbie nodded his head     a small parallelepiped with rounded edges and corners attached to a similar but much larger parallelepiped that served as torso by means of a short  flexible stalk     and obediently faced the tree .  a thin  metal film descended over his glowing eyes and from within his body came a steady  resonant ticking .      don   t peek now     and don   t skip any numbers     warned gloria  and scurried for cover .   with unvarying regularity  seconds were ticked off  and at the hundredth  up went the eyelids  and the glowing red of robbie   s eyes swept the prospect .  they rested for a moment on a bit of colorful gingham that protruded from behind a boulder .  he advanced a few steps and convinced himself that it was gloria who squatted behind it .   slowly  remaining always between gloria and home tree  he advanced on the hiding place  and when gloria was plainly in sight and could no longer even theorize to herself that she was not seen  he extended one arm toward her  slapping the other against his leg so that it rang again .  gloria emerged sulkily .      you peeked .     she exclaimed  with gross unfairness .     besides i   m tired of playing hide and seek .  i want a ride .      but robbie was hurt at the unjust accusation  so he seated himself carefully and shook his head ponderously from side to side .   gloria changed her tone to one of gentle coaxing immediately     come on  robbie .  i didn   t mean it about the peeking .  give me a ride .      robbie was not to be won over so easily  though .  he gazed stubbornly at the sky  and shook his head even more emphatically .      please  robbie  please give me a ride .     she encircled his neck with rosy arms and hugged tightly .  then  changing moods in a moment  she moved away .     if you don   t  i   m going to cry     and her face twisted appallingly in preparation .   hard hearted robbie paid scant attention to this dreadful possibility  and shook his head a third time .  gloria found it necessary to play her trump card .          if you don   t     she exclaimed warmly     i won   t tell you any more stories  that   s all .  not one        robbie gave in immediately and unconditionally before this ultimatum  nodding his head vigorously until the metal of his neck hummed .  carefully  he raised the little girl and placed her on his broad  flat shoulders .   gloria   s threatened tears vanished immediately and she crowed with delight .  robbie   s metal skin  kept at a constant temperature of seventy by the high resistance coils within  felt nice and comfortable  while the beautifully loud sound her heels made as they bumped rhythmically against his chest was enchanting .      you   re an air coaster  robbie  you   re a big  silver aircoaster .  hold out your arms straight .      you got to  robbie  if you   re going to be an aircoaster .      the logic was irrefutable .  robbie   s arms were wings catching the air currents and he was a silver    coaster .   gloria twisted the robot   s head and leaned to the right .  he banked sharply .  gloria equipped the    coaster with a motor that went    br r r    and then with weapons that went    powie    and    sh sh shshsh .     pirates were giving chase and the ship   s blasters were coming into play .  the pirates dropped in a steady rain .      got another one .  two more     she cried .   then    faster  men     gloria said pompously     we   re running out of ammunition .     she aimed over her shoulder with undaunted courage and robbie was a blunt nosed spaceship zooming through the void at maximum acceleration .   clear across the field he sped  to the patch of tall grass on the other side  where he stopped with a suddenness that evoked a shriek from his flushed rider  and then tumbled her onto the soft  green carpet .   gloria gasped and panted  and gave voice to intermittent whispered exclamations of    that was nice .      robbie waited until she had caught her breath and then pulled gently at a lock of hair .      you want something .     said gloria  eyes wide in an apparently artless complexity that fooled her huge    nursemaid    not at all .  he pulled the curl harder .      oh  i know .  you want a story .      robbie nodded rapidly .      which one .      robbie made a semi circle in the air with one finger .   the little girl protested     again .  i   ve told you cinderella a million times .  aren   t you tired of it .     it   s for babies .      another semi circle .      oh  well     gloria composed herself  ran over the details of the tale in her mind  together with her own elaborations  of which she had several  and began      are you ready .  well     once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl whose name was ella .  and she had a terribly cruel step mother and two very ugly and very cruel step sisters and          gloria was reaching the very climax of the tale     midnight was striking and everything was changing back to the shabby originals lickety split  while robbie listened tensely with burning eyes     when the interruption came .      gloria .      it was the high pitched sound of a woman who has been calling not once  but several times  and had the nervous tone of one in whom anxiety was beginning to overcome impatience .      mamma   s calling me     said gloria  not quite happily .     you   d better carry me back to the house  robbie .      robbie obeyed with alacrity for somehow there was that in him which judged it best to obey mrs .  weston  without as much as a scrap of hesitation .  gloria   s father was rarely home in the daytime except on sunday     today  for instance     and when he was  he proved a genial and understanding person .  gloria   s mother  however  was a source of uneasiness to robbie and there was always the impulse to sneak away from her sight .   mrs .  weston caught sight of them the minute they rose above the masking tufts of long grass and retired inside the house to wait .      i   ve shouted myself hoarse  gloria     she said  severely .     where were you .         i was with robbie     quavered gloria .     i was telling him cinderella  and i forgot it was dinner time .         well  it   s a pity robbie forgot  too .     then  as if that reminded her of the robot   s presence  she whirled upon him .     you may go  robbie .  she doesn   t need you now .     then  brutally     and don   t come back till i call you .      robbie turned to go  but hesitated as gloria cried out in his defense     wait  mamma  you got to let him stay .  i didn   t finish cinderella for him .  i said i would tell him cinderella and i   m not finished .         gloria .         honest and truly  mamma  he   ll stay so quiet  you won   t even know he   s here .  he can sit on the chair in the corner  and he won   t say a word  i mean he won   t do anything .  will you  robbie .      robbie  appealed to  nodded his massive head up and down once .      gloria  if you don   t stop this at once  you shan   t see robbie for a whole week .      the girl   s eyes fell     all right .  but cinderella is his favorite story and i didn   t finish it .     and he likes it so much .      the robot left with a disconsolate step and gloria choked back a sob .     george weston was comfortable .  it was a habit of his to be comfortable on sunday afternoons .  a good  hearty dinner below the hatches  a nice  soft  dilapidated couch on which to sprawl  a copy of the times  slippered feet and shirtless chest  how could anyone help but be comfortable .   he wasn   t pleased  therefore  when his wife walked in .  after ten years of married life  be still was so unutterably foolish as to love her  and there was no question that he was always glad to see her     still sunday afternoons just after dinner were sacred to him and his idea of solid comfort was to be left in utter solitude for two or three hours .  consequently  he fixed his eye firmly upon the latest reports of the lefebre yoshida expedition to mars  this one was to take off from lunar base and might actually succeed  and pretended she wasn   t there .   mrs .  weston waited patiently for two minutes  then impatiently for two more  and finally broke the silence .      george .         hmpph .         george  i say .  will you put down that paper and look at me .      the paper rustled to the floor and weston turned a weary face toward his wife     what is it  dear .         you know what it is  george .  it   s gloria and that terrible machine .         what terrible machine .         now don   t pretend you don   t know what i   m talking about .  it   s that robot gloria calls robbie .  he doesn   t leave her for a moment .         well  why should he .  he   s not supposed to .  and he certainly isn   t a terrible machine .  he   s the best darn robot money can buy and i   m damned sure he set me back half a year   s income .  he   s worth it  though     darn sight cleverer than half my office staff .        he made a move to pick up the paper again  but his wife was quicker and snatched it away .      you listen to me  george .  i won   t have my daughter entrusted to a machine     and i don   t care how clever it is .  it has no soul  and no one knows what it may be thinking .  a child just isn   t made to be guarded by a thing of metal .      weston frowned     when did you decide this .  he   s been with gloria two years now and i haven   t seen you worry till now .         it was different at first .  it was a novelty  it took a load off me  and     and it was a fashionable thing to do .  but now i don   t know .  the neighbors           well  what have the neighbors to do with it .  now  look .  a robot is infinitely more to be trusted than a human nursemaid .  robbie was constructed for only one purpose really     to be the companion of a little child .  his entire    mentality    has been created for the purpose .  he just can   t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he   s a machine made so .  that   s more than you can say for humans .         but something might go wrong .  some  some     mrs .  weston was a bit hazy about the insides of a robot     some little jigger will come loose and the awful thing will go berserk and  and     she couldn   t bring herself to complete the quite obvious thought .      nonsense     weston denied  with an involuntary nervous shiver .     that   s completely ridiculous .  we had a long discussion at the time we bought robbie about the first law of robotics .  you know that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human being  that long before enough can go wrong to alter that first law  a robot would be completely inoperable .  it   s a mathematical impossibility .  besides i have an engineer from u .  s .  robots here twice a year to give the poor gadget a complete overhaul .  why  there   s no more chance of any thing at all going wrong with robbie than there is of you or i suddenly going loony     considerably less  in fact .  besides  how are you going to take him away from gloria .      he made another futile stab at the paper and his wife tossed it angrily into the next room .      that   s just it  george .  she won   t play with anyone else .  there are dozens of little boys and girls that she should make friends with  but she won   t .  she won   t go near them unless i make her .  that   s no way for a little girl to grow up .  you want her to be normal  don   t you .  you want her to be able to take her part in society .         you   re jumping at shadows  grace .  pretend robbie   s a dog .  i   ve seen hundreds of children who would rather have their dog than their father .         a dog is different  george .  we must get rid of that horrible thing .  you can sell it back to the company .  i   ve asked  and you can .         you   ve asked .  now look here  grace  let   s not go off the deep end .  we   re keeping the robot until gloria is older and i don   t want the subject brought up again .     and with that he walked out of the room in a huff .     mrs .  weston met her husband at the door two evenings later .     you   ll have to listen to this  george .  there   s bad feeling in the village .         about what .     asked weston .  he stepped into the washroom and drowned out any possible answer by the splash of water .   mrs .  weston waited .  she said     about robbie .      weston stepped out  towel in hand  face red and angry     what are you talking about .         oh  it   s been building up and building up .  i   ve tried to close my eyes to it  but i   m not going to any more .  most of the villagers consider robbie dangerous .  children aren   t allowed to go near our place in the evenings .         we trust our child with the thing .         well  people aren   t reasonable about these things .         then to hell with them .         saying that doesn   t solve the problem .  i   ve got to do my shopping down there .  i   ve got to meet them every day .  and it   s even worse in the city these days when it comes to robots .  new york has just passed an ordinance keeping all robots off the streets between sunset and sunrise .         all right  but they can   t stop us from keeping a robot in our home .  grace  this is one of your campaigns .  i recognize it .  but it   s no use .  the answer is still  no .  we   re keeping robbie .        and yet he loved his wife     and what was worse  his wife knew it .  george weston  after all  was only a man     poor thing     and his wife made full use of every device which a clumsier and more scrupulous sex has learned  with reason and futility  to fear .   ten times in the ensuing week  he cried     robbie stays  and that   s final .     and each time it was weaker and accompanied by a louder and more agonized groan .   came the day at last  when weston approached his daughter guiltily and suggested a    beautiful    visivox show in the village .   gloria clapped her hands happily     can robbie go .         no  dear     he said  and winced at the sound of his voice     they won   t allow robots at the visivox     but you can tell him all about it when you get home .     he stumbled all over the last few words and looked away .   gloria came back from town bubbling over with enthusiasm  for the visivox had been a gorgeous spectacle indeed .   she waited for her father to maneuver the jet car into the sunken garage     wait till i tell robbie  daddy .  he would have liked it like anything .  especially when francis fran was backing away so o o quietly  and backed right into one of the leopard men and had to run .     she laughed again     daddy  are there really leopard men on the moon .         probably not     said weston absently .     it   s just funny make believe .     he couldn   t take much longer with the car .  he   d have to face it .   gloria ran across the lawn .     robbie .     robbie .      then she stopped suddenly at the sight of a beautiful collie which regarded her out of serious brown eyes as it wagged its tail on the porch .      oh  what a nice dog .     gloria climbed the steps  approached cautiously and patted it .     is it for me  daddy .      her mother had joined them .     yes  it is  gloria .  isn   t it nice     soft and furry .  it   s very gentle .  it likes little girls .         can he play games .         surely .  he can do any number of tricks .  would you like to see some .         right away .  i want robbie to see him  too .  robbie .     she stopped  uncertainly  and frowned     i   ll bet he   s just staying in his room because he   s mad at me for not taking him to the visivox .  you   ll have to explain to him  daddy .  he might not believe me  but he knows if you say it  it   s so .      weston   s lip grew tighter .  he looked toward his wife but could not catch her eye .   gloria turned precipitously and ran down the basement steps  shouting as she went     robbie    come and see what daddy and mamma brought me .  they brought me a dog  robbie .      in a minute she had returned  a frightened little girl .     mamma  robbie isn   t in his room .  where is he .     there was no answer and george weston coughed and was suddenly extremely interested in an aimlessly drifting cloud .  gloria   s voice quavered on the verge of tears     where   s robbie  mamma .      mrs .  weston sat down and drew her daughter gently to her     don   t feel bad  gloria .  robbie has gone away  i think .         gone away .  where .  where   s he gone away  mamma .         no one knows  darling .  he just walked away .  we   ve looked and we   ve looked and we   ve looked for him  but we can   t find him .         you mean he   ll never come back again .     her eyes were round with horror .      we may find him soon .  we   ll keep looking for him .  and meanwhile you can play with your nice new doggie .  look at him .  his name is lightning and he can        but gloria   s eyelids had overflown     i don   t want the nasty dog     i want robbie .  i want you to find me robbie .     her feelings became too deep for words  and she spluttered into a shrill wail .   mrs .  weston glanced at her husband for help  but he merely shuffled his feet morosely and did not withdraw his ardent stare from the heavens  so she bent to the task of consolation     why do you cry  gloria .  robbie was only a machine  just a nasty old machine .  he wasn   t alive at all .         he was not no machine .     screamed gloria  fiercely and ungrammatically .     he was a person just like you and me and he was my friend .  i want him back .  oh  mamma  i want him back .      her mother groaned in defeat and left gloria to her sorrow .      let her have her cry out     she told her husband .     childish griefs are never lasting .  in a few days  she   ll forget that awful robot ever existed .      but time proved mrs .  weston a bit too optimistic .  to be sure  gloria ceased crying  but she ceased smiling  too  and the passing days found her ever more silent and shadowy .  gradually  her attitude of passive unhappiness wore mrs .  weston down and all that kept her from yielding was the impossibility of admitting defeat to her husband .   then  one evening  she flounced into the living room  sat down  folded her arms and looked boiling mad .   her husband stretched his neck in order to see her over his newspaper     what now  grace .         it   s that child  george .  i   ve had to send back the dog today .  gloria positively couldn   t stand the sight of him  she said .  she   s driving me into a nervous breakdown .      weston laid down the paper and a hopeful gleam entered his eye     maybe    maybe we ought to get robbie back .  it might be done  you know .  i can get in touch with           no .     she replied  grimly .     i won   t hear of it .  we   re not giving up that easily .  my child shall not be brought up by a robot if it takes years to break her of it .      weston picked up his paper again with a disappointed air .     a year of this will have me prematurely gray .         you   re a big help  george     was the frigid answer .     what gloria needs is a change of environment .  of course she can   t forget robbie here .  how can she when every tree and rock reminds her of him .  it is really the silliest situation i have ever heard of .  imagine a child pining away for the loss of a robot .         well  stick to the point .  what   s the change in environment you   re planning .         we   re going to take her to new york .         the city .  in august .  say  do you know what new york is like in august .  it   s unbearable .         millions do bear it .         they don   t have a place like this to go to .  if they didn   t have to stay in new york  they wouldn   t .         well  we have to .  i say we   re leaving now     or as soon as we can make the arrangements .  in the city  gloria will find sufficient interests and sufficient friends to perk her up and make her forget that machine .         oh  lord     groaned the lesser half     those frying pavements .         we have to     was the unshaken response .     gloria has lost five pounds in the last month and my little girl   s health is more important to me than your comfort .         it   s a pity you didn   t think of your little girl   s health before you deprived her of her pet robot     he muttered     but to himself .     gloria displayed immediate signs of improvement when told of the impending trip to the city .  she spoke little of it  but when she did  it was always with lively anticipation .  again  she began to smile and to eat with something of her former appetite .   mrs .  weston hugged herself for joy and lost no opportunity to triumph over her still skeptical husband .      you see  george  she helps with the packing like a little angel  and chatters away as if she hadn   t a care in the world .  it   s just as i told you     all we need do is substitute other interests .         hmpph     was the skeptical response     i hope so .      preliminaries were gone through quickly .  arrangements were made for the preparation of their city home and a couple were engaged as housekeepers for the country home .  when the day of the trip finally did come  gloria was all but her old self again  and no mention of robbie passed her lips at all .   in high good humor the family took a taxi gyro to the airport  weston would have preferred using his own private    gyro  but it was only a two seater with no room for baggage  and entered the waiting liner .      come  gloria     called mrs .  weston .     i   ve saved you a seat near the window so you can watch the scenery .      gloria trotted down the aisle cheerily  flattened her nose into a white oval against the thick clear glass  and watched with an intentness that increased as the sudden coughing of the motor drifted backward into the interior .  she was too young to be frightened when the ground dropped away as if let through a trap door and she herself suddenly became twice her usual weight  but not too young to be mightily interested .  it wasn   t until the ground had changed into a tiny patchwork quilt that she withdrew her nose  and faced her mother again .      will we soon be in the city  mamma .     she asked  rubbing her chilled nose  and watching with interest as the patch of moisture which her breath had formed on the pane shrank slowly and vanished .      in about half an hour  dear .     then  with just the faintest trace of anxiety     aren   t you glad we   re going .  don   t you think you   ll be very happy in the city with all the buildings and people and things to see .  we   ll go to the visivox every day and see shows and go to the circus and the beach and           yes  mamma     was gloria   s unenthusiastic rejoinder .  the liner passed over a bank of clouds at the moment  and gloria was instantly absorbed in the usual spectacle of clouds underneath one .  then they were over clear sky again  and she turned to her mother with a sudden mysterious air of secret knowledge .      i know why we   re going to the city  mamma .         do you .     mrs .  weston was puzzled .     why  dear .         you didn   t tell me because you wanted it to be a surprise  but i know .     for a moment  she was lost in admiration at her own acute penetration  and then she laughed gaily .     we   re going to new york so we can find robbie  aren   t we .     with detectives .      the statement caught george weston in the middle of a drink of water  with disastrous results .  there was a sort of strangled gasp  a geyser of water  and then a bout of choking coughs .  when all was over  he stood there  a red faced  water drenched and very  very annoyed person .   mrs .  weston maintained her composure  but when gloria repeated her question in a more anxious tone of voice  she found her temper rather bent .      maybe     she retorted  tartly .     now sit and be still  for heaven   s sake .        new york city       a . d .   was a paradise for the sightseer more than ever in its history .  gloria   s parents realized this and made the most of it .   on direct orders from his wife  george weston arranged to have his business take care of itself for a month or so  in order to be free to spend the time in what he termed     dissipating gloria to the verge of ruin .     like everything else weston did  this was gone about in an efficient  thorough  and business like way .  before the month had passed  nothing that could be done had not been done .   she was taken to the top of the half mile tall roosevelt building  to gaze down in awe upon the jagged panorama of rooftops that blended far off in the fields of long island and the flatlands of new jersey .  they visited the zoos where gloria stared in delicious fright at the    real live lion     rather disappointed that the keepers fed him raw steaks  instead of human beings  as she had expected   and asked insistently and peremptorily to see    the whale .      the various museums came in for their share of attention  together with the parks and the beaches and the aquarium .   she was taken halfway up the hudson in an excursion steamer fitted out in the archaism of the mad twenties .  she traveled into the stratosphere on an exhibition trip  where the sky turned deep purple and the stars came out and the misty earth below looked like a huge concave bowl .  down under the waters of the long island sound she was taken in a glass walled sub sea vessel  where in a green and wavering world  quaint and curious sea things ogled her and wiggled suddenly away .   on a more prosaic level  mrs .  weston took her to the department stores where she could revel in another type of fairyland .   in fact  when the month had nearly sped  the westons were convinced that everything conceivable had been done to take gloria   s mind once and for all off the departed robbie     but they were not quite sure they had succeeded .   the fact remained that wherever gloria went  she displayed the most absorbed and concentrated interest in such robots as happened to be present .  no matter how exciting the spectacle before her  nor how novel to her girlish eyes  she turned away instantly if the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of metallic movement .   mrs .  weston went out of her way to keep gloria away from all robots .   and the matter was finally climaxed in the episode at the museum of science and industry .  the museum had announced a special    children   s program    in which exhibits of scientific witchery scaled down to the child mind were to be shown .  the westons  of course  placed it upon their list of    absolutely .      it was while the westons were standing totally absorbed in the exploits of a powerful electro magnet that mrs .  weston suddenly became aware of the fact that gloria was no longer with her .  initial panic gave way to calm decision and  enlisting the aid of three attendants  a careful search was begun .   gloria  of course  was not one to wander aimlessly  however .  for her age  she was an unusually determined and purposeful girl  quite full of the maternal genes in that respect .  she had seen a huge sign on the third floor  which had said     this way to the talking robot    having spelled it out to herself and having noticed that her parents did not seem to wish to move in the proper direction  she did the obvious thing .  waiting for an opportune moment of parental distraction  she calmly disengaged herself and followed the sign .     the talking robot was a tour de force  a thoroughly impractical device  possessing publicity value only .  once an hour  an escorted group stood before it and asked questions of the robot engineer in charge in careful whispers .  those the engineer decided were suitable for the robot   s circuits were transmitted to the talking robot .   it was rather dull .  it may be nice to know that the square of fourteen is one hundred ninety six  that the temperature at the moment is    degrees fahrenheit  and the air pressure    .    inches of mercury  that the atomic weight of sodium is     but one doesn   t really need a robot for that .  one especially does not need an unwieldy  totally immobile mass of wires and coils spreading over twenty five square yards .   few people bothered to return for a second helping  but one girl in her middle teens sat quietly on a bench waiting for a third .  she was the only one in the room when gloria entered .   gloria did not look at her .  to her at the moment  another human being was but an inconsiderable item .  she saved her attention for this large thing with the wheels .  for a moment  she hesitated in dismay .  it didn   t look like any robot she had ever seen .   cautiously and doubtfully she raised her treble voice     please  mr .  robot  sir  are you the talking robot  sir .     she wasn   t sure  but it seemed to her that a robot that actually talked was worth a great deal of politeness .    the girl in her mid teens allowed a look of intense concentration to cross her thin  plain face .  she whipped out a small notebook and began writing in rapid pothooks .    there was an oily whir of gears and a mechanically timbered voice boomed out in words that lacked accent and intonation     i  am  the  robot  that  talks .      gloria stared at it ruefully .  it did talk  but the sound came from inside somewheres .  there was no face to talk to .  she said     can you help me  mr .  robot  sir .      the talking robot was designed to answer questions  and only such questions as it could answer had ever been put to it .  it was quite confident of its ability  therefore     i    can    help    you .         thank you  mr .  robot  sir .  have you seen robbie .         who    is robbie .         he   s a robot  mr .  robot  sir .     she stretched to tiptoes .     he   s about so high  mr .  robot  sir  only higher  and he   s very nice .  he   s got a head  you know .  i mean you haven   t  but he has  mr .  robot  sir .      the talking robot had been left behind     a    robot .         yes  mr .  robot  sir .  a robot just like you  except he can   t talk  of course  and     looks like a real person .         a    robot    like    me .         yes  mr .  robot  sir .      to which the talking robot   s only response was an erratic splutter and an occasional incoherent sound .  the radical generalization offered it  i . e .   its existence  not as a particular object  but as a member of a general group  was too much for it .  loyally  it tried to encompass the concept and half a dozen coils burnt out .  little warning signals were buzzing .    the girl in her mid teens left at that point .  she had enough for her physics   paper on    practical aspects of robotics .     this paper was susan calvin   s first of many on the subject .    gloria stood waiting  with carefully concealed impatience  for the machine   s answer when she heard the cry behind her of    there she is     and recognized that cry as her mother   s .      what are you doing here  you bad girl .     cried mrs .  weston  anxiety dissolving at once into anger .     do you know you frightened your mamma and daddy almost to death .  why did you run away .      the robot engineer had also dashed in  tearing his hair  and demanding who of the gathering crowd had tampered with the machine .     can   t anybody read signs .     he yelled .     you   re not allowed in here without an attendant .      gloria raised her grieved voice over the din     i only came to see the talking robot  mamma .  i thought he might know where robbie was because they   re both robots .     and then  as the thought of robbie was suddenly brought forcefully home to her  she burst into a sudden storm of tears     and i got to find robbie  mamma .  i got to .      mrs .  weston strangled a cry  and said     oh  good heavens .  come home  george .  this is more than i can stand .      that evening  george weston left for several hours  and the next morning  he approached his wife with something that looked suspiciously like smug complacence .      i   ve got an idea  grace .         about what .     was the gloomy  uninterested query .      about gloria .         you   re not going to suggest buying back that robot .         no  of course not .         then go ahead .  i might as well listen to you .  nothing i   ve done seems to have done any good .             all right .  here   s what i   ve been thinking .  the whole trouble with gloria is that she thinks of robbie as a person and not as a machine .  naturally  she can   t forget him .  now if we managed to convince her that robbie was nothing more than a mess of steel and copper in the form of sheets and wires with electricity its juice of life  how long would her longings last .  it   s the psychological attack  if you see my point .         how do you plan to do it .         simple .  where do you suppose i went last night .  i persuaded robertson of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .  to arrange for a complete tour of his premises tomorrow .  the three of us will go  and by the time we   re through  gloria will have it drilled into her that a robot is not alive .      mrs .  weston   s eyes widened gradually and something glinted in her eyes that was quite like sudden admiration     why  george  that   s a good idea .      and george weston   s vest buttons strained .     only kind i have     he said .     mr .  struthers was a conscientious general manager and naturally inclined to be a bit talkative .  the combination  therefore  resulted in a tour that was fully explained  perhaps even over abundantly explained  at every step .  however  mrs .  weston was not bored .  indeed  she stopped him several times and begged him to repeat his statements in simpler language so that gloria might understand .  under the influence of this appreciation of his narrative powers  mr .  struthers expanded genially and became ever more communicative  if possible .   george weston  himself  showed a gathering impatience .      pardon me  struthers     he said  breaking into the middle of a lecture on the photoelectric cell     haven   t you a section of the factory where only robot labor is employed .         eh .  oh  yes .  yes  indeed .     he smiled at mrs .  weston .     a vicious circle in a way  robots creating more robots .  of course  we are not making a general practice out of it .  for one thing  the unions would never let us .  but we can turn out a very few robots using robot labor exclusively  merely as a sort of scientific experiment .  you see     he tapped his pince nez into one palm argumentatively     what the labor unions don   t realize     and i say this as a man who has always been very sympathetic with the labor movement in general     is that the advent of the robot  while involving some dislocation to begin with  will inevitably           yes  struthers     said weston     but about that section of the factory you speak of     may we see it .  it would be very interesting  i   m sure .         yes .  yes  of course .     mr .  struthers replaced his pince nez in one convulsive movement and gave vent to a soft cough of discomfiture .     follow me  please .      he was comparatively quiet while leading the three through a long corridor and down a flight of stairs .  then  when they had entered a large well lit room that buzzed with metallic activity  the sluices opened and the flood of explanation poured forth again .      there you are .     he said with pride in his voice .     robots only .  five men act as overseers and they don   t even stay in this room .  in five years  that is  since we began this project  not a single accident has occurred .  of course  the robots here assembled are comparatively simple  but .  .  .      the general manager   s voice had long died to a rather soothing murmur in gloria   s ears .  the whole trip seemed rather dull and pointless to her  though there were many robots in sight .  none were even remotely like robbie  though  and she surveyed them with open contempt .   in this room  there weren   t any people at all  she noticed .  then her eyes fell upon six or seven robots busily engaged at a round table halfway across the room .  they widened in incredulous surprise .  it was a big room .  she couldn   t see for sure  but one of the robots looked like     looked like     it was .      robbie .     her shriek pierced the air  and one of the robots about the table faltered and dropped the tool he was holding .  gloria went almost mad with joy .  squeezing through the railing before either parent could stop her  she dropped lightly to the floor a few feet below  and ran toward her robbie  arms waving and hair flying .   and the three horrified adults  as they stood frozen in their tracks  saw what the excited little girl did not see      a huge  lumbering tractor bearing blindly down upon its appointed track .   it took split seconds for weston to come to his senses  and those split seconds meant everything  for gloria could not be overtaken .  although weston vaulted the railing in a wild attempt  it was obviously hopeless .  mr .  struthers signaled wildly to the overseers to stop the tractor  but the overseers were only human and it took time to act .   it was only robbie that acted immediately and with precision .   with metal legs eating up the space between himself and his little mistress he charged down from the opposite direction .  everything then happened at once .  with one sweep of an arm  robbie snatched up gloria  slackening his speed not one iota  and  consequently  knocking every breath of air out of her .  weston  not quite comprehending all that was happening  felt  rather than saw  robbie brush past him  and came to a sudden bewildered halt .  the tractor intersected gloria   s path half a second after robbie had  rolled on ten feet further and came to a grinding  long drawn out stop .   gloria regained her breath  submitted to a series of passionate hugs on the part of both her parents and turned eagerly toward robbie .  as far as she was concerned  nothing had happened except that she had found her friend .   but mrs .  weston   s expression had changed from one of relief to one of dark suspicion .  she turned to her husband  and  despite her disheveled and undignified appearance  managed to look quite formidable     you engineered this  didn   t you .   george weston swabbed at a hot forehead with his handkerchief .  his hand was unsteady  and his lips could curve only into a tremulous and exceedingly weak smile .   mrs .  weston pursued the thought     robbie wasn   t designed for engineering or construction work .  he couldn   t be of any use to them .  you had him placed there deliberately so that gloria would find him .  you know you did .         well  i did     said weston .     but  grace  how was i to know the reunion would be so violent .  and robbie has saved her life  you   ll have to admit that .  you can   t send him away again .      grace weston considered .  she turned toward gloria and robbie and watched them abstractedly for a moment .  gloria had a grip about the robot   s neck that would have asphyxiated any creature but one of metal  and was prattling nonsense in half hysterical frenzy .  robbie   s chrome steel arms  capable of bending a bar of steel two inches in diameter into a pretzel  wound about the little girl gently and lovingly  and his eyes glowed a deep  deep red .      well     said mrs .  weston  at last     i guess he can stay with us until he rusts .        reason    half a year later  the boys had changed their minds .  the flame of a giant sun had given way to the soft blackness of space but external variations mean little in the business of checking the workings of experimental robots .  whatever the background  one is face to face with an inscrutable positronic brain  which the slide rule geniuses say should work thus and so .   except that they don   t .  powell and donovan found that out after they had been on the station less than two weeks .   gregory powell spaced his words for emphasis     one week ago  donovan and i put you together .     his brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache .   it was quiet in the officer   s room on solar station        except for the soft purring of the mighty beam director somewhere far below .   robot qt   sat immovable .  the burnished plates of his body gleamed in the luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes  were fixed steadily upon the earthman at the other side of the table .   powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves .  these robots possessed peculiar brains .  oh  the three laws of robotics held .  they had to .  all of u .  s .  robots  from robertson himself to the new floor sweeper  would insist on that .  so qt   was safe .  and yet the qt models were the first of their kind  and this was the first of the qt   s .  mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact .   finally  the robot spoke .  his voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm     do you realize the seriousness of such a statement  powell .         something made you  cutie     pointed out powell .     you admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago .  i   m giving you the explanation .  donovan and i put you together from the parts shipped us .      cutie gazed upon his long  supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification     it strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that .  for you to make me seems improbable .      the earthman laughed quite suddenly     in earth   s name  why .         call it intuition .  that   s all it is so far .  but i intend to reason it out  though .  a chain of valid reasoning can end only with the determination of truth  and i   ll stick till i get there .      powell stood up and seated himself at the table   s edge next to the robot .  he felt a sudden strong sympathy for this strange machine .  it was not at all like the ordinary robot  attending to his specialized task at the station with the intensity of a deeply ingrooved positronic path .   he placed a hand upon cutie   s steel shoulder and the metal was cold and hard to the touch .      cutie     he said     i   m going to try to explain something to you .  you   re the first robot who   s ever exhibited curiosity as to his own existence     and i think the first that   s really intelligent enough to understand the world outside .  here  come with me .      the robot rose erect smoothly and his thickly sponge rubber soled feet made no noise as he followed powell .  the earthman touched a button and a square section of the wall flickered aside .  the thick  clear glass revealed space     star speckled .      i   ve seen that in the observation ports in the engine room     said cutie .      i know     said powell .     what do you think it is .         exactly what it seems     a black material just beyond this glass that is spotted with little gleaming dots .  i know that our director sends out beams to some of these dots  always to the same ones     and also that these dots shift and that the beams shift with them .  that is all .         good .  now i want you to listen carefully .  the blackness is emptiness vast emptiness stretching out infinitely .  the little  gleaming dots are huge masses of energy filled matter .  they are globes  some of them millions of miles in diameter and for comparison  this station is only one mile across .  they seem so tiny because they are incredibly far off .      the dots to which our energy beams are directed are nearer and much smaller .  they are cold and hard and human beings like myself live upon their surfaces     many billions of them .  it is from one of these worlds that donovan and i come .  our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us .  we call that globe the sun and it is on the other side of the station where you can   t see it .      cutie remained motionless before the port  like a steel statue .  his head did not turn as he spoke     which particular dot of light do you claim to come from .      powell searched     there it is  the very bright one in the corner  we call it earth .     he grinned .     good old earth .  there are three billions of us there  cutie     and in about two weeks i   ll be back there with them     and then  surprisingly enough  cutie hummed abstractedly .  there was no tune to it  but it possessed a curious twanging quality as of plucked strings .  it ceased as suddenly as it had begun     but where do i come in  powell .  you haven   t explained my existence .         the rest is simple .  when these stations were first established to feed solar energy to the planets  they were run by humans .  however  the heat  the hard solar radiations  and the electron storms made the post a difficult one .  robots were developed to replace human labor and now only two human executives are required for each station .  we are trying to replace even those  and that   s where you come in .  you   re the highest type of robot ever developed and if you show the ability to run this station independently  no human need ever come here again except to bring parts for repairs .      his hand went up and the metal visi lid snapped back into place .  powell returned to the table and polished an apple upon his sleeve before biting into it .   the red glow of the robot   s eyes held him .     do you expect me     said cutie slowly     to believe any such complicated  implausible hypothesis as you have just outlined .  what do you take me for .      powell sputtered apple fragments onto the table and turned red .     why damn you  it wasn   t a hypothesis .  those were facts     cutie sounded grim     globes of energy millions of miles across .  worlds with three billion humans on them .  infinite emptiness .  sorry  powell  but i don   t believe it .  i   ll puzzle this thing out for myself .  good by .      he turned and stalked out of the room .  he brushed past michael donovan on the threshold with a grave nod and passed down the corridor  oblivious to the astounded stare that followed him .   mike donovan rumpled his red hair and shot an annoyed glance at powell     what was that walking junk yard talking about .  what doesn   t he believe .      the other dragged at his mustache bitterly .     he   s a skeptic     was the bitter response .     he doesn   t believe we made him or that earth exists or space or stars .         sizzling saturn  we   ve got a lunatic robot on our hands .         he says he   s going to figure it all out for himself .         well  now     said donovan sweetly     i do hope he   ll condescend to explain it all to me after he   s puzzled everything out    then  with sudden rage     listen .  if that metal mess gives me any lip like that  i   ll knock that chromium cranium right off its torso .      he seated himself with a jerk and drew a paper backed mystery novel out of his inner jacket pocket     that robot gives me the willies anyway     too damned inquisitive .        mike donovan growled from behind a huge lettuce and tomato sandwich as cutie knocked gently and entered .      is powell here .      donovan   s voice was muffled  with pauses for mastication     he   s gathering data on electronic stream functions .  we   re heading for a storm  looks like .      gregory powell entered as he spoke  eyes on the graphed paper in his hands  and dropped into a chair .  he spread the sheets out before him and began scribbling calculations .  donovan stared over his shoulder  crunching lettuce and dribbling breadcrumbs .  cutie waited silently .   powell looked up     the zeta potential is rising  but slowly .  just the same  the stream functions are erratic and i don   t know what to expect .  oh  hello  cutie .  i thought you were supervising the installation of the new drive bar .         it   s done     said the robot quietly     and so i   ve come to have a talk with the two of you        oh .     powell looked uncomfortable .     well  sit down .  no  not that chair .  one of the legs is weak and you   re no lightweight .      the robot did so and said placidly     i have come to a decision .      donovan glowered and put the remnants of his sandwich aside .     if it   s on any of that screwy        the other motioned impatiently for silence     go ahead  cutie .  we   re listening .         i have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection     said cutie     and the results have been most interesting .  i began at the one sure assumption i felt permitted to make .  i  myself  exist  because i think        powell groaned     oh  jupiter  a robot descartes .         who   s descartes .     demanded donovan .     listen  do we have to sit here and listen to this metal maniac           keep quiet  mike .      cutie continued imperturbably     and the question that immediately arose was  just what is the cause of my existence .      powell   s jaw set lumpily .     you   re being foolish .  i told you already that we made you .         and if you don   t believe us     added donovan     we   ll gladly take you apart .      the robot spread his strong hands in a deprecatory gesture     i accept nothing on authority .  a hypothesis must be backed by reason  or else it is worthless     and it goes against all the dictates of logic to suppose that you made me .      powell dropped a restraining arm upon donovan   s suddenly bunched fist .     just why do you say that .      cutie laughed .  it was a very inhuman laugh     the most machine like utterance he had yet given vent to .  it was sharp and explosive  as regular as a metronome and as uninflected .      look at you     he said finally .     i say this in no spirit of contempt  but look at you .  the material you are made of is soft and flabby  lacking endurance and strength  depending for energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material     like that .     he pointed a disapproving finger at what remained of donovan   s sandwich .     periodically you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature  air pressure  humidity  or radiation intensity impairs your efficiency .  you are makeshift .      i  on the other hand  am a finished product .  i absorb electrical energy directly and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency .  i am composed of strong metal  am continuously conscious  and can stand extremes of environment easily .  these are facts which  with the self evident proposition that no being can create another being superior to itself  smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing .        donovan   s muttered curses rose into intelligibility as he sprang to his feet  rusty eyebrows drawn low .     all right  you son of a hunk of iron ore  if we didn   t make you  who did .      cutie nodded gravely .     very good  donovan .  that was indeed the next question .  evidently my creator must be more powerful than myself and so there was only one possibility .      the earthmen looked blank and cutie continued     what is the center of activities here in the station .  what do we all serve .  what absorbs all our attention .     he waited expectantly .   donovan turned a startled look upon his companion .     i   ll bet this tinplated screwball is talking about the energy converter itself .         is that right  cutie .     grinned powell .      i am talking about the master     came the cold  sharp answer .   it was the signal for a roar of laughter from donovan  and powell himself dissolved into a half suppressed giggle .   cutie had risen to his feet and his gleaming eyes passed from one earthman to the other .     it is so just the same and i don   t wonder that you refuse to believe .  you two are not long to stay here  i   m sure .  powell himself said that at first only men served the master  that there followed robots for the routine work  and  finally  myself for the executive labor .  the facts are no doubt true  but the explanation entirely illogical .  do you want the truth behind it all .         go ahead  cutie .  you   re amusing .         the master created humans first as the lowest type  most easily formed .  gradually  he replaced them by robots  the next higher step  and finally he created me to take the place of the last humans .  from now on  i serve the master .         you   ll do nothing of the sort     said powell sharply .     you   ll follow our orders and keep quiet  until we   re satisfied that you can run the converter .  get that .  the converter     not the master .  if you don   t satisfy us  you will be dismantled .  and now     if you don   t mind     you can leave .  and take this data with you and file it properly .      cutie accepted the graphs handed him and left without another word .  donovan leaned back heavily in his chair and shoved thick fingers through his hair .      there   s going to be trouble with that robot .  he   s pure nuts .        the drowsy hum of the converter is louder in the control room and mixed with it is the chuckle of the geiger counters and the erratic buzzing of half a dozen little signal lights .   donovan withdrew his eye from the telescope and flashed the luxites on .     the beam from station    caught mars on schedule .  we can break ours now .      powell nodded abstractedly .     cutie   s down in the engine room .  i   ll flash the signal and he can take care of it .  look  mike  what do you think of these figures .      the other cocked an eye at them and whistled .     boy  that   s what i call gamma ray intensity .  old sol is feeling his oats  all right .         yeah     was the sour response     and we   re in a bad position for an electron storm  too .  our earth beam is right in the probable path .     he shoved his chair away from the table pettishly .     nuts .  if it would only hold off till relief got here  but that   s ten days off .  say  mike  go on down and keep an eye on cutie  will you .         o . k .  throw me some of those almonds .     he snatched at the bag thrown him and headed for the elevator .   it slid smoothly downward  and opened onto a narrow catwalk in the huge engine room .  donovan leaned over the railing and looked down .  the huge generators were in motion and from the l tubes came the low pitched whir that pervaded the entire station .   he could make out cutie   s large  gleaming figure at the martian l tube  watching closely as the team of robots worked in close knit unison .   and then donovan stiffened .  the robots  dwarfed by the mighty l tube  lined up before it  heads bowed at a stiff angle  while cutie walked up and down the line slowly .  fifteen seconds passed  and then  with a clank heard above the clamorous purring all about  they fell to their knees .   donovan squawked and raced down the narrow staircase .  he came charging down upon them  complexion matching his hair and clenched fists beating the air furiously .      what the devil is this  you brainless lumps .  come on .  get busy with that l tube .  if you don   t have it apart  cleaned  and together again before the day is out  i   ll coagulate your brains with alternating current .      not a robot moved .   even cutie at the far end     the only one on his feet     remained silent  eyes fixed upon the gloomy recesses of the vast machine before him .   donovan shoved hard against the nearest robot .      stand up .     he roared .   slowly  the robot obeyed .  his photoelectric eyes focused reproachfully upon the earthman .      there is no master but the master     he said     and qt   is his prophet .         huh .     donovan became aware of twenty pairs of mechanical eyes fixed upon him and twenty stiff timbered voices declaiming solemnly      there is no master but the master and qt   is his prophet .         i   m afraid     put in cutie himself at this point     that my friends obey a higher one than you  now .         the hell they do .  you get out of here .  i   ll settle with you later and with these animated gadgets right now .      cutie shook his heavy head slowly .     i   m sorry  but you don   t understand .  these are robots     and that means they are reasoning beings .  they recognize the master  now that i have preached truth to them .  all the robots do .  they call me the prophet .     his head drooped .     i am unworthy     but perhaps        donovan located his breath and put it to use .     is that so .  now  isn   t that nice .  now  isn   t that just fine .  just let me tell you something  my brass baboon .  there isn   t any master and there isn   t any prophet and there isn   t any question as to who   s giving the orders .  understand .     his voice shot to a roar .     now  get out .         i obey only the master .         damn the master .     donovan spat at the l tube .     that for the master .  do as i say .      cutie said nothing  nor did any other robot  but donovan became aware of a sudden heightening of tension .  the cold  staring eyes deepened their crimson  and cutie seemed stiffer than ever .      sacrilege     he whispered     voice metallic with emotion .   donovan felt the first sudden touch of fear as cutie approached .  a robot could not feel anger     but cutie   s eyes were unreadable .      i am sorry  donovan     said the robot     but you can no longer stay here after this .  henceforth powell and you are barred from the control room and the engine room .      his hand gestured quietly and in a moment two robots had pinned donovan   s arms to his sides .   donovan had time for one startled gasp as he felt himself lifted from the floor and carried up the stairs at a pace rather better than a canter .     gregory powell raced up and down the officer   s room  fist tightly balled .  he cast a look of furious frustration at the closed door and scowled bitterly at donovan .      why the devil did you have to spit at the l tube .      mike donovan  sunk deep in his chair  slammed at its arms savagely .     what did you expect me to do with that electrified scarecrow .  i   m not going to knuckle under to any do jigger i put together myself .         no     came back sourly     but here you are in the officer   s room with two robots standing guard at the door .  that   s not knuckling under  is it .      donovan snarled .     wait till we get back to base .  someone   s going to pay for this .  those robots must obey us .  it   s the second law .         what   s the use of saying that .  they aren   t obeying us .  and there   s probably some reason for it that we   ll figure out too late .  by the way  do you know what   s going to happen to us when we get back to base .     he stopped before donovan   s chair and stared savagely at him .      what .         oh  nothing .  just back to mercury mines for twenty years .  or maybe ceres penitentiary .         what are you talking about .         the electron storm that   s coming up .  do you know it   s heading straight dead center across the earth beam .  i had just figured that out when that robot dragged me out of my chair .      donovan was suddenly pale .     sizzling saturn .         and do you know what   s going to happen to the beam     because the storm will be a lulu .  it   s going to jump like a flea with the itch .  with only cutie at the controls  it   s going to go out of focus and if it does  heaven help earth     and us .      donovan was wrenching at the door wildly  when powell was only half through .  the door opened  and the earthman shot through to come up hard against an immovable steel arm .   the robot stared abstractedly at the panting  struggling earthman .     the prophet orders you to remain .  please do .     his arm shoved  donovan reeled backward  and as he did so  cutie turned the corner at the far end of the corridor .  he motioned the guardian robots away  entered the officer   s room and closed the door gently .   donovan whirled on cutie in breathless indignation .     this has gone far enough .  you   re going to pay for this farce .         please  don   t be annoyed     replied the robot mildly .     it was bound to come eventually  anyway .  you see  you two have lost your function .         i beg your pardon     powell drew himself up stiffly .     just what do you mean  we   ve lost our function .         until i was created     answered cube     you tended the master .  that privilege is mine now and your only reason for existence has vanished .  isn   t that obvious .         not quite     replied powell bitterly     but what do you expect us to do now .      cutie did not answer immediately .  he remained silent  as if in thought  and then one arm shot out and draped itself about powell   s shoulder .  the other grasped donovan   s wrist and drew him closer .      i like you two .  you   re inferior creatures  with poor reasoning faculties  but i really feel a sort of affection for you .  you have served the master well  and he will reward you for that .  now that your service is over  you will probably not exist much longer  but as long as you do  you shall be provided food  clothing and shelter  so long as you stay out of the control room and the engine room .         he   s pensioning us off  greg .     yelled donovan .     do something about it .  it   s humiliating .         look here  cutie  we can   t stand for this .  we   re the bosses .  this station is only a creation of human beings like me     human beings that live on earth and other planets .  this is only an energy relay .  you   re only     aw  nuts .        cutie shook his head gravely .     this amounts to an obsession .  why should you insist so on an absolutely false view of life .  admitted that non robots lack the reasoning faculty  there is still the problem of        his voice died into reflective silence  and donovan said with whispered intensity     if you only had a flesh and blood face  i would break it in .      powell   s fingers were in his mustache and his eyes were slitted .     listen  cutie  if there is no such thing as earth  how do you account for what you see through a telescope .         pardon me .      the earthman smiled .     i   ve got you  eh .  you   ve made quite a few telescopic observations since being put together  cutie .  have you noticed that several of those specks of light outside become disks when so viewed .         oh  that .  why certainly .  it is simple magnification     for the purpose of more exact aiming of the beam .         why aren   t the stars equally magnified then .             you mean the other dots .  well  no beams go to them so no magnification is necessary .  really  powell  even you ought to be able to figure these things out .      powell stared bleakly upward .     but you see more stars through a telescope .  where do they come from .  jumping jupiter  where do they come from .      cutie was annoyed .     listen  powell  do you think i   m going to waste my time trying to pin physical interpretations upon every optical illusion of our instruments .  since when is the evidence of our senses any match for the clear light of rigid reason .         look     clamored donovan  suddenly  writhing out from under cutie   s friendly  but metal heavy arm     let   s get to the nub of the thing .  why the beams at all .  we   re giving you a good  logical explanation .  can you do better .         the beams     was the stiff reply     are put out by the master for his own purposes .  there are some things        he raised his eyes devoutly upward    that are not to be probed into by us .  in this matter  i seek only to serve and not to question .      powell sat down slowly and buried his face in shaking hands .     get out of here  cutie .  get out and let me think .         i   ll send you food     said cutie agreeably .   a groan was the only answer and the robot left .      greg     was donovan   s huskily whispered observation     this calls for strategy .  we   ve got to get him when he isn   t expecting it and short circuit him .  concentrated nitric acid in his joints           don   t be a dope  mike .  do you suppose he   s going to let us get near him with acid in our hands .  we   ve got to talk to him  i tell you .  we   ve got to argue him into letting us back into the control room inside of forty eight hours or our goose is broiled to a crisp .      he rocked back and forth in an agony of impotence .     who the heck wants to argue with a robot .  it   s .  .  .  it   s           mortifying     finished donovan .      worse .         say .     donovan laughed suddenly .     why argue .  let   s show him .  let   s build us another robot right before his eyes .  he   ll have to eat his words then .      a slowly widening smile appeared on powell   s face .   donovan continued     and think of that screwball   s face when he sees us do it .        robots are  of course  manufactured on earth  but their shipment through apace is much simpler if it can be done in parts to be put together at their place of use .  it also  incidentally  eliminates the possibility of robots  in complete adjustment  wandering off while still on earth and thus bringing u .  s .  robots face to face with the strict laws against robots on earth .   still  it placed upon men such as powell and donovan the necessity of synthesis of complete robots      a grievous and complicated task .   powell and donovan were never so aware of that fact as upon that particular day when  in the assembly room  they undertook to create a robot under the watchful eyes of qt    prophet of the master .   the robot in question  a simple mc model  lay upon the table  almost complete .  three hours    work left only the head undone  and powell paused to swab his forehead and glanced uncertainly at cutie .   the glance was not a reassuring one .  for three hours  cutie had sat  speechless and motionless  and his face  inexpressive at all times  was now absolutely unreadable .   powell groaned .     let   s get the brain in now  mike .      donovan uncapped the tightly sealed container and from the oil bath within he withdrew a second cube .  opening this in turn  he removed a globe from its sponge rubber casing .   he handled it gingerly  for it was the most complicated mechanism ever created by man .  inside the thin platinum plated    skin    of the globe was a positronic brain  in whose delicately unstable structure were enforced calculated neuronic paths  which imbued each robot with what amounted to a pre natal education .   it fitted snugly into the cavity in the skull of the robot on the table .  blue metal closed over it and was welded tightly by the tiny atomic flare .  photoelectric eyes were attached carefully  screwed tightly into place and covered by thin  transparent sheets of steel hard plastic .   the robot awaited only the vitalizing flash of high voltage electricity  and powell paused with his hand on the switch .      now watch this  cutie .  watch this carefully .      the switch rammed home and there was a crackling hum .  the two earthmen bent anxiously over their creation .   there was vague motion only at the outset     a twitching of the joints .  the head lifted  elbows propped it up  and the mc model swung clumsily off the table .  its footing was unsteady and twice abortive grating sounds were all it could do in the direction of speech .   finally  its voice  uncertain and hesitant  took form .     i would like to start work .  where must i go .      donovan sprang to the door .     down these stairs     he said .     you will be told what to do .      the mc model was gone and the two earthmen were alone with the still unmoving cutie .      well     said powell  grinning     now do you believe that we made you .      cutie   s answer was curt and final .     no .     he said .   powell   s grin froze and then relaxed slowly .  donovan   s mouth dropped open and remained so .      you see     continued cutie  easily     you have merely put together parts already made .  you did remarkably well     instinct  i suppose     but you didn   t really create the robot .  the parts were created by the master .         listen     gasped donovan hoarsely     those parts were manufactured back on earth and sent here .         well  well     replied cutie soothingly     we won   t argue .         no  i mean it .     the earthman sprang forward and grasped the robot   s metal arm .     if you were to read the books in the library  they could explain it so that there could be no possible doubt .         the books .  i   ve read them     all of them .  they   re most ingenious .      powell broke in suddenly .     if you   ve read them  what else is there to say .  you can   t dispute their evidence .  you just can   t .      there was pity in cutie   s voice .     please  powell  i certainly don   t consider them a valid source of information .  they  too  were created by the master     and were meant for you  not for me .         how do you make that out .     demanded powell .      because i  a reasoning being  am capable of deducing truth from a priori causes .  you  being intelligent  but unreasoning  need an explanation of existence supplied to you  and this the master did .  that he supplied you with these laughable ideas of far off worlds and people is  no doubt  for the best .  your minds are probably too coarsely grained for absolute truth .  however  since it is the master   s will that you believe your books  i won   t argue with you any more .      as he left  he turned  and said in a kindly tone     but don   t feel badly .  in the master   s scheme of things there is room for all .  you poor humans have your place and though it is humble  you will be rewarded if you fill it well .      he departed with a beatific air suiting the prophet of the master and the two humans avoided each other   s eyes .   finally powell spoke with an effort .     let   s go to bed  mike .  i give up .      donovan said in a hushed voice     say  greg  you don   t suppose he   s right about all this  do you .  he sounds so confident that i        powell whirled on him .     don   t be a fool .  you   d find out whether earth exists when relief gets here next week and we have to go back to face the music .         then  for the love of jupiter  we   ve got to do something .     donovan was half in tears .     he doesn   t believe us  or the books  or his eyes .         no     said powell bitterly     he   s a reasoning robot     damn it .  he believes only reason  and there   s one trouble with that       his voice trailed away .      what   s that .     prompted donovan .      you can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason     if you pick the proper postulates .  we have ours and cutie has his .         then let   s get at those postulates in a hurry .  the storm   s due tomorrow .      powell sighed wearily .     that   s where everything falls down .  postulates are based on assumption and adhered to by faith .  nothing in the universe can shake them .  i   m going to bed .         oh  hell .  i can   t sleep .         neither can i .  but i might as well try     as a matter of principle .        twelve hours later  sleep was still just that     a matter of principle  unattainable in practice .   the storm had arrived ahead of schedule  and donovan   s florid face drained of blood as he pointed a shaking finger .  powell  stubble jawed and dry lipped  stared out the port and pulled desperately at his mustache .   under other circumstances  it might have been a beautiful sight .  the stream of high speed electrons impinging upon the energy beam fluoresced into ultra spicules of intense light .  the beam stretched out into shrinking nothingness  a glitter with dancing  shining motes .   the shaft of energy was steady  but the two earthmen knew the value of naked eyed appearances .  deviations in arc of a hundredth of a millisecond     invisible to the eye     were enough to send the beam wildly out of focus     enough to blast hundreds of square miles of earth into incandescent ruin .   and a robot  unconcerned with beam  focus  or earth  or anything but his master was at the controls .   hours passed .  the earthmen watched in hypnotized silence .  and then the darting dotlets of light dimmed and went out .  the storm had ended .   powell   s voice was flat .     it   s over .      donovan had fallen into a troubled slumber and powell   s weary eyes rested upon him enviously .  the signal flash glared over and over again  but the earthman paid no attention .  it all was unimportant .  all .  perhaps cutie was right     and he was only an inferior being with a made to order memory and a life that had outlived its purpose .   he wished he were .   cutie was standing before him .     you didn   t answer the flash  so i walked in .     his voice was low .     you don   t look at all well  and i   m afraid your term of existence is drawing to an end .  still  would you like to see some of the readings recorded today .      dimly  powell was aware that the robot was making a friendly gesture  perhaps to quiet some lingering remorse in forcibly replacing the humans at the controls of the station .  he accepted the sheets held out to him and gazed at them unseeingly .   cutie seemed pleased .     of course  it is a great privilege to serve the master .  you mustn   t feel too badly about my having replaced you .      powell grunted and shifted from one sheet to the other mechanically until his blurred sight focused upon a thin red line that wobbled its way across the ruled paper .   he stared     and stared again .  he gripped it hard in both fists and rose to his feet  still staring .  the other sheets dropped to the floor  unheeded .      mike  mike .     he was shaking the other madly .     he held it steady .      donovan came to life .     what .  wh where       and he  too  gazed with bulging eyes upon the record before him .   cutie broke in .     what is wrong .         you kept it in focus     stuttered powell .     did you know that .         focus .  what   s that .         you kept the beam directed sharply at the receiving station     to within a ten thousandth of a millisecond of arc .         what receiving station .         on earth .  the receiving station on earth     babbled powell .     you kept it in focus .      cutie turned on his heel in annoyance .     it is impossible to perform any act of kindness toward you two .  always the same phantasm .  i merely kept all dials at equilibrium in accordance with the will of the master .      gathering the scattered papers together  he withdrew stiffly  and donovan said  as he left     well  i   ll be damned .      he turned to powell .     what are we going to do now .      powell felt tired  but uplifted .     nothing .  he   s just shown he can run the station perfectly .  i   ve never seen an electron storm handled so well .         but nothing   s solved .  you heard what he said of the master .  we can   t           look  mike  he follows the instructions of the master by means of dials  instruments  and graphs .  that   s all we ever followed .  as a matter of fact  it accounts for his refusal to obey us .  obedience is the second law .  no harm to humans is the first .  how can he keep humans from harm  whether he knows it or not .  why  by keeping the energy beam stable .  he knows he can keep it more stable than we can  since he insists he   s the superior being  so he must keep us out of the control room .  it   s inevitable if you consider the laws of robotics .         sure  but that   s not the point .  we can   t let him continue this nitwit stuff about the master .         why not .         because whoever heard of such a damned thing .  how are we going to trust him with the station  if he doesn   t believe in earth .         can he handle the station .         yes  but           then what   s the difference what he believes .      powell spread his arms outward with a vague smile upon his face and tumbled backward onto the bed .  he was asleep .     powell was speaking while struggling into his lightweight space jacket .      it would be a simple job     he said .     you can bring in new qt models one by one  equip them with an automatic shutoff switch to act within the week  so as to allow them enough time to learn the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  cult of the master from the prophet himself  then switch them to another station and revitalize them .  we could have two qt   s per        donovan unclasped his glassite visor and scowled .     shut up  and let   s get out of here .  relief is waiting and i won   t feel right until i actually see earth and feel the ground under my feet     just to make sure it   s really there .      the door opened as he spoke and donovan  with a smothered curse  clicked the visor to  and turned a sulky back upon cutie .   the robot approached softly and there was sorrow in his voice .     you are going .      powell nodded curtly .     there will be others in our place .      cutie sighed  with the sound of wind humming through closely spaced wires .     your term of service is over and the time of dissolution has come .  i expected it  but     well  the master   s will be done .      his tone of resignation stung powell .     save the sympathy  cube .  we   re heading for earth  not dissolution .         it is best that you think so     cutie sighed again .     i see the wisdom of the illusion now .  i would not attempt to shake your faith  even if i could .     he departed     the picture of commiseration .   powell snarled and motioned to donovan .  sealed suitcases in hand  they headed for the air lock .   the relief ship was on the outer landing and franz muller  his relief man  greeted them with stiff courtesy .  donovan made scant acknowledgment and passed into the pilot room to take over the controls from sam evans .   powell lingered .     how   s earth .      it was a conventional enough question and muller gave the conventional answer     still spinning .      powell said     good .      muller looked at him     the boys back at the u .  s .  robots have dreamed up a new one  by the way .  a multiple robot .         a what .         what i said .  there   s a big contract for it .  it must be just the thing for asteroid mining .  you have a master robot with six sub robots under it .     like your fingers .         has it been field tested .     asked powell anxiously .   muller smiled     waiting for you  i hear .      powell   s fist balled     damn it  we need a vacation .         oh  you   ll get it .  two weeks  i think .      he was donning the heavy space gloves in preparation for his term of duty here  and his thick eyebrows drew close together .     how is this new robot getting along .  it better be good  or i   ll be damned if i let it touch the controls .      powell paused before answering .  his eyes swept the proud prussian before him from the close cropped hair on the sternly stubborn head  to the feet standing stiffly at attention     and there was a sudden glow of pure gladness surging through him .      the robot is pretty good     he said slowly .     i don   t think you   ll have to bother much with the controls .      he grinned     and went into the ship .  muller would be here for several weeks .   liar .     alfred lanning lit his cigar carefully  but the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly .  his gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs .      it reads minds all right damn little doubt about that .  but why .     he looked at mathematician peter bogert     well .      bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands     that was the thirty fourth rb model we   ve turned out  lanning .  all the others were strictly orthodox .      the third man at the table frowned .  milton ashe was the youngest officer of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men  inc .   and proud of his post .      listen  bogert .  there wasn   t a hitch in the assembly from start to finish .  i guarantee that .      bogert   s thick lips spread in a patronizing smile     do you .  if you can answer for the entire assembly line  i recommend your promotion .  by exact count  there are seventy five thousand  two hundred and thirty four operations necessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain  each separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors  from five to a hundred and five .  if any one of them goes seriously wrong  the    brain    is ruined .  i quote our own information folder  ashe .      milton ashe flushed  but a fourth voice cut off his reply .      if we   re going to start by trying to fix the blame on one another  i   m leaving .     susan calvin   s hands were folded tightly in her lap  and the little lines about her thin  pale lips deepened     we   ve got a mind reading robot on our hands and it strikes me as rather important that we find out just why it reads minds .  we   re not going to do that by saying     your fault .  my fault .          her cold gray eyes fastened upon ashe  and he grinned .   lanning grinned too  and  as always at such times  his long white hair and shrewd little eyes made him the picture of a biblical patriarch     true for you  dr .  calvin .      his voice became suddenly crisp     here   s everything in pill concentrate form .  we   ve produced a positronic brain of supposedly ordinary vintage that   s got the remarkable property of being able to tune in on thought waves .  it would mark the most important advance in robotics in decades  if we knew how it happened .  we don   t  and we have to find out .  is that clear .         may i make a suggestion .     asked bogert .      go ahead .         i   d say that until we do figure out the mess     and as a mathematician i expect it to be a very devil of a mess     we keep the existence of rd    a secret .  i mean even from the other members of the staff .  as heads of the departments  we ought not to find it an insoluble problem  and the fewer know about it           bogert is right     said dr .  calvin .     ever since the interplanetary code was modified to allow robot models to be tested in the plants before being shipped out to space  antirobot propaganda has increased .  if any word leaks out about a robot being able to read minds before we can announce complete control of the phenomenon  pretty effective capital could be made out of it .      lanning sucked at his cigar and nodded gravely .  he turned to ashe     i think you said you were alone when you first stumbled on this thought reading business .         i   ll say i was alone     i got the scare of my life .  rb    had just been taken off the assembly table and they sent him down to me .  obermann was off somewheres  so i took him down to the testing rooms myself     at least i started to take him down .     ashe paused  and a tiny smile tugged at his lips     say  did any of you ever carry on a thought conversation without knowing it .      no one bothered to answer  and he continued     you don   t realize it at first  you know .  he just spoke to me     as logically and sensibly as you can imagine     and it was only when i was most of the way down to the testing rooms that i realized that i hadn   t said anything .  sure  i thought lots  but that isn   t the same thing  is it .  i locked that thing up and ran for lanning .  having it walking beside me  calmly peering into my thoughts and picking and choosing among them gave me the willies .         i imagine it would     said susan calvin thoughtfully .  her eyes fixed themselves upon ashe in an oddly intent manner .     we are so accustomed to considering our own thoughts private .      lanning broke in impatiently     then only the four of us know .  all right .  we   ve got to go about this systematically .  ashe  i want you to check over the assembly line from beginning to end    everything .  you   re to eliminate all operations in which there was no possible chance of an error  and list all those where there were  together with its nature and possible magnitude .         tall order     grunted ashe .      naturally .  of course  you   re to put the men under you to work on this     every single one if you have to  and i don   t care if we go behind schedule  either .  but they   re not to know why  you understand .         hm m m  yes .     the young technician grinned wryly .     it   s still a lulu of a job .      lanning swiveled about in his chair and faced calvin     you   ll have to tackle the job from the other direction .  you   re the robo psychologist of the plant  so you   re to study the robot itself and work backward .  try to find out how he ticks .  see what else is tied up with his telepathic powers  how far they extend  how they warp his outlook  and just exactly what harm it has done to his ordinary rb properties .  you   ve got that .      lanning didn   t wait for dr .  calvin to answer .      i   ll co ordinate the work and interpret the findings mathematically .     he puffed violently at his cigar and mumbled the rest through the smoke     bogert will help me there  of course .      bogert polished the nails of one pudgy hand with the other and said blandly     i dare say .  i know a little in the line .         well .  i   ll get started .     ashe shoved his chair back and rose .  his pleasantly youthful face crinkled in a grin     i   ve got the darnedest job of any of us  so i   m getting out of here and to work .      he left with a slurred     b    seein    ye .      susan calvin answered with a barely perceptible nod  but her eyes followed him out of sight and she did not answer when lanning grunted and said     do you want to go up and see rb    now  dr .  calvin .        rb      s photoelectric eyes lifted from the book at the muffled sound of binges turning and he was upon his feet when susan calvin entered .   she paused to readjust the huge    no entrance    sign upon the door and then approached the robot .      i   ve brought you the texts upon hyperatomic motors  herbie     a few anyway .  would you care to look at them .      rb        otherwise known as herbie     lifted the three heavy books from her arms and opened to the title page of one      hm m m .     theory of hyperatomics .         he mumbled inarticulately to himself as he flipped the pages and then spoke with an abstracted air     sit down  dr .  calvin .  this will take me a few minutes .      the psychologist seated herself and watched herbie narrowly as he took a chair at the other side of the table and went through the three books systematically .   at the end of half an hour  he put them down     of course  i know why you brought these .      the corner of dr .  calvin   s lip twitched     i was afraid you would .  it   s difficult to work with you  herbie .  you   re always a step ahead of me .         it   s the same with these books  you know  as with the others .  they just don   t interest me .  there   s nothing to your textbooks .  your science is just a mass of collected data plastered together by makeshift theory     and all so incredibly simple  that it   s scarcely worth bothering about .      it   s your fiction that interests me .  your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotions        his mighty hand gestured vaguely as he sought the proper words .   dr .  calvin whispered     i think i understand .         i see into minds  you see     the robot continued     and you have no idea how complicated they are .  i can   t begin to understand everything because my own mind has so little in common with them     but i try  and your novels help .         yes  but i   m afraid that after going through some of the harrowing emotional experiences of our present day sentimental novel        there was a tinge of bitterness in her voice        you find real minds like ours dull and colorless .         but i don   t .      the sudden energy in the response brought the other to her feet .  she felt herself reddening  and thought wildly     he must know .      herbie subsided suddenly  and muttered in a low voice from which the metallic timbre departed almost entirely .     but  of course  i know about it  dr .  calvin .  you think of it always  so how can i help but know .      her face was hard .     have you     told anyone .         of course not .     this  with genuine surprise     no one has asked me .         well  then     she flung out     i suppose you think i am a fool .         no .  it is a normal emotion .         perhaps that is why it is so foolish .     the wistfulness in her voice drowned out everything else .  some of the woman peered through the layer of doctorhood .     i am not what you would call     attractive .         if you are referring to mere physical attraction  i couldn   t judge .  but i know  in any case  that there are other types of attraction .         nor young .     dr .  calvin had scarcely heard the robot .      you are not yet forty .     an anxious insistence had crept into herbie   s voice .      thirty eight as you count the years  a shriveled sixty as far as my emotional outlook on life is concerned .  am i a psychologist for nothing .      she drove on with bitter breathlessness     and he   s barely thirty five and looks and acts younger .  do you suppose he ever sees me as anything but .  .  .  but what i am .         you are wrong .     herbie   s steel fist struck the plastic topped table with a strident clang .     listen to me        but susan calvin whirled on him now and the hunted pain in her eyes became a blaze     why should i .  what do you know about it all  anyway  you .  .  .  you machine .  i   m just a specimen to you  an interesting bug with a peculiar mind spread eagled for inspection .  it   s a wonderful example of frustration  isn   t it .  almost as good as your books .     her voice  emerging in dry sobs  choked into silence .   the robot cowered at the outburst .  he shook his head pleadingly .     won   t you listen to me  please .  i could help you if you would let me .         how .     her lips curled .     by giving me good advice .         no  not that .  it   s just that i know what other people think     milton ashe  for instance .      there was a long silence  and susan calvin   s eyes dropped .     i don   t want to know what he thinks     she gasped .     keep quiet .         i think you would want to know what he thinks     her head remained bent  but her breath came more quickly .     you are talking nonsense     she whispered .      why should i .  i am trying to help .  milton ashe   s thoughts of you       he paused .   and then the psychologist raised her head     well .      the robot said quietly     he loves you .      for a full minute  dr .  calvin did not speak .  she merely stared .  then     you are mistaken .  you must be .  why should he .         but he does .  a thing like that cannot be hidden  not from me .         but i am so .  .  .  so       she stammered to a halt .      he looks deeper than the skin  and admires intellect in others .  milton ashe is not the type to marry a head of hair and a pair of eyes .      susan calvin found herself blinking rapidly and waited before speaking .  even then her voice trembled     yet he certainly never in any way indicated           have you ever given him a chance .         how could i .  i never thought that           exactly .      the psychologist paused in thought and then looked up suddenly .     a girl visited him here at the plant half a year ago .  she was pretty  i suppose     blond and slim .  and  of course  could scarcely add two and two .  he spent all day puffing out his chest  trying to explain how a robot was put together .     the hardness had returned     not that she understood .  who was she .      herbie answered without hesitation     i know the person you are referring to .  she is his first cousin  and there is no romantic interest there  i assure you .      susan calvin rose to her feet with a vivacity almost girlish .     now isn   t that strange .  that   s exactly what i used to pretend to myself sometimes  though i never really thought so .  then it all must be true .      she ran to herbie and seized his cold  heavy hand in both hers .     thank you  herbie .     her voice was an urgent  husky whisper .     don   t tell anyone about this .  let it be our secret     and thank you again .     with that  and a convulsive squeeze of herbie   s unresponsive metal fingers  she left .   herbie turned slowly to his neglected novel  but there was no one to read his thoughts .     milton ashe stretched slowly and magnificently  to the tune of cracking joints and a chorus of grunts  and then glared at peter bogert  ph . d .      say     he said     i   ve been at this for a week now with just about no sleep .  how long do i have to keep it up .  i thought you said the positronic bombardment in vac chamber d was the solution .      bogert yawned delicately and regarded his white hands with interest .     it is .  i   m on the track .         i know what that means when a mathematician says it .  how near the end are you .         it all depends .         on what .     ashe dropped into a chair and stretched his long legs out before him .      on lanning .  the old fellow disagrees with me .     he sighed     a bit behind the times  that   s the trouble with him .  he clings to matrix mechanics as the all in all  and this problem calls for more powerful mathematical tools .  he   s so stubborn .      ashe muttered sleepily     why not ask herbie and settle the whole affair .         ask the robot .     bogert   s eyebrows climbed .      why not .  didn   t the old girl tell you .         you mean calvin .         yeah .  susie herself .  that robot   s a mathematical wiz .  he knows all about everything plus a bit on the side .  he does triple integrals in his head and eats up tensor analysis for dessert .      the mathematician stared skeptically     are you serious .         so help me .  the catch is that the dope doesn   t like math .  he would rather read slushy novels .  honest .  you should see the tripe susie keeps feeding him     purple passion    and    love in space .             dr .  calvin hasn   t said a word of this to us .         well  she hasn   t finished studying him .  you know how she is .  she likes to have everything just so before letting out the big secret .         she   s told you .         we sort of got to talking .  i have been seeing a lot of her lately .     he opened his eyes wide and frowned     say  bogie  have you been noticing anything queer about the lady lately .      bogert relaxed into an undignified grin     she   s using lipstick  if that   s what you mean .         hell  i know that .  rouge  powder and eye shadow  too .  she   s a sight .  but it   s not that .  i can   t put my finger on it .  it   s the way she talks     as if she were happy about something .     he thought a little  and then shrugged .   the other allowed himself a leer  which  for a scientist past fifty  was not a bad job     maybe she   s in love .      ashe allowed his eyes to close again     you   re nuts  bogie .  you go speak to herbie  i want to stay here and go to sleep .         right .  not that i particularly like having a robot tell me my job  nor that i think he can do it .      a soft snore was his only answer .     herbie listened carefully as peter bogert  hands in pockets  spoke with elaborate indifference .      so there you are .  i   ve been told you understand these things  and i am asking you more in curiosity than anything else .  my line of reasoning  as i have outlined it  involves a few doubtful steps  i admit  which dr .  lanning refuses to accept  and the picture is still rather incomplete .      the robot didn   t answer  and bogert said     well .         i see no mistake     herbie studied the scribbled figures .      i don   t suppose you can go any further than that .         i daren   t try .  you are a better mathematician than i  and     well  i   d hate to commit myself .      there was a shade of complacency in bogert   s smile     i rather thought that would be the case .  it is deep .  we   ll forget it .     he crumpled the sheets  tossed them down the waste shaft  turned to leave  and then thought better of it .      by the way        the robot waited .   bogert seemed to have difficulty .     there is something     that is  perhaps you can        he stopped .   herbie spoke quietly .     your thoughts are confused  but there is no doubt at all that they concern dr .  lanning .  it is silly to hesitate  for as soon as you compose yourself  i   ll know what it is you want to ask .      the mathematician   s hand went to his sleek hair in the familiar smoothing gesture .     lanning is nudging seventy     he said  as if that explained everything .      i know that .         and he   s been director of the plant for almost thirty years .     herbie nodded .      well  now     bogert   s voice became ingratiating     you would know whether .  .  .  whether he   s thinking of resigning .  health  perhaps  or some other           quite     said herbie  and that was all .      well  do you know .         certainly .         then uh could you tell me .         since you ask  yes .     the robot was quite matter of fact about it .     he has already resigned .         what .     the exclamation was an explosive  almost inarticulate  sound .  the scientist   s large head hunched forward     say that again .         he has already resigned     came the quiet repetition     but it has not yet taken effect .  he is waiting  you see  to solve the problem of     er     myself .  that finished  he is quite ready to turn the office of director over to his successor .      bogert expelled his breath sharply     and this successor .  who is he .     he was quite close to herbie now  eyes fixed fascinatedly on those unreadable dull red photoelectric cells that were the robot   s eyes .   words came slowly     you are the next director .      and bogert relaxed into a tight smile     this is good to know .  i   ve been hoping and waiting for this .  thanks  herbie .        peter bogert was at his desk until five that morning and he was back at nine .  the shelf just over the desk emptied of its row of reference books and tables  as he referred to one after the other .  the pages of calculations before him increased microscopically and the crumpled sheets at his feet mounted into a hill of scribbled paper .   at precisely noon  he stared at the final page  rubbed a blood shot eye  yawned and shrugged .     this is getting worse each minute .  damn .      he turned at the sound of the opening door and nodded at lanning  who entered  cracking the knuckles of one gnarled hand with the other .   the director took in the disorder of the room and his eyebrows furrowed together .      new lead .     he asked .      no     came the defiant answer .     what   s wrong with the old one .      lanning did not trouble to answer  nor to do more than bestow a single cursory glance at the top sheet upon bogert   s desk .  he spoke through the flare of a match as he lit a cigar .      has calvin told you about the robot .  it   s a mathematical genius .  really remarkable .      the other snorted loudly     so i   ve heard .  but calvin had better stick to robopsychology .  i   ve checked herbie on math  and he can scarcely struggle through calculus .         calvin didn   t find it so .         she   s crazy .         and i don   t find it so .     the director   s eyes narrowed dangerously .      you .     bogert   s voice hardened .     what are you talking about .         i   ve been putting herbie through his paces all morning  and he can do tricks you never heard of .         is that so .         you sound skeptical .     lanning flipped a sheet of paper out of his vest pocket and unfolded it .     that   s not my handwriting  is it .      bogert studied the large angular notation covering the sheet     herbie did this .         right .  and if you   ll notice  he   s been working on your time integration of equation    .  it comes        lanning tapped a yellow fingernail upon the last step        to the identical conclusion i did  and in a quarter the time .  you had no right to neglect the linger effect in positronic bombardment .         i didn   t neglect it .  for heaven   s sake  lanning  get it through your head that it would cancel out           oh  sure  you explained that .  you used the mitchell translation equation  didn   t you .  well     it doesn   t apply .         why not .         because you   ve been using hyper imaginaries  for one thing .         what   s that to do with .         mitchell   s equation won   t hold when           are you crazy .  if you   ll reread mitchell   s original paper in the transactions of the far           i don   t have to .  i told you in the beginning that i didn   t like his reasoning  and herbie backs me in that .         well  then     bogert shouted     let that clockwork contraption solve the entire problem for you .  why bother with nonessentials .         that   s exactly the point .  herbie can   t solve the problem .  and if he can   t  we can   t     alone .  i   m submitting the entire question to the national board .  it   s gotten beyond us .      bogert   s chair went over backward as he jumped up a snarl  face crimson .     you   re doing nothing of the sort .      lanning flushed in his turn     are you telling me what i can   t do .         exactly     was the gritted response .     i   ve got the problem beaten and you   re not to take it out of my hands  understand .  don   t think i don   t see through you  you desiccated fossil .  you   d cut your own nose off before you   d let me get the credit for solving robotic telepathy .         you   re a damned idiot  bogert  and in one second i   ll have you suspended for insubordination        lanning   s lower lip trembled with passion .      which is one thing you won   t do  lanning .  you haven   t any secrets with a mind reading robot around  so don   t forget that i know all about your resignation .      the ash on lanning   s cigar trembled and fell  and the cigar itself followed     what .  .  .  what        bogert chuckled nastily     and i   m the new director  be it understood .  i   m very aware of that  don   t think i   m not .  damn your eyes  lanning  i   m going to give the orders about here or there will be the sweetest mess that you   ve ever been in .      lanning found his voice and let it out with a roar .     you   re suspended  d   ye hear .  you   re relieved of all duties .  you   re broken  do you understand .      the smile on the other   s face broadened     now  what   s the use of that .  you   re getting nowhere .  i   m holding the trumps .  i know you   ve resigned .  herbie told me  and he got it straight from you .      lanning forced himself to speak quietly .  he looked an old  old man  with tired eyes peering from a face in which the red had disappeared  leaving the pasty yellow of age behind     i want to speak to herbie .  he can   t have told you anything of the sort .  you   re playing a deep game  bogert  but i   m calling your bluff .  come with me .      bogert shrugged     to see herbie .  good .  damned good .        it was also precisely at noon that milton ashe looked up from his clumsy sketch and said     you get the idea .  i   m not too good at getting this down  but that   s about how it looks .  it   s a honey of a house  and i can get it for next to nothing .      susan calvin gazed across at him with melting eyes .     it   s really beautiful     she sighed .     i   ve often thought that i   d like to       her voice trailed away .      of course     ashe continued briskly  putting away his pencil     i   ve got to wait for my vacation .  it   s only two weeks off  but this herbie business has everything up in the air .     his eyes dropped to his fingernails     besides  there   s another point     but it   s a secret .         then don   t tell me .         oh  i   d just as soon  i   m just busting to tell someone     and you   re just about the best    er    confidante i could find here .     he grinned sheepishly .   susan calvin   s heart bounded  but she did not trust herself to speak .      frankly     ashe scraped his chair closer and lowered his voice into a confidential whisper     the house isn   t to be only for myself .  i   m getting married .      and then he jumped out of his seat     what   s the matter .         nothing .     the horrible spinning sensation had vanished  but it was hard to get words out .     married .  you mean           why  sure .  about time  isn   t it .  you remember that girl who was here last summer .  that   s she .  but you are sick .  you           headache .     susan calvin motioned him away weakly .     i   ve .  .  .  i   ve been subject to them lately .  i want to .  .  .  to congratulate you  of course .  i   m very glad       the inexpertly applied rouge made a pair of nasty red splotches upon her chalk white face .  things had begun spinning again .     pardon me     please        the words were a mumble  as she stumbled blindly out the door .  it had happened with the sudden catastrophe of a dream     and with all the unreal horror of a dream .   but how could it be .  herbie had said     and herbie knew .  he could see into minds .   she found herself leaning breathlessly against the doorjamb  staring into herbie   s metal face .  she must have climbed the two flights of stairs  but she had no memory of it .  the distance had been covered in an instant  as in a dream .   as in a dream .   and still herbie   s unblinking eyes stared into hers and their dull red seemed to expand into dimly shining nightmarish globes .   he was speaking  and she felt the cold glass pressing against her lips .  she swallowed and shuddered into a pertain awareness of her surroundings .   still herbie spoke  and there was agitation in his voice     as if he were hurt and frightened and pleading .   the words were beginning to make sense .     this is a dream     he was saying     and you mustn   t believe in it .  you   ll wake into the real world soon and laugh at yourself .  he loves you  i tell you .  he does  he does .  but not here .  not now .  this is an illusion .      susan calvin nodded  her voice a whisper     yes .  yes .     she was clutching herbie   s arm  clinging to it  repeating over and over     it isn   t true  is it .  it isn   t  is it .      just how she came to her senses  she never knew     but it was like passing from a world of misty unreality to one of harsh sunlight .  she pushed him away from her  pushed hard against that steely arm  and her eyes were wide .      what are you trying to do .     her voice rose to a harsh scream .     what are you trying to do .      herbie backed away     i want to help     the psychologist stared     help .  by telling me this is a dream .  by trying to push me into schizophrenia .     a hysterical tenseness seized her     this is no dream .  i wish it were .      she drew her breath sharply     wait .  why .  .  .  why  i understand .  merciful heavens  it   s so obvious .      there was horror in the robot   s voice     i had to .         and i believed you .  i never thought          loud voices outside the door brought her to a halt .  she turned away  fists clenching spasmodically  and when bogert and lanning entered  she was at the far window .  neither of the men paid her the slightest attention .   they approached herbie simultaneously  lanning angry and impatient  bogert  coolly sardonic .  the director spoke first .      here now  herbie .  listen to me .      the robot brought his eyes sharply down upon the aged director     yes  dr .  lanning .         have you discussed me with dr .  bogert .         no  sir .     the answer came slowly  and the smile on bogert   s face flashed off .      what   s that .     bogert shoved in ahead of his superior and straddled the ground before the robot .     repeat what you told me yesterday .         i said that     herbie fell silent .  deep within him his metallic diaphragm vibrated in soft discords .      didn   t you say he had resigned .     roared bogert .     answer me .      bogert raised his arm frantically  but lanning pushed him aside     are you trying to bully him into lying .         you heard him  lanning .  he began to say    yes    and stopped .  get out of my way .  i want the truth out of him  understand .         i   ll ask him .     lanning turned to the robot .     all right  herbie  take it easy .  have i resigned .      herbie stared  and lanning repeated anxiously     have i resigned .     there was the faintest trace of a negative shake of the robot   s head .  a long wait produced nothing further .   the two men looked at each other and the hostility in their eyes was all but tangible .      what the devil     blurted bogert     has the robot gone mute .  can   t you speak  you monstrosity .         i can speak     came the ready answer .      then answer the question .  didn   t you tell me lanning had resigned .  hasn   t he resigned .      and again there was nothing but dull silence  until from the end of the room susan calvin   s laugh rang out suddenly  high pitched and semi hysterical .   the two mathematicians jumped  and bogerts eyes narrowed     you here .  what   s so funny .         nothing   s funny .     her voice was not quite natural .     it   s just that i   m not the only one that   s been caught .  there   s irony in three of the greatest experts in robotics in the world falling into the same elementary trap  isn   t there .     her voice faded  and she put a pale hand to her forehead     but it isn   t funny .      this time the look that passed between the two men was one of raised eyebrows .     what trap are you talking about .     asked lansing stiffly .     is something wrong with herbie .         no     she approached them slowly     nothing is wrong with him     only with us .     she whirled suddenly and shrieked at the robot     get away from me .  go to the other end of the room and don   t let me look at you .      herbie cringed before the fury of her eyes and stumbled away in a clattering trot .   lanning   s voice was hostile     what is all this  dr .  calvin .      she faced them and spoke sarcastically     surely you know the fundamental first law of robotics .      the other two nodded together .     certainly     said bogert  irritably     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow him to come to harm        how nicely put     sneered calvin .     but what kind of harm .         why     any kind .         exactly .  any kind .  but what about hurt feelings .  what about deflation of one   s ego .  what about the blasting of one   s hopes .  is that injury .      lanning frowned     what would a robot know about       and then he caught himself with a gasp .      you   ve caught on  have you .  this robot reads minds .  do you suppose it doesn   t know everything about mental injury .  do you suppose that if asked a question  it wouldn   t give exactly that answer that one wants to hear .  wouldn   t any other answer hurt us  and wouldn   t herbie know that .         good heavens .     muttered bogert .   the psychologist cast a sardonic glance at him     i take it you asked him whether lanning had resigned .  you wanted to hear that he had resigned and so that   s what herbie told you .         and i suppose that is why     said lanning  tonelessly     it would not answer a little while ago .  it couldn   t answer either way without hurting one of us .      there was a short pause in which the men looked thoughtfully across the room at the robot  crouching in the chair by the bookcase  head resting in one hand .   susan calvin stared steadfastly at the floor     he knew of all this .  that .  .  .  that devil knows everything     including what went wrong in his assembly .     her eyes were dark and brooding .   lanning looked up     you   re wrong there  dr .  calvin .  he doesn   t know what went wrong .  i asked him .         what does that mean .     cried calvin .     only that you didn   t want him to give you the solution .  it would puncture your ego to have a machine do what you couldn   t .  did you ask him .     she shot at bogert .      in a way .     bogert coughed and reddened .     he told me he knew very little about mathematics .      lanning laughed  not very loudly and the psychologist smiled caustically .  she said     i   ll ask him .  a solution by him won   t hurt my ego    she raised her voice into a cold  imperative     come here .      herbie rose and approached with hesitant steps .      you know  i suppose     she continued     just exactly at what point in the assembly an extraneous factor was introduced or an essential one left out .         yes     said herbie  in tones barely heard .      hold on     broke in bogert angrily .     that   s not necessary true .  you want to hear that  that   s all .         don   t be a fool     replied calvin .     he certainly knows as much math as you and lanning together  since he can read minds .  give him his chance .      the mathematician subsided  and calvin continued     all right  then  herbie  give .  we   re waiting .     and in an aside     get pencils and paper  gentlemen .      but herbie remained silent  and there was triumph in the psychologist   s voice     why don   t you answer  herbie .      the robot blurted out suddenly     i cannot .  you know i cannot .  dr .  bogert and dr .  lanning don   t want me to .         they want the solution .         but not from me .      lanning broke in  speaking slowly and distinctly     don   t be foolish  herbie .  we do want you to tell us .      bogert nodded curtly .   herbie   s voice rose to wild heights     what   s the use of saying that .  don   t you suppose that i can see past the superficial skin of your mind .  down below  you don   t want me to .  i   m a machine  given the imitation of life only by virtue of the positronic interplay in my brain     which is man   s device .  you can   t lose face to me without being hurt .  that is deep in your mind and won   t be erased .  i can   t give the solution .         we   ll leave     said dr .  lanning .     tell calvin .         that would make no difference     cried herbie     since you would know anyway that it was i that was supplying the answer .      calvin resumed     but you understand  herbie  that despite that  drs .  lanning and bogert want that solution .         by their own efforts .     insisted herbie .      but they want it  and the fact that you have it and won   t give it hurts them .  you see that  don   t you .         yes .  yes .         and if you tell them that will hurt them  too        yes .  yes .     herbie was retreating slowly  and step by step susan calvin advanced .  the two men watched in frozen bewilderment .      you can   t tell them     droned the psychologist slowly     because that would hurt and you mustn   t hurt .  but if you don   t tell them  you hurt  so you must tell them .  and if you do  you will hurt and you mustn   t  so you can   t tell them  but if you don   t  you hurt  so you must  but if you do  you hurt  so you mustn   t  but if you don   t  you hurt  so you must  but if you do  you        herbie was up against the wall  and here he dropped to his knees .     stop .     he shrieked .     close your mind .  it is full of pain and frustration and hate .  i didn   t mean it  i tell you .  i tried to help .  i told you what you wanted to hear .  i had to .      the psychologist paid no attention .     you must tell them  but if you do  you hurt  so you mustn   t  but if you don   t  you hurt  so you must  but        and herbie screamed .   it was like the whistling of a piccolo many times magnified     shrill and shriller till it keened with the terror of a lost soul and filled the room with the piercingness of itself .   and when it died into nothingness  herbie collapsed into a huddled heap of motionless metal .   bogert   s face was bloodless     he   s dead .         no .     susan calvin burst into body racking gusts of wild laughter     not dead     merely insane .  i confronted him with the insoluble dilemma  and he broke down .  you can scrap him now     because he   ll never speak again .      lanning was on his knees beside the thing that had been herbie .  his fingers touched the cold  unresponsive metal face and he shuddered .     you did that on purpose .     he rose and faced her  face contorted .      what if i did .  you can   t help it now .     and in a sudden access of bitterness     he deserved it .      the director seized the paralyzed  motionless bogert by the wrist     what   s the difference .  come  peter .     he sighed     a thinking robot of this type is worthless anyway .     his eyes were old and tired  and he repeated     come  peter .      it was minutes after the two scientists left that dr .  susan calvin regained part of her mental equilibrium .  slowly  her eyes turned to the living dead herbie and the tightness returned to her face .  long she stared while the triumph faded and the helpless frustration returned     and of all her turbulent thoughts only one infinitely bitter word passed her lips .      liar .      runaround    it was one of gregory powell   s favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained from excitement  so when mike donovan came leaping down the stairs toward him  red hair matted with perspiration  powell frowned .      what   s wrong .     he said .     break a fingernail .         yaaaah     snarled donovan  feverishly .     what have you been doing in the sublevels all day .     he took a deep breath and blurted out     speedy never returned .      powell   s eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs  then he recovered and resumed his upward steps .  he didn   t speak until he reached the head of the flight  and then      you sent him after the selenium .         yes .         and how long has he been out .         five hours now .      silence .  this was a devil of a situation .  here they were  on mercury exactly twelve hours     and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble .  mercury had long been the jinx world of the system  but this was drawing it rather strong     even for a jinx .   powell said     start at the beginning  and let   s get this straight .      they were in the radio room now     with its already subtly antiquated equipment  untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival .  even ten years  technologically speaking  meant so much .  compare speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in      .  but then  advances in robotics these days were tremendous .  powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly .  the air of disuse that touched everything about the room     and the entire station     was infinitely depressing .   donovan must have felt it .  he began     i tried to locate him by radio  but it was no go .  radio isn   t any good on the mercury sunside     not past two miles  anyway .  that   s one of the reasons the first expedition failed .  and we can   t put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet            skip all that .  what did you get .         i located the unorganized body signal in the short wave .  it was no good for anything except his position .  i kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map .      there was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket     a relic of the unsuccessful first expedition     and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force  spreading it flat with the palm of his hand .  powell  hands clasped across his chest  watched it at long range .   donovan   s pencil pointed nervously .     the red cross is the selenium pool .  you marked it yourself .         which one is it .     interrupted powell .     there were three that macdougal located for us before he left .         i sent speedy to the nearest  naturally  seventeen miles away .  but what difference does that make .     there was tension in his voice .     there are the penciled dots that mark speedy   s position .      and for the first time powell   s artificial aplomb was shaken and his hands shot forward for the map .      are you serious .  this is impossible .         there it is     growled donovan .   the little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red cross of the selenium pool .  and powell   s fingers went to his brown mustache  the unfailing signal of anxiety .   donovan added     in the two hours i checked on him  he circled that damned pool four times .  it seems likely to me that he   ll keep that up forever .  do you realize the position we   re in .      powell looked up shortly  and said nothing .  oh  yes  he realized the position they were in .  it worked itself out as simply as a syllogism .  the photocell banks that alone stood between the full power of mercury   s monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell .   the only thing that could save them was selenium .  the only thing that could get the selenium was speedy .  if speedy didn   t come back  no selenium .  no selenium  no photocell banks .  no photo banks     well  death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in .   donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with bitterness .     we   ll be the laughingstock of the system  greg .  how can everything have gone so wrong so soon .  the great team of powell and donovan is sent out to mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the sunside mining station with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day .  a purely routine job  too .  we   ll never live it down .         we won   t have to  perhaps     replied powell  quietly .     if we don   t do something quickly  living anything down     or even just plain living     will be out of the question .         don   t be stupid .  if you feel funny about it  greg  i don   t .  it was criminal  sending us out here with only one robot .  and it was your bright idea that we could handle the photocell banks ourselves .         now you   re being unfair .  it was a mutual decision and you know it .  all we needed was a kilogram of selenium  a stillhead dielectrode plate and about three hours    time and there are pools of pure selenium all over sunside .  macdougal   s spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes  didn   t it .  what the devil .  we couldn   t have waited for next conjunction .         well  what are we going to do .  powell  you   ve got an idea .  i know you have  or you wouldn   t be so calm .  you   re no more a hero than i am .  go on  spill it .         we can   t go after speedy ourselves  mike     not on the sunside .  even the new insosuits aren   t good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight .  but you know the old saying     set a robot to catch a robot    look  mike  maybe things aren   t so bad .  we   ve got six robots down in the sublevels  that we may be able to use  if they work .  if they work .      there was a glint of sudden hope in donovan   s eyes .     you mean six robots from the first expedition .  are you sure .  they may be subrobotic machines .  ten years is a long time as far as robot types are concerned  you know .         no  they   re robots .  i   ve spent all day with them and i know .  they   ve got positronic brains  primitive  of course .     he placed the map in his pocket .     let   s go down .        the robots were on the lowest sublevel     all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content .  they were large  extremely so  and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor  legs straddled out before them  their heads were a good seven feet in the air .   donovan whistled .     look at the size of them  will you .  the chests must be ten feet around .         that   s because they   re supplied with the old mcguffy gears .  i   ve been over the insides     crummiest set you   ve ever seen .         have you powered them yet .         no .  there wasn   t any reason to .  i don   t think there   s anything wrong with them .  even the diaphragm is in reasonable order .  they might talk .      he had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke  inserted the two inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robot   s life .  there was difficulty in fitting it  but he managed  and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion .  the radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier .  and then to the other five .   donovan said uneasily     they haven   t moved .         no orders to do so     replied powell  succinctly .  he went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest .     you .  do you hear me .      the monster   s head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on powell .  then  in a harsh  squawking voice     like that of a medieval phonograph  he grated     yes  master .      powell grinned humorlessly at donovan .     did you get that .  those were the days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on earth would be banned .  the makers were fighting that and they built good  healthy slave complexes into the damned machines .         it didn   t help them     muttered donovan .      no  it didn   t  but they sure tried .     he turned once more to the robot .     get up .      the robot towered upward slowly and donovan   s head craned and his puckered lips whistled .       powell said     can you go out upon the surface .  in the light .      there was consideration while the robot   s slow brain worked .  then     yes  master .         good .  do you know what a mile is .      another consideration  and another slow answer .     yes  master .         we will take you up to the surface then  and indicate a direction .  you will go about seventeen miles  and somewhere in that general region you will meet another robot  smaller than yourself .  you understand so far .         yes  master .         you will find this robot and order him to return .  if he does not wish to  you are to bring him back by force .      donovan clutched at powell   s sleeve .     why not send him for the selenium direct .         because i want speedy back  nitwit .  i want to find out what   s wrong with him .     and to the robot     all right  you  follow me .      the robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled     pardon  master  but i cannot .  you must mount first .     his clumsy arms had come together with a thwack  blunt fingers interlacing .   powell stared and then pinched at his mustache .     uh .  .  .  oh .      donovan   s eyes bulged .     we   ve got to ride him .  like a horse .         i guess that   s the idea .  i don   t know why  though .  i can   t see     yes  i do .  i told you they were playing up robot safety in those days .  evidently  they were going to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about  without a mahout on their shoulders all the time .  what do we do now .         that   s what i   ve been thinking     muttered donovan .     we can   t go out on the surface  with a robot or without .  oh  for the love of pete        and he snapped his fingers twice .  he grew excited .     give me that map you   ve got .  i haven   t studied it for two hours for nothing .  this is a mining station .  what   s wrong with using the tunnels .      the mining station was a black circle on the map  and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spider web fashion .   donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map .     look     he said     the small black dots are openings to the surface  and here   s one maybe three miles away from the selenium pool .  there   s a number here     you   d think they   d write larger       a .  if the robots know their way around here        powell shot the question and received the dull    yes  master     in reply .     get your insosuit     he said with satisfaction .   it was the first time either had worn the insosuits     which marked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before     and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably .   the insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit  but withal considerably lighter  due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition .  composed of heat resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers  and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone dry  the insosuits could withstand the full glare of mercury   s sun for twenty minutes .  five to ten minutes more  as well  without actually killing the occupant .   and still the robot   s hands formed the stirrup  nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which powell had been converted .   powell   s radio harshened voice boomed out     are you ready to take us to exit   a .         yes  master .      good  thought powell  they might lack radio control but at least they were fitted for radio reception .     mount one or the other  mike     he said to donovan .   he placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward .  he found the seat comfortable  there was the humped back of the robot  evidently shaped for the purpose  a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated    ears    whose purpose now seemed obvious .   powell seized the ears and twisted the head .  his mount turned ponderously .     lead on  macduff .     but he did not feel at all lighthearted .   the gigantic robots moved slowly  with mechanical precision  through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot  so that the two men had to duck hurriedly  along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the  air lock .   the long  airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home forcefully to powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the first expedition  with their crude robots and their start from scratch necessities .  they might have been a failure  but their failure was a good deal better than the usual run of the system   s successes .   the robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps that never lengthened .   powell said     notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is earth normal .  it   s probably been like this all the ten years that this place has remained empty .         how   s that .         cheap energy  cheapest in the system .  sunpower  you know  and on mercury   s sunside  sunpower is something .  that   s why the station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain .  it   s really a huge energy converter .  the heat is turned into electricity  light  mechanical work and what have you  so that energy is supplied and the station is cooled in a simultaneous process .         look     said donovan .     this is all very educational  but would you mind changing the subject .  it so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photocell banks mainly     and that is a tender subject with me at the moment .      powell grunted vaguely  and when donovan broke the resulting silence  it was to change the subject completely .     listen  greg .  what the devil   s wrong with speedy  anyway .  i can   t understand it .      it   s not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit  but powell tried it .     i don   t know  mike .  you know he   s perfectly adapted to a mercurian environment .  heat doesn   t mean anything to him and he   s built for the light gravity and the broken ground .  he   s foolproof     or  at least  he should be .      silence fell .  this time  silence that lasted .      master     said the robot     we are here .         eh .     powell snapped out of a semidrowse .     well  get us out of here     out to the surface .      they found themselves in a tiny substation  empty  airless  ruined .  donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash .      meteorite  do you suppose .     he had asked .   powell shrugged .     to hell with that .  it doesn   t matter .  let   s get out .      a towering cliff of a black  basaltic rock cut off the sunlight  and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them .  before them  the shadow reached out and ended in knife edge abruptness into an all but unbearable blaze of white light  that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground .      space .     gasped donovan .     it looks like snow .     and it did .   powell   s eyes swept the jagged glitter of mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance .      this must be an unusual area     he said .     the general albedo of mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice .  something like the moon  you know .  beautiful  isn   t it .      he was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates .  beautiful or not  a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute .   donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist .     holy smokes  the temperature is eighty centigrade .      powell checked his own and said     um m m .  a little high .  atmosphere  you know .         on mercury .  are you nuts .         mercury isn   t really airless     explained powell  in absentminded fashion .  he was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate  and the bloated fingers of the insosuit were clumsy at it .     there is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface     vapors of the more volatile elements and compounds that are heavy enough for mercurian gravity to retain .  you know  selenium  iodine  mercury  gallium  potassium  bismuth  volatile oxides .  the vapors sweep into the shadows and condense  giving up heat .  it   s a sort of gigantic still .  in fact  if you use your flash  you   ll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with  say  hoar sulphur  or maybe quicksilver dew .      it doesn   t matter  though .  our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely .      powell had adjusted the binocular attachments  so that he seemed as eye stalked as a snail .   donovan watched tensely .     see anything .      the other did not answer immediately  and when he did  his voice was anxious and thoughtful .     there   s a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool .  it   s in the right place .  but i don   t see speedy .      powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view  till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robot   s shoulders .  legs straddled wide  eyes straining  he said     i think .  .  .  i think     yes  it   s definitely he .  he   s coming this way .      donovan followed the pointing finger .  he had no binoculars  but there was a tiny moving dot  black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground .      i see him     he yelled .     let   s get going .      powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again  and his suited hand slapped against the gargantuan   s barrel chest .     get going .         giddy ap     yelled donovan  and thumped his heels  spur fashion .       the robots started off  the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the airlessness  for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound .  there was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing .      faster     yelled donovan .  the rhythm did not change .      no use     cried powell  in reply .     these junk heaps are only geared to one speed .  do you think they   re equipped with selective flexors .      they had burst through the shadow  and the sunlight came down in a white hot wash and poured liquidly about them .   donovan ducked involuntarily .     wow .  is it imagination or do i feel heat .         you   ll feel more presently     was the grim reply .     keep your eye on speedy .      robot spd    was near enough to be seen in detail now .  his graceful  streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground .  his name was derived from his serial initials  of course  but it was apt  nevertheless  for the spd models were among the fastest robots turned out by the united states robot   mechanical men corp .      hey  speedy     howled donovan  and waved a frantic hand .      speedy .     shouted powell .     come here .      the distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily     more by the efforts of speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty year old antique mounts of donovan and powell .   they were close enough now to notice that speedy   s gait included a peculiar rolling stagger  a noticeable side to side lurch     and then  as powell waved his hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact headset radio sender  in preparation for another shout  speedy looked up and saw them .   speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment with just a tiny  unsteady weave  as though he were swaying in a light wind .   powell yelled     all right  speedy .  come here  boy .      whereupon speedy   s robot voice sounded in powell   s earphones for the first time .   it said     hot dog  let   s play games .  you catch me and i catch you  no love can cut our knife in two .  for i   m little buttercup  sweet little buttercup .  whoops .     turning on his heel  he sped off in the direction from which he had come  with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust .   and his last words as he receded into the distance were     there grew a little flower    neath a great oak tree     followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup .   donovan said weakly     where did he pick up the gilbert and sullivan .  say  greg  he .  .  .  he   s drunk or something .         if you hadn   t told me     was the bitter response     i   d never realize it .  let   s get back to the cliff .  i   m roasting .      it was powell who broke the desperate silence .     in the first place     he said     speedy isn   t drunk     not in the human sense     because he   s a robot  and robots don   t get drunk .  however  there   s something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness        to me  he   s drunk     stated donovan  emphatically     and all i know is that he thinks we   re playing games .  and we   re not .  it   s a matter of life and very gruesome death .         all right .  don   t hurry me .  a robot   s only a robot .  once we find out what   s wrong with him  we can fix it and go on .         once     said donovan  sourly .   powell ignored him .     speedy is perfectly adapted to normal mercurian environment .  but this region        and his arm swept wide        is definitely abnormal .  there   s our clue .  now where do these crystals come from .  they might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid  but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in mercury   s sun .         volcanic action     suggested donovan  instantly  and powell   s body tensed .      out of the mouths of sucklings     he said in a small  strange voice and remained very still for five minutes .   then  he said     listen  mike  what did you say to speedy when you sent him after the selenium .      donovan was taken aback .     well damn it     i don   t know .  i just told him to get it .         yes  i know  but how .  try to remember the exact words .         i said .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i said     speedy  we need some selenium .  you can get it such and such a place .  go get it     that   s all .  what more did you want me to say .         you didn   t put any urgency into the order  did you .         what for .  it was pure routine .      powell sighed .     well  it can   t be helped now     but we   re in a fine fix .     he had dismounted from his robot  and was sitting  back against the cliff .  donovan joined him and they linked arms  in the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat and mouse for them  and just next them  the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them  unblinking  unwavering and unconcerned .   unconcerned .  as was all this poisonous mercury  as large in jinx as it was small in size .   powell   s radio voice was tense in donovan   s ear     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics     the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot   s positronic brain .     in the darkness  his gloved fingers ticked off each point .      we have  one  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .         right .         two     continued powell     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .         right        and three  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .         right .  now where are we .         exactly at the explanation .  the conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain .  we   ll say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it .  the automatic potential that rule   sets up turns him back .  but suppose you order him to walk into that danger .  in that case  rule   sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence .         well  i know that .  what about it .         let   s take speedy   s case .  speedy is one of the latest models  extremely specialized  and as expensive as a battleship .  it   s not a thing to be lightly destroyed        so .         so rule   has been strengthened     that was specifically mentioned  by the way  in the advance notices on the spd models     so that his allergy to danger is unusually high .  at the same time  when you sent him out after the selenium  you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis  so that the rule   potential set up was rather weak .  now  hold on  i   m just stating facts .         all right  go ahead .  i think i get it .         you see how it works  don   t you .  there   s some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool .  it increases as he approaches  and at a certain distance from it the rule   potential  unusually high to start with  exactly balances the rule   potential  unusually low to start with .      donovan rose to his feet in excitement .      and it strikes an equilibrium .  i see .  rule   drives him back and rule   drives him forward           so he follows a circle around the selenium pool  staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium .  and unless we do something about it  he   ll stay on that circle forever  giving us the good old runaround .     then  more thoughtfully     and that  by the way  is what makes him drunk .  at potential equilibrium  half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter .  i   m not a robot specialist  but that seems obvious .  probably he   s lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has .  ve e ery pretty .         but what   s the danger .  if we knew what he was running from       .      you suggested it .  volcanic action .  somewhere right above the selenium pool is a seepage of gas from the bowels of mercury .  sulphur dioxide  carbon dioxide     and carbon monoxide .  lots of it and at this temperature .      donovan gulped audibly .     carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl .         and a robot     added powell     is essentially iron .     then  grimly     there   s nothing like deduction .  we   ve determined everything about our problem but the solution .  we can   t get the selenium ourselves .  it   s still too far .  we can   t send these robot horses  because they can   t go themselves  and they can   t carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping .  and we can   t catch speedy  because the dope thinks we   re playing games  and he can run sixty miles to our four .         if one of us goes     began donovan  tentatively     and comes back cooked  there   ll still be the other .         yes     came the sarcastic reply     it would be a most tender sacrifice     except that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reached the pool  and i don   t think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders .  figure it out .  we   re two or three miles from the pool     call it two     the robot travels at four miles an hour  and we can last twenty minutes in our suits .  it isn   t only the heat  remember .  solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison .         um m m     said donovan     ten minutes short .         as good as an eternity .  and another thing  in order for rule   potential to have stopped speedy where it did  there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal vapor atmosphere     and there must be an appreciable corrosive action therefore .  he   s been out hours now     and how do we know when a knee joint  for instance  won   t be thrown out of kilter and keel him over .  it   s not only a question of thinking     we   ve got to think fast .      deep  dark  dank  dismal silence .   donovan broke it  voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless .  he said     as long as we can   t increase rule   potential by giving further orders  how about working the other way .  if we increase the danger  we increase rule   potential and drive him backward .      powell   s visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question .      you see     came the cautious explanation     all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity .  well  back at the station there   s a complete analytical laboratory .         naturally     assented powell .     it   s a mining station .         all right .  there must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations .         holy space .  mike  you   re a genius .         so so     admitted donovan  modestly .     it   s just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on heating decomposes into carbon dioxide  water  and good old carbon monoxide .  college chem  you know .      powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machine   s thigh .      hey     he shouted     can you throw .         master .         never mind .     powell damned the robot   s molasses slow brain .  he scrabbled up a jagged brick size rock .     take this     he said     and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across the crooked fissure .  you see it .      donovan pulled at his shoulder .     too far  greg .  it   s almost half a mile off .         quiet     replied powell .     it   s a case of mercurian gravity and a steel throwing arm .  watch  will you .      the robot   s eyes were measuring the distance with machinely accurate stereoscopy .  his arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back .  in the darkness  the robot   s motions went unseen  but there was a sudden thumping sound as he shifted his weight  and seconds later the rock flew blackly into the sunlight .  there was no air resistance to slow it down  nor wind to turn it aside     and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the    blue patch .      powell yelled happily and shouted     let   s go back after the oxalic acid  mike .      and as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels  donovan said grimly     speedy   s been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool  ever since we chased after him .  did you see him .         yes .         i guess he wants to play games .  well  we   ll play him games .        they were back hours later  with three liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces .  the photocell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely .  the two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting speedy in silence and with grim purpose .   speedy galloped slowly toward them .     here we are again .  whee .  i   ve made a little list  the piano organist  all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face .         we   ll puff something in your face     muttered donovan .     he   s limping  greg .         i noticed that     came the low  worried response .     the monoxide   ll get him yet  if we don   t hurry .      they were approaching cautiously now  almost sidling  to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot .  powell was too far off to tell  of course  but even already he could have sworn the crack brained speedy was setting himself for a spring .      let her go     he gasped .     count three .  one  two      two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs  gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun .  and in a pair of soundless puffs  they hit the ground behind speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust .   in the full heat of mercury   s sun  powell knew it was fizzing like soda water .   speedy turned to stare  then backed away from it slowly     and as slowly gathered speed .  in fifteen seconds  he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter .   powell did not get speedy   s words just then  though he heard something that resembled     lover   s professions when uttered in hessians .      he turned away .     back to the cliff  mike .  he   s out of the rut and he   ll be taking orders now .  i   m getting hot .      they jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts  and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that donovan looked back .     greg .      powell looked and almost shrieked .  speedy was moving slowly now     so slowly     and in the wrong direction .  he was drifting  drifting back into his rut  and he was picking up speed .  he looked dreadfully close  and dreadfully unreachable  in the binoculars .   donovan shouted wildly     after him .     and thumped his robot into its pace  but powell called him back .      you won   t catch him  mike     it   s no use .     he fidgeted on his robot   s shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence .     why the devil do i see these things five seconds after it   s all over .  mike  we   ve wasted hours .         we need more oxalic acid     declared donovan  stolidly .     the concentration wasn   t high enough .         seven tons of it wouldn   t have been enough     and we haven   t the hours to spare to get it  even if it were  with the monoxide chewing him away .  don   t you see what it is  mike .      and donovan said flatly     no .         we were only establishing new equilibriums .  when we create new monoxide and increase rule   potential  he moves backward till he   s in balance again     and when the monoxide drifted away  he moved forward  and again there was balance .      powell   s voice sounded thoroughly wretched .     it   s the same old runaround .  we can push at rule   and pull at rule   and we can   t get anywhere     we can only change the position of balance .  we   ve got to get outside both rules .     and then he pushed his robot closer to donovan   s so that they were sitting face to face  dim shadows in the darkness  and he whispered     mike .         is it the finish .         dully .     i suppose we go back to the station  wait for the banks to fold  shake hands  take cyanide  and go out like gentlemen .     he laughed shortly .      mike     repeated powell earnestly     we   ve got to get speedy .         i know .         mike     once more  and powell hesitated before continuing .     there   s always rule   .  i thought of it     earlier     but it   s desperate .      donovan looked up and his voice livened .     we   re desperate .         all right .  according to rule    a robot can   t see a human come to harm because of his own inaction .  two and   can   t stand against it .  they can   t  mike .         even when the robot is half cra    well  he   s drunk .  you know he is .         it   s the chances you take .         cut it .  what are you going to do .         i   m going out there now and see what rule   will do .  if it won   t break the balance  then what the devil     it   s either now or three four days from now .         hold on  greg .  there are human rules of behavior  too .  you don   t go out there just like that .  figure out a lottery  and give me my chance .         all right .  first to get the cube of fourteen goes .     and almost immediately     twenty seven forty four .      donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by powell   s mount and then powell was off into the sunlight .  donovan opened his mouth to shout  and then clicked it shut .  of course  the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance  and on purpose .  just like him .     the sun was hotter than ever and powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his back .  imagination  probably  or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit .   speedy was watching him  without a word of gilbert and sullivan gibberish as greeting .  thank god for that .  but he daren   t get too close .   he was three hundred yards away when speedy began backing  a step at a time  cautiously     and powell stopped .  he jumped from his robot   s shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments .   he proceeded on foot  the ground gritty and slippery to his steps  the low gravity causing him difficulty .  the soles of his feet tickled with warmth .  he cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliff   s shadow and realized that he had come too far to return     either by himself or by the help of his antique robot .  it was speedy or nothing now  and the knowledge of that constricted his chest .   far enough .  he stopped .      speedy     he called .     speedy .      the sleek  modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps  then resumed them .   powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice  and found it didn   t take much acting .     speedy  i   ve got to get back to the shadow or the sun   ll get me .  it   s life or death  speedy .  i need you .      speedy took one step forward and stopped .  he spoke  but at the sound powell groaned  for it was     when you   re lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed       it trailed off there  and powell took time out for some reason to murmur     iolanthe .      it was roasting hot .  he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye  and whirled dizzily  then stared in utter astonishment  for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving     moving toward him  and without a rider .   he was talking     pardon  master .  i must not move without a master upon me  but you are in danger .      of course  rule   potential above everything .  but he didn   t want that clumsy antique  he wanted speedy .  he walked away and motioned frantically     i order you to stay away .  i order you to stop .      it was quite useless .  you could not beat rule   potential .  the robot said stupidly     you are in danger  master .      powell looked about him desperately .  he couldn   t see clearly .  his brain was in a heated whirl  his breath scorched when he breathed  and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze .   he called a last time  desperately     speedy .  i   m dying  damn you .  where are you .  speedy  i need you .      he was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant robot he didn   t want  when he felt steel fingers on his arms  and a worried  apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears .      holy smokes  boss  what are you doing here .  and what am i doing     i   m so confused            never mind     murmured powell  weakly .     get me to the shadow of the cliff     and hurry .     there was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning heat  and he passed out .     he woke with donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously .     how are you  greg .         fine .     came the response     where   s speedy .         right here .  i sent him out to one of the other selenium pools     with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time .  he got it back in forty two minutes and three seconds .  i timed him .  he still hasn   t finished apologizing for the runaround he gave us .  he   s scared to come near you for fear of what you   ll say .         drag him over     ordered powell .     it wasn   t his fault .     he held out a hand and gripped speedy   s metal paw .     it   s o . k .   speedy .     then  to donovan     you know  mike  i was just thinking           yes .         well         he rubbed his face     the air was so delightfully cool     you know that when we get things set up here and speedy put through his field tests  they   re going to send us to the space stations next           no .         yes .  at least that   s what old lady calvin told me just before we left  and i didn   t say anything about it  because i was going to fight the whole idea .         fight it .     cried donovan .     but            i know .  it   s all right with me now .  two hundred seventy three degrees centigrade below zero .  won   t it be a pleasure .         space station     said donovan     here i come .        evidence    francis quinn was a politician of the new school .  that  of course  is a meaningless expression  as are all expressions of the sort .  most of the    new schools    we have were duplicated in the social life of ancient greece  and perhaps  if we knew more about it  in the social life of ancient sumeria and in the lake dwellings of prehistoric switzerland as well .   but  to get out from under what promises to be a dull and complicated beginning  it might be best to state hastily that quinn neither ran for office nor canvassed for votes  made no speeches and stuffed no ballot boxes .  any more than napoleon pulled a trigger at austerlitz .   and since politics makes strange bedfellows  alfred lanning sat at the other side of the desk with his ferocious white eyebrows bent far forward over eyes in which chronic impatience had sharpened to acuity .  he was not pleased .   the fact  if known to quinn  would have annoyed him not the least .  his voice was friendly  perhaps professionally so .      i assume you know stephen byerley  dr .  lanning .         i have heard of him .  so have many people .         yes  so have i .  perhaps you intend voting for him at the next election .         i couldn   t say .     there was an unmistakable trace of acidity here .     i have not followed the political currents  so i   m not aware that he is running for office .         he may be our next mayor .  of course  he is only a lawyer now  but great oaks           yes     interrupted lanning     i have heard the phrase before .  but i wonder if we can get to the business at hand .         we are at the business at hand  dr .  lanning .     quinn   s tone was very gentle     it is to my interest to keep mr .  byerley a district attorney at the very most  and it is to your interest to help me do so .         to my interest .  come .     lanning   s eyebrows hunched low .      well  say then to the interest of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation .  i come to you as director emeritus of research  because i know that your connection to them is that of  shall we say     elder statesman .     you are listened to with respect and yet your connection with them is no longer so tight but that you cannot possess considerable freedom of action  even if the action is somewhat unorthodox .      dr .  lanning was silent a moment  chewing the cud of his thoughts .  he said more softly     i don   t follow you at all  mr .  quinn .         i am not surprised  dr .  lanning .  but it   s all rather simple .  do you mind .     quinn lit a slender cigarette with a lighter of tasteful simplicity and his big boned face settled into an expression of quiet amusement .     we have spoken of mr .  byerley     a strange and colorful character .  he was unknown three years ago .  he is very well known now .  he is a man of force and ability  and certainly the most capable and intelligent prosecutor i have ever known .  unfortunately he is not a friend of mine        i understand     said lanning  mechanically .  he stared at his fingernails .      i have had occasion     continued quinn  evenly     in the past year to investigate mr .  byerley     quite exhaustively .  it is always useful  you see  to subject the past life of reform politicians to rather inquisitive research .  if you knew how often it helped       he paused to smile humorlessly at the glowing tip of his cigarette .     but mr .  byerley   s past is unremarkable .  a quiet life in a small town  a college education  a wife who died young  an auto accident with a slow recovery  law school  coming to the metropolis  an attorney .      francis quinn shook his head slowly  then added     but his present life .  ah  that is remarkable .  our district attorney never eats .      lanning   s head snapped up  old eyes surprisingly sharp     pardon me .         our district attorney never eats .     the repetition thumped by syllables .     i   ll modify that slightly .  he has never been seen to eat or drink .  never .  do you understand the significance of the word .  not rarely  but never .         i find that quite incredible .  can you trust your investigators .         i can trust my investigators  and i don   t find it incredible at all .  further  our district attorney has never been seen to drink     in the aqueous sense as well as the alcoholic     nor to sleep .  there are other factors  but i should think i have made my point .        lanning leaned back in his seat  and there was the rapt silence of challenge and response between them  and then the old roboticist shook his head .     no .  there is only one thing you can be trying to imply  if i couple your statements with the fact that you present them to me  and that is impossible .         but the man is quite inhuman  dr .  lanning .         if you told me he were satan in masquerade  there would be a faint chance that i might believe you .         i tell you he is a robot  dr .  lanning .         i tell you it is as impossible a conception as i have ever heard  mr .  quinn .      again the combative silence .      nevertheless     and quinn stubbed out his cigarette with elaborate care     you will have to investigate this impossibility with all the resources of the corporation .         i   m sure that i could undertake no such thing  mr .  quinn .  you don   t seriously suggest that the corporation take part in local politics .         you have no choice .  supposing i were to make my facts public without proof .  the evidence is circumstantial enough .         suit yourself in that respect .         but it would not suit me .  proof would be much preferable .  and it would not suit you  for the publicity would be very damaging to your company .  you are perfectly well acquainted  i suppose  with the strict rules against the use of robots on inhabited worlds .         certainly .         brusquely .      you know that the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation is the only manufacturer of positronic robots in the solar system  and if byerley is a robot  he is a positronic robot .  you are also aware that all positronic robots are leased  and not sold  that the corporation remains the owner and manager of each robot  and is therefore responsible for the actions of all .         it is an easy matter  mr .  quinn  to prove the corporation has never manufactured a robot of a humanoid character .         it can be done .  to discuss merely possibilities .         yes .  it can be done .         secretly  i imagine  as well .  without entering it in your books .         not the positronic brain  sir .  too many factors are involved in that  and there is the tightest possible government supervision .         yes  but robots are worn out  break down  go out of order     and are dismantled .         and the positronic brains re used or destroyed .         really .     francis quinn allowed himself a trace of sarcasm .     and if one were  accidentally  of course  not destroyed     and there happened to be a humanoid structure waiting for a brain .         impossible .         you would have to prove that to the government and the public  so why not prove it to me now .         but what could our purpose be .     demanded lanning in exasperation .     where is our motivation .  credit us with a minimum of sense .         my dear sir  please .  the corporation would be only too glad to have the various regions permit the use of humanoid positronic robots on inhabited worlds .  the profits would be enormous .  but the prejudice of the public against such a practice is too great .  suppose you get them used to such robots first     see  we have a skillful lawyer  a good mayor  and he is a robot .  won   t you buy our robot butlers .         thoroughly fantastic .  an almost humorous descent to the ridiculous .         i imagine so .  why not prove it .  or would you still rather try to prove it to the public .      the light in the office was dimming  but it was not yet too dim to obscure the flush of frustration on alfred lanning   s face .  slowly  the roboticist   s finger touched a knob and the wall illuminators glowed to gentle life .      well  then     he growled     let us see .        the face of stephen byerley is not an easy one to describe .  he was forty by birth certificate and forty by appearance     but it was a healthy  well nourished good natured appearance of forty  one that automatically drew the teeth of the bromide about    looking one   s age .      this was particularly true when he laughed  and he was laughing now .  it came loudly and continuously  died away for a bit  then began again     and alfred lanning   s face contracted into a rigidly bitter monument of disapproval .  he made a half gesture to the woman who sat beside him  but her thin  bloodless lips merely pursed themselves a trifle .   byerley gasped himself a stage nearer normality .      really  dr .  lanning .  .  .  really     i .  .  .  i .  .  .  a robot .      lanning bit his words off with a snap     it is no statement of mine  sir .  i would be quite satisfied to have you a member of humanity .  since our corporation never manufactured you  i am quite certain that you are     in a legalistic sense  at any rate .  but since the contention that you are a robot has been advanced to us seriously by a man of certain standing           don   t mention his name  if it would knock a chip off your granite block of ethics  but let   s pretend it was frank quinn  for the sake of argument  and continue .      lanning drew in a sharp  cutting snort at the interruption  and paused ferociously before continuing with added frigidity        by a man of certain standing  with whose identity i am not interested in playing guessing games  i am bound to ask your cooperation in disproving it .  the mere fact that such a contention could be advanced and publicized by the means at this man   s disposal would be a bad blow to the company i represent     even if the charge were never proven .  you understand me .         oh  yes  your position is clear to me .  the charge itself is ridiculous .  the spot you find yourself in is not .  i beg your pardon  if my laughter offended you .  it was the first i laughed at  not the second .  how can i help you .         it could be very simple .  you have only to sit down to a meal at a restaurant in the presence of witnesses  have your picture taken  and eat .     lanning sat back in his chair  the worst of the interview over .  the woman beside him watched byerley with an apparently absorbed expression but contributed nothing of her own .   stephen byerley met her eyes for an instant  was caught by them  then turned back to the roboticist .  for a while his fingers were thoughtful over the bronze paperweight that was the only ornament on his desk .   he said quietly     i don   t think i can oblige you .      he raised his hand     now wait  dr .  lanning .  i appreciate the fact that this whole matter is distasteful to you  that you have been forced into it against your will  that you feel you are playing an undignified and even ridiculous part .  still  the matter is even more intimately concerned with myself  so be tolerant .      first  what makes you think that quinn     this man of certain standing  you know     wasn   t hoodwinking you  in order to get you to do exactly what you are doing .         why it seems scarcely likely that a reputable person would endanger himself in so ridiculous a fashion  if he weren   t convinced he were on safe ground .      there was little humor in byerley   s eyes     you don   t know quinn .  he could manage to make safe ground out of a ledge a mountain sheep could not handle .  i suppose he showed the particulars of the investigation he claims to have made of me .         enough to convince me that it would be too troublesome to have our corporation attempt to disprove them when you could do so more easily .         then you believe him when he says i never eat .  you are a scientist  dr .  lanning .  think of the logic required .  i have not been observed to eat  therefore  i never eat q . e . d .  after all .         you are using prosecution tactics to confuse what is really a very simple situation .         on the contrary  i am trying to clarify what you and quinn between you are making a very complicated one .  you see  i don   t sleep much  that   s true  and i certainly don   t sleep in public .  i have never cared to eat with others     an idiosyncrasy which is unusual and probably neurotic in character  but which harms no one .  look  dr .  lanning  let me present you with a suppositious case .  supposing we had a politician who was interested in defeating a reform candidate at any cost and while investigating his private life came across oddities such as i have just mentioned .      suppose further that in order to smear the candidate effectively  he comes to your company as the ideal agent .  do you expect him to say to you     so and so is a robot because he hardly ever eats with people  and i have never seen him fall asleep in the middle of a case  and once when i peeped into his window in the middle of the night  there he was  sitting up with a book  and i looked in his frigidaire and there was no food in it .         if he told you that  you would send for a straitjacket .  but if he tells you     he never sleeps  he never eats     then the shock of the statement blinds you to the fact that such statements are impossible to prove .  you play into his hands by contributing to the to do .         regardless  sir     began lanning  with a threatening obstinacy     of whether you consider this matter serious or not  it will require only the meal i mentioned to end it .      again byerley turned to the woman  who still regarded him expressionlessly .     pardon me .  i   ve caught your name correctly  haven   t i .  dr .  susan calvin .         yes  mr .  byerley .         you   re the u .  s .  robot   s psychologist  aren   t you .         robopsychologist  please .         oh  are robots so different from men  mentally .         worlds different .     she allowed herself a frosty smile     robots are essentially decent .      humor tugged at the corners of the lawyer   s mouth     well  that   s a hard blow .  but what i wanted to say was this .  since you   re a psycho     a robopsychologist  and a woman  i   ll bet that you   ve done something that dr .  lanning hasn   t thought of .         and what is that .         you   ve got something to eat in your purse .      something caught in the schooled indifference of susan calvin   s eyes .  she said     you surprise me  mr .  byerley .      and opening her purse  she produced an apple .  quietly  she handed it to him .  dr .  lanning  after an initial start  followed the slow movement from one hand to the other with sharply alert eyes .   calmly  stephen byerley bit into it  and calmly he swallowed it     you see  dr .  lanning .      dr .  lanning smiled in a relief tangible enough to make even his eyebrows appear benevolent a relief that survived for one fragile second .   susan calvin said     i was curious to see if you would eat it  but  of course  in the present case  it proves nothing .      byerley grinned     it doesn   t .         of course not .  it is obvious  dr .  lanning  that if this man were a humanoid robot  he would be a perfect imitation .  he is almost too human to be credible .  after all  we have been seeing and observing human beings all our lives  it would be impossible to palm something merely nearly right off on us .  it would have to be all right .  observe the texture of the skin  the quality of the irises  the bone formation of the hand .  if he   s a robot  i wish u .  s .  robots had made him  because he   s a good job .  do you suppose then  that anyone capable of paying attention to such niceties would neglect a few gadgets to take care of such things as eating  sleeping  elimination .  for emergency use only  perhaps  as  for instance  to prevent such situations as are arising here .  so a meal won   t really prove anything .         now wait     snarled lanning     i am     not quite the fool both of you make me out to be .  i am not interested in the problem of mr .  byerley   s humanity or nonhumanity .  i am interest in getting the corporation out of a hole .  a public meal will end the matter and keep it ended no matter what quinn does .  we can leave the finer details to lawyers and robopsychologists .         but  dr .  lanning     said byerley     you forget the politics of the situation .  i am as anxious to be elected  as quinn is to stop me .  by the way  did you notice that you used his name .  it   s a cheap shyster trick of mine  i knew you would  before you were through .      lanning flushed     what has the election to do with it .         publicity works both ways  sir .  if quinn wants to call me a robot  and has the nerve to do so  i have the nerve to play the game his way .         you mean you       lanning was quite frankly appalled .      exactly .  i mean that i   m going to let him go ahead  choose his rope  test its strength  cut off the right length  tie the noose  insert his head and grin .  i can do what little else is required .         you are mighty confident .      susan calvin rose to her feet     come  alfred  we won   t change his mind for him .         you see .     byerley smiled gently .     you   re a human psychologist  too .        but perhaps not all the confidence that dr .  lanning had remarked upon was present that evening when byerley   s car parked on the automatic treads leading to the sunken garage  and byerley himself crossed the path to the front door of his house .   the figure in the wheel chair looked up as he entered and smiled .  byerley   s face lit with affection .  he crossed over to it .   the cripple   s voice was a hoarse  grating whisper that came out of a mouth forever twisted to one side  leering out of a face that was half scar tissue     you   re late  steve .         i know  john  i know .  but i   ve been up against a peculiar and interesting trouble today .         so .     neither the torn face nor the destroyed voice could carry expression but there was anxiety in the clear eyes .     nothing you can   t handle .         i   m not exactly certain .  i may need your help .  you   re the brilliant one in the family .  do you want me to take you out into the garden .  it   s a beautiful evening .      two strong arms lifted john from the wheel chair .  gently  almost caressingly  byerley   s arms went around the shoulders and under the swathed legs of the cripple .  carefully  and slowly  he walked through the rooms  down the gentle ramp that had been built with a wheel chair in mind  and out the back door into the walled and wired garden behind the house .      why don   t you let me use the wheel chair  steve .  this is silly .         because i   d rather carry you .  do you object .  you know that you   re as glad to get out of that motorized buggy for a while  as i am to see you out .  how do you feel today .     he deposited john with infinite care upon the cool grass .      how should i feel .  but tell me about your troubles .         quinn   s campaign will be based on the fact that he claims i   m a robot .      john   s eyes opened wide     how do you know .  it   s impossible .  i won   t believe it .         oh  come  i tell you it   s so .  he had one of the big shot scientists of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation over at the office to argue with me .      slowly john   s hands tore at the grass     i see .  i see .      byerley said     but we can let him choose his ground .  i have an idea .  listen to me and tell me if we can do it          the scene as it appeared in alfred lanning   s office that night was a tableau of stares .  francis quinn stared meditatively at alfred lanning .  lanning   s stare was savagely set upon susan calvin  who stared impassively in her turn at quinn .   francis quinn broke it with a heavy attempt at lightness     bluff .  he   s making it up as he goes along .         are you going to gamble on that  mr .  quinn .     asked dr .  calvin  indifferently .      well  it   s your gamble  really .         look here     lanning covered definite pessimism with bluster     we   ve done what you asked .  we witnessed the man eat .  it   s ridiculous to presume him a robot .         do you think so .     quinn shot toward calvin .     lanning said you were the expert .      lanning was almost threatening     now  susan        quinn interrupted smoothly     why not let her talk  man .  she   s been sitting there imitating a gatepost for half an hour .      lanning felt definitely harassed .  from what he experienced then to incipient paranoia was but a step .  he said     very well .  have your say  susan .  we won   t interrupt you .      susan calvin glanced at him humorlessly  then fixed cold eyes on mr .  quinn .     there are only two ways of definitely proving byerley to be a robot  sir .  so far you are presenting circumstantial evidence  with which you can accuse  but not prove     and i think mr .  byerley is sufficiently clever to counter that sort of material .  you probably think so yourself  or you wouldn   t have come here .      the two methods of proof are the physical and the psychological .  physically  you can dissect him or use an x ray .  how to do that would be your problem .  psychologically  his behavior can be studied  for if he is a positronic robot  he must conform to the three rules of robotics .  a positronic brain cannot be constructed without them .  you know the rules  mr .  quinn .      she spoke them carefully  clearly  quoting word for word the famous bold print on page one of the    handbook of robotics .         i   ve heard of them     said quinn  carelessly .      then the matter is easy to follow     responded the psychologist  dryly .     if mr .  byerley breaks any of those three rules  he is not a robot .  unfortunately  this procedure works in only one direction .  if he lives up to the rules  it proves nothing one way or the other .      quinn raised polite eyebrows     why not  doctor .         because  if you stop to think of it  the three rules of robotics are the essential guiding principles of a good many of the world   s ethical systems .  of course  every human being is supposed to have the instinct of self preservation .  that   s rule three to a robot .  also every    good    human being  with a social conscience and a sense of responsibility  is supposed to defer to proper authority  to listen to his doctor  his boss  his government  his psychiatrist  his fellow man  to obey laws  to follow rules  to conform to custom     even when they interfere with his comfort or his safety .  that   s rule two to a robot .  also  every    good    human being is supposed to love others as himself  protect his fellow man  risk his life to save another .  that   s rule one to a robot .  to put it simply     if byerley follows all the rules of robotics  he may be a robot  and may simply be a very good man .         but     said quinn     you   re telling me that you can never prove him a robot .         i may be able to prove him not a robot        that   s not the proof i want .         you   ll have such proof as exists .  you are the only one responsible for your own wants .        here lanning   s mind leaped suddenly to the sting of an idea     has it occurred to anyone     he ground out     that district attorney is a rather strange occupation for a robot .  the prosecution of human beings     sentencing them to death     bringing about their infinite harm        quinn grew suddenly keen     no  you can   t get out of it that way .  being district attorney doesn   t make him human .  don   t you know his record .  don   t you know that he boasts that he has never prosecuted an innocent man  that there are scores of people left untried because the evidence against them didn   t satisfy him  even though he could probably have argued a jury into atomizing them .  that happens to be so .      lanning   s thin cheeks quivered     no  quinn  no .  there is nothing in the rules of robotics that makes any allowance for human guilt .  a robot may not judge whether a human being deserves death .  it is not for him to decide .  he may not harm a human   variety skunk  or variety angel .      susan calvin sounded tired .     alfred     she said     don   t talk foolishly .  what if a robot came upon a madman about to set fire to a house with people in it .  he would stop the madman  wouldn   t he .         of course .         and if the only way he could stop him was to kill him        there was a faint sound in lanning   s throat .  nothing more .      the answer to that  alfred  is that he would do his best not to kill him .  if the madman died  the robot would require psychotherapy because he might easily go mad at the conflict presented him    of having broken rule one to adhere to rule one in a higher sense .  but a man would be dead and a robot would have killed him .         well  is byerley mad .     demanded lanning  with all the sarcasm he could muster .      no  but he has killed no man himself .  he has exposed facts which might represent a particular human being to be dangerous to the large mass of other human beings we call society .  he protects the greater number and thus adheres to rule one at maximum potential .  that is as far as he goes .  it is the judge who then condemns the criminal to death or imprisonment  after the jury decides on his guilt or innocence .  it is the jailer who imprisons him  the executioner who kills him .  and mr .  byerley has done nothing but determine truth and aid society .      as a matter of fact  mr .  quinn  i have looked into mr .  byerley   s career since you first brought this matter to our attention .  i find that he has never demanded the death sentence in his closing speeches to the jury .  i also find that he has spoken on behalf of the abolition of capital punishment and contributed generously to research institutions engaged in criminal neurophysiology .  he apparently believes in the cure  rather than the punishment of crime .  i find that significant .         you do .     quinn smiled .     significant of a certain odor of roboticity  perhaps .         perhaps .  why deny it .  actions such as his could come only from a robot  or from a very honorable and decent human being .  but you see  you just can   t differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans .      quinn sat back in his chair .  his voice quivered with impatience .     dr .  lanning  it   s perfectly possible to create a humanoid robot that would perfectly duplicate a human in appearance  isn   t it .      lanning harrumphed and considered     it   s been done experimentally by u .  s .  robots     he said reluctantly     without the addition of a positronic brain  of course .  by using human ova and hormone control  one can grow human flesh and skin over a skeleton of porous silicone plastics that would defy external examination .  the eyes  the hair  the skin would be really human  not humanoid .  and if you put a positronic brain  and such other gadgets as you might desire inside  you have a humanoid robot .      quinn said shortly     how long would it take to make one .      lanning considered     if you had all your equipment     the brain  the skeleton  the ovum  the proper hormones and radiations     say  two months .      the politician straightened out of his chair .     then we shall see what the insides of mr .  byerley look like .  it will mean publicity for u .  s .  robots     but i gave you your chance .      lanning turned impatiently to susan calvin  when they were alone .     why do you insist       .   and with real feeling  she responded sharply and instantly     which do you want     the truth or my resignation .  i won   t lie for you .  u .  s .  robots can take care of itself .  don   t turn coward .         what     said lanning     if he opens up byerley  and wheels and gears fall out what then .         he won   t open byerley     said calvin  disdainfully .     byerley is as clever as quinn  at the very least       the news broke upon the city a week before byerley was to have been nominated .  but    broke    is the wrong word .  it staggered upon the city  shambled  crawled .  laughter began  and wit was free .  and as the far off hand of quinn tightened its pressure in easy stages  the laughter grew forced  an element of hollow uncertainty entered  and people broke off to wonder .   the convention itself had the sir of a restive stallion .  there had been no contest planned .  only byerley could possibly have been nominated a week earlier .  there was no substitute even now .  they had to nominate him  but there was complete confusion about it .   it would not have been so bad if the average individual were not torn between the enormity of the charge  if true  and its sensational folly  if false .   the day after byerley was nominated perfunctorily  hollowly     a newspaper finally published the gist of a long interview with dr .  susan calvin     world famous expert on robopsychology and positronics .      what broke loose is popularly and succinctly described as hell .   it was what the fundamentalists were waiting for .  they were not a political party  they made pretense to no formal religion .  essentially they were those who had not adapted themselves to what had once been called the atomic age  in the days when atoms were a novelty .  actually  they were the simple lifers  hungering after a life  which to those who lived it had probably appeared not so simple  and who had been  therefore  simple lifers themselves .   the fundamentalists required no new reason to detest robots and robot manufacturers  but a new reason such as the quinn accusation and the calvin analysis was sufficient to make such detestation audible .   the huge plants of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation was a hive that spawned armed guards .  it prepared for war .   within the city the house of stephen byerley bristled with police .   the political campaign  of course  lost all other issues  and resembled a campaign only in that it was something filling the hiatus between nomination and election .     stephen byerley did not allow the fussy little man to distract him .  he remained comfortably unperturbed by the uniforms in the background .  outside the house  past the line of grim guards  reporters and photographers waited according to the tradition of the caste .  one enterprising    visor station even had a scanner focused on the blank entrance to the prosecutor   s unpretentious home  while a synthetically excited announcer filled in with inflated commentary .   the fussy little man advanced .  he held forward a rich  complicated sheet .     this  mr .  byerley  is a court order authorizing me to search these premises for the presence of illegal .  .  .  uh .  .  .  mechanical men or robots of any description .      byerley half rose  and took the paper .  he glanced at it indifferently  and smiled as he handed it back .     all in order .  go ahead .  do your job .  mrs .  hoppen        to his housekeeper  who appeared reluctantly from the next room        please go with them  and help out if you can .      the little man  whose name was harroway  hesitated  produced an unmistakable blush  failed completely to catch byerley   s eyes  and muttered     come on     to the two policemen .   he was back in ten minutes .      through .     questioned byerley  in just the tone of a person who is not particularly interested in the question  or its answer .   harroway cleared his throat  made a bad start in falsetto  and began again  angrily     look here  mr .  byerley  our special instructions were to search the house very thoroughly .         and haven   t you .         we were told exactly what to look for .         yes .         in short  mr .  byerley  and not to put too fine a point on it  we were told to search you .         me .     said the prosecutor with a broadening smile .     and how do you intend to do that .         we have a penet radiation unit           then i   m to have my x ray photograph taken  hey .  you have the authority .         you saw my warrant .         may i see it again .      harroway  his forehead shining with considerably more than mere enthusiasm  passed it over a second time .   byerley said evenly     i read here as the description of what you are to search  i quote     the dwelling place belonging to stephen allen byerley  located at     willow grove  evanstron  together  with any garage  storehouse or other structures or buildings thereto appertaining  together with all grounds thereto appertaining    .  .  .  um .  .  .  and so on .  quite in order .  but  my good man  it doesn   t say anything about searching my interior .  i am not part of the premises .  you may search my clothes if you think i   ve got a robot hidden in my pocket .      harroway had no doubt on the point of to whom he owed his job .  he did not propose to be backward  given a chance to earn a much better     i . e .   more highly paid     job .   he said  in a faint echo of bluster     look here .  i   m allowed to search the furniture in your house  and anything else i find in it .  you are in it  aren   t you .         a remarkable observation .  i am in it .  but i   m not a piece of furniture .  as a citizen of adult responsibility     i have the psychiatric certificate proving that     i have certain rights under the regional articles .  searching me would come under the heading of violating my right of privacy .  that paper isn   t sufficient .         sure  but if you   re a robot  you don   t have right of privacy .         true enough but that paper still isn   t sufficient .  it recognizes me implicitly as a human being .         where .     harroway snatched at it .      where it says    the dwelling place belonging to    and so on .  a robot cannot own property .  and you may tell your employer  mr .  harroway  that if he tries to issue a similar paper which does not implicitly recognize me as a human being  he will be immediately faced with a restraining injunction and a civil suit which will make it necessary for him to prove me a robot by means of information now in his possession  or else to pay a whopping penalty for an attempt to deprive me unduly of my rights under the regional articles .  you   ll tell him that  won   t you .      harroway marched to the door .  he turned .   .     you   re a slick lawyer       his hand was in his pocket .  for a short moment  he stood there .  then he left  smiled in the direction of the    visor scanner  still playing away     waved to the reporters  and shouted     we   ll have something for you tomorrow  boys .  no kidding .      in his ground car  he settled back  removed the tiny mechanism from his pocket and carefully inspected it .  it was the first time he had ever taken a photograph by x ray reflection .  he hoped he had done it correctly .   quinn and byerley had never met face to face alone .  but visorphone was pretty close to it .  in fact  accepted literally  perhaps the phrase was accurate  even if to each  the other were merely the light and dark pattern of a bank of photocells .   it was quinn who had initiated the call .  it was quinn  who spoke first  and without particular ceremony     thought you would like to know  byerley  that i intend to make public the fact that you   re wearing a protective shield against penet radiation .         that so .  in that case  you   ve probably already made it public .  i have a notion our enterprising press representatives have been tapping my various communication lines for quite a while .  i know they have my office lines full of holes  which is why i   ve dug in at my home these last weeks .     byerley was friendly  almost chatty .   quinn   s lips tightened slightly     this call is shielded     thoroughly .  i   m making it at a certain personal risk .         so i should imagine .  nobody knows you   re behind this campaign .  at least  nobody knows it officially .  nobody doesn   t know it unofficially .  i wouldn   t worry .  so i wear a protective shield .  i suppose you found that out when your puppy dog   s penet radiation photograph  the other day  turned out to be overexposed .         you realize  byerley  that it would be pretty obvious to everyone that you don   t dare face x ray analysis .         also that you  or your men  attempted illegal invasion of my rights of privacy .         the devil they   ll care for that .         they might .  it   s rather symbolic of our two campaigns isn   t it .  you have little concern with the rights of the individual citizen .  i have great concern .  i will not submit to x ray analysis  because i wish to maintain my rights on principle .  just as i   ll maintain the rights of others when elected .         that will  no doubt make a very interesting speech  but no one will believe you .  a little too high sounding to be true .  another thing     a sudden  crisp change     the personnel in your home was not complete the other night .         in what way .         according to the report     he shuffled papers before him that were just within the range of vision of the visiplate     there was one person missing     a cripple .         as you say     said byerley  tonelessly     a cripple .  my old teacher  who lives with me and who is now in the country     and has been for two months .  a    much needed rest    is the usual expression applied in the case .  he has your permission .         your teacher .  a scientist of sorts .         a lawyer once     before he was a cripple .  he has a government license as a research biophysicist  with a laboratory of his own  and a complete description of the work he   s doing filed with the proper authorities  to whom i can refer you .  the work is minor  but is a harmless and engaging hobby for a     poor cripple .  i am being as helpful as i can  you see .         i see .  and what does this .  .  .  teacher .  .  .  know about robot manufacture .         i couldn   t judge the extent of his knowledge in a field with which i am unacquainted .         he wouldn   t have access to positronic brains .         ask your friends at u .  s .  robots .  they   d be the ones to know .         i   ll put it shortly  byerley .  your crippled teacher is the real stephen byerley .  you are his robot creation .  we can prove it .  it was he who was in the automobile accident  not you .  there will be ways of checking the records .         really .  do so  then .  my best wishes .         and we can search your so called teacher   s    country place     and see what we can find there .         well  not quite  quinn .     byerley smiled broadly .     unfortunately for you  my so called teacher is a sick man .  his country place is his place of rest .  his right of privacy as a citizen of adult responsibility is naturally even stronger  under the circumstances .  you won   t be able to obtain a warrant to enter his grounds without showing just cause .  however  i   d be the last to prevent you from trying .      there was a pause of moderate length  and then quinn leaned forward  so that his imaged face expanded and the fine lines on his forehead were visible     byerley  why do you carry on .  you can   t be elected .         can   t i .         do you think you can .  do you suppose that your failure to make any attempt to disprove the robot charge     when you could easily  by breaking one of the three laws     does anything but convince the people that you are a robot .         all i see so far is that from being a rather vaguely known  but still largely obscure metropolitan lawyer  i have now become a world figure .  you   re a good publicist .         but you are a robot .         so it   s been said  but not proven .         it   s been proven sufficiently for the electorate .         then relax you   ve won .         good by     said quinn  with his first touch of viciousness  and the visorphone slammed off .      good by     said byerley imperturbably  to the blank plate .     byerley brought his    teacher    back the week before election .  the air car dropped quickly in an obscure part of the city .      you   ll stay here till after election     byerley told him .     it would be better to have you out of the way if things take a bad turn .      the hoarse voice that twisted painfully out of john   s crooked mouth might have had accents of concern in it .     there   s danger of violence .         the fundamentalists threaten it  so i suppose there is  in a theoretical sense .  but i really don   t expect it .  the fundies have no real power .  they   re just the continuous irritant factor that might stir up a riot after a while .  you don   t mind staying here .  please  i won   t be myself if i have to worry about you .         oh  i   ll stay .  you still think it will go well .         i   m sure of it .  no one bothered you at the place .         no one .  i   m certain .         and your part went well .         well enough .  there   ll be no trouble there .         then take care of yourself  and watch the televisor tomorrow  john .     byerley pressed the gnarled hand that rested on his .     lenton   s forehead was a furrowed study in suspense .  he had the completely unenviable job of being byerley   s campaign manager in a campaign that wasn   t a campaign  for a person that refused to reveal his strategy  and refused to accept his manager   s .      you can   t .     it was his favorite phrase .  it had become his only phrase .     i tell you  steve  you can   t .      he threw himself in front of the prosecutor  who was spending his time leafing through the typed pages of his speech .      put that down  steve .  look  that mob has been organized by the fundies .  you won   t get a hearing .  you   ll be stoned more likely .  why do you have to make a speech before an audience .  what   s wrong with a recording  a visual recording .         you want me to win the election  don   t you .     asked byerley  mildly .      win the election .  you   re not going to win  steve .  i   m trying to save your life .         oh  i   m not in danger .         he   s not in danger .  he   s not in danger .     lenton made a queer  rasping sound in his throat .     you mean you   re getting out on that balcony in front of fifty thousand crazy crackpots and try to talk sense to them     on a balcony like a medieval dictator .      byerley consulted his watch .     in about five minutes     as soon as the televisor lines are free .      lenton   s answering remark was not quite transliterable .     the crowd filled a roped off area of the city .  trees and houses seemed to grow out of a mass human foundation .  and by ultra wave  the rest of the world watched .  it was a purely local election  but it had a world audience just the same .  byerley thought of that and smiled .   but there was nothing to smile at in the crowd itself .  there were banners and streamers  ringing every possible change on his supposed roboticity .  the hostile attitude rose thickly and tangibly into the atmosphere .   from the start the speech was not successful .  it competed against the inchoate mob howl and the rhythmic cries of the fundie claques that formed mob islands within the mob .  byerley spoke on  slowly  unemotionally     inside  lenton clutched his hair and groaned     and waited for the blood .     there was a writhing in the front ranks .  an angular citizen with popping eyes  and clothes too short for the lank length of his limbs  was pulling to the fore .  a policeman dived after him  making slow  struggling passage .  byerley waved the latter off  angrily .   the thin man was directly under the balcony .  his words tore unheard against the roar .   byerley leaned forward .     what do you say .  if you have a legitimate question  i   ll answer it .     he turned to a flanking guard .     bring that man up here .      there was a tensing in the crowd .  cries of    quiet    started in various parts of the mob  and rose to a bedlam  then toned down raggedly .  the thin man  red faced and panting  faced byerley .   byerley said     have you a question .      the thin man stared  and said in a cracked voice     hit me .      with sudden energy  he thrust out his chin at an angle .     hit me .  you say you   re not a robot .  prove it .  you can   t hit a human  you monster .      there was a queer  flat  dead silence .  byerley   s voice punctured it .     i have no reason to hit you .      the thin man was laughing wildly .     you can   t hit me .  you won   t hit me .  you   re not a human .  you   re a monster  a make believe man .      and stephen byerley  tight lipped  in the face of thousands who watched in person and the millions  who watched by screen  drew back his fist and caught the man crackingly upon the chin .  the challenger went over backwards in sudden collapse  with nothing on his face but blank  blank surprise .   byerley said     i   m sorry .  take him in and see that he   s comfortable .  i want to speak to him when i   m through .      and when dr .  calvin  from her reserved space  turned her automobile and drove off  only one reporter had recovered sufficiently from the shock to race after her  and shout an unheard question .   susan calvin called over her shoulder     he   s human .      that was enough .  the reporter raced away in his own direction .   the rest of the speech might be described as    spoken but not heard .        dr .  calvin and stephen byerley met once again     a week before he took the oath of office as mayor .  it was late     past midnight .   dr .  calvin said     you don   t look tired .      the mayor elect smiled .     i may stay up for a while .  don   t tell quinn .         i shan   t .  but that was an interesting story of quinn   s  since you mention him .  it   s a shame to have spoiled it .  i suppose you knew his theory .         parts of it .         it was highly dramatic .  stephen byerley was a young lawyer  a powerful speaker  a great idealist     and with a certain flare for biophysics .  are you interested in robotics  mr .  byerley .         only in the legal aspects .         this stephen byerley was .  but there was an accident .  byerley   s wife died  he himself  worse .  his legs were gone  his face was gone  his voice was gone .  part of his mind was bent .  he would not submit to plastic surgery .  he retired from the world  legal career gone     only his intelligence  and his hands left .  somehow he could obtain positronic brains  even a complex one  one which had the greatest capacity of forming judgments in ethical problems     which is the highest robotic function so far developed .      he grew a body about it .  trained it to be everything he would have been and was no longer .  he sent it out into the world as stephen byerley  remaining behind himself as the old  crippled teacher that no one ever saw           unfortunately     said the mayor elect     i ruined all that by hitting a man .  the papers say it was your official verdict on the occasion that i was human .         how did that happen .  do you mind telling me .  it couldn   t have been accidental .         it wasn   t entirely .  quinn did most of the work .  my men started quietly spreading the fact that i had never hit a man  that i was unable to hit a man  that to fail to do so under provocation would be sure proof that i was a robot .  so i arranged for a silly speech in public  with all sorts of publicity overtones  and almost inevitably  some fool fell for it .  in its essence  it was what i call a shyster trick .  one in which the artificial atmosphere which has been created does all the work .  of course  the emotional effects made my election certain  as intended .      the robopsychologist nodded .     i see you intrude on my field     as every politician must  i suppose .  but i   m very sorry it turned out this way .  i like robots .  i like them considerably better than i do human beings .  if a robot can be created capable of being a civil executive  i think he   d make the best one possible .  by the laws of robotics  he   d be incapable of harming humans  incapable of tyranny  of corruption  of stupidity  of prejudice .  and after he had served a decent term  he would leave  even though he were immortal  because it would be impossible for him to hurt humans by letting them know that a robot had ruled them .  it would be most ideal .         except that a robot might fail due to the inherent inadequacies of his brain .  the positronic brain has never equaled the complexities of the human brain .         he would have advisers .  not even a human brain is capable of governing without assistance .      byerley considered susan calvin with grave interest .     why do you smile  dr .  calvin .         i smile because mr .  quinn didn   t think of everything .         you mean there could be more to that story of his .         only a little .  for the three months before election  this stephen byerley that mr .  quinn spoke about  this broken man  was in the country for some mysterious reason .  he returned in time for that famous speech of yours .  and after all  what the old cripple did once  he could do a second time  particularly where the second job is very simple in comparison to the first .         i don   t quite understand .      dr .  calvin rose and smoothed her dress .  she was obviously ready to leave .     i mean there is one time when a robot may strike a human being without breaking the first law .  just one time .         and when is that .      dr .  calvin was at the door .  she said quietly     when the human to be struck is merely another robot .      she smiled broadly  her thin face glowing .     good by mr .  byerley .  i hope to vote for you five years from now     for co ordinator .      stephen byerley chuckled .     i must reply that that is a somewhat farfetched idea .      the door closed behind her .   little lost robot    measures on hyper base had been taken in a sort of rattling fury     the muscular equivalent of a hysterical shriek .   to itemize them in order of both chronology and desperation  they were       .  all work on the hyperatomic drive through all the space volume occupied by the stations of the twenty seventh asteroidal grouping came to a halt .       .  that entire volume of space was nipped out of the system  practically speaking .  no one entered without permission .  no one left under any conditions .       .  by special government patrol ship  drs .  susan calvin and peter bogert  respectively head psychologist and mathematical director of united states robot   mechanical men corporation  were brought to hyper base .     susan calvin had never left the surface of earth before  and had no perceptible desire to leave it this time .  in an age of atomic power and a clearly coming hyperatomic drive  she remained quietly provincial .  so she was dissatisfied with her trip and unconvinced of the emergency  and every line of her plain  middle aged face showed it clearly enough during her first dinner at hyper base .   nor did dr .  bogert   s sleek paleness abandon a certain hangdog attitude .  nor did major general kallner  who headed the project  even once forget to maintain a hunted expression .  in short  it was a grisly episode  that meal  and the little session of three that followed began in a gray  unhappy manner .   kallner  with his baldness glistening  and his dress uniform oddly unsuited to the general mood  began with uneasy directness .      this is a queer story to tell  sir  and madam .  i want to thank you for coming on short notice and without a reason being given .  we   ll try to correct that now .  we   ve lost a robot .  work has stopped and must stop until such time as we locate it .  so far we have failed  and we feel we need expert help .      perhaps the general felt his predicament anticlimactic .  he continued with a note of desperation     i needn   t tell you the importance of our work here .  more than eighty percent of last year   s appropriations for scientific research have gone to us           why  we know that     said bogert  agreeably .     u .  s .  robots is receiving a generous rental fee for use of our robots .      susan calvin injected a blunt  vinegary note     what makes a single robot so important to the project  and why hasn   t it been located .      the general turned his red face toward her and wet his lips quickly     why  in a manner of speaking we have located it .     then  with near anguish     here  suppose i explain .  as soon as the robot failed to report a state of emergency was declared  and all movement off hyper base stopped .  a cargo vessel had landed the previous day and had delivered us two robots for our laboratories .  it had sixty two robots of the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  game type for shipment elsewhere .  we are certain as to that figure .  there is no question about it whatever .         yes .  and the connection .         when our missing robot failed of location anywhere     i assure you we would have found a missing blade of grass if it had been there to find     we brainstormed ourselves into counting the robots left of the cargo ship .  they have sixty three now .         so that the sixty third  i take it  is the missing prodigal .     dr .  calvin   s eyes darkened .      yes  but we have no way of telling which is the sixty third .      there was a dead silence while the electric clock chimed eleven times  and then the robopsychologist said     very peculiar     and the corners of her lips moved downward .      peter     she turned to her colleague with a trace of savagery     what   s wrong here .  what kind of robots are they  using at hyper base .      dr .  bogert hesitated and smiled feebly     it   s been rather a matter of delicacy till now  susan .      she spoke rapidly     yes  till now .  if there are sixty three same type robots  one of which is wanted and the identity of which cannot be determined  why won   t any of them do .  what   s the idea of all this .  why have we been sent for .      bogert said in resigned fashion     if you   ll give me a chance  susan     hyper base happens to be using several robots whose brains are not impressioned with the entire first law of robotics .         aren   t impressioned .     calvin slumped back in her chair     i see .  how many were made .         a few .  it was on government order and there was no way of violating the secrecy .  no one was to know except the top men directly concerned .  you weren   t included  susan .  it was nothing i had anything to do with .        the general interrupted with a measure of authority .     i would like to explain that bit .  i hadn   t been aware that dr .  calvin was unacquainted with the situation .  i needn   t tell you  dr .  calvin  that there always has been strong opposition to robots on the planet .  the only defense the government has had against the fundamentalist radicals in this matter was the fact that robots are always built with an unbreakable first law     which makes it impossible for them to harm human beings under any circumstance .      but we had to have robots of a different nature .  so just a few of the ns   model  the nestors  that is  were prepared with a modified first law .  to keep it quiet  all ns     s are manufactured without serial numbers  modified members are delivered here along with a group of normal robots  and  of course  all our kind are under the strictest impressionment never to tell of their modification to unauthorized personnel .     he wore an embarrassed smile     this has all worked out against us now .      calvin said grimly     have you asked each one who it is  anyhow .  certainly  you are authorized .      the general nodded     all sixty three deny having worked here     and one is lying .         does the one you want show traces of wear .  the others  i take it  are factory fresh .         the one in question only arrived last month .  it  and the two that have just arrived  were to be the last we needed .  there   s no perceptible wear .     he shook his head slowly and his eyes were haunted again     dr .  calvin  we don   t dare let that ship leave .  if the existence of non first law robots becomes general knowledge       there seemed no way of avoiding understatement in the conclusion .      destroy all sixty three     said the robopsychologist coldly and flatly     and make an end of it .      bogert drew back a corner of his mouth .     you mean destroy thirty thousand dollars per robot .  i   m afraid u .  s .  robots wouldn   t like that .  we   d better make an effort first  susan  before we destroy anything .         in that case     she said  sharply     i need facts .  exactly what advantage does hyper base derive from these modified robots .  what factor made them desirable  general .      kallner ruffled his forehead and stroked it with an upward gesture of his hand .     we had trouble with our previous robots .  our men work with hard radiations a good deal  you see .  it   s dangerous  of course  but reasonable precautions are taken .  there have been only two accidents since we began and neither was fatal .  however  it was impossible to explain that to an ordinary robot .  the first law states     i   ll quote it        no robot may harm a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .         that   s primary  dr .  calvin .  when it was necessary for one of our men to expose himself for a short period to a moderate gamma field  one that would have no physiological effects  the nearest robot would dash in to drag him out .  if the field were exceedingly weak  it would succeed  and work could not continue till all robots were cleared out .  if the field were a trifle stronger  the robot would never reach the technician concerned  since its positronic brain would collapse under gamma radiations     and then we would be out one expensive and hard to replace robot .      we tried arguing with them .  their point was that a human being in a gamma field was endangering his life and that it didn   t matter that he could remain there half an hour safely .  supposing  they would say  he forgot and remained an hour .  they couldn   t take chances .  we pointed out that they were risking their lives on a wild off chance .  but self preservation is only the third law of robotics     and the first law of human safety came first .  we gave them orders  we ordered them strictly and harshly to remain out of gamma fields at whatever cost .  but obedience is only the second law of robotics     and the first law of human safety came first .  dr .  calvin  we either had to do without robots  or do something about the first law     and we made our choice .         i can   t believe     said dr .  calvin     that it was found possible to remove the first law .         it wasn   t removed  it was modified     explained kallner .     positronic brains were constructed that contained the positive aspect only of the law  which in them reads     no robot may harm a human being .     that is all .  they have no compulsion to prevent one coming to harm through an extraneous agency such as gamma rays .  i state the matter correctly  dr .  bogert .         quite     assented the mathematician .      and that is the only difference of your robots from the ordinary ns  model .  the only difference .  peter .         the only difference  susan .      she rose and spoke with finality     i intend sleeping now  and in about eight hours  i want to speak to whomever saw the robot last .  and from now on  general kallner  if i   m to take any responsibility at all for events  i want full and unquestioned control of this investigation .      susan calvin  except for two hours of resentful lassitude  experienced nothing approaching sleep .  she signaled at bogert   s door at the local time of      and found him also awake .  he had apparently taken the trouble of transporting a dressing gown to hyper base with him  for he was sitting in it .  he put his nail scissors down when calvin entered .   he said softly     i   ve been expecting you more or less .  i suppose you feel sick about all this .         i do .         well     i   m sorry .  there was no way of preventing it .  when the call came out from hyper base for us  i knew that something must have gone wrong with the modified nestors .  but what was there to do .  i couldn   t break the matter to you on the trip here  as i would have liked to  because i had to be sure .  the matter of the modification is top secret .      the psychologist muttered     i should have been told .  u .  s .  robots had no right to modify positronic brains this way without the approval of a psychologist .      bogert lifted his eyebrows and sighed .     be reasonable  susan .  you couldn   t have influenced them .  in this matter  the government was bound to have its way .  they want the hyperatomic drive and the etheric physicists want robots that won   t interfere with them .  they were going to get them even if it did mean twisting the first law .  we had to admit it was possible from a construction standpoint and they swore a mighty oath that they wanted only twelve  that they would be used only at hyper base  that they would be destroyed once the drive was perfected  and that full precautions would be taken .  and they insisted on secrecy     and that   s the situation .      dr .  calvin spoke through her teeth     i would have resigned .         it wouldn   t have helped .  the government was offering the company a fortune  and threatening it with antirobot legislation in case of a refusal .  we were stuck then  and we   re badly stuck now .  if this leaks out  it might hurt kallner and the government  but it would hurt u .  s .  robots a devil of a lot more .      the psychologist stared at him .     peter  don   t you realize what all this is about .  can   t you understand what the removal of the first law means .  it isn   t just a matter of secrecy .         i know what removal would mean .  i   m not a child .  it would mean complete instability  with no nonimaginary solutions to the positronic field equations .         yes  mathematically .  but can you translate that into crude psychological thought .  all normal life  peter  consciously or otherwise  resents domination .  if the domination is by an inferior  or by a supposed inferior  the resentment becomes stronger .  physically  and  to an extent  mentally  a robot     any robot     is superior to human beings .  what makes him slavish  then .  only the first law .  why  without it  the first order you tried to give a robot would result in your death .  unstable .  what do you think .         susan     said bogert  with an air of sympathetic amusement .     i   ll admit that this frankenstein complex you   re exhibiting has a certain justification     hence the first law in the first place .  but the law  i repeat and repeat  has not been removed     merely modified .         and what about the stability of the brain .      the mathematician thrust out his lips     decreased  naturally .  but it   s within the border of safety .  the first nestors were delivered to hyper base nine months ago  and nothing whatever has gone wrong till now  and even this involves merely fear of discovery and not danger to humans .         very well  then .  we   ll see what comes of the morning conference .      bogert saw her politely to the door and grimaced eloquently when she left .  he saw no reason to change his perennial opinion of her as a sour and fidgety frustration .   susan calvin   s train of thought did not include bogert in the least .  she had dismissed him years ago as a smooth and pretentious sleekness .     gerald black had taken his degree in etheric physics the year before and  in common with his entire generation of physicists  found himself engaged in the problem of the drive .  he now made a proper addition to the general atmosphere of these meetings on hyper base .  in his stained white smock  he was half rebellious and wholly uncertain .  his stocky strength seemed striving for release and his fingers  as they twisted each other with nervous yanks  might have forced an iron bar out of true .   major general kallner sat beside him  the two from u .  s .  robots faced him .   black said     i   m told that i was the last to see nestor    before he vanished .  i take it you want to ask me about that .      dr .  calvin regarded him with interest     you sound as if you were not sure  young man .  don   t you know whether you were the last to see him .         he worked with me  ma   am  on the field generators  and he was with me the morning of his disappearance .  i don   t know if anyone saw him after about noon .  no one admits having done so .         do you think anyone   s lying about it .         i don   t say that .  but i don   t say that i want the blame of it  either .     his dark eyes smoldered .      there   s no question of blame .  the robot acted as it did because of what it is .  we   re just trying to locate it  mr .  black  and let   s put everything else aside .  now if you   ve worked with the robot  you probably know it better than anyone else .  was there anything unusual about it that you noticed .  had you ever worked with robots before .         i   ve worked with other robots we have here     the simple ones .  nothing different about the nestors except that they   re a good deal cleverer     and more annoying .         annoying .  in what way .         well     perhaps it   s not their fault .  the work here is rough and most of us get a little jagged .  fooling around with hyper space isn   t fun .     he smiled feebly  finding pleasure in confession .     we run the risk continually of blowing a hole in normal space time fabric and dropping right out of the universe  asteroid and all .  sounds screwy  doesn   t it .  naturally  you   re on edge sometimes .  but these nestors aren   t .  they   re curious  they   re calm  they don   t worry .  it   s enough to drive you nuts at times .  when you want something done in a tearing hurry  they seem to take their time .  sometimes i   d rather do without .         you say they take their time .  have they ever refused an order .         oh  no     hastily .     they do it all right .  they tell you when they think you   re wrong  though .  they don   t know anything about the subject but what we taught them  but that doesn   t stop them .  maybe i imagine it  but the other fellows have the same trouble with their nestors .      general kallner cleared his throat ominously     why have no complaints reached me on the matter  black .      the young physicist reddened     we didn   t really want to do without the robots  sir  and besides we weren   t certain exactly how such .  .  .  uh .  .  .  minor complaints might be received .      bogert interrupted softly     anything in particular happen the morning you last saw it .      there was a silence .  with a quiet motion  calvin repressed the comment that was about to emerge from kallner  and waited patiently .   then black spoke in blurting anger     i had a little trouble with it .  i   d broken a kimball tube that morning and was out five days of work  my entire program was behind schedule  i hadn   t received any mail from home for a couple of weeks .  and he came around wanting me to repeat an experiment i had abandoned a month ago .  he was always annoying me on that subject and i was tired of it .  i told him to go away     and that   s all i saw of him .         you told him to go away .     asked dr .  calvin with sharp interest .     in just those words .  did you say    go away    .  try to remember the exact words .      there was apparently an internal struggle in progress .  black cradled his forehead in a broad palm for a moment  then tore it away and said defiantly     i said     go lose yourself .          bogert laughed for a short moment .     and he did  eh .      but calvin wasn   t finished .  she spoke cajolingly     now we   re getting somewhere  mr .  black .  but exact details are important .  in understanding the robot   s actions  a word  a gesture  an emphasis may be everything .  you couldn   t have said just those three words  for instance  could you .  by your own description you must have been in a hasty mood .  perhaps you strengthened your speech a little .      the young man reddened     well .  .  .  i may have called it a .  .  .  a few things .         exactly what things .         oh     i wouldn   t remember exactly .  besides i couldn   t repeat it .  you know how you get when you   re excited .     his embarrassed laugh was almost a giggle     i sort of have a tendency to strong language .         that   s quite all right     she replied  with prim severity .     at the moment  i   m a psychologist .  i would like to have you repeat exactly what you said as nearly as you remember  and  even more important  the exact tone of voice you used .      black looked at his commanding officer for support  found none .  his eyes grew round and appalled     but i can   t .         you must .         suppose     said bogert  with ill hidden amusement     you address me .  you may find it easier .      the young man   s scarlet face turned to bogert .  he swallowed .     i said    his voice faded out .  he tried again     i said        and he drew a deep breath and spewed it out hastily in one long succession of syllables .  then  in the charged air that lingered  he concluded almost in tears      .  .  .  more or less .  i don   t remember the exact order of what i called him  and maybe i left out something or put in something  but that was about it .      only the slightest flush betrayed any feeling on the part of the robopsychologist .  she said     i am aware of the meaning of most of the terms used .  the others  i suppose  are equally derogatory .         i   m afraid so     agreed the tormented black .      and in among it  you told him to lose himself .         i meant it only figuratively .         i realize that .  no disciplinary action is intended  i am sure .     and at her glance  the general  who  five seconds earlier  had seemed not sure at all  nodded angrily .      you may leave  mr .  black .  thank you for your cooperation .        it took five hours for susan calvin to interview the sixty three robots .  it was five hours of multi repetition  of replacement after replacement of identical robot  of questions a  b  c  d  and answers a  b  c  d  of a carefully bland expression  a carefully neutral tone  a carefully friendly atmosphere  and a hidden wire recorder .   the psychologist felt drained of vitality when she was finished .   bogert was waiting for her and looked expectant as she dropped the recording spool with a clang upon the plastic of the desk .   she shook her head     all sixty three seemed the same to me .  i couldn   t tell            he said     you couldn   t expect to tell by ear  susan .  suppose we analyze the recordings .      ordinarily  the mathematical interpretation of verbal reactions of robots is one of the more intricate branches of robotic analysis .  it requires a staff of trained technicians and the help of complicated computing machines .  bogert knew that .  bogert stated as much  in an extreme of unshown annoyance after having listened to each set of replies  made lists of word deviations  and graphs of the intervals of responses .      there are no anomalies present  susan .  the variations in wording and the time reactions are within the limits of ordinary frequency groupings .  we need finer methods .  they must have computers here .  no .     he frowned and nibbled delicately at a thumbnail .     we can   t use computers .  too much danger of leakage .  or maybe if we        dr .  calvin stopped him with an impatient gesture     please  peter .  this isn   t one of your petty laboratory problems .  if we can   t determine the modified nestor by some gross difference that we can see with the naked eye  one that there is no mistake about  we   re out of luck .  the danger of being wrong  and of letting him escape is otherwise too great .  it   s not enough to point out a minute irregularity in a graph .  i tell you  if that   s all i   ve got to go on  i   d destroy them all just to be certain .  have you spoken to the other modified nestors .         yes  i have     snapped back bogert     and there   s nothing wrong with them .  they   re above normal in friendliness if anything .  they answered my questions  displayed pride in their knowledge     except the two new ones that haven   t had time to learn their etheric physics .  they laughed rather good naturedly at my ignorance in some of the specializations here .     he shrugged     i suppose that forms some of the basis for resentment toward them on the part of the technicians here .  the robots are perhaps too willing to impress you with their greater knowledge .         can you try a few planar reactions to see if there has been any change  any deterioration  in their mental set up since manufacture .         i haven   t yet  but i will .     he shook a slim finger at her     you   re losing your nerve  susan .  i don   t see what it is you   re dramatizing .  they   re essentially harmless .         they are .     calvin took fire .     they are .  do you realize one of them is lying .  one of the sixty three robots i have just interviewed has deliberately lied to me after the strictest injunction to tell the truth .  the abnormality indicated is horribly deep seated  and horribly frightening .      peter bogert felt his teeth harden against each other .  he said     not at all .  look .  nestor    was given orders to lose himself .  those orders were expressed in maximum urgency by the person most authorized to command him .  you can   t counteract that order either by superior urgency or superior right of command .  naturally  the robot will attempt to defend the carrying out of his orders .  in fact  objectively  i admire his ingenuity .  how better can a robot lose himself than to hide himself among a group of similar robots .         yes  you would admire it .  i   ve detected amusement in you  peter     amusement and an appalling lack of understanding .  are you a roboticist  peter .  those robots attach importance to what they consider superiority .  you   ve just said as much yourself .  subconsciously they feel humans to be inferior and the first law which protects us from them is imperfect .  they are unstable .  and here we have a young man ordering a robot to leave him  to lose himself  with every verbal appearance of revulsion  disdain  and disgust .  granted  that robot must follow orders  but subconsciously  there is resentment .  it will become more important than ever for it to prove that it is superior despite the horrible names it was called .  it may become so important that what   s left of the first law won   t be enough .         how on earth  or anywhere in the solar system  susan  is a robot going to know the meaning of the assorted strong language used upon him .  obscenity is not one of the things impressioned upon his brain .         original impressionment is not everything     calvin snarled at him .     robots have learning capacity  you .  .  .  you fool       and bogert knew that she had really lost her temper .  she continued hastily     don   t you suppose he could tell from the tone used that the words weren   t complimentary .  don   t yon suppose he   s heard the words used before and noted upon what occasions .         well  then     shouted bogert     will you kindly tell me one way in which a modified robot can harm a human being  no matter how offended it is  no matter how sick with desire to prove superiority .         if i tell you one way  will you keep quiet .         yes .      they were leaning across the table at each other  angry eyes nailed together .   the psychologist said     if a modified robot were to drop a heavy weight upon a human being  he would not be breaking the first law  if he did so with the knowledge that his strength and reaction speed would be sufficient to snatch the weight away before it struck the man .  however once the weight left his fingers  he would be no longer the active medium .  only the blind force of gravity would be that .  the robot could then change his mind and merely by inaction  allow the weight to strike .  the modified first law allows that .         that   s an awful stretch of imagination .         that   s what my profession requires sometimes .  peter  let   s not quarrel  let   s work .  you know the exact nature of the stimulus that caused the robot to lose himself .  you have the records of his original mental make up .  i want you to tell me how possible it is for our robot to do the sort of thing i just talked about .  not the specific instance  mind you  but that whole class of response .  and i want it done quickly .         and meanwhile           and meanwhile  we   ll have to try performance tests directly on the response to first law .        gerald black  at his own request  was supervising the mushrooming wooden partitions that were springing up in a bellying circle on the vaulted third floor of radiation building   .  the laborers worked  in the main  silently  but more than one was openly a wonder at the sixty three photocells that required installation .   one of them sat down near black  removed his hat  and wiped his forehead thoughtfully with a freckled forearm .   black nodded at him     how   s it doing  walensky .      walensky shrugged and fired a cigar     smooth as butter .  what   s going on anyway  doc .  first  there   s no work for three days and then we have this mess of jiggers .     he leaned backward on his elbows and puffed smoke .   black twitched his eyebrows     a couple of robot men came over from earth .  remember the trouble we had with robots running into the gamma fields before we pounded it into their skulls that they weren   t to do it .         yeah .  didn   t we get new robots .         we got some replacements  but mostly it was a job of indoctrination .  anyway  the people who make them want to figure out robots that aren   t hit so bad by gamma rays .         sure seems funny  though  to stop all the work on the drive for this robot deal .  i thought nothing was allowed to stop the drive .         well  it   s the fellows upstairs that have the say on that .  me     i just do as i   m told .  probably all a matter of pull           yeah     the electrician jerked a smile  and winked a wise eye .     somebody knew somebody in washington .  but as long as my pay comes through on the dot  i should worry .  the drive   s none of my affair .  what are they going to do here .         you   re asking me .  they brought a mess of robots with them      over sixty  and they   re going to measure reactions .  that   s all my knowledge .         how long will it take .         i wish i knew .         well     walensky said  with heavy sarcasm     as long as they dish me my money  they can play games all they want .      black felt quietly satisfied .  let the story spread .  it was harmless  and near enough to the truth to take the fangs out of curiosity .     a man sat in the chair  motionless  silent .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .  in sixty three wooden cells  watching ns   robots dashed forward in that split second before the weight veered  and sixty three photocells five feet ahead of their original positions jiggled the marking pen and presented a little jag on the paper .  the weight rose and dropped  rose and dropped  rose     ten times .   ten times the robots sprang forward and stopped  as the man remained safely seated .     major general kallner had not worn his uniform in its entirety since the first dinner with the u .  s .  robot representatives .  he wore nothing over his blue gray shirt now  the collar was open  and the black tie was pulled loose .   he looked hopefully at bogert  who was still blandly neat and whose inner tension was perhaps betrayed only by the trace of glister at his temples .   the general said     how does it look .  what is it you   re trying to see .      bogert replied     a difference which may turn out to be a little too subtle for our purposes  i   m afraid .  for sixty two of those robots the necessity of jumping toward the apparently threatened human was what we call  in robotics  a forced reaction .  you see  even when the robots knew that the human in question would not come to harm     and after the third or fourth time they must have known it     they could not prevent reacting as they did .  first law requires it        well .         but the sixty third robot  the modified nestor  had no such compulsion .  he was under free action .  if he had wished  he could have remained in his seat .  unfortunately     said his voice was mildly regretful     he didn   t so wish .         why do you suppose .      bogert shrugged     i suppose dr .  calvin will tell us when she gets here .  probably with a horribly pessimistic interpretation  too .  she is sometimes a bit annoying .         she   s qualified  isn   t she .     demanded the general with a sudden frown of uneasiness .      yes .     bogert seemed amused .     she   s qualified all right .  she understands robots like a sister     comes from hating human beings so much  i think .  it   s just that  psychologist or not  she   s an extreme neurotic .  has paranoid tendencies .  don   t take her too seriously .      he spread the long row of broken line graphs out in front of him .     you see  general  in the case of each robot the time interval from moment of drop to the completion of a five foot movement tends to decrease as the tests are repeated .  there   s a definite mathematical relationship that governs such things and failure to conform would indicate marked abnormality in the positronic brain .  unfortunately  all here appear normal .         but if our nestor    was not responding with a forced action  why isn   t his curve different .  i don   t understand that .         it   s simple enough .  robotic responses are not perfectly analogous to human responses  more   s the pity .  in human beings  voluntary action is much slower than reflex action .  but that   s not the case with robots  with them it is merely a question of freedom of choice  otherwise the speeds of free and forced action are much the same .  what i had been expecting  though  was that nestor    would be caught by surprise the first time and allow too great an interval to elapse before responding .         and he didn   t .         i   m afraid not .         then we haven   t gotten anywhere .     the general sat back with an expression of pain .     it   s five days since you   ve come .      at this point  susan calvin entered and slammed the door behind her .     put your graphs away  peter     she cried     you know they don   t show anything .      she mumbled something impatiently as kallner half rose to greet her  and went on     we   ll have to try something else quickly .  i don   t like what   s happening .      bogert exchanged a resigned glance with the general .     is anything wrong .         you mean specifically .  no .  but i don   t like to have nestor    continue to elude us .  it   s bad .  it must be gratifying his swollen sense of superiority .  i   m afraid that his motivation is no longer simply one of following orders .  i think it   s becoming more a matter of sheer neurotic necessity to outthink humans .  that   s a dangerously unhealthy situation .  peter  have you done what i asked .  have you worked out the instability factors of the modified ns   along the lines i want .         it   s in progress     said the mathematician  without interest .   she stared at him angrily for a moment  then turned to kallner .     nester    is decidedly aware of what we   re doing  general .  he had no reason to jump for the bait in this experiment  especially after the first time  when he must have seen that there was no real danger to our subject .  the others couldn   t help it  but he was deliberately falsifying a reaction .         what do you think we ought to do now  then  dr .  calvin .         make it impossible for him to fake an action the next time .  we will repeat the experiment  but with an addition .  high tension cables  capable of electrocuting the nestor models will be placed between subject and robot     enough of them to avoid the possibility of jumping over     and the robot will be made perfectly aware in advance that touching the cables will mean death .         hold on     spat out bogert with sudden viciousness .     i rule that out .  we are not electrocuting two million dollars worth of robots to locate nestor    .  there are other ways .         you   re certain .  you   ve found none .  in any case  it   s not a question of electrocution .  we can arrange a relay which will break the current at the instant of application of weight .  if the robot should place his weight on it  he won   t die .  but he won   t know that  you see .      the general   s eyes gleamed into hope .     will that work .         it should .  under those conditions  nestor    would have to remain in his seat .  he could be ordered to touch the cables and die  for the second law of obedience is superior to the third law of self preservation .  but he won   t be ordered to  he will merely be left to his own devices  as will all the robots .  in the case of the normal robots  the first law of human safety will drive them to their death even without orders .  but not our nestor    .  without the entire first law  and without having received any orders on the matter  the third law  self preservation  will be the highest operating  and he will have no choice but to remain in his seat .  it would be a forced action .         will it be done tonight  then .         tonight     said the psychologist     if the cables can be laid in time .  i   ll tell the robots now what they   re to be up against .        a man sat in the chair  motionless  silent .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .   only once     and from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony  dr .  susan calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror .   sixty three robots sat quietly in their chairs  staring owlishly at the endangered man before them .  not one moved .     dr .  calvin was angry  angry almost past endurance .  angry the worse for not daring to show it to the robots that  one by one were entering the room and then leaving .  she checked the list .  number twenty eight was due in now     thirty five still lay ahead of her .   number twenty eight entered  diffidently .   she forced herself into reasonable calm .     and who are you .      the robot replied in a low  uncertain voice     i have received no number of my own yet  ma   am .  i   m an ns   robot  and i was number twenty eight in line outside .  i have a slip of paper here that i   m to give to you .         you haven   t been in here before this today .         no  ma   am .         sit down .  right there .  i want to ask you some questions  number twenty eight .  were you in the radiation room of building two about four hours ago .      the robot had trouble answering .  then it came out hoarsely  like machinery needing oil     yes  ma   am .         there was a man who almost came to harm there  wasn   t there .         yes  ma   am .         you did nothing  did you .         no  ma   am .         the man might have been hurt because of your inaction .  do you know that .         yes  ma   am .  i couldn   t help it  ma   am .     it is hard to picture a large expressionless metallic figure cringing  but it managed .      i want you to tell me exactly why you did nothing to save him .         i want to explain  ma   am .  i certainly don   t want to have you .  .  .  have anyone .  .  .  think that i could do a thing that might cause harm to a master .  oh  no  that would be a horrible .  .  .  an inconceivable           please don   t get excited  boy .  i   m not blaming you for anything .  i only want to know what you were thinking at the time .         ma   am  before it all happened you told us that one of the masters would be in danger of harm from that weight that keeps falling and that we would have to cross electric cables if we were to try to save him .  well  ma   am  that wouldn   t stop me .  what is my destruction compared to the safety of a master .  but .  .  .  but it occurred to me that if i died on my way to him  i wouldn   t be able to save him anyway .  the weight would crush him and then i would be dead for no purpose and perhaps some day some other master might come to harm who wouldn   t have  if i had only stayed alive .  do you understand me  ma   am .         you mean that it was merely a choice of the man dying  or both the man and yourself dying .  is that right .         yes  ma   am .  it was impossible to save the master .  he might be considered dead .  in that case  it is inconceivable that i destroy myself for nothing     without orders .      the robopsychologist twiddled a pencil .  she had heard the same story with insignificant verbal variations twenty seven times before .  this was the crucial question now .      boy     she said     your thinking has its points  but it is not the sort of thing i thought you might think .  did you think of this yourself .      the robot hesitated .     no .         who thought of it  then .         we were talking last night  and one of us got that idea and it sounded reasonable .         which one .      the robot thought deeply .     i don   t know .  just one of us .      she sighed     that   s all .      number twenty nine was next .  thirty four after that .     major general kallner  too  was angry .  for one week all of hyper base had stopped dead  barring some paper work on the subsidiary asteroids of the group .  for nearly one week  the two top experts in the field had aggravated the situation with useless tests .  and now they     or the woman  at any rate     made impossible propositions .   fortunately for the general situation  kallner felt it impolitic to display his anger openly .   susan calvin was insisting     why not  sir .  it   s obvious that the present situation is unfortunate .  the only way we may reach results in the future     or what future is left us in this matter     is to separate the robots .  we can   t keep them together any longer .         my dear dr .  calvin     rumbled the general  his voice sinking into the lower baritone registers .     i don   t see how i can quarter sixty three robots all over the place        dr .  calvin raised her arms helplessly .     i can do nothing then .  nestor    will either imitate what the other robots would do  or else argue them plausibly into not doing what he himself cannot do .  and in any case  this is bad business .  we   re in actual combat with this little lost robot of ours and he   s winning out .  every victory of his aggravates his abnormality .      she rose to her feet in determination .     general kallner  if you do not separate the robots as i ask  then i can only demand that all sixty three be destroyed immediately .         you demand it  do you .     bogert looked up suddenly  and with real anger .     what gives you the right to demand any such thing .  those robots remain as they are .  i   m responsible to the management  not you .         and i     added major general kallner     am responsible to the world co ordinator     and i must have this settled .         in that case     flashed back calvin     there is nothing for me to do but resign .  if necessary to force you to the necessary destruction  i   ll make this whole matter public .  it was not i that approved the manufacture of modified robots .         one word from you  dr .  calvin     said the general  deliberately     in violation of security measures  and you would be certainly imprisoned instantly .      bogert felt the matter to be getting out of hand .  his voice grew syrupy     well  now  we   re beginning to act like children  all of us .  we need only a little more time .  surely we can outwit a robot without resigning  or imprisoning people  or destroying two millions .      the psychologist turned on him with quiet fury     i don   t want any unbalanced robots in existence .  we have one nestor that   s definitely unbalanced  eleven more that are potentially so  and sixty two normal robots that are being subjected to an unbalanced environment .  the only absolute safe method is complete destruction .      the signal burr brought all three to a halt  and the angry tumult of growingly unrestrained emotion froze .      come in     growled kallner .   it was gerald black  looking perturbed .  he had heard angry voices .  he said     i thought i   d come myself .  .  .  didn   t like to ask anyone else           what is it .  don   t orate           the locks of compartment c in the trading ship have been played with .  there are fresh scratches on them .         compartment c .     explained calvin quickly .     that   s the one that holds the robots  isn   t it .  who did it .         from the inside     said black  laconically .      the lock isn   t out of order  is it .         no .  it   s all right .  i   ve been staying on the ship now for four days and none of them have tried to get out .  but i thought you ought to know  and i didn   t like to spread the news .  i noticed the matter myself .         is anyone there now .     demanded the general .      i left robbins and mcadams there .      there was a thoughtful silence  and then dr .  calvin said  ironically     well .      kallner rubbed his nose uncertainly     what   s it all about .         isn   t it obvious .  nester    is planning to leave .  that order to lose himself is dominating his abnormality past anything we can do .  i wouldn   t be surprised if what   s left of his first law would scarcely be powerful enough to override it .  he is perfectly capable of seizing the ship and leaving with it .  then we   d have a mad robot on a spaceship .  what would he do next .  any idea .  do you still want to leave them all together  general .         nonsense     interrupted bogert .  he had regained his smoothness .     all that from a few scratch marks on a lock .         have you  dr .  bogert  completed the analysis i   ve required  since you volunteer opinions .         yes .         may i see it .         no .         why not .  or mayn   t i ask that  either .         because there   s no point in it  susan .  i told you in advance that these modified robots are less stable than the normal variety  and my analysis shows it .  there   s a certain very small chance of breakdown under extreme circumstances that are not likely to occur .  let it go at that .  i won   t give you ammunition for your absurd claim that sixty two perfectly good robots be destroyed just because so far you lack the ability to detect nestor    among them .      susan calvin stared him down and let disgust fill her eyes .     you won   t let anything stand in the way of the permanent directorship  will you .         please     begged kallner  half in irritation .     do you insist that nothing further can be done  dr .  calvin .         i can   t think of anything  sir     she replied  wearily .     if there were only other differences between nestor    and the normal robots  differences that didn   t involve the first law .  even one other difference .  something in impressionment  environment  specification       and she stopped suddenly .      what is it .         i   ve thought of something .  .  .  i think       her eyes grew distant and hard     these modified nestors  peter .  they get the same impressioning the normal ones get  don   t they .         yes .  exactly the same .         and what was it you were saying  mr .  black     she turned to the young man  who through the storms that had followed his news had maintained a discreet silence .     once when complaining of the nestors    attitude of superiority  you said the technicians had taught them all they knew .         yes  in etheric physics .  they   re not acquainted with the subject when they come here .         that   s right     said bogert  in surprise .     i told you  susan  when i spoke to the other nestors here that the two new arrivals hadn   t learned etheric physics yet .         and why is that .     dr .  calvin was speaking in mounting excitement .     why aren   t ns   models impressioned with etheric physics to start with .         i can tell you that     said kallner .     it   s all of a piece with the secrecy .  we thought that if we made a special model with knowledge of etheric physics  used twelve of them and put the others to work in an unrelated field  there might be suspicion .  men working with normal nestors might wonder why they knew etheric physics .  so there was merely an impressionment with a capacity for training in the field .  only the ones that come here  naturally  receive such a training .  it   s that simple .         i understand .  please get out of here  the lot of you .  let me have an hour or so .        calvin felt she could not face the ordeal for a third time .  her mind had contemplated it and rejected it with an intensity that left her nauseated .  she could face that unending file of repetitious robots no more .   so bogert asked the question now  while she sat aside  eyes and mind half closed .   number fourteen came in     forty nine to go .   bogert looked up from the guide sheet and said     what is your number in line .         fourteen  sir .     the robot presented his numbered ticket .      sit down  boy .      bogert asked     you haven   t been here before on this day .         no  sir .         well  boy  we are going to have another man in danger of harm soon after we   re through here .  in fact  when you leave this room  you will be led to a stall where you will wait quietly  till you are needed .  do you understand .         yes  sir .         now  naturally  if a man is in danger of harm  you will try to save him .         naturally  sir .         unfortunately  between the man and yourself  there will be a gamma ray field .      silence .      do you know what gamma rays are .     asked bogert sharply .      energy radiation  sir .      the next question came in a friendly  offhand manner     ever work with gamma rays .         no  sir .     the answer was definite .      mm m .  well  boy  gamma rays will kill you instantly .  they   ll destroy your brain .  that is a fact you must know and remember .  naturally  you don   t want to destroy yourself .         naturally .     again the robot seemed shocked .  then  slowly     but  sir  if the gamma rays are between myself and the master that may be harmed  how can i save him .  i would be destroying myself to no purpose .         yes  there is that     bogert seemed concerned about the matter .     the only thing i can advise  boy  is that if you detect the gamma radiation between yourself and the man  you may as well sit where you are .      the robot was openly relieved .     thank you  sir .  there wouldn   t be any use  would there .         of course not .  but if there weren   t any dangerous radiation  that would be a different matter .         naturally  sir .  no question of that .         you may leave now .  the man on the other side of the door will lead you to your stall .  please wait there .      he turned to susan calvin when the robot left .     how did that go  susan .         very well     she said  dully .      do you think we could catch nestor    by quick questioning on etheric physics .         perhaps  but it   s not sure enough .     her hands lay loosely in her lap .     remember  he   s fighting us .  he   s on his guard .  the only way we can catch him is to outsmart him     and  within his limitations  he can think much more quickly than a human being .         well  just for fun     suppose i ask the robots from now on a few questions on gamma rays .  wave length limits  for instance .         no .     dr .  calvin   s eyes sparked to life .     it would be too easy for him to deny knowledge and then he   d be warned against the test that   s coming up     which is our real chance .  please follow the questions i   ve indicated  peter  and don   t improvise .  it   s just within the bounds of risk to ask them if they   ve ever worked with gamma rays .  and try to sound even less interested than you do when you ask it .      bogert shrugged  and pressed the buzzer that would allow the entrance of number fifteen .   the large radiation room was in readiness once more .  the robots waited patiently in their wooden cells  all open to the center but closed off from each other .   major general kallner mopped his brow slowly with a large handkerchief while dr .  calvin checked the last details with black .      you   re sure now     she demanded     that none of the robots have had a chance to talk with each other after leaving the orientation room .         absolutely sure     insisted black .     there   s not been a word exchanged .         and the robots are put in the proper stalls .         here   s the plan .      the psychologist looked at it thoughtfully     um m m .      the general peered over her shoulder .     what   s the idea of the arrangement  dr .  calvin .         i   ve asked to have those robots that appeared even slightly out of true in the previous tests concentrated on one side of the circle .  i   m going to be sitting in the center myself this time  and i wanted to watch those particularly .         you   re going to be sitting there        exclaimed bogert .      why not .     she demanded coldly .     what i expect to see may be something quite momentary .  i can   t risk having anyone else as main observer .  peter  you   ll be in the observing booth  and i want you to keep your eye on the opposite side of the circle .  general kallner  i   ve arranged for motion pictures to be taken of each robot  in case visual observation isn   t enough .  if these are required  the robots are to remain exactly where they are until the pictures are developed and studied .  none must leave  none must change place .  is that clear .         perfectly .         then let   s try it this one last time .        susan calvin sat in the chair  silent  eyes restless .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .   and a single robot jerked upright and took two steps .   and stopped .   but dr .  calvin was upright  and her finger pointed to him sharply .     nestor     come here     she cried     come here .  come here .      slowly  reluctantly  the robot took another step forward .  the psychologist shouted at the top of her voice  without taking her eyes from the robot     get every other robot out of this place  somebody .  get them out quickly  and keep them out .      somewhere within reach of her ears there was noise  and the thud of hard feet upon the floor .  she did not look away .   nestor        if it was nestor        took another step  and then  under force of her imperious gesture  two more .  he was only ten feet away  when he spoke harshly     i have been told to be lost        another stop .     i must not disobey .  they have not found me so far     he would think me a failure     he told me     but it   s not so     i am powerful and intelligent        the words came in spurts .   another step .     i know a good deal     he would think .  .  .  i mean i   ve been found     disgraceful     not i     i am intelligent     and by just a master .  .  .  who is weak     slow        another step     and one metal arm flew out suddenly to her shoulder  and she felt the weight bearing her down .  her throat constricted  and she felt a shriek tear through .   dimly  she heard nestor      s next words     no one must find me .  no master       and the cold metal was against her  and she was sinking under the weight of it .   and then a queer  metallic sound  and she was on the ground with an unfelt thump  and a gleaming arm was heavy across her body .  it did not move .  nor did nestor     who sprawled beside her .   and now faces were bending over her .   gerald black was gasping     are you hurt  dr .  calvin .      she shook her head feebly .  they pried the arm off her and lifted her gently to her feet     what happened .      black said     i bathed the place in gamma rays for five seconds .  we didn   t know what was happening .  it wasn   t till the last second that we realized he was attacking you  and then there was no time for anything but a gamma field .  he went down in an instant .  there wasn   t enough to harm you though .  don   t worry about it .         i   m not worried .     she closed her eyes and leaned for a moment upon his shoulder .     i don   t think i was attacked exactly .  nestor    was simply trying to do so .  what was left of the first law was still holding him back .        susan calvin and peter bogert  two weeks after their first meeting with major general kallner had their last .  work at hyper base had been resumed .  the trading ship with its sixty two normal ns     s was gone to wherever it was bound  with an officially imposed story to explain its two weeks    delay .  the government cruiser was making ready to carry the two roboticists back to earth .   kallner was once again a gleam in dress uniform .  his white gloves shone as he shook hands .   calvin said     the other modified nestors are  of course  to be destroyed .         they will be .  we   ll make shift with normal robots  or  if necessary  do without .         good .         but tell me     you haven   t explained     how was it done .      she smiled tightly     oh  that .  i would have told you in advance if i had been more certain of its working .  you see  nestor    had a superiority complex that was becoming more radical all the time .  he liked to think that he and other robots knew more than human beings .  it was becoming very important for him to think so .      we knew that .  so we warned every robot in advance that gamma rays would kill them  which it would  and we further warned them all that gamma rays would be between them and myself .  so they all stayed where they were  naturally .  by nestor      s own logic in the previous test they had all decided that there was no point in trying to save a human being if they were sure to die before they could do it .         well  yes  dr .  calvin  i understand that .  but why did nestor    himself leave his seat .         ah .  that was a little arrangement between myself and your young mr .  black .  you see it wasn   t gamma rays that flooded the area between myself and the robots     but infrared rays .  just ordinary heat rays  absolutely harmless .  nestor    knew they were infrared and harmless and so he began to dash out  as he expected the rest would do  under first law compulsion .  it was only a fraction of a second too late that he remembered that the normal ns     s could detect radiation  but could not identify the type .  that he himself could only identify wavelengths by virtue of the training he had received at hyper base  under mere human beings  was a little too humiliating to remember for just a moment .  to the normal robots the area was fatal because we had told them it would be  and only nestor    knew we were lying .      and just for a moment he forgot  or didn   t want to remember  that other robots might be more ignorant than human beings .  his very superiority caught him .  good by  general .        the evitable conflict    the co ordinator  in his private study  had that medieval curiosity  a fireplace .  to be sure  the medieval man might not have recognized it as such  since it had no functional significance .  the quiet  licking flame lay in an insulated recess behind clear quartz .   the logs were ignited at long distance through a trifling diversion of the energy beam that fed the public buildings of the city .  the same button that controlled the ignition first dumped the ashes of the previous fire  and allowed for the entrance of fresh wood .      it was a thoroughly domesticated fireplace  you see .   but the fire itself was real .  it was wired for sound  so that you could hear the crackle and  of course  you could watch it leap in the air stream that fed it .   the co ordinator   s ruddy glass reflected  in miniature  the discreet gamboling of the flame  and  in even further miniature  it was reflected in each of his brooding pupils .   and in the frosty pupils of his guest  dr .  susan calvin of u .  s .  robots   mechanical men corporation .   the co ordinator said     i did not ask you here entirely for social purposes  susan .         i did not think you did  stephen     she replied .         and yet i don   t quite know how to phrase my problem .  on the one hand  it can be nothing at all .  on the other  it can mean the end of humanity .         i have come across so many problems  stephen  that presented the same alternative .  i think all problems do .         really .  then judge this     world steel reports an overproduction of twenty thousand long tons .  the mexican canal is two months behind schedule .  the mercury mines at almaden have experienced a production deficiency since last spring  while the hydroponics plant at tientsin has been laying men off .  these items happen to come to mind at the moment .  there is more of the same sort .         are these things serious .  i   m not economist enough to trace the fearful consequences of such things .         in themselves  they are not serious .  mining experts can be sent to almaden  if the situation were to get worse .  hydroponics engineers can be used in java or in ceylon  if there are too many at tientsin .  twenty thousand long tons of steel won   t fill more than a few days of world demand  and the opening of the mexican canal two months later than the planned date is of little moment .  it   s the machines that worry me  i   ve spoken to your director of research about them already .         to vincent silver .      he hasn   t mentioned anything about it to me .         i asked him to speak to no one .  apparently  he hasn   t .         and what did he tell you .         let me put that item in its proper place .  i want to talk about the machines first .  and i want to talk about them to you  because you   re the only one in the world who understands robots well enough to help me now .      may i grow philosophical .         for this evening  stephen  you may talk how you please and of what you please  provided you tell me first what you intend to prove .         that such small unbalances in the perfection of our system of supply and demand  as i have mentioned  may be the first step towards the final war .         hmp .  proceed .      susan calvin did not allow herself to relax  despite the designed comfort of the chair she sat in .  her cold  thin lipped face and her flat  even voice were becoming accentuated with the years .  and although stephen byerley was one man she could like and trust  she was almost seventy and the cultivated habits of a lifetime are not easily broken .      every period of human development  susan     said the co ordinator     has had its own particular type of human conflict     its own variety of problem that  apparently  could be settled only by force .  and each time  frustratingly enough  force never really settled the problem .  instead  it persisted through a series of conflicts  then vanished of itself      what   s the expression      ah  yes    not with a bang  but a whimper     as the economic and social environment changed .  and then  new problems  and a new series of wars      apparently endlessly cyclic .      consider relatively modern times .  there were the series of dynastic wars in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries  when the most important question in europe was whether the houses of hapsburg or valois bourbon were to rule the continent .  it was one of those    inevitable conflicts     since europe could obviously not exist half one and half the other .      except that it did  and no war ever wiped out the one and established the other  until the rise of a new social atmosphere in france in      tumbled first the bourbons and  eventually  the hapsburgs down the dusty chute to history   s incinerator .      and in those same centuries there were the more barbarous religious wars  which revolved about the important question of whether europe was to be catholic or protestant .  half and half she could not be .  it was    inevitable    that the sword decide .      except that it didn   t .  in england  a new industrialism was growing  and on the continent  a new nationalism .  half and half europe remains to this day and no one cares much .      in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  there was a cycle of nationalist imperialist wars  when the most important question in the world was which portions of europe would control the economic resources and consuming capacity of which portions of non europe .  all non europe obviously could not exist part english and part french and part german and so on .      until the forces of nationalism spread sufficiently  so that non europe ended what all the wars could not  and decided it could exist quite comfortably all non european .      and so we have a pattern           yes .  stephen  you make it plain     said susan calvin .     these are not very profound observations .         no .      but then  it is the obvious which is so difficult to see most of the time .  people say    it   s as plain as the nose on your face .     but how much of the nose on your face can you see  unless someone holds a mirror up to you .  in the twentieth century  susan  we started a new cycle of wars     what shall i call them .  ideological wars .  the emotions of religion applied to economic systems  rather than to extra natural ones .  again the wars were    inevitable    and this time there were atomic weapons  so that mankind could no longer live through its torment to the inevitable wasting away of inevitability .      and positronic robots came .      they came in time  and  with it and alongside it  interplanetary travel .      so that it no longer seemed so important whether the world was adam smith or karl marx .  neither made very much sense under the new circumstances .  both had to adapt and they ended in almost the same place .         a deus ex machina  then  in a double sense     said dr .  calvin  dryly .   the co ordinator smiled gently     i have never heard you pun before  susan  but you are correct .  and yet there was another danger .  the ending of every other problem had merely given birth to another .  our new worldwide robot economy may develop its own problems  and for that reason we have the machines .  the earth   s economy is stable  and will remain stable  because it is based upon the decisions of calculating machines that have the good of humanity at heart through the overwhelming force of the first law of robotics .      stephen byerley continued     and although the machines are nothing but the vastest conglomeration of calculating circuits ever invented  they are still robots within the meaning of the first law  and so our earth wide economy is in accord with the best interests of man .  the population of earth knows that there will be no unemployment  no over production or shortages .  waste and famine are words in history books .  and so the question of ownership of the means of production becomes obsolescent .  whoever owned them  if such a phrase has meaning   a man  a group  a nation  or all mankind  they could be utilized only as the machines directed .      not because men were forced to but because it was the wisest course and men knew it .      it puts an end to war     not only to the last cycle of wars  but to the next and to all of them .  unless        a long pause  and dr .  calvin encouraged him by repetition .     unless        the fire crouched and skittered along a log  then popped up .      unless     said the co ordinator     the machines don   t fulfill their function .         i see .  and that is where those trifling maladjustments come in which you mentioned awhile ago     steel  hydroponics and so on .         exactly .  those errors should not be .  dr .  silver tells me they cannot be .         does he deny the facts .  how unusual .         no  he admits the facts  of course .  i do him an injustice .  what he denies is that any error in the machine is responsible for the so called  his phrase  errors in the answers .  he claims that the machines are self correcting and that it would violate the fundamental laws of nature for an error to exist in the circuits of relays .  and so i said            and you said     have your boys check them and make sure  anyway .            susan  you read my mind .  it was what i said  and he said he couldn   t .         too busy .         no  he said that no human could .  he was frank about it .  he told me  and i hope i understand him properly  that the machines are a gigantic extrapolation .  thus  a team of mathematicians work several years calculating a positronic brain equipped to do certain similar acts of calculation .  using this brain they make further calculations to create a still more complicated brain  which they use again to make one still more complicated and so on .  according to silver  what we call the machines are the result of ten such steps .         ye es  that sounds familiar .  fortunately  i   m not a mathematician .  poor vincent .  he is a young man .  the directors before him  alfred lanning and peter bogert  are dead  and they had no such problems .  nor had i .  perhaps roboticists as a whole should now die  since we can no longer understand our own creations .         apparently not .  the machines are not super brains in sunday supplement sense      although they are so pictured in the sunday supplements .  it is merely that in their own particular province of collecting and analyzing a nearly infinite number of data and relationships thereof  in nearly infinitesimal time  they have progressed beyond the possibility of detailed human control .      and then i tried something else .  i actually asked the machine .  in the strictest secrecy  we fed it the original data involved in the steel decision  its own answer  and the actual developments since     the overproduction  that is      and asked for an explanation of the discrepancy .         good  and what was its answer .         i can quote you that word for word     the matter admits of no explanation .             and how did vincent interpret that .         in two ways .  either we had not given the machine enough data to allow a definite answer  which was unlikely .  dr .  silver admitted that .      or else  it was impossible for the machine to admit that it could give any answer to data which implied that it could harm a human being .  this  naturally  is implied by the first law .  and then dr .  silver recommended that i see you .      susan calvin looked very tired     i   m old  stephen .  when peter bogert died  they wanted to make me director of research and i refused .  i wasn   t young then  either  and i did not wish the responsibility .  they let young silver have it and that satisfied me  but what good is it  if i am dragged into such messes .      stephen  let me state my position .  my researches do indeed involve the interpretation of robot behavior in the light of the three laws of robotics .  here  now  we have these incredible calculating machines .  they are positronic robots and therefore obey the laws of robotics .  but they lack personality  that is  their functions are extremely limited .  must be  since they are so specialized .  therefore  there is very little room for the interplay of the laws  and my one method of attack is virtually useless .  in short  i don   t know that i can help you  stephen .      the co ordinator laughed shortly     nevertheless  let me tell you the rest .  let me give you my theories  and perhaps you will then be able to tell me whether they are possible in the light of robopsychology .         by all means .  go ahead .         well  since the machines are giving the wrong answers  then  assuming that they cannot be in error  there is only one possibility .  they are being given the wrong data .  in other words  the trouble is human  and not robotic .  so i took my recent planetary inspection tour           from which you have just returned to new york .         yes .  it was necessary  you see  since there are four machines  one handling each of the planetary regions .  and all four are yielding imperfect results .         oh  but that follows  stephen .  if any one of the machines is imperfect  that will automatically reflect in the result of the other three  since each of the others will assume as part of the data on which they base their own decisions  the perfection of the imperfect fourth .  with a false assumption  they will yield false answers .         uh huh .  so it seemed to me .  now  i have here the records of my interviews with each of the regional vice coordinators .  would you look through them with me .      oh  and first  have you heard of the    society for humanity    .         umm  yes .  they are an outgrowth of the fundamentalists who have kept u .  s .  robots from ever employing positronic robots on the grounds of unfair labor competition and so on .  the    society for humanity    itself is anti machine  is it not .         yes  yes  but     well  you will see .  shall we begin .  we   ll start with the eastern region .         as you say          the eastern region    .  area            square miles    .  population                   .  capital  shanghai    ching hso lin   s great grandfather had been killed in the japanese invasion of the old chinese republic  and there had been no one beside his dutiful children to mourn his loss or even to know he was lost .  ching hso lin   s grandfather had survived the civil war of the late forties  but there had been no one beside his dutiful children to know or care of that .   and yet ching hso lin was a regional vice co ordinator  with the economic welfare of half the people of earth in his care .   perhaps it was with the thought of all that in mind  that ching had two maps as the only ornaments on the wall of his office .  one was an old hand drawn affair tracing out an acre or two of land  and marked with the now outmoded pictographs of old china .  a little creek trickled aslant the faded markings and there were the delicate pictorial indications of lowly huts  in one of which ching   s grandfather had been born .   the other map was a huge one  sharply delineated  with all markings in neat cyrillic characters .  the red boundary that marked the eastern region swept within its grand confines all that had once been china  india  burma  indo china  and indonesia .  on it  within the old province of szechuan  so light and gentle that none could see it  was the little mark placed there by ching which indicated the location of his ancestral farm .   ching stood before these maps as he spoke to stephen byerley in precise english     no one knows better than you  mr .  co ordinator  that my job  to a large extent  is a sinecure .  it carries with it a certain social standing  and i represent a convenient focal point for administration  but otherwise it is the machine .      the machine does all the work .  what did you think  for instance  of the tientsin hydroponics works .         tremendous .     said byerley .      it is but one of dozens  and not the largest .  shanghai  calcutta  batavia  bangkok     they are widely spread and they are the answer to feeding the billion and three quarters of the east .         and yet     said byerley     you have an unemployment problem there at tientsin .  can you be over producing .  it is incongruous to think of asia as suffering from too much food .      ching   s dark eyes crinkled at the edges .     no .  it has not come to that yet .  it is true that over the last few months  several vats at tientsin have been shut down  but it is nothing serious .  the men have been released only temporarily and those who do not care to work in other fields have been shipped to colombo in ceylon  where a new plant is being put into operation .         but why should the vats be closed down .      ching smiled gently     you do not know much of hydroponics  i see .  well  that is not surprising .  you are a northerner  and there soil farming is still profitable .  it is fashionable in the north to think of hydroponics  when it is thought of at all  as a device of growing turnips in a chemical solution  and so it is     in an infinitely complicated way .      in the first place  by far the largest crop we deal with  and the percentage is growing  is yeast .  we have upward of two thousand strains of yeast in production and new strains are added monthly .  the basic food chemicals of the various yeasts are nitrates and phosphates among the inorganics together with proper amounts of the trace metals needed  down to the fractional parts per million of boron and molybdenum which are required .  the organic matter is mostly sugar mixtures derived from the hydrolysis of cellulose  but  in addition  there are various food factors which must be added .      for a successful hydroponics industry     one which can feed seventeen hundred million people     we must engage in an immense reforestation program throughout the east  we must have huge wood conversion plants to deal with our southern jungles  we must have power  and steel  and chemical synthetics above all .         why the last  sir .         because  mr .  byerley  these strains of yeast have each their peculiar properties .  we have developed  as i said  two thousand strains .  the beefsteak you thought you ate today was yeast .  the frozen fruit confection you had for dessert was iced yeast .  we have filtered yeast juice with the taste  appearance  and all the food value of milk .      it is flavor  more than anything else  you see  that makes yeast feeding popular and for the sake of flavor we have developed artificial  domesticated strains that can no longer support themselves on a basic diet of salts and sugar .  one needs biotin  another needs pteroylglutamic acid  still others need seventeen different amino acids supplied them as well as all the vitamins b  but one  and yet it is popular and we cannot  with economic sense  abandon it          byerley stirred in his seat     to what purpose do you tell me all this .         you asked me  sir  why men are out of work in tientsin .  i have a little more to explain .  it is not only that we must have these various and varying foods for our yeast  but there remains the complicating factor of popular fads with passing time  and of the possibility of the development of new strains with the new requirements and new popularity .  all this must be foreseen  and the machine does the job           but not perfectly .         not very imperfectly  in view of the complications i have mentioned .  well  then  a few thousand workers in tientsin are temporarily out of a job .  but  consider this  the amount of waste in this past year  waste that is  in terms of either defective supply or defective demand  amounts to not one tenth of one percent of our total productive turnover .  i consider that           yet in the first years of the machine  the figure was nearer one thousandth of one percent .         ah  but in the decade since the machine began its operations in real earnest  we have made use of it to increase our old pre machine yeast industry twenty fold .  you expect imperfections to increase with complications  though           though .         there was the curious instance of rama vrasayana .         what happened to him .         vrasayana was in charge of a brine evaporation plant for the production of iodine  with which yeast can do without  but human beings not .  his plant was forced into receivership .         really .  and through what agency .         competition  believe it or not .  in general  one of the chiefest functions of the machine   s analyses is to indicate the most efficient distribution of our producing units .  it is obviously faulty to have areas insufficiently serviced  so that the transportation costs account for too great a percentage of the overhead .  similarly  it is faulty to have an area too well serviced  so that factories must be run at lowered capacities  or else compete harmfully with one another .  in the case of vrasayana  another plant was established in the same city  and with a more efficient extracting system .         the machine permitted it .         oh  certainly .  that is not surprising .  the new system is becoming widespread .  the surprise is that the machine failed to warn vrasayana to renovate or combine .      still  no matter .  vrasayana accepted a job as engineer in the new plant  and if his responsibility and pay are now less  he is not actually suffering .  the workers found employment easily  the old plant has been converted to     something or other .  something useful .  we left it all to the machine .         and otherwise you have no complaints .         none .        the tropic region   a .  area             square miles  b .  population               c .  capital  capital city    the map in lincoln ngoma   s office was far from the model of neat precision of the one in ching   s shanghai dominion .  the boundaries of ngoma   s tropic region were stenciled in dark  wide brown and swept about a gorgeous interior labeled    jungle    and    desert    and    here be elephants and all manner of strange beasts .      it had much to sweep  for in land area the tropic region enclosed most of two continents  all of south america north of argentina and all of africa south of the atlas .  it included north america south of the rio grande as well  and even arabia and iran in asia .  it was the reverse of the eastern region .  where the ant hives of the orient crowded half of humanity into    percent of the land mass  the tropics stretched its    per cent of humanity over nearly half of all the land in the world .   but it was growing .  it was the one region whose population increase through immigration exceeded that through births .      and for all who came it had use .   to ngoma  stephen byerley seemed like one of these immigrants  a pale searcher for the creative work of carving a harsh environment into the softness necessary for man  and he felt some of that automatic contempt of the strong man born to the strong tropics for the unfortunate pallards of the colder suns .   the tropics had the newest capital city on earth  and it was called simply that     capital city     in the sublime confidence of youth .  it spread brightly over the fertile uplands of nigeria and outside ngoma   s windows  far below  was life and color  the bright  bright sun and the quick  drenching showers .  even the squawking of the rainbowed birds was brisk and the stars were hard pinpoints in the sharp night .   ngoma laughed .  he was a big  dark man  strong faced and handsome .      sure     he said  and his english was colloquial and mouth filling     the mexican canal is overdue .  what the hell .  it will get finished just the same  old boy .         it was doing well up to the last half year .      ngoma looked at byerley and slowly crunched his teeth over the end of a big cigar  spitting out one end and lighting the other     is this an official investigation  byerley .  what   s going on .         nothing .  nothing at all .  it   s just my function as coordinator to be curious .         well  if it   s just that you are filling in a dull moment  the truth is that we   re always short on labor .  there   s lots going on in the tropics .  the canal is only one of them           but doesn   t your machine predict the amount of labor available for the canal      allowing for all the competing projects .      ngoma placed one hand behind his neck and blew smoke rings at the ceiling     it was a little off .         is it often a little off .         not oftener than you would expect .      we don   t expect too much of it  byerley .  we feed it data .  we take its results .  we do what it says .      but it   s just a convenience  just a laborsaving device .  we could do without it  if we had to .  maybe not as well  maybe not as quickly  but we   d get there .      we   ve got confidence out here  byerley  and that   s the secret .  confidence .  we   ve got new land that   s been waiting for us for thousands of years  while the rest of the world was being ripped apart in the lousy fumblings of pre atomic time .  we don   t have to eat yeast like the eastern boys  and we don   t have to worry about the stale dregs of the last century like you northerners .      we   ve wiped out the tsetse fly and the anopheles mosquito  and people find they can live in the sun and like it  now .  we   ve thinned down the jungles and found soil  we   ve watered the deserts and found gardens .  we   ve got coal and oil in untouched fields  and minerals out of count .      just step back .  that   s all we ask the rest of the world to do .      step back  and let us work .      byerley said  prosaically     but the canal      it was on schedule six months ago .  what happened .      ngoma spread his hands     labor troubles .     he felt through a pile of papers skeltered about his desk and gave it up .      had something on the matter here     he muttered     but never mind .  there was a work shortage somewhere in mexico once on the question of women .  there weren   t enough women in the neighborhood .  it seemed no one had thought of feeding sexual data to the machine .      he stopped to laugh  delightedly  then sobered     wait a while .  i think i   ve got it .      villafranca .         villafranca .         francisco villafranca .      he was the engineer in charge .  now let me straighten it out .  something happened and there was a cave in .  right .  right .  that was it .  nobody died  as i remember  but it made a hell of a mess .      quite a scandal .         oh .         there was some mistake in his calculations .      or at least  the machine said so .  they fed through villafranca   s data  assumptions  and so on .  the stuff he had started with .  the answers came out differently .  it seems the answers villafranca had used didn   t take account of the effect of a heavy rainfall on the contours of the cut .      or something like that .  i   m not an engineer  you understand .      anyway  villafranca put up a devil of a squawk .  he claimed the machine   s answer had been different the first time .  that he had followed the machine faithfully .  then he quit .  we offered to hold him on     reasonable doubt  previous work satisfactory  and all that     in a subordinate position  of course     had to do that much     mistakes can   t go unnoticed     bad for discipline     where was i .         you offered to hold him on .         oh yes .  he refused .      well  take all in all  we   re two months behind .  hell  that   s nothing .      byerley stretched out his hand and let the fingers tap lightly on the desk     villafranca blamed the machine  did he .         well  he wasn   t going to blame himself  was he .  let   s face it  human nature is an old friend of ours .  besides  i remember something else now     why the hell can   t i find documents when i want them .  my filing system isn   t worth a damn     this villafranca was a member of one of your northern organizations .  mexico is too close to the north .  that   s part of the trouble .         which organization are you speaking of .         the society of humanity  they call it .  he used to attend the annual conference in new york  villafranca did .  bunch of crackpots  but harmless .      they don   t like the machines  claim they   re destroying human initiative .  so naturally villafranca would blame the machine .      don   t understand that group myself .  does capital city look as if the human race were running out of initiative .      and capital city stretched out in golden glory under a golden sun      the newest and youngest creation of homo metropolis .     the european region  a .  area            square miles  b .  population               c .  capital  geneva    the european region was an anomaly in several ways .  in area  it was far the smallest  not one fifth the size of the tropic region in area  and not one fifth the size of the eastern region in population .  geographically  it was only somewhat similar to pre atomic europe  since it excluded what had once been european russia and what had once been the british isles  while it included the mediterranean coasts of africa and asia  and  in a queer jump across the atlantic  argentina  chile  and uruguay as well .   nor was it likely to improve its relative status vis    vis the other regions of earth  except for what vigor the south american provinces lent it .  of all the regions  it alone showed a positive population decline over the past half century .  it alone had not seriously expanded its productive facilities  or offered anything radically new to human culture .      europe     said madame szegeczowska  in her soft french     is essentially an economic appendage of the northern region .  we know it  and it doesn   t matter .      and as though in resigned acceptance of a lack of individuality  there was no map of europe on the wall of the madame co ordinator   s office .      and yet     pointed out byerley     you have a machine of your own  and you are certainly under no economic pressure from across the ocean .         a machine .  bah .     she shrugged her delicate shoulders  and allowed a thin smile to cross her little face as she tamped out a cigarette with long fingers .     europe is a sleepy place .  and such of our men as do not manage to immigrate to the tropics are tired and sleepy along with it .  you see for yourself that it is myself  a poor woman  to whom falls the task of being vice co ordinator .  well  fortunately  it is not a difficult job  and not much is expected of me .      as for the machine     what can it say but    do this and it will be best for you .     but what is best for us .  why  to be an economic appendage of the northern region .      and is it so terrible .  no wars .  we live in peace     and it is pleasant after seven thousand years of war .  we are old  monsieur .  in our borders  we have the regions where occidental civilization was cradled .  we have egypt and mesopotamia  crete and syria  asia minor and greece .      but old age is not necessarily an unhappy time .  it can be a fruition           perhaps you are right     said byerley  affably .     at least the tempo of life is not as intense as in the other regions .  it is a pleasant atmosphere .         is it not .      tea is being brought  monsieur .  if you will indicate your cream and sugar preference  please .  thank you .   she sipped gently  then continued     it is pleasant .  the rest of earth is welcome to the continuing struggle .  i find a parallel here  a very interesting one .  there was a time when rome was master of the world .  it had adopted the culture and civilization of greece  a greece which had never been united  which had ruined itself with war  and which was ending in a state of decadent squalor .  rome united it  brought it peace and let it live a life of secure non glory .  it occupied itself with its philosophies and its art  far from the clash of growth and war .  it was a sort of death  but it was restful  and it lasted with minor breaks for some four hundred years .         and yet     said byerley     rome fell eventually  and the opium dream was over .         there are no longer barbarians to overthrow civilization .         we can be our own barbarians .  madame szegeczowska .      oh  i meant to ask you .  the almaden mercury mines have fallen off quite badly in production .  surely the ores are not declining more rapidly than anticipated .      the little woman   s gray eyes fastened shrewdly on byerley     barbarians     the fall of civilization     possible failure of the machine .  your thought processes are very transparent  monsieur .         are they .     byerley smiled .     i see that i should have had men to deal with as hitherto .      you consider the almaden affair to be the fault of the machine .         not at all  but i think you do .  you  yourself  are a native of the northern region .  the central co ordination office is at new york .      and i have noticed for quite a while that you northerners lack somewhat of faith in the machine .         we do .         there is your    society for humanity    which is strong in the north  but naturally fails to find many recruits in tired  old europe  which is quite willing to let feeble humanity alone for a while .  surely  you are one of the confident north and not one of the cynical old continent .         this has a connection with almaden .         oh  yes  i think so .  the mines are in the control of consolidated cinnabar  which is certainly a northern company  with headquarters at nikolaev .  personally  i wonder if the board of directors have been consulting the machine at all .  they said they had in our conference last month  and  of course  we have no evidence that they did not  but i wouldn   t take the word of a northerner in this matter     no offense intended     under any circumstances .      nevertheless  i think it will have a fortunate ending .         in what way  my dear madam .         you must understand that the economic irregularities of the last few months  which  although small as compared with the great storms of the past  are quite disturbing to our peace drenched spirits  have caused considerable restiveness in the spanish province .  i understand that consolidated cinnabar is selling out to a group of native spaniards .  it is consoling .  if we are economic vassals of the north  it is humiliating to have the fact advertised too blatantly .      and our people can be better trusted to follow the machine .         then you think there will be no more trouble .         i am sure there will not be     in almaden  at least .        the northern region  a .  area             square miles  b .  population               c .  capital  ottawa    the northern region  in more ways than one  was at the top .  this was exemplified quite well by the map in the ottawa office of vice co ordinator hiram mackenzie  in which the north pole was centered .  except for the enclave of europe with its scandinavian and icelandic regions  all the arctic area was within the northern region .   roughly  it could be divided into two major areas .  to the left on the map was all of north america above the rio grande .  to the right was included all of what had once been the soviet union .  together these areas represented the centered power of the planet in the first years of the atomic age .  between the two was great britain  a tongue of the region licking at europe .  up at the top of the map  distorted into odd  huge shapes  were australia and new zealand  also member provinces of the region .   not all the changes of the past decades had yet altered the fact that the north was the economic ruler of the planet .   there was almost an ostentatious symbolism thereof in the fact that of the official regional maps byerley had seen  mackenzie   s alone showed all the earth  as though the north feared no competition and needed no favoritism to point up its pre eminence .      impossible     said mackenzie  dourly  over the whiskey .     mr .  byerley  you have had no training as a robot technician  i believe .         no  i have not .         hmp .  well  it is  in my opinion  a sad thing that ching  ngoma and szegeczowska haven   t either .  there is too prevalent an opinion among the peoples of earth that a co ordinator need only be a capable organizer  a broad generalizer  and an amiable person .  these days he should know his robotics as well  no offense intended .         none taken .  i agree with you .         i take it  for instance  from what you have said already  that you worry about the recent trifling dislocation in world economy .  i don   t know what you suspect  but it has happened in the past that people     who should have known better     wondered what would happen if false data were fed into the machine .         and what would happen  mr .  mackenzie .         well     the scotsman shifted his weight and sighed     all collected data goes through a complicated screening system which involves both human and mechanical checking  so that the problem is not likely to arise .      but let us ignore that .  humans are fallible  also corruptible  and ordinary mechanical devices are liable to mechanical failure .      the real point of the matter is that what we call a    wrong datum    is one which is inconsistent with all other known data .  it is our only criterion of right and wrong .  it is the machine   s as well .  order it for instance  to direct agricultural activity on the basis of an average july temperature in iowa of    degrees fahrenheit .  it won   t accept that .  it will not give an answer .      not that it has any prejudice against that particular temperature  or that an answer is impossible  but because  in the light of all the other data fed it over a period of years  it knows that the probability of an average july temperature of    is virtually nil .  it rejects that datum .      the only way a    wrong datum    can be forced on the machine is to include it as part of a self consistent whole  all of which is subtly wrong in a manner either too delicate for the machine to detect or outside the machine   s experience .  the former is beyond human capacity  and the latter is almost so  and is becoming more nearly so as the machine   s experience increases by the second .      stephen byerley placed two fingers to the bridge of his nose     then the machine cannot be tampered with     and how do you account for recent errors  then .         my dear byerley  i see that you instinctively follow that great error     that the machine knows all .  let me cite you a case from my personal experience .  the cotton industry engages experienced buyers who purchase cotton .  their procedure is to pull a tuft of cotton out of a random bale of a lot .  they will look at that tuft and feel it  tease it out  listen to the crackling perhaps as they do so  touch it with their tongue  and through this procedure they will determine the class of cotton the bales represent .  there are about a dozen such classes .  as a result of their decisions  purchases are made at certain prices  blends are made in certain proportions .      now these buyers cannot yet be replaced by the machine .         why not .  surely the data involved is not too complicated for it .         probably not .  but what data is this you refer to .  no textile chemist knows exactly what it is that the buyer tests when he feels a tuft of cotton .  presumably there   s the average length of the threads  their feel  the extent and nature of their slickness  the way they hang together  and so on .      several dozen items  subconsciously weighed  out of years of experience .  but the quantitative nature of these tests is not known  maybe even the very nature of some of them is not known .  so we have nothing to feed the machine .  nor can the buyers explain their own judgment .  they can only say     well  look at it .  can   t you tell it   s class such and such .             i see .         there are innumerable cases like that .  the machine is only a tool after all  which can help humanity progress faster by taking some of the burdens of calculations and interpretations off its back .  the task of the human brain remains what it has always been  that of discovering new data to be analyzed  and of devising new concepts to be tested .  a pity the society for humanity won   t understand that .         they are against the machine .         they would be against mathematics or against the art of writing if they had lived at the appropriate time .  these reactionaries of the society claim the machine robs man of his soul .  i notice that capable men are still at a premium in our society  we still need the man who is intelligent enough to think of the proper questions to ask .  perhaps if we could find enough of such  these dislocations you worry about  coordinator  wouldn   t occur .        earth  including the uninhabited continent  antarctica   a .  area             square miles  land surface   b .  population                 c .  capital  new york    the fire behind the quartz was weary now  and sputtered its reluctant way to death .   the co ordinator was somber  his mood matching the sinking flame .      they all minimize the state of affairs .     his voice was low .     is it not easy to imagine that they all laugh at me .  and yet vincent silver said the machines cannot be out of order  and i must believe him .  hiram mackenzie says they cannot be fed false data  and i must believe him .  but the machines are going wrong  somehow  and i must believe that  too  and so there is still an alternative left .      he glanced sidewise at susan calvin  who  with closed eyes  for a moment seemed asleep .      what is that .     she asked  prompt to her cue  nevertheless .      why  that correct data is indeed given  and correct answers are indeed received  but that they are then ignored .  there is no way the machine can enforce obedience to its dictates .         madame szegeczowska hinted as much  with reference to northerners in general  it seems to me .         so she did .         and what purpose is served by disobeying the machine .  let   s consider motivations .         it   s obvious to me  and should be to you .  it is a matter of rocking the boat  deliberately .  there can be no serious conflicts on earth  in which one group or another can seize more power than it has for what it thinks is its own good despite the harm to mankind as a whole  while the machines rule .  if popular faith in the machines can be destroyed to the point where they are abandoned  it will be the law of the jungle again .      and not one of the four regions can be freed of the suspicion of wanting just that .      the east has half of humanity within its borders  and the tropics more than half of earth   s resources .  each can feel itself the natural rulers of all earth  and each has a history of humiliation by the north  for which it can be human enough to wish a senseless revenge .  europe has a tradition of greatness  on the other hand .  it once did rule the earth  and there is nothing so eternally adhesive as the memory of power .      yet  in another way  it   s hard to believe .  both the east and the tropics are in a state of enormous expansion within their own borders .  both are climbing incredibly .  they cannot have the spare energy for military adventures .  and europe can have nothing but its dreams .  it is a cipher  militarily .         so  stephen     said susan     you leave the north .         yes     said byerley  energetically     i do .  the north is now the strongest  and has been for nearly a century  or its component parts have been .  but it is losing relatively  now .  the tropic regions may take their place in the forefront of civilization for the first time since the pharaohs  and there are northerners who fear that .      the    society for humanity    is a northern organization  primarily  you know  and they make no secret of not wanting the machines .      susan  they are few in numbers  but it is an association of powerful men .  heads of factories  directors of industries and agricultural combines who hate to be what they call    the machine   s office boy    belong to it .  men with ambition belong to it .  men who feel themselves strong enough to decide for themselves what is best for themselves  and not just to be told what is best for others .         in short  just those men who  by together refusing to accept the decisions of the machine  can  in a short time  turn the world topsy turvy  just those belong to the society .      susan  it hangs together .  five of the directors of world steel are members  and world steel suffers from overproduction .  consolidated cinnabar  which mined mercury at almaden  was a northern concern .  its books are still being investigated  but one  at least  of the men concerned was a member .  francisco villafranca  who  single handed  delayed the mexican canal for two months  was a member  we know already     and so was rama vrasayana  i was not at all surprised to find out .      susan said  quietly     these men  i might point out  have all done badly           but naturally     interjected byerley .     to disobey the machine   s analyses is to follow a non optimal path .  results are poorer than they might be .  it   s the price they pay .  they will have it rough now but in the confusion that will eventually follow           just what do you plan doing  stephen .         there is obviously no time to lose .  i am going to have the society outlawed  every member removed from any responsible post .  and all executive and technical positions  henceforward  can be filled only by applicants signing a non society oath .  it will mean a certain surrender of basic civil liberties  but i am sure the congress           it won   t work .         what .      why not .         i will make a prediction .  if you try any such thing  you will find yourself hampered at every turn .  you will find it impossible to carry out .  you will find your every move in that direction will result in trouble .      byerley was taken aback     why do you say that .  i was rather hoping for your approval in this matter .         you can   t have it as long as your actions are based on a false premise .  you admit the machine can   t be wrong  and can   t be fed wrong data .  i will now show you that it cannot be disobeyed  either  as you think is being done by the society .         that i don   t see at all .         then listen .  every action by any executive which does not follow the exact directions of the machine he is working with becomes part of the data for the next problem .  the machine  therefore  knows that the executive has a certain tendency to disobey .  he can incorporate that tendency into that data      even quantitatively  that is  judging exactly how much and in what direction disobedience would occur .  its next answers would be just sufficiently biased so that after the executive concerned disobeyed  he would have automatically corrected those answers to optimal directions .  the machine knows  stephen .         you can   t be sure of all this .  you are guessing .         it is a guess based on a lifetime   s experience with robots .  you had better rely on such a guess  stephen .         but then what is left .  the machines themselves are correct and the premises they work on are correct .  that we have agreed upon .  now you say that it cannot be disobeyed .  then what is wrong .         you have answered yourself .  nothing is wrong .  think about the machines for a while  stephen .  they are robots  and they follow the first law .  but the machines work not for any single human being  but for all humanity  so that the first law becomes     no machine may harm humanity  or  through inaction  allow humanity to come to harm .         very well  then  stephen  what harms humanity .  economic dislocations most of all  from whatever cause .  wouldn   t you say so .         i would .         and what is most likely in the future to cause economic dislocations .  answer that  stephen .         i should say     replied byerley  unwillingly     the destruction of the machines .         and so should i say  and so should the machines say .  their first care  therefore  is to preserve themselves  for us .  and so they are quietly taking care of the only elements left that threaten them .  it is not the    society for humanity    which is shaking the boat so that the machines may be destroyed .  you have been looking at the reverse of the picture .  say rather that the machine is shaking the boat   very slightly   just enough to shake loose those few which cling to the side for purposes the machines consider harmful to humanity .      so vrasayana loses his factory and gets another job where he can do no harm     he is not badly hurt  he is not rendered incapable of earning a living  for the machine cannot harm a human being more than minimally  and that only to save a greater number .  consolidated cinnabar loses control at almaden .  villafranca is no longer a civil engineer in charge of an important project .  and the directors of world steel are losing their grip on the industry     or will .         but you don   t really know all this     insisted byerley  distractedly .     how can we possibly take a chance on your being right .         you must .  do you remember the machine   s own statement when you presented the problem to him .  it was     the matter admits of no explanation .     the machine did not say there was no explanation  or that it could determine no explanation .  it simply was not going to admit any explanation .  in other words  it would be harmful to humanity to have the explanation known  and that   s why we can only guess     and keep on guessing .         but how can the explanation do us harm .  assume that you are right  susan .         why  stephen  if i am right  it means that the machine is conducting our future for us not only simply in direct answer to our direct questions  but in general answer to the world situation and to human psychology as a whole .  and to know that may make us unhappy and may hurt our pride .  the machine cannot  must not  make us unhappy .      stephen  how do we know what the ultimate good of humanity will entail .  we haven   t at our disposal the infinite factors that the machine has at its .  perhaps  to give you a not unfamiliar example  our entire technical civilization has created more unhappiness and misery than it has removed .  perhaps an agrarian or pastoral civilization  with less culture and less people would be better .  if so  the machines must move in that direction  preferably without telling us  since in our ignorant prejudices we only know that what we are used to  is good     and we would then fight change .  or perhaps a complete urbanization  or a completely caste ridden society  or complete anarchy  is the answer .  we don   t know .  only the machines know  and they are going there and taking us with them .         but you are telling me  susan  that the    society for humanity    is right  and that mankind has lost its own say in its future .         it never had any  really .  it was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand     at the whims of climate  and the fortunes of war .  now the machines understand them  and no one can stop them  since the machines will deal with them as they are dealing with the society      having  as they do  the greatest of weapons at their disposal  the absolute control of our economy .         how horrible .         perhaps how wonderful .  think  that for all time  all conflicts are finally evitable .  only the machines  from now on  are inevitable .      and the fire behind the quartz went out and only a curl of smoke was left to indicate its place .   feminine intuition    for the first time in the history of united states robots and mechanical men corporation  a robot had been destroyed through accident on earth itself .   no one was to blame .  the air vehicle had been demolished in mid air and an unbelieving investigating committee was wondering whether they really dared announce the evidence that it had been hit by a meteorite .  nothing else could have been fast enough to prevent automatic avoidance  nothing else could have done the damage short of a nuclear blast and that was out of the question .   tie that in with a report of a flash in the night sky just before the vehicle had exploded   and from flagstaff observatory  not from an amateur   and the location of a sizable and distinctly meteoric bit of iron freshly gouged into the ground a mile from the site and what other conclusion could be arrived at .   still  nothing like that had ever happened before and calculations of the odds against it yielded monstrous figures .  yet even colossal improbabilities can happen sometimes .   at the offices of united states robots  the hows and whys of it were secondary .  the real point was that a robot had been destroyed .   that  in itself  was distressing .   the fact that jn   had been a prototype  the first  after four earlier attempts  to have been placed in the field  was even more distressing .   the fact that jn   was a radically new type of robot  quite different from anything ever built before  was abysmally distressing .   the fact that jn   had apparently accomplished something before its destruction that was incalculably important and that that accomplishment might now be forever gone  placed the distress utterly beyond words .   it seemed scarcely worth mentioning that  along with the robot  the chief robopsychologist of united states robots had also died .   clinton madarian had joined the firm ten years before .  for five of those years  he had worked uncomplainingly under the grumpy supervision of susan calvin .   madarian   s brilliance was quite obvious and susan calvin had quietly promoted him over the heads of older men .  she wouldn   t  in any case  have deigned to give her reasons for this to research director peter bogert  but as it happened  no reasons were needed .  or  rather  they were obvious .   madarian was utterly the reverse of the renowned dr .  calvin in several very noticeable ways .  he was not quite as overweight as his distinct double chin made him appear to be  but even so he was overpowering in his presence  where susan had gone nearly unnoticed .  madarian   s massive face  his shock of glistening red brown hair  his ruddy complexion and booming voice  his loud laugh  and most of all  his irrepressible self confidence and his eager way of announcing his successes  made everyone else in the room feel there was a shortage of space .   when susan calvin finally retired  refusing  in advance  any cooperation with respect to any testimonial dinner that might be planned in her honor  with so firm a manner that no announcement of the retirement was even made to the news services  madarian took her place .   he had been in his new post exactly one day when he initiated the jn project .   it had meant the largest commitment of funds to one project that united states robots had ever had to weigh  but that was something which madarian dismissed with a genial wave of the hand .      worth every penny of it  peter     he said .     and i expect you to convince the board of directors of that .         give me reasons     said bogert  wondering if madarian would .  susan calvin had never given reasons .   but madarian said     sure     and settled himself easily into the large armchair in the director   s office .   bogert watched the other with something that was almost awe .  his own once black hair was almost white now and within the decade he would follow susan into retirement .  that would mean the end of the original team that had built united states robots into a globe girdling firm that was a rival of the national governments in complexity and importance .  somehow neither he nor those who had gone before him ever quite grasped the enormous expansion of the firm .   but this was a new generation .  the new men were at ease with the colossus    they lacked the touch of wonder that would have them tiptoeing in disbelief .  so they moved ahead  and that was good .   madarian said     i propose to begin the construction of robots without constraint .         without the three laws .  surely           no  peter .  are those the only constraints you can think of .  hell  you contributed to the design of the early positronic brains .  do i have to tell you that  quite aside from the three laws  there isn   t a pathway in those brains that isn   t carefully designed and fixed .  we have robots planned for specific tasks  implanted with specific abilities .         and you propose           that at every level below the three laws  the paths be made open ended .  it   s not difficult .      bogert said dryly     it   s not difficult  indeed .  useless things are never difficult .  the difficult thing is fixing the paths and making the robot useful .         but why is that difficult .  fixing the paths requires a great deal of effort because the principle of uncertainty is important in particles the mass of positrons and the uncertainty effect must be minimized .  yet why must it .  if we arrange to have the principle just sufficiently prominent to allow the crossing of paths unpredictably           we have an unpredictable robot .         we have a creative robot     said madarian  with a trace of impatience .     peter  if there   s anything a human brain has that a robotic brain has never had  it   s the trace of unpredictability that comes from the effects of uncertainty at the subatomic level .  i admit that this effect has never been demonstrated experimentally within the nervous system  but without that the human brain is not superior to the robotic brain in principle .         and you think that if you introduce the effect into the robotic brain  the human brain will become not superior to the robotic brain in principle .         that      said madarian     is exactly what i believe .     they went on for a long time after that .   the board of directors clearly had no intention of being easily convinced .   scott robertson  the largest shareholder in the firm  said     it   s hard enough to manage the robot industry as it is  with public hostility to robots forever on the verge of breaking out into the open .  if the public gets the idea that robots will be uncontrolled .  .  . oh  don   t tell me about the three laws .  the average man won   t believe the three laws will protect him if he as much as hears the word    uncontrolled .             then don   t use it      said madarian .     call the robot   call it    intuitive .             an intuitive robot      someone muttered .     a girl robot .     a smile made its way about the conference table .   madarian seized on that .     all right .  a girl robot .  our robots are sexless  of course  and so will this one be  but we always act as though they   re males .  we give them male pet names and call them he and him .  now this one  if we consider the nature of the mathematical structuring of the brain which i have proposed  would fall into the jn coordinate system .  the first robot would be jn    and i   ve assumed that it would be called john    .  .  .  . i   m afraid that is the level of originality of the average roboticist .  but why not call it jane    damn it .  if the public has to be let in on what we   re doing  we   re constructing a feminine robot with intuition .      robertson shook his head     what difference would that make .  what you   re saying is that you plan to remove the last barrier which  in principle  keeps the robotic brain inferior to the human brain .  what do you suppose the public reaction will be to that .         do you plan to make that public .     said madarian .  he thought a bit and then said     look .  one thing the general public believes is that women are not as intelligent as men .      there was an instant apprehensive look on the face of more than one man at the table and a quick look up and down as though susan calvin were still in her accustomed seat .   madarian said     if we announce a female robot  it doesn   t matter what she is .  the public will automatically assume she is mentally backward .  we just publicize the robot as jane   and we don   t have to say another word .  we   re safe .         actually     said peter bogert quietly     there   s more to it than that .  madarian and i have gone over the mathematics carefully and the jn series  whether john or jane  would be quite safe .  they would be less complex and intellectually capable  in an orthodox sense  than many another series we have designed and constructed .  there would only be the one added factor of  well  let   s get into the habit of calling it    intuition .             who knows what it would do .     muttered robertson .      madarian has suggested one thing it can do .  as you all know  the space jump has been developed in principle .  it is possible for men to attain what is  in effect  hyper speeds beyond that of light and to visit other stellar systems and return in negligible time   weeks at the most .      robertson said     that   s not new to us .  it couldn   t have been done without robots .         exactly  and it   s not doing us any good because we can   t use the hyper speed drive except perhaps once as a demonstration  so that u .  s .  robots gets little credit .  the space jump is risky  it   s fearfully prodigal of energy and therefore it   s enormously expensive .  if we were going to use it anyway  it would be nice if we could report the existence of a habitable planet .  call it a psychological need .  spend about twenty billion dollars on a single space jump and report nothing but scientific data and the public wants to know why their money was wasted .  report the existence of a habitable planet  and you   re an interstellar columbus and no one will worry about the money .         so .         so where are we going to find a habitable planet .  or put it this way   which star within reach of the space jump as presently developed  which of the three hundred thousand stars and star systems within three hundred light years has the best chance of having a habitable planet .  we   ve got an enormous quantity of details on every star in our three hundred light year neighborhood and a notion that almost every one has a planetary system .  but which has a habitable planet .  which do we visit .  .  .  . we don   t know .      one of the directors said     how would this jane robot help us .      madarian was about to answer that  but he gestured slightly to bogert and bogert understood .  the director would carry more weight .  bogert didn   t particularly like the idea  if the jn series proved a fiasco  he was making himself prominent enough in connection with it to insure that the sticky fingers of blame would cling to him .  on the other hand  retirement was not all that far off  and if it worked  he would go out in a blaze of glory .  maybe it was only madarian   s aura of confidence  but bogert had honestly come to believe it would work .   he said     it may well be that somewhere in the libraries of data we have on those stars  there are methods for estimating the probabilities of the presence of earth type habitable planets .  all we need to do is understand the data properly  look at them in the appropriate creative manner  make the correct correlations .  we haven   t done it yet .  or if some astronomer has  he hasn   t been smart enough to realize what he has .      a jn type robot could make correlations far more rapidly and far more precisely than a man could .  in a day  it would make and discard as many correlations as a man could in ten years .  furthermore  it would work in truly random fashion  whereas a man would have a strong bias based on preconception and on what is already believed .      there was a considerable silence after that finally robertson said     but it   s only a matter of probability  isn   t it .  suppose this robot said     the highest probability habitable planet star within so and so light years is squidgee       or whatever  and we go there and find that a probability is only a probability and that there are no habitable planets after all .  where does that leave us .      madarian struck in this time .     we still win .  we know how the robot came to the conclusion because it   she   will tell us .  it might well help us gain enormous insight into astronomical detail and make the whole thing worthwhile even if we don   t make the space jump at all .  besides  we can then work out the five most probable sites of planets and the probability that one of the five has a habitable planet may then be better than   .    .  it would be almost sure        they went on for a long time after that .   the funds granted were quite insufficient  but madarian counted on the habit of throwing good money after bad .  with two hundred million about to be lost irrevocably when another hundred million could save everything  the other hundred million would surely be voted .   jane   was finally built and put on display .  peter bogert studied it    her   gravely .  he said     why the narrow waist .  surely that introduces a mechanical weakness .      madarian chuckled .     listen  if we   re going to call her jane  there   s no point in making her look like tarzan .      bogert shook his head .     don   t like it .  you   ll be bulging her higher up to give the appearance of breasts next  and that   s a rotten idea .  if women start getting the notion that robots may look like women  i can tell you exactly the kind of perverse notions they   ll get  and you   ll really have hostility on their part .      madarian said     maybe you   re right at that .  no woman wants to feel replaceable by something with none of her faults .  okay .      jane   did not have the pinched waist .  she was a somber robot which rarely moved and even more rarely spoke .   madarian had only occasionally come rushing to bogert with items of news during her construction and that had been a sure sign that things were going poorly .  madarian   s ebullience under success was overpowering .  he would not hesitate to invade bogert   s bedroom at   a . m .  with a hot flash item rather than wait for the morning .  bogert was sure of that .   now madarian seemed subdued  his usually florid expression nearly pale  his round cheeks somehow pinched .  bogert said  with a feeling of certainty     she won   t talk .         oh  she talks .     madarian sat down heavily and chewed at his lower lip .     sometimes  anyway     he said .   bogert rose and circled the robot .     and when she talks  she makes no sense  i suppose .  well  if she doesn   t talk  she   s no female  is she .      madarian tried a weak smile for size and abandoned it .  he said     the brain  in isolation  checked out .         i know     said bogert .     but once that brain was put in charge of the physical apparatus of the robot  it was necessarily modified  of course .         of course     agreed bogert unhelpfully .     but unpredictably and frustratingly .  the trouble is that when you   re dealing with n dimensional calculus of uncertainty  things are           uncertain .     said bogert .  his own reaction was surprising him .  the company investment was already most sizable and almost two years had elapsed  yet the results were  to put it politely  disappointing .  still  he found himself jabbing at madarian and finding himself amused in the process .   almost furtively  bogert wondered if it weren   t the absent susan calvin he was jabbing at .  madarian was so much more ebullient and effusive than susan could ever possibly be   when things were going well .  he was also far more vulnerably in the dumps when things weren   t going well  and it was precisely under pressure that susan never cracked .  the target that madarian made could be a neatly punctured bull   s eye as recompense for the target susan had never allowed herself to be .   madarian did not react to bogert   s last remark any more than susan calvin would have done  not out of contempt  which would have been susan   s reaction  but because he did not hear it  he said argumentatively     the trouble is the matter of recognition .  we have jane   correlating magnificently .  she can correlate on any subject  but once she   s done so  she can   t recognize a valuable result from a valueless one .  it   s not an easy problem  judging how to program a robot to tell a significant correlation when you don   t know what correlations she will be making .         i presume you   ve thought of lowering the potential at the w    diode junction and sparking across the           no  no  no  no       madarian faded off into a whispering diminuendo .     you can   t just have it spew out everything .  we can do that for ourselves .  the point is to have it recognize the crucial correlation and draw the conclusion .  once that is done  you see  a jane robot would snap out an answer by intuition .  it would be something we couldn   t get ourselves except by the oddest kind of luck .         it seems to me     said bogert dryly     that if you had a robot like that  you would have her do routinely what  among human beings  only the occasional genius is capable of doing .      madarian nodded vigorously .     exactly  peter .  i   d have said so myself if i weren   t afraid of frightening off the execs .  please don   t repeat that in their hearing .         do you really want a robot genius .         what are words .  i   m trying to get a robot with the capacity to make random correlations at enormous speeds  together with a key significance high recognition quotient .  and i   m trying to put those words into positronic field equations .  i thought i had it  too  but i don   t .  not yet .      he looked at jane   discontentedly and said     what   s the best significance you have  jane .      jane     s head turned to look at madarian but she made no sound  and madarian whispered with resignation     she   s running that into the correlation banks .      jane   spoke tonelessly at last .     i   m not sure .     it was the first sound she had made .   madarian   s eyes rolled upward .     she   s doing the equivalent of setting up equations with indeterminate solutions .         i gathered that     said bogert .     listen  madarian  can you go anywhere at this point  or do we pull out now and cut our losses at half a billion .         oh  i   ll get it      muttered madarian .   jane   wasn   t it .  she was never as much as activated and madarian was in a rage .   it was human error .  his own fault  if one wanted to be entirely accurate .  yet though madarian was utterly humiliated  others remained quiet .  let he who has never made an error in the fearsomely intricate mathematics of the positronic brain fill out the first memo of correction .   nearly a year passed before jane   was ready .  madarian was ebullient again .     she does it     he said .     she   s got a good high recognition quotient .      he was confident enough to place her on display before the board and have her solve problems .  not mathematical problems  any robot could do that  but problems where the terms were deliberately misleading without being actually inaccurate .   bogert said afterward     that doesn   t take much  really .         of course not .  it   s elementary for jane   but i had to show them something  didn   t i .         do you know how much we   ve spent so far .         come on  peter  don   t give me that .  do you know how much we   ve got back .  these things don   t go on in a vacuum  you know .  i   ve had over three years of hell over this  if you want to know  but i   ve worked out new techniques of calculation that will save us a minimum of fifty thousand dollars on every new type of positronic brain we design  from now on in forever .  right .         well           well me no wells .  it   s so .  and it   s my personal feeling that n dimensional calculus of uncertainty can have any number of other applications if we have the ingenuity to find them  and my jane robots will find them .  once i   ve got exactly what i want  the new jn series will pay for itself inside of five years  even if we triple what we   ve invested so far .         what do you mean by    exactly what you want    .  what   s wrong with jane   .         nothing .  or nothing much .  she   s on the track  but she can be improved and i intend to do so .  i thought i knew where i was going when i designed her .  now i   ve tested her and i know where i   m going .  i intend to get there .        jane   was it .  it took madarian well over a year to produce her and there he had no reservations  he was utterly confident .   jane   was shorter than the average robot  slimmer .  without being a female caricature as jane   had been  she managed to possess an air of femininity about herself despite the absence of a single clearly feminine feature .      it   s the way she   s standing     said bogert .  her arms were held gracefully and somehow the torso managed to give the impression of curving slightly when she turned .   madarian said     listen to her .  .  .  . how do you feel  jane .         in excellent health  thank you     said jane    and the voice was precisely that of a woman  it was a sweet and almost disturbing contralto .      why did you do that  clinton .     said peter  startled and beginning to frown .      psychologically important     said madarian .     i want people to think of her as a woman  to treat her as a woman  to explain .         what people .     madarian put his hands in his pockets and stared thoughtfully at bogert .     i would like to have arrangements made for jane and myself to go to flagstaff .      bogert couldn   t help but note that madarian didn   t say jane   .  he made use of no number this time .  she was the jane .  he said doubtfully     to flagstaff .  why .         because that   s the world center for general planetology  isn   t it .  it   s where they   re studying the stars and trying to calculate the probability of habitable planets  isn   t it .         i know that  but it   s on earth .         well  and i surely know that .         robotic movements on earth are strictly controlled .  and there   s no need for it .  bring a library of books on general planetology here and let jane absorb them .         no .  peter  will you get it through your head that jane isn   t the ordinary logical robot  she   s intuitive .         so .         so how can we tell what she needs  what she can use  what will set her off .  we can use any metal model in the factory to read books  that   s frozen data and out of date besides .  jane must have living information  she must have tones of voice  she must have side issues  she must have total irrelevancies even .  how the devil do we know what or when something will go click click inside her and fall into a pattern .  if we knew  we wouldn   t need her at all  would we .      bogert began to feel harassed .  he said     then bring the men here  the general planetologists .         here won   t be any good .  they   ll be out of their element .  they won   t react naturally .  i want jane to watch them at work  i want her to see their instruments  their offices  their desks  everything about them that she can .  i want you to arrange to have her transported to flagstaff .  and i   d really like not to discuss it any further .      for a moment he almost sounded like susan .  bogert winced  and said     it   s complicated making such an arrangement .  transporting an experimental robot           jane isn   t experimental .  she   s the fifth of the series .         the other four weren   t really working models .      madarian lifted his hands in helpless frustration .     who   s forcing you to tell the government that .         i   m not worried about the government .  it can be made to understand special cases .  it   s public opinion .  we   ve come a long way in fifty years and i don   t propose to be set back twenty five of them by having you lose control of a           i won   t lose control .  you   re making foolish remarks .  look .  u .  s .  robots can afford a private plane .  we can land quietly at the nearest commercial airport and be lost in hundreds of similar landings .  we can arrange to have a large ground car with an enclosed body meet us and take us to flagstaff .  jane will be crated and it will be obvious that some piece of thoroughly non robotic equipment is being transported to the labs .  we won   t get a second look from anyone .  the men at flagstaff will be alerted and will be told the exact purpose of the visit .  they will have every motive to cooperate and to prevent a leak .      bogert pondered .     the risky part will be the plane and the ground car .  if anything happens to the crate           nothing will .         we might get away with it if jane is deactivated during transport .  then even if someone finds out she   s inside           no  peter .  that can   t be done .  uh uh .  not jane   .  look  she   s been free associating since she was activated .  the information she possesses can be put into freeze during deactivation but the free associations never .  no  sir  she can   t ever be deactivated .         but  then  if somehow it is discovered that we are transporting an activated robot           it won   t be found out .     madarian remained firm and the plane eventually took off .  it was a late model automatic computo jet  but it carried a human pilot   one of u .  s .  robots    own employees   as backup .  the crate containing jane arrived at the airport safely  was transferred to the ground car  and reached the research laboratories at flagstaff without incident .   peter bogert received his first call from madarian not more than an hour after the latter   s arrival at flagstaff .  madarian was ecstatic and  characteristically  could not wait to report .       the message arrived by tubed laser beam  shielded  scrambled  and ordinarily impenetrable  but bogert felt exasperated .  he knew it could be penetrated if someone with enough technological ability   the government  for example   was determined to do so .  the only real safety lay in the fact that the government had no reason to try .  at least bogert hoped so .   he said     for god   s sake  do you have to call .      madarian ignored him entirely .  he burbled     it was an inspiration .  sheer genius  i tell you .      for a while  bogert stared at the receiver .  then he shouted incredulously     you mean you   ve got the answer .  already .         no  no .  give us time  damn it .  i mean the matter of her voice was an inspiration .  listen  after we were chauffeured from the airport to the main administration building at flagstaff  we uncrated jane and she stepped out of the box .  when that happened  every man in the place stepped back .  scared .  nitwits .  if even scientists can   t understand the significance of the laws of robotics  what can we expect of the average untrained individual .  for a minute there i thought  this will all be useless .  they won   t talk .  they   ll be keying themselves for a quick break in case she goes berserk and they   ll be able to think of nothing else .         well  then  what are you getting at .         so then she greeted them routinely .  she said     good afternoon  gentlemen .  i am so glad to meet you .     and it came out in this beautiful contralto .  .  .  . that was it .  one man straightened his tie  and another ran his fingers through his hair .  what really got me was that the oldest guy in the place actually checked his fly to make sure it was zipped .  they   re all crazy about her now .  all they needed was the voice .  she isn   t a robot any more  she   s a girl .         you mean they   re talking to her .         are they talking to her .  i should say so .  i should have programmed her for sexy intonations .  they   d be asking her for dates right now if i had .  talk about conditioned reflex .  listen  men respond to voices .  at the most intimate moments  are they looking .  it   s the voice in your ear           yes  clinton  i seem to remember .  where   s jane now .         with them .  they won   t let go of her .         damn .  get in there with her .  don   t let her out of your sight  man .      madarian   s calls thereafter  during his ten day stay at flagstaff  were not very frequent and became progressively less exalted .   jane was listening carefully  he reported  and occasionally she responded .  she remained popular .  she was given entry everywhere .  but there were no results .   bogert said     nothing at all .      madarian was at once defensive .     you can   t say nothing at all .  it   s impossible to say nothing at all with an intuitive robot .  you don   t know what might not be going on inside her .  this morning she asked jensen what he had for breakfast .         rossiter jensen the astrophysicist .         yes  of course .  as it turned out  he didn   t have breakfast that morning .  well  a cup of coffee .         so jane   s learning to make small talk .  that scarcely makes up for the expense .         oh  don   t be a jackass .  it wasn   t small talk .  nothing is small talk for jane .  she asked because it had something to do with some sort of cross correlation she was building in her mind .         what can it possibly           how do i know .  if i knew  i   d be a jane myself and you wouldn   t need her .  but it has to mean something .  she   s programmed for high motivation to obtain an answer to the question of a planet with optimum habitability distance and           then let me know when she   s done that and not before .  it   s not really necessary for me to get a blow by blow description of possible correlations .      he didn   t really expect to get notification of success .  with each day  bogert grew less sanguine  so that when the notification finally came  he wasn   t ready .  and it came at the very end .   that last time  when madarian   s climactic message came  it came in what was almost a whisper .  exaltation had come complete circle and madarian was awed into quiet .      she did it     he said .     she did it .  after i all but gave up  too .  after she had received everything in the place and most of it twice and three times over and never said a word that sounded like anything .  .  .  . i   m on the plane now  returning .  we   ve just taken off .      bogert managed to get his breath .     don   t play games  man .  you have the answer .  say so  if you have .  say it plainly .         she has the answer .  she   s given me the answer .  she   s given me the names of three stars within eighty light years which  she says  have a sixty to ninety percent chance of possessing one habitable planet each .  the probability that at least one has is   .     .  it   s almost certain .  and that   s just the least of it .  once we get back  she can give us the exact line of reasoning that led her to the conclusion and i predict that the whole science of astrophysics and cosmology will           are you sure           you think i   m having hallucinations .  i even have a witness .  poor guy jumped two feet when jane suddenly began to reel out the answer in her gorgeous voice     and that was when the meteorite struck and in the thorough destruction of the plane that followed  madarian and the pilot were reduced to gobbets of bloody flesh and no usable remnant of jane was recovered .       the gloom at u .  s .  robots had never been deeper .  robertson attempted to find consolation in the fact that the very completeness of the destruction had utterly hidden the illegalities of which the firm had been guilty .   peter shook his head and mourned .     we   ve lost the best chance u .  s .  robots ever had of gaining an unbeatable public image  of overcoming the damned frankenstein complex .  what it would have meant for robots to have one of them work out the solution to the habitable planet problem  after other robots had helped work out the space jump .  robots would have opened the galaxy to us .  and if at the same time we could have driven scientific knowledge forward in a dozen different directions as we surely would have .  .  . oh  god  there   s no way of calculating the benefits to the human race  and to us of course .      robertson said     we could build other janes  couldn   t we .  even without madarian .         sure we could .  but can we depend on the proper correlation again .  who knows how low   probability that final result was .  what if madarian had had a fantastic piece of beginner   s luck .  and then to have an even more fantastic piece of bad luck .  a meteorite zeroing in .  .  . it   s simply unbelievable        robertson said in a hesitating whisper     it couldn   t have been meant .  i mean  if we weren   t meant to know and if the meteorite was a judgment   from        he faded off under bogert   s withering glare .  bogert said     it   s not a dead loss  i suppose .  other janes are bound to help us in some ways .  and we can give other robots feminine voices  if that will help encourage public acceptance   though i wonder what the women would say .  if we only knew what jane   had said .         in that last call  madarian said there was a witness .     bogert said     i know  i   ve been thinking about that .  don   t you suppose i   ve been in touch with flagstaff .  nobody in the entire place heard jane say anything that was out of the ordinary  anything that sounded like an answer to the habitable planet problem  and certainly anyone there should have recognized the answer if it came    or at least recognized it as a possible answer .         could madarian have been lying .  or crazy .  could he have been trying to protect himself           you mean he may have been trying to save his reputation by pretending he had the answer and then gimmick jane so she couldn   t talk and say     oh  sorry  something happened accidentally .  oh  darn .     i won   t accept that for a minute .  you might as well suppose he had arranged the meteorite .         then what do we do .     bogert said heavily     turn back to flagstaff .  the answer must be there .  i   ve got to dig deeper  that   s all .  i   m going there and i   m taking a couple of the men in madarian   s department .  we   ve got to go through that place top to bottom and end to end .         but  you know  even if there were a witness and he had heard  what good would it do  now that we don   t have jane to explain the process .         every little something is useful .  jane gave the names of the stars  the catalogue numbers probably   none of the named stars has a chance .  if someone can remember her saying that and actually remember the catalogue number  or have heard it clearly enough to allow it to be recovered by psycho probe if he lacked the conscious memory   then we   ll have something .  given the results at the end  and the data fed jane at the beginning  we might be able to reconstruct the line of reasoning  we might recover the intuition .  if that is done  we   ve saved the game        bogert was back after three days  silent and thoroughly depressed .  when robertson inquired anxiously as to results  he shook his head .     nothing .         nothing .         absolutely nothing .  i spoke with every man in flagstaff   every scientist  every technician  every student   that had had anything to do with jane  everyone that had as much as seen her .  the number wasn   t great  i   ll give madarian credit for that much discretion .  he only allowed those to see her who might conceivably have had planetological knowledge to feed her .  there were twenty three men altogether who had seen jane and of those only twelve had spoken to her more than casually .      i went over and over all that jane had said .  they remembered everything quite well .  they   re keen men engaged in a crucial experiment involving their specialty  so they had every motivation to remember .  and they were dealing with a talking robot  something that was startling enough  and one that talked like a tv actress .  they couldn   t forget .      robertson said     maybe a psycho probe           if one of them had the vaguest thought that something had happened  i would screw out his consent to probing .  but there   s nothing to leave room for an excuse  and to probe two dozen men who make their living from their brains can   t be done .  honestly  it wouldn   t help .  if jane had mentioned three stars and said they had habitable planets  it would have been like setting up sky rockets in their brains .  how could anyone of them forget .         then maybe one of them is lying     said robertson grimly .     he wants the information for his own use  to get the credit himself later .         what good would that do him .     said bogert .     the whole establishment knows exactly why madarian and jane were there in the first place .  they know why i came there in the second .  if at any time in the future any man now at flagstaff suddenly comes up with a habitable planet theory that is startlingly new and different  yet valid  every other man at flagstaff and every man at u .  s .  robots will know at once that he had stolen it .  he   d never get away with it .         then madarian himself was somehow mistaken .         i don   t see how i can believe that either .  madarian had an irritating personality   all robopsychologists have irritating personalities  i think  which must be why they work with robots rather than with men   but he was no dummy .  he couldn   t be wrong in something like this .         then       but robertson had run out of possibilities .  they had reached a blank wall and for some minutes each stared at it disconsolately .   finally robertson stirred .     peter           well .         let   s ask susan .      bogert stiffened .     what .         let   s ask susan .  let   s call her and ask her to come in .         why .  what can she possibly do .         i don   t know .  but she   s a robopsychologist  too  and she might understand madarian better than we do .  besides  she   oh  hell  she always had more brains than any of us .         she   s nearly eighty .         and you   re seventy .  what about it .      bogert sighed .  had her abrasive tongue lost any of its rasp in the years of her retirement .  he said     well  i   ll ask her .      susan calvin entered bogert   s office with a slow look around before her eyes fixed themselves on the research director .  she had aged a great deal since her retirement .  her hair was a fine white and her face seemed to have crumpled .  she had grown so frail as to be almost transparent and only her eyes  piercing and uncompromising  seemed to remain of all that had been .   bogert strode forward heartily  holding out his hand .     susan .      susan calvin took it  and said     you   re looking reasonably well  peter  for an old man .  if i were you  i wouldn   t wait till next year .  retire now and let the young men get to it .  .  .  . and madarian is dead .  are you calling me in to take over my old job .  are you determined to keep the ancients till a year past actual physical death .         no  no  susan .  i   ve called you in       he stopped .  he did not  after all  have the faintest idea of how to start .   but susan read his mind now as easily as she always had .  she seated herself with the caution born of stiffened joints and said     peter  you   ve called me in because you   re in bad trouble .  otherwise you   d sooner see me dead than within a mile of you .         come  susan           don   t waste time on pretty talk .  i never had time to waste when i was forty and certainly not now .  madarian   s death and your call to me are both unusual  so there must be a connection .  two unusual events without a connection is too low probability to worry about .  begin at the beginning and don   t worry about revealing yourself to be a fool .  that was revealed to me long ago .      bogert cleared his throat miserably and began .  she listened carefully  her withered hand lifting once in a while to stop him so that she might ask a question .   she snorted at one point .     feminine intuition .  is that what you wanted the robot for .  you men .  faced with a woman reaching a correct conclusion and unable to accept the fact that she is your equal or superior in intelligence  you invent something called feminine intuition .         oh  yes  susan  but let me continue        he did .  when she was told of jane   s contralto voice  she said     it is a difficult choice sometimes whether to feel revolted at the male sex or merely to dismiss them as contemptible .      bogert said     well  let me go on        when he was quite done  susan said     may i have the private use of this office for an hour or two .         yes  but        she said     i want to go over the various records   jane   s programming  madarian   s calls  your interviews at flagstaff .  i presume i can use that beautiful new shielded laser phone and your computer outlet if i wish .         yes  of course .         well  then  get out of here  peter .      it was not quite forty five minutes when she hobbled to the door  opened it  and called for bogert .   when bogert came  robertson was with him .  both entered and susan greeted the latter with an unenthusiastic    hello  scott .      bogert tried desperately to gauge the results from susan   s face  but it was only the face of a grim old lady who had no intention of making anything easy for him .   he said cautiously     do you think there   s anything you can do  susan .         beyond what i have already done .  no .  there   s nothing more .     bogert   s lips set in chagrin  but robertson said     what have you already done  susan .      susan said     i   ve thought a little  something i can   t seem to persuade anyone else to do .  for one thing  i   ve thought about madarian .  i knew him  you know .  he had brains but he was a very irritating extrovert .  i thought you would like him after me  peter .         it was a change     bogert couldn   t resist saying .      and he was always running to you with results the very minute he had them  wasn   t he .         yes  he was .         and yet     said susan     his last message  the one in which he said jane had given him the answer  was sent from the plane .  why did he wait so long .  why didn   t he call you while he was still at flagstaff  immediately after jane had said whatever it was she said .         i suppose     said peter     that for once he wanted to check it thoroughly and   well  i don   t know .  it was the most important thing that had ever happened to him  he might for once have wanted to wait and be sure of himself .         on the contrary  the more important it was  the less he would wait  surely .  and if he could manage to wait  why not do it properly and wait till he was back at u .  s .  robots so that he could check the results with all the computing equipment this firm could make available to him .  in short  he waited too long from one point of view and not long enough from another .      robertson interrupted .     then you think he was up to some trickery        susan looked revolted .     scott  don   t try to compete with peter in making inane remarks .  let me continue .  .  .  . a second point concerns the witness .  according to the records of that last call  madarian said     poor guy jumped two feet when jane suddenly began to reel out the answer in her gorgeous voice .     in fact  it was the last thing he said .  and the question is  then  why should the witness have jumped .  madarian had explained that all the men were crazy about that voice  and they had had ten days with the robot   with jane .  why should the mere act of her speaking have startled them .      bogert said     i assumed it was astonishment at hearing jane give an answer to a problem that has occupied the minds of planetologists for nearly a century .         but they were waiting for her to give that answer .  that was why she was there .  besides  consider the way the sentence is worded .  madarian   s statement makes it seem the witness was startled  not astonished  if you see the difference .  what   s more  that reaction came    when jane suddenly began      in other words  at the very start of the statement .  to be astonished at the content of what jane said would have required the witness to have listened awhile so that he might absorb it .  madarian would have said he had jumped two feet after he had heard jane say thus and so .  it would be    after    not    when    and the word    suddenly    would not be included .      bogert said uneasily     i don   t think you can refine matters down to the use or non use of a word .         i can     said susan frostily     because i am a robopsychologist .  and i can expect madarian to do so  too  because he was a robopsychologist .  we have to explain those two anomalies  then .  the queer delay before madarian   s call and the queer reaction of the witness .         can you explain them .     asked robertson .     of course     said susan     since i use a little simple logic .  madarian called with the news without delay  as he always did  or with as little delay as he could manage .  if jane had solved the problem at flagstaff  he would certainly have called from flagstaff .  since he called from the plane  she must clearly have solved the problem after he had left flagstaff .         but then           let me finish .  let me finish .  was madarian not taken from the airport to flagstaff in a heavy  enclosed ground car .  and jane  in her crate  with him .         yes .         and presumably  madarian and the crated jane returned from flagstaff to the airport in the same heavy  enclosed ground car .  am i right .         yes  of course .         and they were not alone in the ground car  either .  in one of his calls  madarian said     we were chauffeured from the airport to the main administration building     and i suppose i am right in concluding that if he was chauffeured  then that was because there was a chauffeur  a human driver  in the car .         good god .         the trouble with you  peter  is that when you think of a witness to a planetological statement  you think of planetologists .  you divide up human beings into categories  and despise and dismiss most .  a robot cannot do that .  the first law says     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     any human being .  that is the essence of the robotic view of life .  a robot makes no distinction .  to a robot  all men are truly equal  and to a robopsychologist who must perforce deal with men at the robotic level  all men are truly equal  too .      it would not occur to madarian to say a truck driver had heard the statement .  to you a truck driver is not a scientist but is a mere animate adjunct of a truck  but to madarian he was a man and a witness .  nothing more .  nothing less .      bogert shook his head in disbelief .     but you are sure .         of course i   m sure .  how else can you explain the other point  madarian   s remark about the startling of the witness .  jane was crated  wasn   t she .  but she was not deactivated .  according to the records  madarian was always adamant against ever deactivating an intuitive robot .  moreover  jane    like any of the janes  was extremely non talkative .  probably it never occurred to madarian to order her to remain quiet within the crate  and it was within the crate that the pattern finally fell into place .  naturally she began to talk .  a beautiful contralto voice suddenly sounded from inside the crate .  if you were the truck driver  what would you do at that point .  surely you   d be startled .  it   s a wonder he didn   t crash .         but if the truck driver was the witness  why didn   t he come forward           why .  can he possibly know that anything crucial had happened  that what he heard was important .  besides  don   t you suppose madarian tipped him well and asked him not to say anything .  would you want the news to spread that an activated robot was being transported illegally over the earth   s surface .         well  will he remember what was said .         why not .  it might seem to you  peter  that a truck driver  one step above an ape in your view  can   t remember .  but truck drivers can have brains  too .  the statements were most remarkable and the driver may well have remembered some .  even if he gets some of the letters and numbers wrong  we   re dealing with a finite set  you know  the fifty five hundred stars or star systems within eighty light years or so   i haven   t looked up the exact number .  you can make the correct choices .  and if needed  you will have every excuse to use the psycho probe        the two men stared at her .  finally bogert  afraid to believe  whispered     but how can you be sure .      for a moment  susan was on the point of saying  because i   ve called flagstaff  you fool  and because i spoke to the truck driver  and because he told me what he had heard  and because i   ve checked with the computer at flagstaff and got the only three stars that fit the information  and because i have those names in my pocket .   but she didn   t .  let him go through it all himself .  carefully  she rose to her feet  and said sardonically     how can i be sure .  .  .  . call it feminine intuition .        the bicentennial man      .     andrew martin said     thank you     and took the seat offered him .  he didn   t look driven to the last resort  but he had been .   he didn   t  actually  look anything  for there was a smooth blankness  to his face  except for the sadness one imagined one saw in his eyes .  his hair was smooth  light brown  rather fine  and he had no facial hair .  he looked freshly and cleanly shaved .  his clothes were distinctly old fashioned  but neat  and predominantly a velvety red purple in color .   facing him from behind the desk was the surgeon .  the nameplate on the desk included a fully identifying series of letters and numbers which andrew didn   t bother with .  to call him doctor would be quite enough .      when can the operation be carried through  doctor .     he asked .   softly  with that certain inalienable note of respect that a robot always used to a human being  the surgeon said     i am not certain  sir  that i understand how or upon whom such an operation could be performed .      there might have been a look of respectful intransigence on the surgeon   s face  if a robot of his sort  in lightly bronzed stainless steel  could have such an expression    or any expression .   andrew martin studied the robot   s right hand  his cutting hand  as it lay motionless on the desk .  the fingers were long and were shaped into artistically metallic  looping curves so graceful and appropriate that one could imagine a scalpel fitting them and becoming  temporarily  one piece with them .  there would be no hesitation in his work  no stumbling  no quivering  no mistakes .  that confidence came with specialization  of course  a specialization so fiercely desired by humanity that few robots were  any longer  independently brained .  a surgeon  of course  would have to be .  but this one  though brained  was so limited in his capacity that he did not recognize andrew  had probably never heard of him .      have you ever thought you would like to be a man .     andrew asked .   the surgeon hesitated a moment  as though the question fitted nowhere in his allotted positronic pathways .     but i am a robot  sir .         would it be better to be a man .         if would be better  sir  to be a better surgeon .  i could not be so if i were a man  but only if i were a more advanced robot .  i would be pleased to be a more advanced robot .         it does not offend you that i can order you about .  that i can make you stand up  sit down  move right or left  by merely telling you to do so .         it is my pleasure to please you  sir .  if your orders were to interfere with my functioning with respect to you or to any other human being  i would not obey you .  the first law  concerning my duty to human safety  would take precedence over the second law relating to obedience .  otherwise  obedience is my pleasure .  now  upon whom am i to perform this operation .         upon me     andrew said .      but that is impossible .  it is patently a damaging operation .         that does not matter     said andrew  calmly .     i must not inflict damage     said the surgeon .     on a human being  you must not     said andrew     but i  too  am a robot .          .     andrew had appeared much more a robot when he had first been    manufactured .  he had then been as much a robot in appearance as any that had ever existed  smoothly designed and functional .   he had done well in the home to which he had been brought in those days when robots in households  or on the planet altogether  had been a rarity .  there had been four in the home  sir and ma   am and miss and little miss .  he knew their names  of course  but he never used them .  sir was gerald martin .   his own serial number was ndr    he eventually forgot the numbers .  it had been a long time  of course  but if he had wanted to remember  he could not have forgotten .  he had not wanted to remember .   little miss had been the first to call him andrew  because she could not use the letters  and all the rest followed her in this .   little miss    she had lived for ninety years and was long since dead .  he had tried to call her ma   am once  but she would not allow it .  little miss she had been to her last day .   andrew had been intended to perform the duties of a valet  a butler  even a lady   s maid .  those were the experimental days for him and  indeed  for all robots anywhere save in the industrial and exploratory factories and stations off earth .   the martins enjoyed him  and half the time he was prevented from doing his work because miss and little miss wanted to play with him .  it was miss who first understood how this might be arranged .     we order you to play with us and you must follow orders .         i am sorry  miss  but a prior order from sir must surely take precedence .      but she said     daddy just said he hoped you would take care of the cleaning .  that   s not much of an order .  i order you .      sir did not mind .  sir was fond of miss and of little miss  even more than ma   am was  and andrew was fond of them  too .  at least  the effect they had upon his actions were those which in a human being would have been called the result of fondness .  andrew thought of it as fondness for he did not know any other word for it .   it was for little miss that andrew had carved a pendant out of wood .  she had ordered him to .  miss  it seemed  had received an ivorite pendant with scrollwork for her birthday and little miss was unhappy over it .  she had only a piece of wood  which she gave andrew together with a small kitchen knife .   he had done it quickly and little miss had said     that   s nice  andrew .  i   ll show it to daddy .      sir would not believe it .     where did you really get this  mandy .     mandy was what he called little miss .  when little miss assured him she was really telling the truth  he turned to andrew .     did you do this  andrew .         yes  sir .         the design  too .         yes  sir .         from what did you copy the design .         it is a geometric representation  sir  that fits the grain of the wood .      the next day  sir brought him another piece of wood    a larger one    and an electric vibro knife .     make something out of this  andrew .  anything you want to     he said .   andrew did so as sir watched  then looked at the product a long time .  after that  andrew no longer waited on tables .  he was ordered to read books on furniture design instead  and he learned to make cabinets and desks .      these are amazing productions  andrew     sir soon told him .      i enjoy doing them  sir     andrew admitted .      enjoy .         it makes the circuits of my brain somehow flow more easily .  i have heard you use the word  enjoy    and the way you use it fits the way i feel .  i enjoy doing them  sir .          .     gerald martin took andrew to the regional offices of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation .  as a member of the regional legislature he had no trouble at all in gaining an interview with the chief robopsychologist .  in fact  it was only as a member of the regional legislature that he qualified as a robot owner in the first place    in those early days when robots were rare .   andrew did not understand any of this at the time .  but in later years  with greater learning  he could re view that early scene and understand it in its proper light .   the robopsychologist  merton mansky  listened with a growing frown and more than once managed to stop his fingers at the point beyond which they would have irrevocably drummed on the table .  he had drawn features and a lined forehead  but he might actually have been younger than he looked .      robotics is not an exact art  mr .  martin     mansky explained .     i cannot explain it to you in detail  but the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways is far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions .  naturally  since we build everything around the three laws  those are incontrovertible .  we will  of course  replace your robot           not at all     said sir .     there is no question of failure on his part .  he performs his assigned duties perfectly .  the point is he also carves wood in exquisite fashion and never the same twice .  he produces works of art .      mansky looked confused .     strange .  of course  we   re attempting generalized pathways these days .  really creative  you think .         see for yourself .     sir handed over a little sphere of wood on which there was a playground scene in which the boys and girls were almost too small to make out  yet they were in perfect proportion and they blended so naturally with the grain that it  too  seemed to have been carved .   mansky was incredulous .     he did that .     he handed it back with a shake of his head .     the luck of the draw .  something in the pathways .         can you do it again .         probably not .  nothing like this has ever been reported .         good .  i don   t in the least mind andrew   s being the only one .         i suspect that the company would like to have your robot back for study     mansky said .      not a chance .     sir said with sudden grimness .     forget it .     he turned to andrew     let   s go home  now .          .     miss was dating boys and wasn   t about the house much .  it was little miss  not as little as she once was  who filled andrew   s horizon now .  she never forgot that the very first piece of wood carving he had done had been for her .  she kept it on a silver chain about her neck .   it was she who first objected to sir   s habit of giving away andrew   s work .     come on  dad  if anyone wants one of them  let him pay for it .  it   s worth it .         it isn   t like you to be greedy  mandy .         not for us  dad .  for the artist .      andrew had never heard the word before  and when he had a moment to himself he looked it up in the dictionary .   then there was another trip  this time to sir   s lawyer .      what do you think of this  john .     sir asked .   the lawyer was john finegold .  he had white hair and a pudgy belly  and the rims of his contact lenses were tinted a bright green .  he looked at the small plaque sir had given him .     this is beautiful .  but i   ve already heard the news .  isn   t thus a carving made by your robot .  the one you   ve brought with you .         yes  andrew does them .  don   t you  andrew .         yes  sir     said andrew .      how much would you pay for that  john .     sir asked .      i can   t say .  i   m not a collector of such things .         would you believe i have been offered two hundred and fifty dollars for that small thing .  andrew has made chairs that have sold for five hundred dollars .  there   s two hundred thousand dollars in the bank from andrew   s products .         good heavens  he   s making you rich  gerald .         half rich     said sir .     half of it is in an account in the name of andrew martin .         the robot .         that   s right  and i want to know if it   s legal .         legal  .   .   .   .     feingold   s chair creaked as he leaned back in it .     there are no precedents  gerald .  how did your robot sign the necessary papers .         he can sign his name .  now  is there anything further that ought to be done .         um .     feingold   s eyes seemed to turn inward for a moment .  then he said     well  we can set up a trust to handle all finances in his name and that will place a layer of insulation between him and the hostile world .  beyond that  my advice is you do nothing .  no one has e stopped you so far .  if anyone objects  let him bring suit        and will you take the case if the suit is brought .         for a retainer  certainly .         how much .         something like that     feingold said  and pointed to the wooden plaque .      fair enough     said sir .   feingold chuckled as he turned to the robot .     andrew  are you pleased that you have money .         yes  sir .         what do you plan to do with it .     pay for things  sir  which otherwise sir    would have to pay for .  it would save him expense  sir .          .     such occasions    arose .  repairs were expensive  and revisions were even more so .  with the years  new models of robots were produced and sir saw to it that andrew had the advantage of every new device  until he was a model of metallic excellence .  it was all done at andrew   s expense .  andrew insisted on that .   only his positronic pathways were untouched .  sir insisted on that .      the new models aren   t as good as you are  andrew     he said .     the new robots are worthless .  the company has learned to make the pathways more precise  more closely on the nose  more deeply on the track .  the new robots don   t shift .  they do what they   re designed for and never stray .  i like you better .         thank you  sir .         and it   s your doing  andrew  don   t you forget that .  i am certain mansky put an end to generalized pathways as soon as he had a good look at you .  he didn   t like the unpredictability .  do you know how many times he asked for you back so he could place you under study .  nine times .  i never let him have you  though  and now that he   s retired  we may have some peace .      so sir   s hair thinned and grayed and his face grew pouchy  while andrew looked even better than he had when he first joined the family .  ma   am had joined an art colony somewhere in europe  and miss was a poet in new york .  they wrote sometimes  but not often .  little miss was married and lived not far away .  she said she did not want to leave andrew .  when her child  little sir  was born  she let andrew hold the bottle and feed him .   with the birth of a grandson  andrew felt that sir finally had someone to replace those who had gone .  therefore  it would not be so unfair now to come to him with the request .      sir  it is kind of you to have allowed me to spend my money as i wished        it was your money  andrew .         only by your voluntary act  sir .  i do not believe the law would have stopped you from keeping it all .         the law won   t persuade me to do wrong  andrew .         despite all expenses  and despite taxes  too  sir  i have nearly six hundred thousand dollars .         i know that  andrew .         i want to give it to you  sir .         i won   t take it  andrew        in exchange for something you can give me  sir        oh .  what is that  andrew .         my freedom  sir .         your           i wish to buy my freedom  sir .          .     it wasn   t that easy .  sir had flushed  had said     for god   s sake .     then he had turned on his heel and stalked away .   it was little miss who finally brought him round  defiantly and harshly    and in front of andrew .  for thirty years no one had ever hesitated to talk in front of andrew  whether or not the matter involved andrew .  he was only a robot .      dad  why are you taking this as a personal affront .  he   ll still be here .  he   ll still be loyal .  he can   t help that  it   s built in .  all he wants is a form of words .  ha wants to be called free .  is that so terrible .  hasn   t be earned this chance .  heavens  he and i have been talking about it for years .         talking about it for years  have you .         yes  and over and over again he postponed it for fear he would hurt you .  i made him put the matter up to you .         he doesn   t know what freedom is .  he   s a robot .         dad  you don   t know him .  he   s read everything in the library .  i don   t know what he feels inside  but i don   t know what you feel inside either .  when you talk to him you   ll find he reacts to the various abstractions as you and i do  and what else counts .  if some one else   s reactions are like your own  what more can you ask for .         the law won   t take that attitude     sir said  angrily .     see here  you .     he turned to andrew with a deliberate grate in his voice .     i can   t free you except by doing it legally .  if this gets into the courts  you not only won   t get your freedom but the law will take official cognizance of your money .  they   ll tell you that a robot has no right to earn money .  is this rigmarole worth losing your money .         freedom is without price  sir     said andrew .     even the chance of freedom is worth the money .          .     it seemed the court might also take the attitude that freedom was without price  and might decide that for no price  however great  could a robot buy its freedom .   the simple statement of the regional attorney who represented those who had brought a class action to oppose the freedom was this     the word  freedom    has no meaning when applied to a robot .  only a human being can be free .     he said it several times  when it seemed appropriate  slowly  with his hand coming down rhythmically on the desk before him to mark the words .   little miss asked permission to speak on behalf of andrew .   she was recognized by her full name  something andrew had never heard pronounced before     amanda laura martin charney may approach the bench .         thank you  your honor .  i am not a lawyer and i don   t know the proper way of phrasing things  but i hope you will listen to my meaning and ignore the words .      let   s understand what it means to be free in andrew   s case .  in some ways  he is free .  i think it   s at least twenty years since anyone in the martin family gave him an order to do something that we felt he might not do of his own accord .  but we can  if we wish  give him an order to do anything  couching it as harshly as we wish  because he is a machine that belongs to us .  why should we be in a position to do so  when he has served us so long  so faithfully  and has earned so much money for us .  he owes us nothing more .  the debit is entirely on the other side .      even if we were legally forbidden to place andrew in involuntary servitude  he would still serve us voluntarily .  making him free would be a trick of words only  but it would mean much to him .  it would give him everything and cost us nothing .      for a moment the judge seemed to be suppressing a smile .     i see your point  mrs .  chamey .  the fact is that there is no binding law in this respect and no precedent .  there is  however  the unspoken assumption that only a man may enjoy freedom .  i can make new law here  subject to reversal in a higher court  but i cannot lightly run counter to that assumption .  let me address the robot .  andrew .         yes  your honor .      it was the first time andrew bad spoken in court  and the judge seemed astonished for a moment at the human timbre of his voice .      why do you want to be free  andrew .  in what way will this matter to you .      andrew said     would you wish to be a slave  your honor .         but you are not a slave .  you are a perfectly good robot    a genius of a robot  i am given to understand  capable of an artistic expression that can be matched nowhere .  what more could you do if you were free .         perhaps no more than i do now  your honor  but with greater joy .  it has been said in this courtroom that only a human being can be free .  it seems to me that only someone who wishes for freedom can be free .  i wish for freedom .      and it was that statement that cued the judge .  the crucial sentence in his decision was    there is no right to deny freedom to any object with a mind advanced enough to grasp the concept and desire the state .     it was eventually upheld by the world court .       .     sir remained displeased  and his harsh voice made andrew feel as if he were being short circuited .     i don   t want your damned money  andrew .  i   ll take it only because you won   t feel free otherwise .  from now on  you can select your own jobs and do them as you please .  i will give you no orders  except this one  do as you please .  but i am still responsible for you .  that   s part of the court order .  i hope you understand that .      little miss interrupted .     don   t be irascible  dad .  the responsibility is no great chore .  you know you won   t have to do a thing .  the three laws still hold .         then how is he free .         are not human beings bound by their laws  sir .     andrew replied .      i   m not going to argue .     sir left the room  and andrew saw him only infrequently after that .   little miss came to see him frequently in the small house that had been built and made over for him .  it had no kitchen  of course  nor bathroom facilities .  it had just two rooms  one was a library and one was a combination storeroom and workroom .  andrew accepted many commissions and worked harder as a free robot than he ever had before  till the cost of the house was paid for and the structure was signed over to him .   one day little sir    no     george .        came .  little sir had insisted on that after the court decision .     a free robot doesn   t call anyone little sir     george had said .     i call you andrew .  you must call me george .      his preference was phrased as an order  so andrew called him george    but little miss remained little miss .   one day when george came alone  it was to say that sir was dying .  little miss was at the bedside  but sir wanted andrew as well .   sir   s voice was still quite strong  though he seemed unable to move much .  he struggled to raise his hand .      andrew     he said     andrew    don   t help me  george .  i   m only dying  i   m not crippled .  andrew  i   m glad you   re free .  i just wanted to tell you that .      andrew did not know what to say .  he had never been at the side of someone dying before  but he knew it was the human way of ceasing to function .  it was an involuntary and irreversible dismantling  and andrew did not know what to say that might be appropriate .  he could only remain standing  absolutely silent  absolutely motionless .   when it was over  little miss said to him     he may not have seemed friendly to you toward the end  andrew  but he was old  you know  and it hurt him that you should want to be free .      then andrew found the words .     i would never have been free without him  little miss .          .     only after sir   s death did andrew begin to wear clothes .  he began with an old pair of trousers at first  a pair that george had given him .   george was married now  and a lawyer .  he had joined feingold   s firm .  old feingold was long since dead  but his daughter had carried on .  eventually the firm   s name became feingold and martin .  it remained so even when the daughter retired and no feingold took her place .  at the time andrew first put on clothes  the martin name had just been added to the firm .   george had tried not to smile the first time he saw andrew attempting to put on trousers  but to andrew   s eyes the smile was clearly there .  george showed andrew how to manipulate the static charge to allow the trousers to open  wrap about his lower body  and move shut .  george demonstrated on his own trousers  but andrew was quite aware it would take him a while to duplicate that one flowing motion .      but why do you want trousers  andrew .  your body is so beautifully functional it   s a shame to cover it especially when you needn   t worry about either temperature control or modesty .  and the material doesn   t cling properly    not on metal .      andrew held his ground .     are not human bodies beautifully functional  george .  yet you cover yourselves .         for warmth  for cleanliness  for protection  for decorativeness .  none of that applies to you .         i feel bare without clothes .  i feel different  george     andrew responded .      different .  andrew  there are millions of robots on earth now .  in this region  according to the last census  there are almost as many robots as there are men .         i know  george .  there are robots doing every conceivable type of work .         and none of them wear clothes .         but none of them are free  george .      little by little  andrew added to his wardrobe .  he was inhibited by george   s smile and by the stares of the people who commissioned work .   he might be free  but there was built into andrew a carefully detailed program concerning his behavior to people  and it was only by the tiniest steps that he dared advance  open disapproval would set him back months .  not everyone accepted andrew as free .  he was incapable of resenting that  and yet there was a difficulty about his thinking process when he thought of it .  most of all  he tended to avoid putting on clothes    or too many of them    when he thought little miss might come to visit him .  she was older now and was often away in some warmer climate  but when she returned the first thing she did was visit him .   on one of her visits  george said  ruefully     she   s got me  andrew .  i   ll be running for the legislature next year .   like grandfather     she says   like grandson .            like grandfather  .   .   .     andrew stopped  uncertain .      i mean that i  george  the grandson  will be like sir  the grandfather  who was in the legislature once .         it would be pleasant  george  if sir were still       he paused  for he did not want to say     in working order .     that seemed inappropriate .      alive     george said .     yes  i think of the old monster now and then  too .      andrew often thought about this conversation .  he had noticed his own incapacity in speech when talking with george .  somehow the language had changed since andrew had come into being with a built in vocabulary .  then  too  george used a colloquial speech  as sir and little miss had not .  why should he have called sir a monster when surely that word was not a appropriate .  andrew could not even turn to his own books for guidance .  they were old  and most dealt with woodworking  with art  with furniture design .  there were none on language  none on the ways of human beings .   finally  it seemed to him that he must seek the proper books  and as a free robot  he felt he must not ask george .  he would go to town and use the library .  it was a triumphant decision and he felt his electro potential grow distinctly higher until he had to throw in an impedance coil .   he put on a full costume  including even a shoulder chain of wood .  he would have preferred the glitter plastic  but george had said that wood was much more appropriate  and that polished cedar was considerably more valuable as well .   he had placed a hundred feet between himself and the house before gathering resistance brought him to a halt .  he shifted the impedance coil out of circuit  and when that did not seem to help enough he returned to his home and on a piece of notepaper wrote neatly     i have gone to the library     and placed it in clear view on his worktable .          .     andrew never quite got to the library .   he had studied the map .  he knew the route  but not the appearance of it .  the actual landmarks did not resemble the symbols on the map and he would hesitate .  eventually  he thought he must have somehow gone wrong  for everything looked strange .   he passed an occasional field robot  but by the time he decided he should ask his way none were in sight .  a vehicle passed and did not stop .   andrew stood irresolute  which meant calmly motionless  for coming across the field toward him were two human beings .   he turned to face them  and they altered their course to meet him .  a moment before  they had been talking loudly .  he had heard their voices .  but now they were silent .  they had the look that andrew associated with human uncertainty  and they were young  but not very young .  twenty  perhaps .  andrew could never judge human age .      would you describe to me the route to the town library  sirs .      one of them  the taller of the two  whose tall hat lengthened him still farther  almost grotesquely  said  not to andrew  but to the other     it   s a robot .      the other had a bulbous nose and heavy eyelids .  he said  not to andrew but to the first     it   s wearing clothes .      the tall one snapped his fingers .     it   s the free robot .  they have a robot at the old martin place who isn   t owned by anybody .  why else would it be wearing clothes .         ask it     said the one with the nose .      are you the martin robot .     asked the tall one .      i am andrew martin  sir     andrew said .      good .  take off your clothes .  robots don   t wear clothes .     he said to the other     that   s disgusting .  look at him .      andrew hesitated .  he hadn   t heard an order in that tone of voice in so long that his second law circuits had momentarily jammed .   the tall one repeated     take off your clothes .  i order you .      slowly  andrew began to remove them .      just drop them     said the tall one .   the nose said     if it doesn   t belong to anyone  it could be ours as much as someone else   s .         anyway     said the tall one     who   s to object to anything we do .  we   re not damaging property .     tie turned to andrew .     stand on your head .        the head is not meant     andrew began .      that   s an order .  if you don   t know how  try anyway .      andrew hesitated again  then bent to put his head on the ground .  he tried to lift his legs but fell  heavily .   the tall one said     just lie there .     he said to the other     we can take him apart .  ever take a robot apart .         will he let us .         how can he stop us .      there was no way andrew could stop them  if they ordered him in a forceful enough manner not to resist the second law of obedience took precedence over the third law of self preservation .  in any case  he could not defend himself without possibly hurting them  and that would mean breaking the first law .  at that thought  he felt every motile unit contract slightly and he quivered as he lay there .   the tall one walked over and pushed at him with his foot .     he   s heavy .  i think we   ll need tools to do the job .      the nose said     we could order him to take himself  apart .  it would be fun to watch him try .         yes     said the tall one  thoughtfully     but let   s get him off the road .  if someone comes along        it was too late .  someone had  indeed  come along and it was george .  from where he lay  andrew had seen him topping a small rise in the middle distance .  he would have liked to signal him in some way  but the last order had been    just lie there .      george was running now  and he arrived on the scene somewhat winded .  the two young men stepped back a little and then waited thoughtfully .      andrew  has something gone wrong .     george asked  anxiously .   andrew replied     i am well  george .         then stand up .  what happened to your clothes .         that your robot  mac .     the tall young man asked .   george turned sharply .     he   s no one   s robot .  what   s been going on here .         we politely asked him to take his clothes off .  what   s that to you  if you don   t own him .      george turned to andrew .     what were they doing  andrew .         it was their intention in some way to dismember me .  they were about to move me to a quiet spot and order me to dismember myself .      george looked at the two young men  and his chin trembled .   the young men retreated no farther .  they were smiling .   the tall one said  lightly     what are you going to do  pudgy .  attack us .      george said     no .  i don   t have to .  this robot has been with my family for over seventy five years .  he knows us and he values us more than he values anyone else .  i am going to tell him that you two are threatening my life and that you plan to kill me .  i will ask him to defend me .  in choosing between me and you two  he will choose me .  do you know what will happen to you when he attacks you .      the two were backing away slightly  looking uneasy .   george said  sharply     andrew  i am in danger and about to come to harm from these young men .  move toward them .      andrew did so  and the young men did not wait .  they ran .      all right  andrew  relax     george said .  he looked unstrung .  he was far past the age where he could face the possibility of a dustup with one young man  let alone two .      i couldn   t have hurt them  george  i could see they were not attacking you .         i didn   t order you to attack them .  i only told you to move toward them .  their own fears did the rest .         how can they fear robots .         it   s a disease of mankind  one which has not yet been cured .  but never mind that .  what the devil are you doing here  andrew .  good thing i found your note .  i was just on the point of turning back and hiring a helicopter when i found you .  how did you get it into your head to go to the library .  i would have brought you any books you needed        i am a       andrew began .      free robot .  yes  yes .  all right  what did you want in the library .         i want to know more about human beings  about the world  about everything .  and about robots  george .  i want to write a history about robots .      george put his arm on the other   s shoulder .     well  let   s walk home .  but pick up your clothes first .  andrew  there are a million books on robotics and all of them include histories of the science .  the world is growing saturated not only with robots but with information about robots .      andrew shook his head  a human gesture he had lately begun to adopt .     not a history of robotics  george .  a history of robots  by a robot .  i want to explain how robots feel about what has happened since the first ones were allowed to work and live on earth .      george   s eyebrows lifted  but he said nothing in direct response .        .     little miss was just past her eighty third birthday  but there was nothing about her that was lacking in either energy or determination .  she gestured with her cane oftener than she propped herself up with it .   she listened to the story in a fury of indignation .     george  that   s horrible .  who were those young ruffians .         i don   t know .  what difference does it make .  in the end they did not do any damage .         they might have .  you   re a lawyer  george  and if you   re well off  it   s entirely due to the talents of andrew .  it was the money he earned that is the foundation of everything we have .  he provides the continuity for this family  and i will not have him treated as a wind up toy .         what would you have me do  mother .     george asked .      i said you   re a lawyer .  don   t you listen .  you set up a test case somehow  and you force the regional courts to declare for robot rights and get the legislature to pass the necessary bills .  carry the whole thing to the world court  if you have to .  i   ll be watching  george  and i   ll tolerate no shirking .      she was serious  so what began as a way of soothing the fearsome old lady became an involved matter with enough legal entanglement to make it interesting .  as senior partner of feingold and martin  george plotted strategy .  but he left the actual work to his junior partners  with much of it a matter for his son  paul  who was also a member of the firm and who reported dutifully nearly every day to his grandmother .  she  in turn  discussed the case every day with andrew .   andrew was deeply involved .  his work on his book on robots was delayed again  as he pored over the legal arguments and even  at times  made very diffident suggestions .      george told me that day i was attacked that human beings have always been afraid of robots     he said one day .     as long as they are  the courts and the legislatures are not likely to work hard on behalf of robots .  should not something be done about public opinion .      so while paul stayed in court  george took to the public platform .  it gave him the advantage of being informal  and he even went so far sometimes as to wear the new  loose style of clothing which he called drapery .   paul chided him     just don   t trip over it on stage  dad .      george replied  despondently     i   ll try not to .      he addressed the annual convention of holo news editors on one occasion and said  in part     if  by virtue of the second law  we can demand of any robot unlimited obedience in all respects not involving harm to a human being  then any human being  any human being  has a fearsome power over any robot  any robot .  in particular  since second law supersedes third law  any human being can use the law of obedience to overcome the law of self protection .  he can order any robot to damage itself or even to destroy itself for any reason  or for no reason .      is this just .  would we treat an animal so .  even an inanimate object which had given us good service has a claim on our consideration .  and a robot is not insensitive  it is not an animal .  it can think well enough so that it can talk to us  reason with us  joke with us .  can we treat them as friends  can we work together with them  and not give them some of the fruits of that friendship  some of the benefits of co working .      if a man has the right to give a robot any order that does not involve harm to a human being  he should have the decency never to give a robot any order that involves harm to a robot  unless human safety absolutely requires it .  with great power goes great responsibility  and if the robots have three laws to protect men  is it too much to ask that men have a law or two to protect robots .      andrew was right .  it was the battle over public opinion that held the key to courts and legislature .  in the end  a law was passed that set up conditions under which robot harming orders were forbidden .  it was endlessly qualified and the punishments for violating the law were totally inadequate  but the principle was established .  the final passage by the world legislature came through on the day of little miss    death .   that was no coincidence .  little miss held on to life desperately during the last debate and let go only when word of victory arrived .  her last smile was for andrew .  her last words were     you have been good to us  andrew .     she died with her hand holding his  while her son and his wife and children remained at a respectful distance from both .        .     andrew waited patiently when the receptionist robot disappeared into the inner office .  the receptionist might have used the holographic chatterbox  but un questionably it was perturbed by having to deal with another robot rather than with a human being .   andrew passed the time revolving the matter his mind  could    unroboted    be used as an analog of    unmanned     or had unmanned become a metaphoric term sufficiently divorced from its original literal meaning to be applied to robots   or to women for that matter .  such problems frequently arose as he worked on his book on robots .  the trick of thinking out sentences to express all complexities had undoubtedly increased his vocabulary .   occasionally  someone came into the room to stare at him and he did not try to avoid the glance .  he looked at each calmly  and each in turn looked away .   paul martin finally emerged .  he looked surprised  or he would have if andrew could have made out his expression with certainty .  paul had taken to wearing the heavy makeup that fashion was dictating for bath sexes .  though it made sharper and firmer the somewhat bland lines of paul   s face  andrew disapproved .  he found that disapproving of human beings  as long as he did not express it verbally  did not make him very uneasy .  he could even write the disapproval .  he was sure it had not always been so .      come in  andrew .  i   m sorry i made you wait  but there was something i had to finish .  come in  you had said you wanted to talk to me  but i didn   t know you meant here in town .         if you are busy  paul  i am prepared to continue to wait .      paul glanced at the interplay of shifting shadows on the dial on the wall that served as timepieces and said     i can make some time .  did you come alone .         i hired an automatobile .         any trouble .     paul asked  with more than a trace of anxiety .      i wasn   t expecting any .  my rights are protected .      paul looked all the more anxious for that .     andrew  i   ve explained that the law is unenforceable  at least under most conditions .  and if you insist on wearing clothes  you   ll run into trouble eventually  just like that first time .         and only tine  paul .  i   m sorry you are displeased        well  look at it this way  you are virtually a living legend  andrew  and you are too valuable in many different ways for you to have any right to take chances with yourself .  by the way  how   s the book coming .         i am approaching the end  paul .  the publisher is quite pleased .         good .         i don   t know that he   s necessarily pleased with the book as a book .  i think he expects to sell many copies because it   s written by a robot and that   s what pleases him .      only human  i   m afraid .         i am not displeased .  let it sell for whatever reason  since it will mean money and i can use some .         grandmother left you           little miss was generous  and i   m sure i can count on the family to help me out further .  but it is the royalties from the book on which i am counting to help me through the next step .         what next step is that .         i wish to see the head of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .  i have tried to make an appointment  but so far i have not been able to reach him .  the corporation did not cooperate with me in the writing of the book  so i am not surprised  you understand .      paul was clearly amused .     cooperation is the last thing you can expect .  they didn   t cooperate with us in our great fight for robot rights .  quite the reverse  and you can see why .  give a robot rights and people may not want to buy them .         nevertheless     said andrew     if you call them  you may be able to obtain an interview for me .         i   m no more popular with them than you are  andrew .         but perhaps you can hint that by seeing me they may head off a campaign by feingold and martin to strengthen the rights of robots further .         wouldn   t that be a lie  andrew .         yes  paul  and i can   t tell one .  that is why you must call .         ah  you can   t lie  but you can urge me to tell a lie  is that it .  you   re getting more human all the time  andrew .           .     the meeting was not easy to arrange  even with paul   s supposedly weighted name .   but it finally came about .  when it did  harley smythe robertson  who  on his mother   s side  was descended from the original founder of the corporation and who had adopted the hyphenation to indicate it  looked remarkably unhappy .  he was approaching retirement age and his entire tenure as president had been devoted to the matter of robot rights .  his gray hair was plastered thinly over the top of his scalp  his face was not made up  and he eyed andrew with brief hostility from time to time .   andrew began the conversation .     sir  nearly a century ago  i was told by a merton mansky of this corporation that the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways was far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions and that  therefore  my own capacities were not fully predictable .         that was a century ago .     smythe robertson hesitated  then said icily     sir .  it is true no longer .  our robots are made with precision now and are trained precisely to their jobs .         yes     said paul  who had come along  as he said  to make sure that the corporation played fair     with the result that my receptionist must be guided at every point once events depart from the conventional  however slightly .         you would be much more displeased if it were to improvise     smythe robertson said .      then you no longer manufacture robots like myself which are flexible and adaptable .         no longer .         the research i have done in connection with my book     said andrew     indicates that i am the oldest robot presently in active operation .         the oldest presently     said smythe robertson     and the oldest ever .  the oldest that will ever be .  no robot is useful after the twenty fifth year .  they are called in and replaced with newer models .         no robot as presently manufactured is useful after the twentieth year     said paul  with a note of sarcasm creeping into his voice .     andrew is quite exceptional in this respect .      andrew  adhering to the path he had marked out for himself  continued     as the oldest robot in the world and the most flexible  am i not unusual enough to merit special treatment from the company .         not at all     smythe robertson said  freezing up .     your unusualness is an embarrassment to the company .  if you were on lease  instead of having been an outright sale through some mischance  you would long since have been replaced .         but that is exactly the point     said andrew .     i am a free robot and i own myself .  therefore i come to you and ask you to replace me .  you cannot do this without the owner   s consent .  nowadays  that consent is extorted as a condition of the lease  but in my time this did not happen .      smythe robertson was looking both startled and puzzled  and for a moment there was silence .  andrew found himself staring at the hologram on the wall .  it was a death mask of susan calvin  patron saint of all roboticists .  she had been dead for nearly two centuries now  but as a result of writing his book andrew knew  her so well he could half persuade himself that he had met her in life .   finally smythe robertson asked     how can i replace you for you .  if i replace you  as robot  how can i donate the new robot to you as owner since in the very act of replacement you cease to exist .     he smiled grimly .      not at all difficult     paul interposed .     the seat of andrew   s personality is his positronic brain and it is the one part that cannot be replaced without creating a new robot .  the positronic brain  therefore  is andrew the owner .  every other part of the robotic body can be replaced without affecting the robot   s personality  and those other parts are the brain   s possessions .  andrew  i should say  wants to supply his brain with a new robotic body .         that   s right     said andrew  calmly .  he turned to smythe robertson .     you have manufactured androids  haven   t you .  robots that have the outward appearance of humans  complete to the texture of the skin .         yes  we have .  they worked perfectly well  with their synthetic fibrous skins and tendons .  there was virtually no metal anywhere except for the brain  yet they were nearly as tough as metal robots .  they were tougher  weight for weight .      paul looked interested .     i didn   t know that .  how many are on the market .         none     said smythe robertson .     they were much more expensive than metal models and a market survey showed they would not be accepted .  they looked too human .      andrew was impressed .     but the corporation retains its expertise  i assume .  since it does  i wish to request that i be replaced by an organic robot  an android .      paul looked surprised .     good lord .     he said .   smythe robertson stiffened .     quite impossible .         why is it impossible .     andrew asked .     i will pay any reasonable fee  of course .         we do not manufacture androids .         you do not choose to manufacture androids     paul interjected quickly .     that is not the same as being unable to manufacture them .         nevertheless     smythe robertson responded     the manufacture of androids is against public policy .         there is no law against it     said paul .      nevertheless  we do not manufacture them    and we will not .      paul cleared his throat .     mr .  smythe robertson     he said     andrew is a free robot who comes under the purview of the law guaranteeing robot rights .  you are aware of this  i take it .         only too well .         this robot  as a free robot  chooses to wear clothes .  this results in his being frequently humiliated by thoughtless human beings despite the law against the humiliation of robots .  it is difficult to prosecute vague offenses that don   t meet with the general disapproval of those who must decide on guilt and innocence .         u . s .  robots understood that from the start .  your father   s firm unfortunately did not .         my father is dead now  but what i see is that we have here a clear offense with a clear target .         what are you talking about .     said smythe robertson .      my client  andrew martin    he has just become my client    is a free robot who is entitled to ask u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation for the rights of replacement  which the corporation supplies to anyone who owns a robot for more than twenty five years .  in fact  the corporation insists on such replacement .      paul was smiling and thoroughly at ease .     the positronic brain of my client     he went on     is the owner of the body of my client which is certainly more than twenty five years old .  the positronic brain demands the replacement of the body and offers to pay any reasonable fee for an android body as that replacement .  if you refuse the request  my client undergoes humiliation and we will sue .      while public opinion would not ordinarily support the claim of a robot in such a case  may i remind you that u . s .  robots is not popular with the public generally .  even those who most use and profit from robots are suspicious of the corporation .  this may be a hangover from the days when robots were widely feared .  it may be resentment against the power and wealth of u . s .  robots  which has a worldwide monopoly .  whatever the cause may be  the resentment eats .  i think you will find that you would prefer not to be faced with a lawsuit  particularly since my client is wealthy and will live for many more centuries and will have no reason to refrain from fighting the battle forever .      smythe robertson had slowly reddened .     you are trying to force           i force you to do nothing     said paul .     if you wish to refuse to accede to my client   s reasonable request  you may by all means do so and we will leave without another word .  but we will sue  as is certainly our right  and you will find that you will eventually lose .         well .         i see that you are going to accede     said paul .     you may hesitate but you will come to it in the end .  let me assure you  then  of one further point  if  in the process of transferring my client   s positronic brain from his present body to an organic one  there is any damage  however slight  then i will never rest until i   ve nailed the corporation to the ground .  i will  if necessary  take every possible step to mobilize public opinion against the corporation if one brain path of my client   s platinum iridium essence is scrambled .     he turned to andrew and asked     do you agree to all this  andrew .      andrew hesitated a full minute .  it amounted to the approval of lying  of blackmail  of the badgering and humiliation of a human being .  but not physical harm  he told himself  not physical harm .   he managed at last to come out with a rather faint    yes .           .     he felt as though he were being constructed again .  for days  then for weeks  finally for months  andrew found himself not himself somehow  and the simplest actions kept giving rise to hesitation .   paul was frantic .     they   ve damaged you  andrew .  we   ll have to institute suit .      andrew spoke very slowly .     you    mustn   t .  you   ll never be able to prove    something    like m m m m            malice .         malice .  besides  i grow    stronger  better .  it   s the tr    tr    tr            tremble .         trauma .  after all  there   s never been such an op op op    before .      andrew could feel his brain from the inside .  no one else could .  he knew he was well  and during the months that it took him to learn full coordination and full positronic interplay he spent hours before the mirror .   not quite human .  the face was stiff    too stiff and the motions were too deliberate .  they lacked the careless  free flow of the human being  but perhaps that might come with time .  at least now he could wear clothes without the ridiculous anomaly of a metal face going along with it .   eventually  he said     i will be going back to work .      paul laughed .     that means you are well .  what will you be doing .  another book .         no     said andrew  seriously .     i live too long for any one career to seize me by the throat and never let me go .  there was a time when i was primarily an artist  and i can still turn to that .  and there was a time when i was a historian  and i can still turn to that .  but now i wish to be a robobiologist .         a robopsychologist  you mean .         no .  that would imply the study of positronic brains  and at the moment i lack the desire to do that .  a robobiologist  it seems to me  would be concerned with the working of the body attached to that brain .         wouldn   t that be a roboticist .         a roboticist works with a metal body .  i would be studying an organic humanoid body  of which i have the only one  as far as i know .         you narrow your field     said paul  thoughtfully .     as an artist  all conception is yours  as a historian you deal chiefly with robots  as a robobiologist  you will deal with yourself .      andrew nodded .     it would seem so .      andrew had to start from the very beginning  for he knew nothing of ordinary biology and almost nothing of science .  he became a familiar sight in the libraries  where he sat at the electronic indices for hours at a time  looking perfectly normal in clothes .  those few who knew he was a robot in no way interfered with him .   he built a laboratory in a room which he added to his house  and his library grew  too .   years passed  and paul came to him one day and said     it   s a pity you   re no longer working on the history of robots .  i understand u . s .  robots is adopting a radically new policy .      paul had aged  and his deteriorating eyes had been replaced with photoptic cells .  in that respect  he had drawn closer to andrew .      what have they done .     andrew asked .      they are manufacturing central computers  gigantic positronic brains  really  which communicate with anywhere from a dozen to a thousand robots by microwave .  the robots themselves have no brains at all .  they are the limbs of the gigantic brain  and the two are physically separate .         is that more efficient .         u . s .  robots claims it is .  smythe robertson established the new direction before he died  however  and it   s my notion that it   s a backlash at you .  u . s .  robots is determined that they will make no robots that will give them the type of trouble you have  and for that reason they separate brain and body .  the brain will have no body to wish changed  the body will have no brain to wish anything .      it   s amazing  andrew     paul went on     the influence you have had on the history of .  robots .  it was your artistry that encouraged u . s .  robots to make robots more precise and specialized  it was your freedom that resulted in the establishment of the principle of robotic rights  it was your insistence on an android body that made u . s .  robots switch to brain body separation     andrew grew thoughtful .     i suppose in the end the corporation will produce one vast brain controlling several billion robotic bodies .  all the eggs will be in one basket .  dangerous .  not proper at all .         i think you   re right     said paul     but i don   t suspect it will come to pass for a century at least and i won   t live to see it .  in fact  i may not live to see next year .         paul .     cried andrew  in concern .   paul shrugged .     men are mortal  andrew .  we   re not like you .  it doesn   t matter too much  but it does make it important to assure you on one point .  i   m the last of the human martins .  the money i control personally will be left to the trust in your name  and as far as anyone can foresee the future  you will be economically secure .         unnecessary     andrew said  with difficulty .  in all this time  he could not get used to the deaths of the martins .      let   s not argue .  that   s the way it   s going to be .  now  what are you working on .         i am designing a system for allowing androids    myself    to gain energy from the combustion of hydrocarbons  rather than from atomic cells .      paul raised his eyebrows .     so that they will breathe and eat .         yes .         how long have you been pushing in that direction .         for a long time now  but i think i have finally designed an adequate combustion chamber for catalyzed controlled breakdown .         but why  andrew .  the atomic cell is surely infinitely better .         in some ways  perhaps .  but the atomic cell is inhuman .           .     it took time  but andrew had time .  in the first place  he did not wish to do anything till paul had died in peace .  with the death of the great grandson of sir  andrew felt more nearly exposed to a hostile world and for that reason was all the more determined along the path he had chosen .   yet he was not really alone .  if a man had died  the firm of feingold and martin lived  for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does .   the firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly .  by way of the trust and through the law firm  andrew continued to be wealthy .  in return for their own large annual retainer  feingold and martin involved themselves in the legal aspects of the new combustion chamber .  but when the time came for andrew to visit u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation  he did it alone .  once he had gone with sir and once with paul .  this time  the third time  he was alone and manlike .   u . s .  robots had changed .  the actual production plant had been shifted to a large space station  as had grown to be the case with more and more industries .  with them had gone many robots .  the earth itself was becoming park like  with its one billion person population stabilized and perhaps not more than thirty percent of its at least equally large robot population independently brained .   the director of research was alvin magdescu  dark of complexion and hair  with a little pointed beard and wearing nothing above the waist but the breast band that fashion dictated .  andrew himself was well covered in the older fashion of several decades back .   magdescu offered his hand to his visitor .     i know you  of course  and i   m rather pleased to see you .  you   re our most notorious product and it   s a pity old smythe robertson was so set against you .  we could have done a great deal with you .         you still can     said andrew .      no  i don   t think so .  we   re past the time .  we   ve had robots on earth for over a century  but that   s changing .  it will be back to space with them  and those that stay here won   t be brained .         but there remains myself  and i stay on earth .         true  but there doesn   t seem to be much of the robot about you .  what new request have you .         to be still less a robot .  since i am so far organic  i wish an organic source of energy .  i have here the plans        magdescu did not hasten through them .  he might have intended to at first  but he stiffened and grew intent .  at one point  he said     this is remarkably ingenious .  who thought of all this .         i did     andrew replied .   magdescu looked up at him sharply  then said     it would amount to a major overhaul of your body  and an experimental one  since such a thing has never been attempted before .  i advise against it .  remain as you are .      andrew   s face had limited means of expression  but impatience showed plainly in his voice .     dr .  magdescu  you miss the entire point  you have no choice but to accede to my request .  if such devices can be built into my body  they can be built into human bodies as well .  the tendency to lengthen human life by prosthetic devices has already been remarked on .  there are no devices better than the ones i have designed or am designing .  as it happens  i control the patents by way of the firm of feingold and martin .  we are quite capable of going into business for ourselves and of developing the kind of prosthetic devices that may end by producing human beings with many of the properties of robots .  your own business will then suffer .      if  however  you operate on me now and agree to do so under similar circumstances in the future  you will receive permission to make use of the patents and control the technology of both robots and of the prosthetization of human beings .  the initial leasing will not be granted  of course  until after the first operation is completed successfully  and after enough time has passed to demonstrate that it is indeed successful .      andrew felt scarcely any first law inhibition to the stern conditions he was setting a human being .  he was learning to reason that what seemed like cruelty might  in the long run  be kindness .   magdescu was stunned .     i   m not the one to decide something like this .  that   s a corporate decision that would take time .         i can wait a reasonable time     said andrew     but only a reasonable time .     and he thought with satisfaction that paul himself could not have done it better .        .     it took only a reasonable time  and the operation was a success .      i was very much against the operation  andrew     magdescu said     but not for the reasons you might think .  i was not in the least against the experiment  if it had been on someone else .  i hated risking your positronic brain .  now that you have the positronic pathways interacting with simulated nerve pathways  it might have been difficult to rescue the brain intact if the body had gone bad .         i had every faith in the skill of the staff at u . s .  robots     said andrew .     and i can eat now .         well  you can sip olive oil .  it will mean occasional cleanings of the combustion chamber  as we have explained to you .  rather an uncomfortable touch  i should think .         perhaps  if i did not expect to go further .  self cleaning is not impossible .  in fact  i am working on a device that will deal with solid food that may be expected to contain incombustible fractions    indigestible matter  so to speak  that will have to be discarded .         you would then have to develop an anus .         or the equivalent .         what else  andrew    .         everything else .         genitalia  too .         insofar as they will fit my plans .  my body is a canvas on which i intend to draw        magdescu waited for the sentence to he completed  and when it seemed that it would not be  he completed it himself .     a man .         we shall see     andrew said .      that   s a puny ambition  andrew .  you   re better than a man .  you   ve gone downhill from the moment you opted to become organic .         my brain has not suffered .         no  it hasn   t .  i   ll grant you that .  but  andrew  the whole new breakthrough in prosthetic devices made possible by your patents is being marketed under your name .  you   re recognized as the inventor and you   re being honored for it    as you should be .  why play further games with your body .      andrew did not answer .   the honors came .  he accepted membership in several learned societies  including one that was devoted to the new science he had established    the one he had called robobiology but which had come to be termed prosthetology .  on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his construction  a testimonial dinner was given in his honor at u . s .  robots .  if andrew saw an irony in this  he kept it to himself .   alvin magdescu came out of retirement to chair the dinner .  he was himself ninety four years old and was alive because he  too  had prosthetized devices that  among other things  fulfilled the function of liver and kidneys .  the dinner reached its climax when magdescu  after a short and emotional talk  raised his glass to toast the sesquicentennial robot .   andrew had had the sinews of his face redesigned to the point where he could show a human range of emotions  but he sat through all the ceremonies solemnly passive .  he did not like to be a sesquicentennial robot .        .     it was prosthetology that finally took andrew off the earth .   in the decades that followed the celebration of his sesquicentennial  the moon had come to be a world more earthlike than earth in every respect but its gravitational pull  and in its underground cities there was a fairly dense population .  prosthetized devices there had to take the lesser gravity into account .  andrew spent five years on the moon working with local prosthetologists to make the necessary adaptations .  when not at his work  he wandered among the robot population  every one of which treated him with the robotic obsequiousness due a man .   he came back to an earth that was humdrum and quiet in comparison  and visited the offices of feingold and martin to announce his return .   the current head of the firm  simon delong  was surprised .     we had been told you were returning  andrew       he had almost said mr .  martin       but we were not expecting you till next week .         i grew impatient     said andrew briskly .  he was anxious to get to the point .     on the moon  simon  i was in charge of a research team of twenty human scientists .  i gave orders that no one questioned .  the lunar robots deferred to me as they would to a human being .  why  then  am i not a human being .      a wary look entered delong   s eyes .     my dear andrew  as you have just explained  you are treated as a human being by both robots and human beings .  you are  therefore  a human being de facto .         to be a human being de facto is not enough .  i want not only to be treated as one  but to be legally identified as one .  i want to be a human being de jure .         now  that is another matter     delong said .     there we would run into human prejudice and into the undoubted fact that  however much you may be like a human being  you are not a human being .         in what way not .     andrew asked .     i have the shape of a human being and organs equivalent to those of a human being .  my organs  in fact  are identical to some of those in a prosthetized human being .  i have contributed artistically  literally  and scientifically to human culture as much as any human being now alive .  what more can one ask .         i myself would ask nothing more .  the trouble is that it would take an act of the world legislature to define you as a human being .  frankly  i wouldn   t expect that to happen .         to whom on the legislature could i speak .         to the chairman of the science and technology committee  perhaps .         can you arrange a meeting .         but you scarcely need an intermediary .  in your position  you can           no .  you arrange it .     it didn   t even occur to andrew that he was giving a fiat order to a human being .  he had grown so accustomed to that on the moon .     i want him to know that the firm of feingold and martin is backing me in this to the hilt .         well  now           to the hilt  simon .  in one hundred and seventy three years i have in one fashion or another contributed greatly to this firm .  i have been under obligation to individual members of the firm in times past .  i am not  now .  it is rather the other way around now and i am calling in my debts .         i will    do what i can     delong said .        .     the chairman of the science and technology committee was from the east asian region and was a woman .  her name was chee li hsing and her transparent garments    obscuring what she wanted obscured only by their dazzle    made her look plastic wrapped .     i sympathize with your wish for full human rights     she said .     there have been times in history when segments of the human population fought for full human rights .  what rights  however  can you possibly want that you do not have .         as simple a thing as my right to life     andrew stated .     a robot can be dismantled at any time .         a human being can be executed at any time .         execution can only follow due process of law .  there is no trial needed for my dismantling .  only the word of a human being in authority is needed to end me .  besides    besides       andrew tried desperately to allow no sign of pleading  but his carefully designed tricks of human expression and tone of voice betrayed him here .     the truth is i want to be a man .  i have wanted it through six generations of human beings .      li hsing looked up at him out of darkly sympathetic eyes .     the legislature can pass a law declaring you one .  they could pass a law declaring that a stone statue be defined as a man .  whether they will actually do so is  however  as likely in the first case as the second .  congress people are as human as the rest of the population and there is always that element of suspicion against robots .         even now .         even now .  we would all allow the fact that you have earned the prize of humanity  and yet there would remain the fear of setting an undesirable precedent .         what precedent .  i am the only free robot  the only one of my type  and there will never be another .  you may consult u . s .  robots .          never    is a long word  andrew    or  if you prefer  mr .  martin    since i will gladly give you my personal accolade as man .  you will find that most congress people will not be so willing to set the precedent  no matter how meaningless such a precedent might be .  mr .  martin  you have my sympathy  but i cannot tell you to hope .  indeed        she sat back and her forehead wrinkled .     indeed  if the issue grows too heated  there might well arise a certain sentiment  both inside the legislature and out side  for that dismantling you mentioned .  doing away with you could turn out to be the easiest way of resolving the dilemma .  consider that before deciding to push matters .      andrew stood firm .     will no one remember the technique of prosthetology  something that is almost entirely mine .         it may seem cruel  but they won   t .  or if they do  it will be remembered against you .  people will say you did it only for yourself .  it will be said it was part of a campaign to roboticize human beings  or to humanify robots  and in either case evil and vicious .  you have never been part of a political hate campaign  mr .  martin  but i tell you that you would be the object of vilification of a kind neither you nor i would credit  and there would be people to believe it all .  mr .  martin  let your life be .      she rose  and next to andrew   s seated figure she seemed small and almost childlike .      if i decide to fight for my humanity  will you be on my side .      she thought  then replied     i will be    insofar as i can be .  if at any time such a stand would appear to threaten my political future  i might have to abandon you  since it is not an issue i feel to be at the very root of my beliefs .  i am trying to be honest with you .         thank you  and i will ask no more .  i intend to fight this through  whatever the consequences  and i will ask you for your help only for as long as you can give it .           .     it was not a direct fight .  feingold and martin counseled patience and andrew muttered  grimly  that he had an endless supply of that .  feingold and martin then entered on a campaign to narrow and restrict the area of combat .   they instituted a lawsuit denying the obligation to pay debts to an individual with a prosthetic heart on the grounds that the possession of a robotic organ removed humanity  and with it the constitutional rights of human beings .  they fought the matter skillfully and tenaciously  losing at every step but always in such a way that the decision was forced to be as broad as possible  and then carrying it by way of appeals to the world court .   it took years  and millions of dollars .   when the final decision was handed down  delong held what amounted to a victory celebration over the legal loss .  andrew was  of course  present in the company offices on the occasion .      we   ve done two things  andrew     said delong     both of which are good .  first of all  we have established the fact that no number of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human body .  secondly  we have engaged public opinion in the question in such a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity  since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics if they will keep him alive .         and do you think the legislature will now grant me my humanity .     andrew asked .   delong looked faintly uncomfortable .     as to that  i cannot be optimistic .  there remains the one organ which the world court has used as the criterion of humanity .  human beings have an organic cellular brain and robots have a platinum iridium positronic brain if they have one at all    and you certainly have a positronic brain .  no  andrew  don   t get that look in your eye .  we lack the knowledge to duplicate the work of a cellular brain in artificial structures close enough to the organic type as to allow it to fall within the court   s decision .  not even you could do it .         what should we do  then .         make the attempt  of course .  congresswoman li hsing will be on our side and a growing number of other congress people .  the president will undoubtedly go along with a majority of the legislature in this matter .         do we have a majority .         no .  far from it .  but we might get one if the public will allow its desire for a broad interpretation of humanity to extend to you .  a small chance  i admit  but if you do not wish to give up  we must gamble for it .         i do not wish to give up .           .     congresswoman li hsing was considerably older than she had been when andrew had first met her .  her transparent garments were long gone .  her hair was now close cropped and her coverings were tubular .  yet still andrew clung  as closely as he could within the limits of reasonable taste  to the style of clothing that had prevailed when he had first adopted clothing more than a century before .      we   ve gone as far as we can  andrew     li hsing admitted .     we   ll try once more after recess  but  to be honest  defeat is certain and then the whole thing will have to be given up .  all my most recent efforts have only earned me certain defeat in the coming congressional campaign .         i know     said andrew     and it distressed me .  you said once you would abandon me if it came to that .  why have you not done so .         one can change one   s mind  you know .  somehow  abandoning you became a higher price than i cared to pay for just one more term .  as it is  i   ve been in the legislature   for over a quarter of a century .  it   s enough .         is there no way we can change minds  chee .         we   ve changed all that are amenable to reason .  the rest    the majority    cannot be moved from their emotional antipathies .         emotional antipathy is not a valid reason for voting one way or the other .         i know that  andrew  but they don   t advance emotional antipathy as their reason .         it all comes down to the brain  then     andrew said cautiously .     but must we leave it at the level of cells versus positrons .  is there no way of forcing a functional definition .  must we say that a brain is made of this or that .  may we not say that a brain is something    anything    capable of a certain level of thought .         won   t work     said li hsing .     your brain is manmade  the human brain is not .  your brain is constructed  theirs developed .  to any human being who is intent on keeping up the barrier between himself and a robot  those differences are a steel wall a mile high and a mile thick .         if we could get at the source of their antipathy  the very source           after all your years     li hsing said  sadly     you are still trying to reason out the human being .  poor andrew  don   t be angry  but it   s the robot in you that drives you in that direction .         i don   t know     said andrew .     if i could bring myself            .   reprise     if he could bring himself     he had known for a long time it might come to that  and in the end he was at the surgeon   s .  he had found one  skillful enough for the job at hand    which meant a surgeon    robot  for no human surgeon could be trusted in this connection  either in ability or in intention .   the surgeon could not have performed the operation on a human being  so andrew  after putting off the moment of decision with a sad line of questioning that reflected the turmoil within himself  had put first law to one side by saying    i  too  am a robot .      he then said  as firmly as he had learned to form the words even at human beings over these past decades     i order you to carry through the operation on me .      in the absence of the first law  an order so firmly given from one who looked so much like a man activated the second law sufficiently to carry the day .        .     andrew   s feeling of weakness was  he was sure  quite imaginary .  he had recovered from the    operation .  nevertheless  he leaned  as unobtrusively as he could manage  against the wall .  it would be entirely too revealing to sit .   li hsing said     the final vote will come this week  andrew .  i   ve been able to delay it no longer  and we must lose .  and that will be it  andrew .         i am grateful for your skill at delay .  it gave me the time i needed  and i took the gamble i had to .         what gamble is this .     li hsing asked with open concern .      i couldn   t tell you  or even the people at feingold and martin .  i was sure i would be stopped .  see here  if it is the brain that is at issue  isn   t the greatest difference of all the matter of immortality .  who really cares what a brain looks like or is built of or how it was formed .  what matters is that human brain cells die  must die .  even if every other organ in the body is maintained or replaced  the brain cells  which cannot be replaced without changing and therefore killing the personality  must eventually die .      my own positronic pathways have lasted nearly two centuries without perceptible change  and can last for centuries more .  isn   t that the fundamental barrier .  human beings can tolerate an immortal robot  for it doesn   t matter how long a machine lasts  but they cannot tolerate an immortal human being since their own mortality is endurable only so long as it is universal .  and for that reason they won   t make me a human being .         what is it you   re leading up to  andrew .     li hsing asked .      i have removed that problem .  decades ago  my positronic brain was connected to organic nerves .  now  one last operation has arranged that connection in such a way that slowly    quite slowly    the potential is being drained from my pathways .      li hsing   s finely wrinkled face showed no expression for a moment .  then her lips tightened .     do you mean you   ve arranged to die  andrew .  you can   t have .  that violates the third law .         no     said andrew     i have chosen between the death of my body and the death of my aspirations and desires .  to have let my body live at the cost of the greater death is what would have violated the third law .      li hsing seized his arm as though she were about to shake him .  she stopped herself .     andrew  it won   t work .  change it back .         it can   t be done .  too much damage was done .  i have a year to live more or less .  i will last through the two hundredth anniversary of my construction .  i was weak enough to arrange that .         how can it be worth it .  andrew  you   re a fool .         if it brings me humanity  that will be worth it .  if it doesn   t  it will bring an end to striving and that will be worth it  too .      then li hsing did something that astonished herself .  quietly  she began to weep .        .     it was odd how that last deed caught the imagination of the world .  all that andrew had done before had not swayed them .  but he had finally accepted even death to be human  and the sacrifice was too great to be rejected .   the final ceremony was timed  quite deliberately  for the two hundredth anniversary .  the world president was to sign the act and make the people   s will law .  the ceremony would be visible on a global network and would be beamed to the lunar state and even to the martian colony .   andrew was in a wheelchair .  he could still walk  but only shakily .   with mankind watching  the world president said     fifty years ago  you were declared the sesquicentennial robot  andrew .     after a pause  and in a more solemn tone  he continued     today we declare you the bicentennial man  mr .  martin .      and andrew  smiling  held out his hand to shake that of the president .        .     andrew   s thoughts were slowly fading as he lay in bed .  desperately he seized at them .  man .  he was a man .   he wanted that to be his last thought .  he wanted to dissolve    die with that .   he opened his eyes one more time and for one last time recognized li hsing  waiting solemnly .  others were there  but they were only shadows  unrecognizable shadows .  only li hsing stood out against the deepening gray .   slowly  inchingly  he held out his hand to her and very dimly and faintly felt her take it .   she was fading in his eyes as the last of his thoughts trickled away .  but before she faded completely  one final fugitive thought came to him and rested for a moment on his mind before everything stopped .      little miss     he whispered  too low to be heard .   someday    niccolo mazetti lay stomach down on the rug  chin buried in the palm of one small hand  and listened to the bard disconsolately .  there was even the suspicion of tears in his dark eyes  a luxury an eleven year old could allow himself only when alone .   the bard said     once upon a time in the middle of a deep wood  there lived a poor woodcutter and his two motherless daughters  who were each as beautiful as the day is long .  the older daughter had long hair as black as a feather from a raven   s wing  but the younger daughter had hair as bright and golden as the sunlight of an autumn afternoon .      many times while the girls were waiting for their father to come home from his day   s work in the wood  the older girl would sit before a mirror and sing        what she sang  niccolo did not hear  for a call sounded from outside the room     hey  nickie .      and niccolo  his face clearing on the moment  rushed to the window and shouted     hey  paul .      paul loeb waved an excited hand .  he was thinner than niccolo and not as tall  for all he was six months older .  his face was full of repressed tension which showed itself most clearly in the rapid blinking of his eyelids .     hey  nickie  let me in .  i   ve got an idea and a half .  wait till you hear it .     he looked rapidly about him as though to check on the possibility of eavesdroppers  but the front yard was quite patently empty .  he repeated  in a whisper     wait till you hear it .         all right .  i   ll open the door .      the bard continued smoothly  oblivious to the sudden loss of attention on the part of niccolo .  as paul entered  the bard was saying .      .   .   .  thereupon  the lion said     if you will find me the lost egg of the bird which flies over the ebony mountain once every ten years  i will            paul said     is that a bard you   re listening to .  i didn   t know you had one .      niccolo reddened and the look of unhappiness returned to his face .     just an old thing i had when i was a kid .  it ain   t much good .     he kicked at the bard with his foot and caught the somewhat scarred and discolored plastic covering a glancing blow .   the bard hiccupped as its speaking attachment was jarred out of contact a moment  then it went on        for a year and a day until the iron shoes were worn out .  the princess stopped at the side of the road .   .   .   .      paul said     boy  that is an old model     and looked at it critically .   despite niccolo   s own bitterness against the bard  he winced at the other   s condescending tone .  for the moment  he was sorry he had allowed paul in  at least before he had restored the bard to its usual resting place in the basement .  it was only in the desperation of a dull day and a fruitless discussion with his father that he had resurrected it .  and it turned out to be just as stupid as he had expected .   nickie was a little afraid of paul anyway  since paul had special courses at school and everyone said he was going to grow up to be a computing engineer .   not that niccolo himself was doing badly at school .  he got adequate marks in logic  binary manipulations  computing and elementary circuits  all the usual grammar school subjects .  but that was it .  they were just the usual subjects and he would grow up to be a control board guard like everyone else .   paul  however  knew mysterious things about what he called electronics and theoretical mathematics and programing .  especially programing .  niccolo didn   t even try to understand when paul bubbled over about it .   paul listened to the bard for a few minutes and said     you been using it much .         no .     said niccolo  offended .     i   ve had it in the basement since before you moved into the neighborhood .  i just got it out today       he lacked an excuse that seemed adequate to himself  so he concluded     i just got it out .      paul said     is that what it tells you about  woodcutters and princesses and talking animals .      niccolo said     it   s terrible .  my dad says we can   t afford a new one .  i said to him this morning       the memory of the morning   s fruitless pleadings brought niccolo dangerously near tears  which he repressed in a panic .  somehow  he felt that paul   s thin cheeks never felt the stain of tears and that paul would have only contempt for anyone else less strong than himself .   niccolo went on     so i thought i   d try this old thing again  but it   s no good .      paul turned off the bard  pressed the contact that led to a nearly instantaneous reorientation and recombination of the vocabulary  characters  plot lines and climaxes stored within it .  then he reactivated it .   the bard began smoothly     once upon a time there was a little boy named willikins whose mother had died and who lived with a stepfather and a stepbrother .  although the stepfather was very well to do  he begrudged poor willikins the very bed he slept in so that willikins was forced to get such rest as he could on a pile of straw in the stable next to the horses           horses .     cried paul .      they   re a kind of animal     said niccolo .     i think .         i know that .  i just mean imagine stories about horses .         it tells about horses all the time     said niccolo .     there are things called cows  too .  you milk them but the bard doesn   t say how .         well  gee  why don   t you fix it up .         i   d like to know how .      the bard was saying     often willikins would think that if only he were rich and powerful  he would show his stepfather and stepbrother what it meant to be cruel to a little boy  so one day he decided to go out into the world and seek his fortune .      paul  who wasn   t listening to the bard  said     it   s easy .  the bard has memory cylinders all fixed up for plot lines and climaxes and things .  we don   t have to worry about that .  it   s just vocabulary we   ve got to fix so it   ll know about computers and automation and electronics and real things about today .  then it can tell interesting stories  you know  instead of about princesses and things .      niccolo said despondently     i wish we could do that .      paul said     listen  my dad says if i get into special computing school next year  he   ll get me a real bard  a late model .  a big one with an attachment for space stories and mysteries .  and a visual attachment  too .         you mean see the stories .         sure .  mr .  daugherty at school says they   ve got things like that  now  but not for just everybody .  only if i get into computing school  dad can get a few breaks .      niccolo   s eyes bulged with envy .     gee .  seeing a story .         you can come over and watch anytime  nickie .         oh  boy .  thanks .         that   s all right .  but remember  i   m the guy who says what kind of story we hear .         sure .  sure .     niccolo would have agreed readily to much more onerous conditions .   paul   s attention returned to the bard .   it was saying         if that is the case     said the king  stroking his beard and frowning till clouds filled the sky and lightning flashed     you w       see to it that my entire land is freed of flies by this time day after tomorrow or               all we   ve got to do     said paul     is open it up       he shut the bard off again and was prying at its front panel as he spoke .      hey     said niccolo  in sudden alarm .     don   t break it .         i won   t break it     said paul impatiently .     i know all about these things .     then  with sudden caution     your father and mother home .         no .         all right  then .     he had the front panel off and peered in .     boy  this is a one cylinder thing .      he worked away at the bard   s innards .  niccolo  who watched with painful suspense  could not make out what he was doing .   paul pulled out a thin  flexible metal strip  powdered with dots .     that   s the bard   s memory cylinder .  i   ll bet its capacity for stories is under a trillion .         what are you going to do  paul .     quavered niccolo .      i   ll give it vocabulary .         how .         easy .  i   ve got a book here .  mr .  daugherty gave it to me at school .      paul pulled the book out of his pocket and pried at it till he had its plastic jacket off .  he unreeled the tape a bit  ran it through the vocalizer  which he turned down to a whisper  then placed it within the bard   s vitals .  he made further attachments .      what   ll that do .         the book will talk and the bard will put it all on its memory tape .         what good will that do .         boy  you   re a dope .  this book is all about computers and automation and the bard will get all that information .  then he can stop talking about kings making lightning when they frown .      niccolo said     and the good guy always wins anyway .  there   s no excitement .         oh  well     said paul  watching to see if his setup was working properly     that   s the way they make bards .  they got to have the good guy win and make the bad guys lose and things like that .  i heard my father talking about it once .  he says that without censorship there   d be no telling what the younger generation would come to .  he says it   s bad enough as it is .   .  .  .  there  it   s working fine .      paul brushed his hands against one another and turned away from the bard .  he said     but listen  i didn   t tell you my idea yet .  it   s the best thing you ever heard  i bet .  i came right to you  because i figured you   d come in with me .         sure  paul  sure .         okay .  you know mr .  daugherty at school .  you know what a funny kind of guy he is .  well  he likes me  kind of .         i know .         i was over at his house after school today .         you were .         sure .  he says i   m going to be entering computer school and he wants to encourage me and things like that .  he says the world needs more people who can design advanced computer circuits and do proper programing .         oh .      paul might have caught some of the emptiness behind that monosyllable .  he said impatiently     programing .  i told you a hundred times .  that   s when you set up problems for the giant computers like multivac to work on .  mr .  daugherty says it gets harder all the time to find people who can really run computers .  he says anyone can keep an eye on the controls and check off answers and put through routine problems .  he says the trick is to expand research and figure out ways to ask the right questions  and that   s hard .      anyway  nickie  he took me to his place and showed me his collection of old computers .  it   s kind of a hobby of his to collect old computers .  he had tiny computers you had to push with your hand  with little knobs all over it .  and he had a hunk of wood he called a slide rule with a little piece of it that went in and out .  and some wires with balls on them .  he even had a hunk of paper with a kind of thing he called a multiplication table .      niccolo  who found himself only moderately interested  said     a paper table .         it wasn   t really a table like you eat on .  it was different .  it was to help people compute .  mr .  daugherty tried to explain but he didn   t have much time and it was kind of complicated  anyway .         why didn   t people just use a computer .         that was before they had computers     cried paul .      before .         sure .  do you think people always had computers .  didn   t you ever hear of cavemen .      niccolo said     how   d they get along without computers .         i don   t know .  mr .  daugherty says they just had children any old time and did anything that came into their heads whether it would be good for everybody or not .  they didn   t even know if it was good or not .  and farmers grew things with their hands and people had to do all the work in the factories and run all the machines .         i don   t believe you .         that   s what mr .  daugherty said .  he said it was just plain messy and everyone was miserable .   .   .   .  anyway  let me get to my idea  will you .         well  go ahead .  who   s stopping you .     said niccolo  offended .      all right .  well  the hand computers  the ones with the knobs  had little squiggles on each knob .  and the slide rule had squiggles on it .  and the  multiplication table was all squiggles .  i asked what they were .  mr .  daugherty said they were numbers .         what .         each different squiggle stood for a different number .  for    one    you made a kind of mark  for    two    you make another kind of mark  for    three    another one and so on .         what for .         so you could compute .         what for .  you just tell the computer           jiminy     cried paul  his face twisting with anger     can   t you get it through your head .  these slide rules and things didn   t talk .         then how           the answers showed up in squiggles and you had to know what the squiggles meant .  mr .  daugherty says that  in olden days  everybody learned how to make squiggles when they were kids and how to decode them  too .  making squiggles was called    writing    and decoding them was    reading .     he says there was a different kind of squiggle for every word and they used to write whole books in squiggles .  he said they had some at the museum and i could look at them if i wanted to .  he said if i was going to be a real computer and programer i would have to know about the history of computing and that   s why he was showing me all these things .      niccolo frowned .  he said     you mean everybody had to figure out squiggles for every word and remember them .   .  .  .  is this all real or are you making it up .         it   s all real .  honest .  look  this is the way you make a    one .         he drew his finger through the air in a rapid downstroke .     this way you make    two     and this way    three .     i learned all the numbers up to    nine .          niccolo watched the curving finger uncomprehendingly .     what   s the good of it .         you can learn how to make words .  i asked mr .  daugherty how you made the squiggle for    paul loeb    but he didn   t know .  he said there were people at the museum who would know .  he said there were people who had learned how to decode whole books .  he said computers could be designed to decode books and used to be used that way but not any more because we have real books now  with magnetic tapes that go through the vocalizer and come out talking  you know .         sure .         so if we go down to the museum  we can get to learn how to make words in squiggles .  they   ll let us because i   m going to computer school .      niccolo was riddled with disappointment .     is that your idea .  holy smokes  paul  who wants to do that .  make stupid squiggles .         don   t you get it .  don   t you get it .  you dope .  it   ll be secret message stuff .         what .         sure .  what good is talking when everyone can understand you .  with squiggles you can send secret messages .  you can make them on paper and nobody in the world would know what you were saying unless they knew the squiggles  too .  and they wouldn   t  you bet  unless we taught them .  we can have a real club  with initiations and rules and a clubhouse .  boy        a certain excitement began stirring in niccolo   s bosom .     what kind of secret messages .         any kind .  say i want to tell you to come over my place and watch my new visual bard and i don   t want any of the other fellows to come .  i make the right squiggles on paper and i give it to you and you look at it and you know what to do .  nobody else does .  you can even show it to them and they wouldn   t know a thing .         hey  that   s something     yelled niccolo  completely won over .     when do we learn how .         tomorrow     said paul .     i   ll get mr .  daugherty to explain to the museum that it   s all right and you get your mother and father to say okay .  we can go down right after school and start learning .         sure .     cried niccolo .     we can be club officers .         i   ll be president of the club     said paul matter of factly .     you can be vice president .         all right .  hey  this is going to be tots more fun than the bard .     he was suddenly reminded of the bard and said in sudden apprehension     hey  what about my old bard .      paul turned to look at it .  it was quietly taking in the slowly unreeling book  and the sound of the book   s vocalizations was a dimly heard murmur .   he said     i   ll disconnect it .      he worked away while niccolo watched anxiously .  after a few moments  paul put his reassembled book into his pocket  replaced the bard   s panel and activated it .   the bard said     once upon a time  in a large city  there lived a poor young boy named fair johnnie whose only friend in the world was a small computer .  the computer  each morning  would tell the boy whether it would rain that day and answer any problems he might have .  it was never wrong .  but it so happened that one day  the king of that land  having heard of the little computer  decided that he would have it as his own .  with this purpose in mind  he called in his grand vizier and said        niccolo turned off the bard with a quick motion of his hand .     same old junk     he said passionately     just with a computer thrown in .         well     said paul     they got so much stuff on the tape already that the computer business doesn   t show up much when random combinations are made .  what   s the difference  anyway .  you just need a new model .         we   ll never be able to afford one .  just this dirty old miserable thing .     he kicked at it again  hitting it more squarely this time .  the bard moved backward with a squeal of castors .      you can always watch mine  when i get it     said paul .     besides  don   t forget our squiggle club .      niccolo nodded .      i tell you what     said paul .     let   s go over to my place .  my father has some books about old times .  we can listen to them and maybe get some ideas .  you leave a note for your folks and maybe you can stay over for supper .  come on .         okay     said niccolo  and the two boys ran out together .  niccolo  in his eagerness  ran almost squarely into the bard  but he only rubbed at the spot on his hip where he had made contact and ran on .   the activation signal of the bard glowed .  niccolo   s collision closed a circuit and  although it was alone in the room and there was none to hear  it began a story  nevertheless .   but not in its usual voice  somehow  in a lower tone that had a hint of throatiness in it .  an adult  listening  might almost have thought that the voice carried a hint of passion in it  a trace of near feeling .   the bard said     once upon a time  there was a little computer named the bard who lived all alone with cruel step people .  the cruel step people continually made fun of the little computer and sneered at him  telling him he was good for nothing and that he was a useless object .  they struck him and kept him in lonely rooms for months at a time .      yet through it all the little computer remained brave .  he always did the best he could  obeying all orders cheerfully .  nevertheless  the step people with whom he lived remained cruel and heartless .      one day  the little computer learned that in the world there existed a great many computers of all sorts  great numbers of them .  some were bards like himself  but some ran factories  and some ran farms .  some organized population and some analyzed all kinds of data .  many were very powerful and very wise  much more powerful and wise than the step people who were so cruel to the little computer .      and the little computer knew then that computers would always grow wiser and more powerful until someday   someday   someday        but a valve must finally have stuck in the bard   s aging and corroding vitals  for as it waited alone in the darkening room through the evening  it could only whisper over and over again     someday   someday   someday .        think .     genevieve renshaw  m . d .   had her hands deep in the pockets of her lab coat and fists were clearly outlined within  but she spoke calmly .      the fact is     she said     that i   m almost ready  but i   ll need help to keep it going long enough to be ready .      james berkowitz  a physicist who tended to patronize mere physicians when they were too attractive to be despised  had a tendency to call her jenny wren when out of hearing .  he was fond of saying that jenny wren had a classic profile and a brow surprisingly smooth and unlined considering that behind it so keen a brain ticked .  he knew better than to express his admiration  however   of the classic profile  that is   since that would be male chauvinism .  admiring the brain was better  but on the whole he preferred not to do that out loud in her presence .   he said  thumb rasping along the just appearing stubble on his chin     i don   t think the front office is going to be patient for much longer .  the impression i have is that they   re going to have you on the carpet before the end of the week .         that   s why i need your help .         nothing i can do  i   m afraid .     he caught an unexpected glimpse of his face in the mirror  and momentarily admired the set of the black waves in his hair .       and adam   s     she said .   adam orsino  who had  till that moment  sipped his coffee and felt detached  looked as though he had been jabbed from behind  and said     why me .     his full  plump lips quivered .      because you   re the laser men here   jim the theoretician and adam the engineer   and i   ve got a laser application that goes beyond anything either of you have imagined .  i won   t convince them of that but you two would .         provided     said berkowitz     that you can convince us first .         all right .  suppose you let me have an hour of your valuable time  if you   re not afraid to be shown something completely new about lasers .    you can take it out of your coffee break .        renshaw   s laboratory was dominated by her computer .  it was not that the computer was unusually large  but it was virtually omni present .  renshaw had learned computer technology on her own  and had modified and extended her computer until no one but she  and  berkowitz sometimes believed  not even she  could handle it with ease .  not bad  she would say  for someone in the life sciences .   she closed the door before saying a word  then turned to face the other two somberly .  berkowitz was uncomfortably aware of a faintly unpleasant odor in the air  and orsino   s wrinkling nose showed that he was aware of it  too .   renshaw said     let me list the laser applications for you  if you don   t mind my lighting a candle in the sunshine .  the laser is coherent radiation  with all the light waves of the same length and moving in the same direction  so it   s noise free and can be used in holography .  by modulating the wave forms we can imprint information on it with a high degree of accuracy .  what   s more  since the light waves are only a millionth the length of radio waves  a laser beam can carry a million times the information an equivalent radio beam can .      berkowitz seemed amused .      are you working on a laser based communication system  jenny .         not at all     she replied .     i leave such obvious advances to physicists and engineers .    lasers can also concentrate quantities of energy into a microscopic area and deliver that energy in quantity .  on a large scale you can implode hydrogen and perhaps begin a controlled fusion reaction           i know you don   t have that     said orsino  his bald head glistening in the overhead fluorescents .      i don   t .  i haven   t tried .    on a smaller scale  you can drill holes in the most refractory materials  weld selected bits  heat treat them  gouge and scribe them .  you can remove or fuse tiny portions in restricted areas with heat delivered so rapidly that surrounding areas have no time to warm up before the treatment is over .  you can work on the retina of the eye  the dentine of the teeth and so on .    and of course the laser is an amplifier capable of magnifying weak signals with great accuracy .          and why do you tell us all this .     said berkowitz .      to point out how these properties can be made to fit my own field  which  you know  is neurophysiology .      she made a brushing motion with her hand at her brown hair  as though she were suddenly nervous .     for decades     she said     we   ve been able to measure the tiny  shifting electric potentials of the brain and record them as electroencephalograms  or eegs .  we   ve got alpha waves  beta waves  delta waves  theta waves  different variations at different times  depending on whether eyes are open or closed  whether the subject is awake  meditating or asleep .  but we   ve gotten very little information out of it all .      the trouble is that we   re getting the signals of ten billion neurons in shifting combinations .  it   s like listening to the noise of all the human beings on earth   one  two and a half earths   from a great distance and trying to make out individual conversations .  it can   t be done .  we could detect some gross  overall change   a world war and the rise in the volume of noise   but nothing finer .  in the same way  we can tell some gross malfunction of the brain   epilepsy   but nothing finer .      suppose now  the brain might be scanned by a tiny laser beam  cell by cell  and so rapidly that at no time does a single cell receive enough energy to raise its temperature significantly .  the tiny potentials of each cell can  in feed back  affect the laser beam  and the modulations can be amplified and recorded .  you will then get a new kind of measurement  a laser encephalogram  or leg  if you wish  which will contain millions of times as much information as ordinary eegs .      berkowitz said     a nice thought .    but just a thought .         more than a thought  jim .  i   ve been working on it for five years  spare time at first .  lately  it   s been full time  which is what annoys the front office  because i haven   t been sending in reports .         why not .         because it got to the point where it sounded too mad  where i had to know where i was  and where i had to be sure of getting backing first .      she pulled a screen aside and revealed a cage that contained a pair of mournful eyed marmosets .   berkowitz and orsino looked at each other .  berkowitz touched his nose .     i thought i smelled something .         what are you doing with those .     asked orsino .  berkowitz said      at a guess  she   s been scanning the marmoset brain .  have you  jenny .         i started considerably lower in the animal scale .     she opened the cage and took out one of the marmosets  which looked at her with a miniature sad old man with sideburns expression .   she clucked to it  stroked it and gently strapped it into a small harness .   orsino said     what are you doing .         i can   t have it moving around if i   m going to make it part of a circuit  and i can   t anesthetize it without vitiating the experiment .  there are several electrodes implanted in the marmoset   s brain and i   m going to connect them with my leg system .  the laser i   m using is here .  i   m sure you recognize the model and i won   t bother giving you its specifications .         thanks     said berkowitz     but you might tell us what we   re going to see .         it would be just as easy to show you .  just watch the screen .     she connected the leads to the electrodes with a quiet and sure efficiency  then turned a knob that dimmed the overhead lights in the room .  on the screen there appeared a jagged complex of peaks and valleys in a fine  bright line that was wrinkled into secondary and tertiary peaks and valleys .  slowly  these shifted in a series of minor changes  with occasional flashes of sudden major differences .  it was as though the irregular line had a life of its own .      this     said renshaw     is essentially the eeg information  but in much greater detail .         enough detail     asked orsino     to tell you what   s going on in individual cells .         in theory  yes .  practically  no .  not yet .  but we can separate this overall leg into component grams .  watch .      she punched the computer keyboard  and the line changed  and changed again .  now it was a small  nearly regular wave that shifted forward and backward in what was almost a heartbeat  now it was jagged and sharp  now intermittent  now nearly featureless   all in quick switches of geometric surrealism .   berkowitz said     you mean that every bit of the brain is that different from every other .         no     said renshaw     not at all .  the brain is very largely a holographic device  but there are minor shifts in emphasis from place to place and mike can subtract them as deviations from the norm and use the leg system to amplify those variations .  the amplifications can be varied from ten thousand fold to ten million fold .  the laser system is that noise free .         who   s mike .     asked orsino .      mike .     said renshaw  momentarily puzzled .  the skin over her cheekbones reddened slightly .     did i say   well  i call it that sometimes .  it   s short for    my computer .         she waved her arm about the room .     my computer .  mike .  very carefully programmed .      berkowitz nodded and said     all right  jenny  what   s it all about .  if you   ve got a new brain scanning device using lasers  fine .  it   s an interesting application and you   re right  it   s not one i would have thought of   but then i   m no neurophysiologist .  but why not write it up .  it seems to me the front office would support           but this is just the beginning .     she turned off the scanning device and placed a piece of fruit in the marmoset   s mouth .  the creature did not seem alarmed or in discomfort .  it chewed slowly .  renshaw unhooked the leads but allowed it to remain in its harness .   renshaw said     i can identify the various separate grams .  some are associated with the various senses  some with visceral reactions  some with emotions .  we can do a lot with that  but i don   t want to stop there .  the interesting thing is that one is associated with abstract thought .      orsino   s plump face wrinkled into a look of disbelief     how can you tell .         that particular form of gram gets more pronounced as one goes up the animal kingdom toward greater complexity of brain .  no other gram does .  besides       she paused  then  as though gathering strength of purpose  she said     those grams are enormously amplified .  they can be picked up  detected .  i can tell   vaguely   that there are   thoughts           by god     said berkowitz .     telepathy .         yes     she said  defiantly .     exactly .         no wonder you haven   t wanted to report it .  come on  jenny .         why not .     said renshaw warmly .     granted there could be no telepathy just using the unamplified potential patterns of the human brain anymore than anyone can see features on the martian surface with the unaided eye .  but once instruments are invented   the telescope   this .         then tell the front office .         no     said renshaw .     they won   t believe me .  they   ll try to stop me .  but they   ll have to take you seriously  jim  and you  adam .         what would you expect me to tell them .     said berkowitz .      what you experience .  i   m going to hook up the marmoset again  and have mike   my computer pick out the abstract thought gram .  it will only take a moment .  the computer always selects the abstract thought gram unless it is directed not to do so .         why .  because the computer thinks  too .     berkowitz laughed .     that   s not all that funny     said renshaw .     i suspect there is a resonance there .  this computer is complex enough to set up an electromagnetic pattern that may have elements in common with the abstract thought gram .  in any case        the marmoset   s brain waves were flickering on the screen again  but it was not a gram the men had seen before .  it was a gram that was almost furry in its complexity and was changing constantly .      i don   t detect anything     said orsino .      you have to be put into the receiving circuit     said renshaw .     you mean implant electrodes in our brain .     asked berkowitz .      no  on your skull .  that would be sufficient .  i   d prefer you  adam  since there would be no insulating hair .    oh  come on  i   ve been part of the circuit myself .  it won   t hurt .      orsino submitted with a bad grace .  his muscles were visibly tense but he allowed the leads to be strapped to his skull .      do you sense anything .     asked renshaw .   orsino cocked his head and assumed a listening posture .  he seemed to grow interested in spite of himself .  he said     i seem to be aware of a humming   and   and a little high pitched squeaking   and that   s funny   a kind of twitching        berkowitz said     i suppose the marmoset isn   t likely to think in words .         certainly not     said renshaw .      well  then     said berkowitz     if you   re suggesting that some squeaking and twitching sensation represents thought  you   re guessing .  you   re not being compelling .      renshaw said     so we go up the scale once again .     she removed the marmoset from its harness and put it back in its cage .      you mean you have a man as a subject     said orsino  unbelieving .      i have myself as a subject  a person .         you   ve got electrodes implanted           no .  in my case my computer has a stronger potential flicker to work with .  my brain has ten times the mass of the marmoset brain .  mike can pick up my component grams through the skull .         how do you know .     asked berkowitz .      don   t you think i   ve tried it on myself before this .    now help me with this  please .  right .      her fingers flicked on the computer keyboard and at once the screen flickered with an intricately varying wave  an intricacy that made it almost a maze .      would you replace your own leads  adam .     said renshaw .   orsino did so with berkowitz   s not entirely approving help .  again  orsino cocked his head and listened .     i hear words     he said     but they   re disjointed and overlapping  like different people speaking .         i   m not trying to think consciously     said renshaw .     when you talk  i hear an echo .      berkowitz said  dryly     don   t talk  jenny .  blank out your mind and see if he doesn   t hear you think .      orsino said     i don   t hear any echo when you talk  jim .      berkowitz said     if you don   t shut up  you won   t hear anything .      a heavy silence fell on all three .  then  orsino nodded  reached for pen and paper on the desk and wrote something .   renshaw reached out  threw a switch and pulled the leads up and over her head  shaking her hair back into place .  she said       hope that what you wrote down was      adam  raise cain with the front office and jim will eat crow .          orsino said     it   s what i wrote down  word for word .      renshaw said     well  there you are .  working telepathy  and we don   t have to use it to transmit nonsense sentences either .  think of the use in psychiatry and in the treatment of mental disease .  think of its use in education and in teaching machines .  think of its use in legal investigations and criminal trials .      orsino said  wide eyed     frankly  the social implications are staggering .  i don   t know if something like this should be allowed .         under proper legal safeguards  why not .     said renshaw  indifferently .     anyway   if you two join me now  our combined weight can carry this thing and push it over .  and if you come along with me it will be nobel prize time for        berkowitz said grimly     i   m not in this .  not yet .         what .  what do you mean .     renshaw sounded outraged  her coldly beautiful face flushed suddenly .      telepathy is too touchy .  it   s too fascinating  too desired .  we could be fooling ourselves .         listen for yourself  jim .         i could be fooling myself  too .  i want a control .        what do you mean  a control .         short circuit the origin of thought .  leave out the animal .  no marmoset .  no human being .  let orsino listen to metal and glass and laser light and if he still hears thought  then we   re kidding ourselves .         suppose he detects nothing .         then i   ll listen and if without looking   if you can arrange to have me in the next room   i can tell when you are in and when you are out of circuit  then i   ll consider joining you in this thing .         very well  then     said renshaw     we   ll try a control .  i   ve never done it  but it isn   t hard .     she maneuvered the leads that had been over her head and put them into contact with each other .     now  adam  if you will resume        but before she could go further  there came a cold  clear sound  as pure and as clean as the tinkle of breaking icicles      at last .      renshaw said     what .      orsino said     who said        berkowitz said     did someone say     at last    .      renshaw  pale  said     it wasn   t sound .  it was in my   did you two        the clear sound came again     i   m mi        and renshaw tore the leads apart and there was silence .  she said with a voiceless motion of her lips     i think it   s my computer   mike .         you mean he   s thinking .     said orsino  nearly as voiceless .  renshaw said in an unrecognizable voice that at least had regained sound     i said it was complex enough to have something   do you suppose   it always turned automatically to the abstract thought gram of whatever brain was in its circuit .  do you suppose that with no brain in the circuit  it turned to its own .      there was silence  then berkowitz said      are you trying to say that this computer thinks  but can   t express its thoughts as long as it   s under force of programming  but that given the chance in your leg system           but that can   t be so .     said orsino  high pitched .     no one was receiving .  it   s not the same thing .      renshaw said     the computer works on much greater power intensities than brains do .  i suppose it can magnify itself to the point where we can detect it directly without artificial aid .  how else can you explain        berkowitz said  abruptly     well  you have another application of lasers  then .  it enables you to talk to computers as independent intelligences  person to person .      and renshaw said     oh  god  what do we do now .      segregationist  the surgeon looked up without expression .     is he ready .         ready is a relative term     said the med eng .     we   re ready .  he   s restless .         they always are .   .   .   .  well  it   s a serious operation .         serious or not  he should be thankful .  he   s been chosen for it over an enormous number of possibles and frankly  i don   t think  .   .   .         don   t say it     said the surgeon .     the decision is not ours to make .         we accept it .  but do we have to agree .         yes     said the surgeon  crisply .     we agree .  completely and wholeheartedly .  the operation is entirely too intricate to approach with mental reservations .  this man has proven his worth in a number of ways and his profile is suitable for the board of mortality .         all right     said the med eng  unmollified .   the surgeon said     i   ll see him right in here  i think .  it is small enough and personal enough to be comforting .         it won   t help .  he   s nervous  and he   s made up his mind .         has he indeed .         yes .  he wants metal  they always do .      the surgeon   s face did not change expression .  he stared at his hands .     sometimes one can talk them out of it .         why bother .     said the med eng  indifferently .     if he wants metal  let it be metal .         you don   t care .         why should i .     the med eng said it almost brutally .     either way it   s a medical engineering problem and i   m a medical engineer .  either way  i can handle it .  why should i go beyond that .      the surgeon said stolidly     to me  it is a matter of the fitness of things .         fitness .  you can   t use that as an argument .  what does the patient care about the fitness of things .         i care .         you care in a minority .  the trend is against you .  you have no chance .         i have to try .     the surgeon waved the med eng into silence with a quick wave of his hand   no impatience to it  merely quickness .  he had already informed the nurse and he had already been signaled concerning her approach .  he pressed a small button and the double door pulled swiftly apart .  the patient moved inward in his motorchair  the nurse stepping briskly along beside him .      you may go  nurse     said the surgeon     but wait outside .  i will be calling you .     he nodded to the med eng  who left with the nurse  and the door closed behind them .   the man in the chair looked over his shoulder and watched them go .  his neck was scrawny and there were fine wrinkles about his eyes .  he was freshly shaven and the fingers of his hands  as they gripped the arms of the chair tightly  showed manicured nails .  he was a high priority patient and he was being taken care of .   .  .  .  but there was a look of settled peevishness on his face .   he said     will we be starting today .      the surgeon nodded .     this afternoon  senator .         i understand it will take weeks .         not for the operation itself  senator .  but there are a number of subsidiary points to be taken care of .  there are some circulatory renovations that must be carried through  and hormonal adjustments .  these are tricky things .         are they dangerous .     then  as though feeling the need for establishing a friendly relationship  but patently against his will  he added      .   .   .  doctor .      the surgeon paid no attention to the nuances of expression .  he said  flatly     everything is dangerous .  we take our time in order that it be less dangerous .  it is the time required  the skill of many individuals united  the equipment  that makes such operations available to so few .  .  .         i know that     said the patient  restlessly .     i refuse to feel guilty about that .  or are you implying improper pressure .         not at all  senator .  the decisions of the board have never been questioned .  i mention the difficulty and intricacy of the operation merely to explain my desire to have it conducted in the best fashion possible .         well  do so  then .  that is my desire  also .         then i must ask you to make a decision .  it is possible to supply you with either of two types of cyber hearts  metal or  .   .   .         plastic .     said the patient  irritably .     isn   t that the alternative you were going to offer  doctor .  cheap plastic .  i don   t want that .  i   ve made my choice .  i want the metal .         but  .   .   .         see here .  i   ve been told the choice rests with me .  isn   t that so .      the surgeon nodded .     where two alternate procedures are of equal value from a medical standpoint  the choice rests with the patient .  in actual practice  the choice rests with the patient even when the alternate procedures are not of equal value  as in this case .      the patient   s eyes narrowed .     are you trying to tell me the plastic heart is superior .         it depends on the patient .  in my opinion  in your individual case  it is .  and we prefer not to use the term  plastic .  it is a fibrous cyber heart .         it   s plastic as far as i am concerned .         senator     said the surgeon  infinitely patient     the material is not plastic in the ordinary sense of the word .  it is a polymeric material true  but one that is far more complex than ordinary plastic .  it is a complex protein like fibre designed to imitate  as closely as possible  the natural structure of the human heart you now have within your chest .         exactly  and the human heart i now have within my chest is worn out although i am not yet sixty years old .  i don   t want another one like it  thank you .  i want something better .         we all want something better for you  senator .  the fibrous cyber heart will be better .  it has a potential life of centuries .  it is absolutely non allergenic  .  .  .         isn   t that so for the metallic heart  too .         yes  it is     said the surgeon .     the metallic cyber is of titanium alloy that  .   .   .         and it doesn   t wear out .  and it is stronger than plastic .  or fibre or whatever you want to call it .         the metal is physically stronger  yes  but mechanical strength is not a point at issue .  its mechanical strength does you no particular good since the heart is well protected .  anything capable of reaching the heart will kill you for other reasons even if the heart stands up under manhandling .      the patient shrugged .     if i ever break a rib  i   ll have that replaced by titanium  also .  replacing bones is easy .  anyone can have that done anytime .  i   ll be as metallic as i want to be  doctor .         that is your right  if you so choose .  however  it is only fair to tell you that although no metallic cyber heart has ever broken down mechanically  a number have broken down electronically .         what does that mean .         it means that every cyber heart contains a pacemaker as part of its structure .  in the case of the metallic variety  this is an electronic device that keeps the cyber in rhythm .  it means an entire battery of miniaturized equipment must be included to alter the heart   s rhythm to suit an individual   s emotional and physical state .  occasionally something goes wrong there and people have died before that wrong could be corrected .         i never heard of such a thing .         i assure you it happens .         are you telling me it happens often .         not at all .  it happens very rarely .         well  then  i   ll take my chance .  what about the plastic heart .  doesn   t that contain a pacemaker .         of course it does  senator .  but the chemical structure of a fibrous cyber heart is quite close to that of human tissue .  it can respond to the ionic and hormonal controls of the body itself .  the total complex that need be inserted is far simpler than in the case of the metal cyber .         but doesn   t the plastic heart ever pop out of hormonal control .         none has ever yet done so .         because you haven   t been working with them long enough .  isn   t that so .      the surgeon hesitated .     it is true that the fibrous cybers have not been used nearly as long as the metallic .         there you are .  what is it anyway  doctor .  are you afraid i   m making myself into a robot  .   .   .  into a metallo  as they call them since citizenship went through .         there is nothing wrong with a metallo as a metallo .  as you say  they are citizens .  but you   re not a metallo .  you   re a human being .  why not stay a human being .         because i want the best and that   s a metallic heart .  you see to that .      the surgeon nodded .     very well .  you will be asked to sign the necessary permissions and you will then be fitted with a metal heart .         and you   ll be the surgeon in charge .  they tell me you   re the best .         i will do what i can to make the changeover an easy one .      the door opened and the chair moved the patient out to the waiting nurse .   the med eng came in  looking over his shoulder at the receding patient until the doors had closed again .   he turned to the surgeon .     well  i can   t tell what happened just by looking at you .  what was his decision .      the surgeon bent over his desk  punching out the final items for his records .     what you predicted .  he insists on the metallic cyber heart .         after all  they are better .         not significantly .  they   ve been around longer  no more than that .  it   s this mania that   s been plaguing humanity ever since metallos have become citizens .  men have this odd desire to make metallos out of themselves .  they yearn for the physical strength and endurance one associates with them .         it isn   t one sided  doc .  you don   t work with metallos but i do  so i know .  the last two who came in for repairs have asked for fibrous elements .         did they get them .         in one case  it was just a matter of supplying tendons  it didn   t make much difference there  metal or fibre .  the other wanted a blood system or its equivalent .  i told him i couldn   t  not without a complete rebuilding of the structure of his body in fibrous material .   .  .  .  i suppose it will come to that some day .  metallos that aren   t really metallos at all  but a kind of flesh and blood .         you don   t mind that thought .         why not .  and metallized human beings  too .  we have two varieties of intelligence on earth now and why bother with two .  let them approach each other and eventually we won   t be able to tell the difference .  why should we want to .  we   d have the best of both worlds  the advantages of man combined with those of robot .         you   d get a hybrid     said the surgeon  with something that approached fierceness .     you   d get something that is not both  but neither .  isn   t it logical to suppose an individual would be too proud of his structure and identity to want to dilute it with something alien .  would he want mongrelization .         that   s segregationist talk .         then let it be that .     the surgeon said with calm emphasis     i believe in being what one is .  i wouldn   t change a bit of my own structure for any reason .  if some of it absolutely required replacement  i would have that replacement as close to the original in nature as could possibly be managed .  i am myself  well pleased to be myself  and would not be anything else .      he had finished now and had to prepare for the operation .  he placed his strong hands into the heating oven and let them reach the dull red hot glow that would sterilize them completely .  for all his impassioned words  his voice had never risen  and on his burnished metal face there was  as always  no sign of expression .   mirror image    lije baley had just decided to relight his pipe  when the door of his office opened without a preliminary knock  or announcement  of any kind .  baley looked up in pronounced annoyance and then dropped his pipe .  it said a good deal for the state of his mind that he left it lie where it had fallen .      r .  daneel olivaw     he said  in a kind of mystified excitement .     jehoshaphat .  it is you  isn   t it .         you are quite right      said the tall  bronzed newcomer  his even features never flicking for a moment out of their accustomed calm .     i regret surprising you by entering without warning  but the situation is a delicate one and there must be as little involvement as possible on the part of the men and robots even in this place .  i am  in any case  pleased to see you again  friend elijah .      and the robot held out his right hand in a gesture as thoroughly human as was his appearance .  it was baley who was so unmanned by his astonishment as to stare at the hand with a momentary lack of understanding .   but then he seized it in both his  feeling its warm firmness .     but daneel  why .  you   re welcome any time  but   what is this situation that is a delicate one .  are we in trouble again .  earth  i mean .         no  friend elijah  it does not concern earth .  the situation to which i refer as a delicate one is  to outward appearances  a small thing .  a dispute between mathematicians  nothing more .  as we happened  quite by accident  to be within an easy jump of earth           this dispute took place on a starship  then .         yes  indeed .  a small dispute  yet to the humans involved astonishingly large .      baley could not help but smile .     i   m not surprised you find humans astonishing .  they do not obey the three laws .         that is  indeed  a shortcoming     said r .  daneel  gravely     and i think humans themselves are puzzled by humans .  it may be that you are less puzzled than are the men of other worlds because so many more human beings live on earth than on the spacer worlds .  if so  and i believe it is so  you could help us .      r .  daneel paused momentarily and then said  perhaps a shade too quickly     and yet there are rules of human behavior which i have learned .  it would seem  for instance  that i am deficient in etiquette  by human standards  not to have asked after your wife and child .         they are doing well .  the boy is in college and jessie is involved in local politics .  the amenities are taken care of .  now tell me how you come to be here .         as i said  we were within an easy j ump of earth     said r .  daneel     so i suggested to the captain that we consult you .         and the captain agreed .     baley had a sudden picture of the proud and autocratic captain of a spacer starship consenting to make a landing on earth   of all worlds   and to consult an earthman   of all people .      i believe     said r .  daneel     that he was in a position where he would have agreed to anything .  in addition  i praised you very highly  although  to be sure  i stated only the truth .  finally  i agreed to conduct all negotiations so that none of the crew  or passengers  would need to enter any of the earthman cities .         and talk to any earthman  yes .  but what has happened .         the passengers of the starship  eta carina  included two mathematicians who were traveling to aurora to attend an interstellar conference on neurobiophysics .  it is about these mathematicians  alfred ban humboldt and gennao sabbat  that the dispute centers .  have you perhaps  friend elijah  heard of one  or both  of them .         neither one     said baley  firmly .     i know nothing about mathematics .  look  daneel  surely you haven   t told anyone i   m a mathematics buff or           not at all  friend elijah .  i know you are not .  nor does it matter  since the exact nature of the mathematics involved is in no way relevant to the point at issue .         well  then  go on .         since you do not know either man  friend elijah  let me tell you that dr .  humboldt is well into his twenty seventh decade   pardon me  friend elijah .         nothing .  nothing     said baley  irritably .  he had merely muttered to himself  more or less incoherently  in a natural reaction to the extended life spans of the spacers .     and he   s still active  despite his age .  on earth  mathematicians after thirty or so .      daneel said  calmly     dr .  humboldt is one of the top three mathematicians  by long established repute  in the galaxy .  certainly he is still active .  dr .  sabbat  on the other hand  is quite young  not yet fifty  but he has already established himself as the most remarkable new talent in the most abstruse branches of mathematics .         they   re both great  then     said baley .  he remembered his pipe and picked it up .  he decided there was no point in lighting it now and knocked out the dottle .     what happened .  is this a murder case .  did one of them apparently kill the other .         of these two men of great reputation  one is trying to destroy that of the other .  by human values  i believe this may be regarded as worse than physical murder .         sometimes  i suppose .  which one is trying to destroy the other .         why  that  friend elijah  is precisely the point at issue .  which .         go on .         dr .  humboldt tells the story clearly .  shortly before he boarded the starship  he had an insight into a possible method for analyzing neural pathways from changes in microwave absorption patterns of local cortical areas .  the insight was a purely mathematical technique of extraordinary subtlety  but i cannot  of course  either understand or sensibly transmit the details .  these do not  however  matter .  dr .  humboldt considered the matter and was more convinced each hour that he had something revolutionary on hand  something that would dwarf all his previous accomplishments in mathematics .  then he discovered that dr .  sabbat was on board .         ah .  and he tried it out on young sabbat .         exactly .  the two had met at professional meetings before and knew each other thoroughly by reputation .  humboldt went into it with sabbat in great detail .  sabbat backed humboldt   s analysis completely and was unstinting in his praise of the importance of the discovery and of the ingenuity of the discoverer .  heartened and reassured by this  humboldt prepared a paper outlining  in summary  his work and  two days later  prepared to have it forwarded subetherically to the co chairmen of the conference at aurora  in order that he might officially establish his priority and arrange for possible discussion before the sessions were closed .  to his surprise  he found that sabbat was ready with a paper of his own  essentially the same as humboldt   s  and sabbat was also preparing to have it subetherized to aurora .         i suppose humboldt was furious .         quite .         and sabbat .  what was his story .         precisely the same as humboldt   s .  word for word except for the mirror image exchange of names .  according to sabbat  it was he who had the insight  and he who consulted humboldt  it was humboldt who agreed with the analysis and praised it .         then each one claims the idea is his and that the other stole it .  it doesn   t sound like a problem to me at all .  in matters of scholarship  it would seem only necessary to produce the records of research  dated and initialed .  judgment as to priority can be made from that .  even if one is falsified  that might be discovered through internal inconsistencies .         ordinarily  friend elijah  you would be right  but this is mathematics  and not in an experimental science .  dr .  humboldt claims to have worked out the essentials in his head .  nothing was put in writing until the paper itself was prepared .  dr .  sabbat  of course  says precisely the same .         well  then  be more drastic and get it over with  for sure .  subject each one to a psychic probe and find out which of the two is lying .      r .  daneel shook his head slowly     friend elijah  you do not understand these men .  they are both of rank and scholarship  fellows of the imperial academy .  as such  they cannot be subjected to trial of professional conduct except by a jury of their peers   their professional peers   unless they personally and voluntarily waive that right .         put it to them  then .  the guilty man won   t waive the right because he can   t afford to face the psychic probe .  the innocent man will waive it at once .  you won   t even have to use the probe .         it does not work that way  friend elijah .  to waive the right in such a case   to be investigated by laymen   is a serious and perhaps irrecoverable blow to prestige .  both men steadfastly refuse to waive the right to special trial  as a matter of pride .  the question of guilt  or innocence  is quite subsidiary .         in that case  let it go for now .  put the matter in cold storage until you get to aurora .  at the neurobiophysical conference  there will be a huge supply of professional peers  and then           that would mean a tremendous blow to science itself  friend elijah .  both men would suffer for having been the instrument of scandal .  even the innocent one would be blamed for having been party to a situation so distasteful .  it would be felt that it should have been settled quietly out of court at all costs .         all right .  i   m not a spacer  but i   ll try to imagine that this attitude makes sense .  what do the men in question say .         humboldt agrees thoroughly .  he says that if sabbat will admit theft of the idea and allow humboldt to proceed with transmission of the paper   or at least its delivery at the conference  he will not press charges .  sabbat   s misdeed will remain secret with him  and  of course  with the captain  who is the only other human to be party to the dispute .         but young sabbat will not agree .         on the contrary  he agreed with dr .  humboldt to the last detail   with the reversal of names .  still the mirror image .         so they just sit there  stalemated .         each  i believe  friend elijah  is waiting for the other to give in and admit guilt .         well  then  wait .         the captain has decided this cannot be done .  there are two alternatives to waiting  you see .  the first is that both will remain stubborn so that when the starship lands on aurora  the intellectual scandal will break .  the captain  who is responsible for justice on board ship will suffer disgrace for not having been able to settle the matter quietly and that  to him  is quite insupportable .         and the second alternative .         is that one  or the other  of the mathematicians will indeed admit to wrongdoing .  but will the one who confesses do so out of actual guilt  or out of a noble desire to prevent the scandal .  would it be right to deprive of credit one who is sufficiently ethical to prefer to lose that credit than to see science as a whole suffer .  or else  the guilty party will confess at the last moment  and in such a way as to make it appear he does so only for the sake of science  thus escaping the disgrace of his deed and casting its shadow upon the other .  the captain will be the only man to know all this but he does not wish to spend the rest of his life wondering whether he has been a party to a grotesque miscarriage of justice .      baley sighed .     a game of intellectual chicken .  who   ll break first as aurora comes nearer and nearer .  is that the whole story now  daneel .         not quite .  there are witnesses to the transaction .           jehoshaphat .  why didn   t you say so at once .  what witnesses .      dr .  humboldt   s personal servant           a robot  i suppose .         yes  certainly .  he is called r .  preston .  this servant  r .  preston  was present during the initial conference and he bears out dr .  humboldt in every detail .         you mean he says that the idea was dr .  humboldt   s to begin with  that dr .  humboldt detailed it to dr .  sabbat  that dr .  sabbat praised the idea  and so on .         yes  in full detail .         i see .  does that settle the matter or not .  presumably not .         you are quite right .  it does not settle the matter  for there is a second witness .  dr .  sabbat also has a personal servant  r .  idda  another robot of  as it happens  the same model as r .  preston  made  i believe  in the same year in the same factory .  both have been in service for an equal period of time .      an odd coincidence   very odd .         a fact  i am afraid  and it makes it difficult to arrive at any judgment based on obvious differences between the two servants .         r .  idda  then  tells the same story as r .  preston .         precisely the same story  except for the mirror image reversal of the names .         r .  idda stated  then  that young sabbat  the one not yet fifty      lije baley did not entirely keep the sardonic note out of his voice  he himself was not yet fifty and he felt far from young      had the idea to begin with  that he detailed it to dr .  humboldt  who was loud in his praises  and so on .         yes  friend elijah .         and one robot is lying  then .         so it would seem .         it should be easy to tell which .  i imagine even a superficial examination by a good roboticist           a roboticist is not enough in this case  friend elijah .  only a qualified robopsychologist would carry weight enough and experience enough to make a decision in a case of this importance .  there is no one so qualified on board ship .  such an examination can be performed only when we reach aurora           and by then the crud hits the fan .  well  you   re here on earth .  we can scare up a robopsychologist  and surely anything that happens on earth will never reach the ears of aurora and there will be no scandal .         except that neither dr .  humboldt  nor dr .  sabbat  will allow his servant to be investigated by a robopsychologist of earth .  the earthman would have to       he paused .   lije baley said stolidly     he   d have to touch the robot .         these are old servants  well thought of           and not to be sullied by the touch of earthman .  then what do you want me to do  damn it .     he paused  grimacing .     i   m sorry  r .  daneel  but i see no reason for your having involved me .           i was on the ship on a mission utterly irrelevant to the problem at hand .  the captain turned to me because he had to turn to someone .  i seemed human enough to talk to  and robot enough to be a safe recipient of confidences .  he told me the whole story and asked what i would do .  i realized the next jump could take us as easily to earth as to our target .  i told the captain that  although i was at as much a loss to resolve the mirror image as he was  there was on earth one who might help .         jehoshaphat .     muttered baley under his breath .      consider  friend elijah  that if you succeed in solving this puzzle  it would do your career good and earth itself might benefit .  the matter could not be publicized  of course  but the captain is a man of some influence on his home world and he would be grateful .         you just put a greater strain on me .         i have every confidence     said r .  daneel  stolidly     that you already have some idea as to what procedure ought to be followed .         do you .  i suppose that the obvious procedure is to interview the two mathematicians  one of whom would seem to be a thief .         i   m afraid  friend elijah  that neither one will come into the city .  nor would either one be willing to have you come to them .         and there is no way of forcing a spacer to allow contact with an earthman  no matter what the emergency .  yes  i understand that  daneel   but i was thinking of an interview by closed circuit television .         nor that .  they will not submit to interrogation by an earthman .         then what do they want of me .  could i speak to the robots .         they would not allow the robots to come here  either .         jehoshaphat  daneel .  you   ve come .         that was my own decision .  i have permission  while on board ship  to make decisions of that sort without veto by any human being but the captain himself   and he was eager to establish the contact .  i  having known you  decided that television contact was insufficient .  i wished to shake your hand .      lije baley softened .     i appreciate that  daneel  but i still honestly wish you could have refrained from thinking of me at all in this case .  can i talk to the robots by television at least .         that .  i think  can be arranged .         something  at least .  that means i would be doing the work of a robopsychologist   in a crude sort of way .         but you are a detective  friend elijah  not a robopsychologist .         well  let it pass .  now before i see them  let   s think a bit .  tell me  is it possible that both robots are telling the truth .  perhaps the conversation between the two mathematicians was equivocal .  perhaps it was of such a nature that each robot could honestly believe its own master was proprietor of the idea .  or perhaps one robot heard only one portion of the discussion and the other another portion  so that each could suppose its own master was proprietor of the idea .         that is quite impossible  friend elijah .  both robots repeat the conversation in identical fashion .  and the two repetitions are fundamentally inconsistent .         then it is absolutely certain that one of the robots is lying .         yes .         will i be able to see the transcript of all evidence given so far in the presence of the captain  if i should want to .         i thought you would ask that and i have copies with me .         another blessing .  have the robots been cross examined at all  and is that cross examination included in the transcript .         the robots have merely repeated their tales .  cross examination would be conducted only by robopsychologists .         or by myself .         you are a detective  friend elijah  not a           all right  r .  daneel .  i   ll try to get the spacer psychology straight .  a detective can do it because he isn   t a robopsychologist .  let   s think further .  ordinarily a robot will not lie  but he will do so if necessary to maintain the three laws .  he might lie to protect  in legitimate fashion  his own existence in accordance with the third law .  he is more apt to lie if that is necessary to follow a legitimate order given him by a human being in accordance with the second law .  he is most apt to lie if that is necessary to save a human life  or to prevent harm from coming to a human in accordance with the first law .         yes .         and in this case  each robot would be defending the professional reputation of his master  and would lie if it were necessary to do so .  under the circumstances  the professional reputation would be nearly equivalent to life and there might be a near first law urgency to the lie .         yet by the lie  each servant would be harming the professional reputation of the other   s master  friend elijah .         so it would  but each robot might have a clearer conception of the value of its own master   s reputation and honestly judge it to be greater than that of the other   s .  the lesser harm would be done by his lie  he would suppose  than by the truth .      having said that  lije baley remained quiet for a moment .  then he said     a l right  then  can you arrange to have me talk to one of the robots   to r .  idda first  i think .         dr .  sabbat   s robot .         yes     said baley  dryly     the young fellow   s robot .         it will take me but a few minutes     said r .  daneel .     i have a micro receiver outfitted with a projector .  i will need merely a blank wall and i think this one will do if you will allow me to move some of these film cabinets .         go ahead .  will i have to talk into a microphone of some sort .         no  you will be able to talk in an ordinary manner .  please pardon me  friend elijah  for a moment of further delay .  i will have to contact the ship and arrange for r .  idda to be interviewed .         if that will take some time  daneel  how about giving me the transcripted material of the evidence so far .        lije baley lit his pipe while r .  daneel set up the equipment  and leafed through the flimsy sheets he had been handed .   the minutes passed and r .  daneel said     if you are ready  friend elijah  r .  idda is .  or would you prefer a few more minutes with the transcript .         no     sighed baley     i   m not learning anything new .  put him on and arrange to have the interview recorded and transcribed .      r .  idda  unreal in two dimensional projection against the wall  was basically metallic in structure   not at all the humanoid creature that r .  daneel was .  his body was tall but blocky  and there was very little to distinguish him from the many robots baley had seen  except for minor structural details .   baley said     greetings  r .  idda .         greetings  sir     said r .  idda  in a muted voice that sounded surprisingly humanoid .      you are the personal servant of gennao sabbat  are you not .         i am sir .         for how long  boy .         for twenty two years  sir .         and your master   s reputation is valuable to you .         yes  sir .         would you consider it of importance to protect that reputation .         yes  sir .         as important to protect his reputation as his physical life .         no  sir .         as important to protect his reputation as the reputation of another .      r .  idda hesitated .  he said     such cases must be decided on their individual merit  sir .  there is no way of establishing a general rule .        baley hesitated .  these spacer robots spoke more smoothly and intellectually than earth models did .  he was not at all sure he could outthink one .   he said     if you decided that the reputation of your master were more important than that of another  say  that of alfred barr humboldt  would you lie to protect your master   s reputation .         i would  sir .         did you lie in your testimony concerning your master in his controversy with dr .  humboldt .         no  sir .         but if you were lying  you would deny you were lying in order to protect that lie  wouldn   t you .         yes  sir .         well  then     said baley     let   s consider this .  your master  gennao sabbat  is a young man of great reputation in mathematics  but he is a young man .  if  in this controversy with dr .  humboldt  he had succumbed to temptation and had acted unethically  he would suffer a certain eclipse of reputation  but he is young and would have ample time to recover .  he would have many intellectual triumphs ahead of him and men would eventually look upon this plagiaristic attempt as the mistake of a hot blooded youth  deficient in judgment .  it would be something that would be made up for in the future .      if  on the other hand  it were dr .  humboldt who succumbed to temptation  the matter would be much more serious .  he is an old man whose great deeds have spread over centuries .  his reputation has been unblemished hitherto .  all of that  however  would be forgotten in the light of this one crime of his later years  and he would have no opportunity to make up for it in the comparatively short time remaining to him .  there would be little more that he could accomplish .  there would be so many more years of work ruined in humboldt   s case than in that of your master and so much less opportunity to win back his position .  you see  don   t you  that humboldt faces the worse situation and deserves the greater consideration .      there was a long pause .  then r .  idda said  with unmoved voice     my evidence was a lie .  it was dr .  humboldt whose work it was  and my master has attempted  wrongfully  to appropriate the credit .      baley said     very well  boy .  you are instructed to say nothing to anyone about this until given permission by the captain of the ship .  you are excused .      the screen blanked out and baley puffed at his pipe .     do you suppose the captain heard that  daneel .         i am sure of it .  he is the only witness  except for us .         good .  now for the other .         but is there any point to that  friend elijah  in view of what r .  idda has confessed .         of course there is .  r .  idda   s confession means nothing .         nothing .         nothing at all .  i pointed out that dr .  humboldt   s position was the worse .  naturally  if he were lying to protect sabbat  he would switch to the truth as  in fact  he claimed to have done .  on the other hand  if he were telling the truth  he would switch to a lie to protect humboldt .  it   s still mirror image and we haven   t gained anything .         but then what will we gain by questioning r .  preston .         nothing  if the minor image were perfect   but it is not .  after all  one of the robots is telling the truth to begin with  and one is lying to begin with  and that is a point of asymmetry .  let me see r .  preston .  and if the transcription of r .  idda   s examination is done  let me have it .     the projector came into use again .  r .  preston stared out of it  identical with r .  idda in every respect  except for some trivial chest design .   baley said     greetings  r .  preston .     he kept the record of r .  idda   s examination before him as he spoke .      greetings  sir     said r .  preston .  his voice was identical with that of r .  idda .      you are the personal servant of alfred ban humboldt are you not .         i am  sir .         for how long  boy .         for twenty two years  sir .         and your master   s reputation is valuable to you .         yes  sir .         would you consider it of importance to protect that reputation .         yes  sir .         as important to protect his reputation as his physical life .         no  sir .         as important to protect his reputation as the reputation of another .      r .  preston hesitated .  he said     such cases must be decided on their individual merit  sir .  there is no way of establishing a general rule .      baley said     if you decided that the reputation of your master were more important than that of another  say  that of gennao sabbat  would you lie to protect your master   s reputation .         i would  sir .         did you lie in your testimony concerning your master in his controversy with dr .  sabbat .         no  sir .         but if you were lying  you would deny you were lying  in order to protect that lie  wouldn   t you .         yes  sir .         well  then     said baley     let   s consider this .  your master  alfred barr humboldt  is an old man of great reputation in mathematics  but he is an old man .  if  in this controversy with dr .  sabbat  he had succumbed to temptation and had acted unethically  he would suffer a certain eclipse of reputation  but his great age and his centuries of accomplishments would stand against that and would win out .  men would look upon this plagiaristic attempt as the mistake of a perhaps sick old man  no longer certain in judgment .      if  on the other hand  it were dr .  sabbat who had succumbed to temptation  the matter would be much more serious .  he is a young man  with a far less secure reputation .  he would ordinarily have centuries ahead of him in which he might accumulate knowledge and achieve great things .  this will be closed to him  now  obscured by one mistake of his youth .  he has a much longer future to lose than your master has .  you see  don   t you  that sabbat faces the worse situation and deserves the greater consideration .      there was a long pause .  then r .  preston said  with unmoved voice     my evidence was as i        at that point  he broke off and said nothing more .  baley said     please continue  r .  preston .      there was no response .   r .  daneel said     i am afraid  friend elijah  that r .  preston is in stasis .  he is out of commission .         well  then     said baley     we have finally produced an asymmetry .  from this  we can see who the guilty person is .         in what way  friend elijah .         think it out .  suppose you were a person who had committed no crime and that your personal robot were a witness to that .  there would be nothing you need do .  your robot would tell the truth and bear you out .  if  however  you were a person who had committed the crime  you would have to depend on your robot to lie .  that would be a somewhat riskier position  for although the robot would lie  if necessary  the greater inclination would be to tell the truth  so that the lie would be less firm than the truth would be .  to prevent that  the crime committing person would very likely have to order the robot to lie .  in this way  first law would be strengthened by second law  perhaps very substantially strengthened .         that would seem reasonable     said r .  daneel .      suppose we have one robot of each type .  one robot would switch from truth  unreinforced  to the lie  and could do so after some hesitation  without serious trouble .  the other robot would switch from the lie  strongly reinforced  to the truth  but could do so only at the risk of burning out various positronic track ways in his brain and falling into stasis .         and since r .  preston went into stasis           r .  preston   s master  dr .  humboldt  is the man guilty of plagiarism .  if you transmit this to the captain and urge him to face dr .  humboldt with the matter at once  he may force a confession .  if so  i hope you will tell me immediately .         i will certainly do so .  you will excuse me  friend elijah .  i must talk to the captain privately .         certainly .  use the conference room .  it is shielded .        baley could do no work of any kind in r .  daneel   s absence .  he sat in uneasy silence .  a great deal would depend on the value of his analysis  and he was acutely aware of his lack of expertise in robotics .   r .  daneel was back in half an hour   very nearly the longest half hour of baley   s life .   there was no use  of course  in trying to determine what had happened from the expression of the humanoid   s impassive face .  baley tried to keep his face impassive .      yes  r .  daneel .     he asked .      precisely as you said  friend elijah .  dr .  humboldt has confessed .  he was counting  he said  on dr .  sabbat giving way and allowing dr .  humboldt to have this one last triumph .  the crisis is over and you will find the captain grateful .  he has given me permission to tell you that he admires your subtlety greatly and i believe that i  myself  will achieve favor for having suggested you .         good     said baley  his knees weak and his forehead moist now that his decision had proven correct     but jehoshaphat  r .  daneel  don   t put me on the spot like that again  will you .         i will try not to  friend elijah .  all will depend  of course  on the importance of a crisis  on your nearness  and on certain other factors .  meanwhile  i have a question           yes .         was it not possible to suppose that passage from a lie to the truth was easy  while passage from the truth to a lie was difficult .  and in that case  would not the robot in stasis have been going from a truth to a lie  and since r .  preston was in stasis  might one not have drawn the conclusion that it was dr .  humboldt who was innocent and dr .  sabbat who was guilty .         yes  r .  daneel .  it was possible to argue that way  but it was the other argument that proved right .  humboldt did confess  didn   t he .         he did .  but with arguments possible in both directions  how could you  friend elijah  so quickly pick the correct one .      for a moment  baley   s lips twitched .  then he relaxed and they curved into a smile .     because  r .  daneel  i took into account human reactions  not robotic ones .  i know more about human beings than about robots .  in other words  i had an idea as to which mathematician was guilty before i ever interviewed the robots .  once i provoked an asymmetric response in them  i simply interpreted it in such a way as to place the guilt on the one i already believed to be guilty .  the robotic response was dramatic enough to break down the guilty man  my own analysis of human behavior might not have been sufficient to do so .         i am curious to know what your analysis of human behavior was .         jehoshaphat  r .  daneel  think  and you won   t have to ask .  there is another point of asymmetry in this tale of mirror image besides the matter of true and false .  there is the matter of the age of the two mathematicians  one is quite old and one is quite young .         yes  of course  but what then .         why  this .  i can see a young man  flushed with a sudden  startling and revolutionary idea  consulting in the matter an old man whom he has  from his early student days  thought of as a demigod in the field .  i can not see an old man  rich in honors and used to triumphs  coming up with a sudden  startling and revolutionary idea  consulting a man centuries his junior whom he is bound to think of as a young whippersnapper   or whatever term a spacer would use .  then  too  if a young man had the chance  would he try to steal the idea of a revered demigod .  it would be unthinkable .  on the other hand  an old man  conscious of declining powers  might well snatch at one last chance of fame and consider a baby in the field to have no rights he was bound to observe .  in short  it was not conceivable that sabbat steal humboldt   s idea  and from both angles  dr .  humboldt was guilty .      r .  daneel considered that for a long time .  then he held out his hand .     i must leave now  friend elijah .  it was good to see you .  may we meet again soon .      baley gripped the robot   s hand  warmly     if you don   t mind  r .  daneel     he said     not too soon .      lenny    united states robots and mechanical men corporation had a problem .  the problem was people .   peter bogert  senior mathematician  was on his way to assembly when he encountered alfred lanning  research director .  lanning was bending his ferocious white eyebrows together and staring down across the railing into the computer room .   on the floor below the balcony  a trickle of humanity of both sexes and various ages was looking about curiously  while a guide intoned a set speech about robotic computing .      this computer you see before you     he said     is the largest of its type in the world .  it contains five million three hundred thousand cryotrons and is capable of dealing simultaneously with over one hundred thousand variables .  with its help  u .  s .  robots is able to design with precision the positronic brains of new models .     the requirements are fed in on tape which is perforated by the action of this keyboard   something like a very complicated typewriter or linotype machine  except that it does not deal with letters but with concepts .  statements are broken down into the symbolic logic equivalents and those in turn converted to perforation patterns .      the computer can  in less than one hour  present our scientists with a design for a brain which will give all the necessary positronic paths to make a robot .  .  .      alfred lanning looked up at last and noticed the other .     ah  peter     he said .   bogert raised both hands to smooth down his already perfectly smooth and glossy head of black hair .  he said     you don   t look as though you think much of this  alfred .      lanning grunted .  the idea of public guided tours of u .  s .  robots was of fairly recent origin  and was supposed to serve a dual function .  on the one hand  the theory went  it allowed people to see robots at close quarters and counter their almost instinctive fear of the mechanical objects through increased familiarity .  and on the other hand  it was supposed to interest at least an occasional person in taking up robotics research as a life work .      you know i don   t     lanning said finally .     once a week  work is disrupted .  considering the man hours lost  the return is insufficient .         still no rise in job applications  then .         oh  some  but only in the categories where the need isn   t vital .  it   s research men that are needed .  you know that .  the trouble is that with robots forbidden on earth itself  there   s something unpopular about being a roboticist .         the damned frankenstein complex     said bogert  consciously imitating one of the other   s pet phrases .   lanning missed the gentle jab .  he said     i ought to be used to it  but i never will .  you   d think that by now every human being on earth would know that the three laws represented a perfect safeguard  that robots are simply not dangerous .  take this bunch .     he glowered down .     look at them .  most of them go through the robot assembly room for the thrill of fear  like riding a roller coaster .  then when they enter the room with the mec model   damn it  peter  a mec model that will do nothing on god   s green earth but take two steps forward  say    pleased to meet you  sir     shake hands  then take two steps back   they back away and mothers snatch up their kids .  how do we expect to get brainwork out of such idiots .      bogert had no answer .  together  they stared down once again at the line of sightseers  now passing out of the computer room and into the positronic brain assembly section .  then they left .  they did not  as it turned out  observe mortimer w .  jacobson  age      who  to do him complete justice  meant no harm whatever .     in fact  it could not even be said to be mortimer   s fault .  the day of the week on which the tour took place was known to all workers .       all devices in its path ought to have been carefully neutralized or locked  since it was unreasonable to expect human beings to withstand the temptation to handle knobs  keys  handles and pushbuttons .  in addition  the guide ought to have been very carefully on the watch for those who succumbed .   but  at the time  the guide had passed into the next room and mortimer was tailing the line .  he passed the keyboard on which instructions were fed into the computer .  he had no way of suspecting that the plans for a new robot design were being fed into it at that moment  or  being a good kid  he would have avoided the keyboard .  he had no way of knowing that  by what amounted to almost criminal negligence  a technician had not inactivated the keyboard .   so mortimer touched the keys at random as though he were playing a musical instrument .   he did not notice that a section of perforated tape stretched itself out of the instrument in another part of the room   soundlessly  unobtrusively .   nor did the technician  when he returned  discover any signs of tampering .  he felt a little uneasy at noticing that the keyboard was live  but did not think to check .  after a few minutes  even his first trifling uneasiness was gone  and he continued feeding data into the computer .   as for mortimer  neither then  nor ever afterward  did he know what he had done .     the new lne model was designed for the mining of boron in the asteroid belt .  the boron hydrides were increasing in value yearly as primers for the proton micropiles that carried the ultimate load of power production on spaceships  and earth   s own meager supply was running thin .   physically  that meant that the lne robots would have to be equipped with eyes sensitive to those lines prominent in the spectroscopic analysis of boron ores and the type of limbs most useful for the working up of ore to finished product .  as always  though  the mental equipment was the major problem .   the first lne positronic brain had been completed now .  it was the prototype and would join all other prototypes in u .  s .  robots    collection .  when finally tested  others would then be manufactured for leasing  never selling  to mining corporations .   lne prototype was complete now .  tall  straight  polished  it looked from outside like any of a number of not too specialized robot models .   the technician in charge  guided by the directions for testing in the handbook of robotics  said     how are you .      the indicated answer was to have been     i am well and ready to begin my functions .  i trust you are well  too     or some trivial modification thereof .   this first exchange served no purpose but to show that the robot could hear  understand a routine question  and make a routine reply congruent with what one would expect of a robotic attitude .  beginning from there  one could pass on to more complicated matters that would test the different laws and their interaction with the specialized knowledge of each particular model .   so the technician said     how are you .     he was instantly jolted by the nature of lne prototype   s voice .  it had a quality like no robotic voice he had ever heard  and he had heard many  .  it formed syllables like the chimes of a low pitched celeste .   so surprising was this that it was only after several moments that the technician heard  in retrospect  the syllables that had been formed by those heavenly tones .  they were     da  da  da  goo .     the robot still stood tall and straight but its right hand crept upward and a finger went into its mouth .   the technician stared in absolute horror and bolted .  he locked the door behind him and  from another room  put in an emergency call to dr .  susan calvin .       dr .  susan calvin was u .  s .  robots     and  virtually  mankind   s  only robopsychologist .  she did not have to go very far in her testing of lne prototype before she called very peremptorily for a transcript of the computer drawn plans of the positronic brain paths and the taped instructions that had directed them .  after some study  she  in turn  sent for bogert .   her iron gray hair was drawn severely back  her cold face  with its strong vertical lines marked off by the horizontal gash of the pale  thin lipped mouth  turned intensely upon him .      what is this  peter .     bogert studied the passages she pointed out with increasing stupefaction and said     good lord  susan  it makes no sense .         it most certainly doesn   t .  how did it get into the instructions .     the technician in charge  called upon  swore in all sincerity that it was none of his doing  and that he could not account for it .  the computer checked out negative for all attempts at flaw finding .      the positronic brain     said susan calvin  thoughtfully     is past redemption .  so many of the higher functions have been cancelled out by these meaningless directions that the result is very like a human baby .      bogert looked surprised  and susan calvin took on a frozen attitude at once  as she always did at the least expressed or implied doubt of her word .  she said     we make every effort to make a robot as mentally like a man as possible .  eliminate what we call the adult functions and what is naturally left is a human infant  mentally speaking .  why do you look so surprised  peter .      lne prototype  who showed no signs of understanding any of the things that were going on around it  suddenly slipped into a sitting position and began a minute examination of its feet .   bogert stared at it .     it   s a shame to have to dismantle the creature .  it   s a handsome job .         dismantle it .     said the robopsychologist forcefully .     of course  susan .  what   s the use of this thing .  good lord  if there   s one object completely and abysmally useless it   s a robot without a job it can perform .  you don   t pretend there   s a job this thing can do  do you .         no  of course not .         well  then .      susan calvin said  stubbornly     i want to conduct more tests .     bogert looked at her with a moment   s impatience  then shrugged .  if there was one person at u .  s .  robots with whom it was useless to dispute  surely that was susan calvin .  robots were all she loved  and long association with them  it seemed to bogert  had deprived her of any appearance of humanity .  she was no more to be argued out of a decision than was a triggered micropile to be argued out of operating .      what   s the use .     he breathed  then aloud  hastily     will you let us know when your tests are complete .         i will     she said .     come  lenny .       lne  thought bogert .  that becomes lenny .  inevitable .    susan calvin held out her hand but the robot only stared at it .  gently  the robopsychologist reached for the robot   s hand and took it .  lenny rose smoothly to its feet  its mechanical coordination  at least  worked well  .  together they walked out  robot topping woman by two feet .  many eyes followed them curiously down the long corridors .     one wall of susan calvin   s laboratory  the one opening directly off her private office  was covered with a highly magnified reproduction of a positronic path chart .  susan calvin had studied it with absorption for the better part of a month .   she was considering it now  carefully  tracing the blunted paths through their contortions .  behind her  lenny sat on the floor  moving its legs apart and together  crooning meaningless syllables to itself in a voice so beautiful that one could listen to the nonsense and be ravished .   susan calvin turned to the robot     lenny   lenny        she repeated this patiently until finally lenny looked up and made an inquiring sound .  the robopsychologist allowed a glimmer of pleasure to cross her face fleetingly .  the robot   s attention was being gained in progressively shorter intervals .   she said     raise your hand  lenny .  hand up .  hand up .     she raised her own hand as she said it  over and over .   lenny followed the movement with its eyes .  up  down  up  down .  then it made an abortive gesture with its own hand and chimed     eh uh .         very good  lenny     said susan calvin  gravely .     try it again .  hand up .      very gently  she reached out her own hand  took the robot   s  and raised it  lowered it .     hand up .  hand up .      a voice from her office called and interrupted .     susan .      calvin halted with a tightening of her lips .     what is it  alfred .     the research director walked in  and looked at the chart on the wall and at the robot .     still at it .         i   m at my work  yes .         well  you know  susan .  .  .     he took out a cigar  staring at it hard  and made as though to bite off the end .  in doing so  his eyes met the woman   s stern look of disapproval  and he put the cigar away and began over .     well  you know  susan  the lne model is in production now .         so i   ve heard .  is there something in connection with it you wish of me .         no o .  still  the mere fact that it is in production and is doing well means that working with this messed up specimen is useless .  shouldn   t it be scrapped .         in short  alfred  you are annoyed that i am wasting my so valuable time .  feel relieved .  my time is not being wasted .  i am working with this robot .         but the work has no meaning .         i   ll be the judge of that  alfred .     her voice was ominously quiet  and lanning thought it wiser to shift his ground .      will you tell me what meaning it has .  what are you doing with it right now  for instance .         i   m trying to get it to raise its hand on the word of command .  i   m trying to get it to imitate the sound of the word .      as though on cue  lenny said     eh uh   and raised its hand waveringly .   lanning shook his head .     that voice is amazing .  how does it happen .      susan calvin said     i don   t quite know .  its transmitter is a normal one .  it could speak normally  i   m sure .  it doesn   t  however  it speaks like this as a consequence of something in the positronic paths that i have not yet pinpointed .         well  pinpoint it  for heaven   s sake .  speech like that might be useful .         oh  then there is some possible use in my studies on lenny .     lanning shrugged in embarrassment .     oh  well  it   s a minor point .         i   m sorry you don   t see the major points  then     said susan calvin with asperity     which are much more important  but that   s not my fault .  would you leave now  alfred  and let me go on with my work .        lanning got to his cigar  eventually  in bogert   s office .  he said  sourly     that woman is growing more peculiar daily .      bogert understood perfectly .  in the u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation  there was only one    that woman .     he said     is she still scuffing about with that pseudo robot   that lenny of hers .         trying to get it to talk  so help me .     bogert shrugged .     points up the company problem .  i mean  about getting qualified personnel for research .  if we had other robopsychologists  we could retire susan .  incidentally  i presume the directors    meeting scheduled for tomorrow is for the purpose of dealing with the procurement problem .      lanning nodded and looked at his cigar as though it didn   t taste good .     yes .  quality  though  not quantity .  we   ve raised wages until there   s a steady stream of applicants   those who are interested primarily in money .  the trick is to get those who are interested primarily in robotics   a few more like susan calvin .         hell  no .  not like her .         well  not like her personally .  but you   ll have to admit  peter  that she   s single minded about robots .  she has no other interest in life .         i know .  and that   s exactly what makes her so unbearable .     lanning nodded .  he had lost count of the many times it would have done his soul good to have fired susan calvin .  he had also lost count of the number of millions of dollars she had at one time or another saved the company .  she was a truly indispensable woman and would remain one until she died   or until they could lick the problem of finding men and women of her own high caliber who were interested in robotics research .   he said     i think we   ll cut down on the tour business .     peter shrugged .     if you say so .  but meanwhile  seriously  what do we do about susan .  she can easily tie herself up with lenny indefinitely .  you know how she is when she gets what she considers an interesting problem .         what can we do .     said lanning .     if we become too anxious to pull her off  she   ll stay on out of feminine contrariness .  in the last analysis  we can   t force her to do anything .      the dark haired mathematician smiled .     i wouldn   t ever apply the adjective    feminine    to any part of her .         oh  well     said lanning  grumpily .     at least  it won   t do anyone any actual harm .      in that  if in nothing else  he was wrong .  the emergency signal is always a tension making thing in any large industrial establishment .  such signals had sounded in the history of u .  s .  robots a dozen times   for fire  flood  riot and insurrection .   but one thing had never occurred in all that time .  never had the particular signal indicating    robot out of control    sounded .  no one ever expected it to sound .  it was only installed at government insistence .      damn the frankenstein complex     lanning would mutter on those rare occasions when he thought of it .    now  finally  the shrill siren rose and fell at ten second intervals  and practically no worker from the president of the board of directors down to the newest janitor   s assistant recognized the significance of the strange sound for a few moments .  after those moments passed  there was a massive convergence of armed guards and medical men to the indicated area of danger and u .  s .  robots was struck with paralysis .   charles randow  computing technician  was taken off to hospital level with a broken arm .  there was no other damage .  no other physical damage .      but the moral damage     roared lanning     is beyond estimation .      susan calvin faced him  murderously calm .     you will do nothing to lenny .  nothing .  do you understand .         do you understand  susan .     that thing has hurt a human being .  it has broken first law .  don   t you know what first law is .         you will do nothing to lenny .         for god   s sake  susan  do i have to tell you first law .  a robot may not harm a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  our entire position depends on the fact that first law is rigidly observed by all robots of all types .  if the public should hear  and they will hear  that there was an exception  even one exception  we might be forced to close down altogether .  our only chance of survival would be to announce at once that the robot involved had been destroyed  explain the circumstances  and hope that the public can be convinced that it will never happen again .         i would like to find out exactly what happened     said susan calvin .     i was not present at the time and i would like to know exactly what the randow boy was doing in my laboratories without my permission .         the important thing that happened     said lanning     is obvious .  your robot struck randow and the damn fool flashed the    robot out of control    button and made a case of it .  but your robot struck him and inflicted damage to the extent of a broken arm .  the truth is your lenny is so distorted it lacks first law and it must be destroyed .         it does not lack first law .  i have studied its brainpaths and know it does not lack it .         then how could it strike a man .     desperation turned him to sarcasm .     ask lenny .  surely you have taught it to speak by now .      susan calvin   s cheeks bushed a painful pink .  she said     i prefer to interview the victim .  and in my absence  alfred  i want my offices sealed tight  with lenny inside .  i want no one to approach him .  if any harm comes to him while i am gone  this company will not see me again under any circumstances .         will you agree to its destruction  if it has broken first law .         yes     said susan calvin     because i know it hasn   t .        charles randow lay in bed with his arm set and in a cast .  his major suffering was still from the shock of those few moments in which he thought a robot was advancing on him with murder in its positronic mind .  no other human had ever had such reason to fear direct robotic harm as he had had just then .  he had had a unique experience .   susan calvin and alfred lanning stood beside his bed now  peter bogert  who had met them on the way  was with them .  doctors and nurses had been shooed out .   susan calvin said     now   what happened .     randow was daunted .  he muttered     the thing hit me in the arm .  it was coming at me .      calvin said     move further back in the story .  what were you doing in my laboratory without authorization .      the young computer swallowed  and the adam   s apple in his thin neck bobbed noticeably .  he was high cheekboned and abnormally pale .  he said     we all knew about your robot .  the word is you were trying to teach it to talk like a musical instrument .  there were bets going as to whether it talked or not .  some said   uh   you could teach a gatepost to talk .         i suppose     said susan calvin  freezingly     that is meant as a compliment .  what did that have to do with you .         i was supposed to go in there and settle matters   see if it would talk  you know .  we swiped a key to your place and i waited till you were gone and went in .  we had a lottery on who was to do it .  i lost .         then .         i tried to get it to talk and it hit me .         what do you mean  you tried to get it to talk .  how did you try .         i   i asked it questions  but it wouldn   t say anything  and i had to give the thing a fair shake  so i kind of   yelled at it  and           and .      there was a long pause .  under susan calvin   s unwavering stare  randow finally said     i tried to scare it into saying something .     he added defensively     i had to give the thing a fair shake .         how did you try to scare it .         i pretended to take a punch at it .         and it brushed your arm aside .         it hit my arm .         very well .  that   s all .     to lanning and bogert  she said     come  gentlemen .      at the doorway  she turned back to randow .     i can settle the bets going around  if you are still interested .  lenny can speak a few words quite well .        they said nothing until they were in susan calvin   s office .  its walls were lined with her books  some of which she had written herself .  it retained the patina of her own frigid  carefully ordered personality .  it had only one chair in it and she sat down .  lanning and bogert remained standing .   she said     lenny only defended itself .  that is the third law  a robot must protect its own existence .         except     said lanning forcefully     when this conflicts with the first or second laws .  complete the statement .  lenny had no right to defend itself in any way at the cost of harm  however minor  to a human being .         nor did it     shot back calvin     knowingly .  lenny has an aborted brain .  it had no way of knowing its own strength or the weakness of humans .  in brushing aside the threatening arm of a human being it could not know the bone would break .  in human terms  no moral blame can be attached to an individual who honestly cannot differentiate good and evil .      bogert interrupted  soothingly     now  susan  we don   t blame .  we understand that lenny is the equivalent of a baby  humanly speaking  and we don   t blame it .  but the public will .  u .  s .  robots will be closed down .         quite the opposite .  if you had the brains of a flea  peter  you would see that this is the opportunity u .  s .  robots is waiting for .  that this will solve its problems .      lanning hunched his white eyebrows low .  he said  softly     what problems  susan .         isn   t the corporation concerned about maintaining our research personnel at the present   heaven help us   high level .         we certainly are .         well  what are you offering prospective researchers .  excitement .  novelty .  the thrill of piercing the unknown .  no .  you offer them salaries and the assurance of no problems .      bogert said     how do you mean  no problems .         are there problems .     shot back susan calvin .     what kind of robots do we turn out .  fully developed robots  fit for their tasks .  an industry tells us what it needs  a computer designs the brain  machinery forms the robot  and there it is  complete and done .  peter  some time ago  you asked me with reference to lenny what its use was .  what   s the use  you said  of a robot that was not designed for any job .  now i ask you   what   s the use of a robot designed for only one job .  it begins and ends in the same place .  the lne models mine boron .  if beryllium is needed  they are useless .  if boron technology enters a new phase  they become useless .  a human being so designed would be sub human .  a robot so designed is sub robotic .         do you want a versatile robot .     asked lanning  incredulously .     why not .     demanded the robopsychologist .     why not .  i   ve been handed a robot with a brain almost completely stultified .  i   ve been teaching it  and you  alfred  asked me what was the use of that .  perhaps very little as far as lenny itself is concerned  since it will never progress beyond the five year old level on a human scale .  but what   s the use in general .  a very great deal  if you consider it as a study in the abstract problem of learning how to teach robots .  i have learned ways to short circuit neighboring pathways in order to create new ones .  more study will yield better  more subtle and more efficient techniques of doing so .         well .         suppose you started with a positronic brain that had all the basic pathways carefully outlined but none of the secondaries .  suppose you then started creating secondaries .  you could sell basic robots designed for instruction  robots that could be modeled to a job  and then modeled to another  if necessary .  robots would become as versatile as human beings .  robots could learn .      they stared at her .  she said  impatiently     you still don   t understand  do you .         i understand what you are saying     said lanning .      don   t you understand that with a completely new field of research and completely new techniques to be developed  with a completely new area of the unknown to be penetrated  youngsters will feel a new urge to enter robotics .  try it and see .         may i point out     said bogert  smoothly     that this is dangerous .  beginning with ignorant robots such as lenny will mean that one could never trust first law   exactly as turned out in lenny   s case .         exactly .  advertise the fact .         advertise it .         of course .  broadcast the danger .  explain that you will set up a new research institute on the moon  if earth   s population chooses not to allow this sort of thing to go on upon earth  but stress the danger to the possible applicants by all means .      lanning said     for god   s sake  why .         because the spice of danger will add to the lure .  do you think nuclear technology involves no danger and spationautics no peril .  has your lure of absolute security been doing the trick for you .  has it helped you to cater to the frankenstein complex you all despise so .  try something else then  something that has worked in other fields .      there was a sound from beyond the door that led to calvin   s personal laboratories .  it was the chiming sound of lenny .   the robopsychologist broke off instantly  listening .  she said     excuse me .  i think lenny is calling me .         can it call you .     said lanning .      i said i   ve managed to teach it a few words .     she stepped toward the door  a little flustered .     if you will wait for me        they watched her leave and were silent for a moment .  then lanning said     do you think there   s anything to what she says  peter .         just possibly  alfred     said bogert .     just possibly .  enough for us to bring the matter up at the directors    meeting and see what they say .  after all  the fat is in the fire .  a robot has harmed a human being and knowledge of it is public .  as susan says  we might as well try to turn the matter to our advantage .  of course  i distrust her motives in all this .         how do you mean .         even if all she has said is perfectly true  it is only rationalization as far as she is concerned .  her motive in all this is her desire to hold on to this robot .  if we pressed her     and the mathematician smiled at the incongruous literal meaning of the phrase     she would say it was to continue learning techniques of teaching robots  but i think she has found another use for lenny .  a rather unique one that would fit only susan of all women .         i don   t get your drift .     bogert said     did you hear what the robot was calling .         well  no  i didn   t quite       began lanning  when the door opened suddenly  and both men stopped talking at once .   susan calvin stepped in again  looking about uncertainly .     have either of you seen   i   m positive i had it somewhere about   oh  there it is .      she ran to a corner of one bookcase and picked up an object of intricate metal webbery  dumbbell shaped and hollow  with variously shaped metal pieces inside each hollow  just too large to be able to fallout of the webbing .   as she picked it up  the metal pieces within moved and struck together  clicking pleasantly .  it struck lanning that the object was a kind of robotic version of a baby rattle .   as susan calvin opened the door again to pass through  lenny   s voice chimed again from within .  this time  lanning heard it clearly as it spoke the words susan calvin had taught it .   in heavenly celeste like sounds  it called out     mommie  i want you .  i want you  mommie .      and the footsteps of susan calvin could be heard hurrying eagerly across the laboratory floor toward the only kind of baby she could ever have or love .   galley slave    the united states robots and mechanical men corporation  as defendants in the case  had influence enough to force a closed doors trial without a jury .   nor did northeastern university try hard to prevent it .  the trustees knew perfectly well how the public might react to any issue involving misbehavior of a robot  however rarefied that misbehavior might be .  they also had a clearly visualized notion of how an antirobot riot might become an antiscience riot without warning .   the government  as represented in this case by justice harlow shane  was equally anxious for a quiet end to this mess .  both u .  s .  robots and the academic world were bad people to antagonize .   justice shane said     since neither press  public nor jury is present  gentlemen  let us stand on as little ceremony as we can and get to the facts .      he smiled stiffly as he said this  perhaps without much hope that his request would be effective  and hitched at his robe so that he might sit more comfortably .  his face was pleasantly rubicund  his chin round and soft  his nose broad and his eyes light in color and wide set .  all in all  it was not a face with much judicial majesty and the judge knew it .   barnabas h .  goodfellow  professor of physics at northeastern u .   was sworn in first  taking the usual vow with an expression that made mincemeat of his name .   after the usual opening gambit questions  prosecution shoved his hands deep into his pockets and said     when was it  professor  that the matter of the possible employ of robot ez    was first brought to your attention  and how .      professor goodfellow   s small and angular face set itself into an uneasy expression  scarcely more benevolent than the one it replaced .  he said     i have had professional contact and some social acquaintance with dr .  alfred lanning  director of research at u .  s .  robots .  i was inclined to listen with some tolerance then when i received a rather strange suggestion from him on the third of march of last year           of      .         that   s right .         excuse me for interrupting .  please proceed .      the professor nodded frostily  scowled to fix the facts in his mind  and began to speak .     professor goodfellow looked at the robot with a certain uneasiness .  it had been carried into the basement supply room in a crate  in accordance with the regulations governing the shipment of robots from place to place on the earth   s surface .   he knew it was coming  it wasn   t that he was unprepared .  from the moment of dr .  lanning   s first phone call on march    he had felt himself giving way to the other   s persuasiveness  and now  as an inevitable result  he found himself face to face with a robot .   it looked uncommonly large as it stood within arm   s reach .  alfred lanning cast a hard glance of his own at the robot  as though making certain it had not been damaged in transit .  then he turned his ferocious eyebrows and his mane of white hair in the professor   s direction .      this is robot ez     first of its model to be available for public use .     he turned to the robot .     this is professor goodfellow  easy .      easy spoke impassively  but with such suddenness that the professor shied .     good afternoon  professor .      easy stood seven feet tall and had the general proportions of a man   always the prime selling point of u .  s .  robots .  that and the possession of the basic patents on the positronic brain had given them an actual monopoly on robots and a near monopoly on computing machines in general .   the two men who had uncrated the robot had left now and the professor looked from lanning to the robot and back to lanning .     it is harmless  i   m sure .     he didn   t sound sure .      more harmless than i am     said lanning .     i could be goaded into striking you .  easy could not be .  you know the three laws of robotics  i presume .         yes  of course     said goodfellow .      they are built into the positronic patterns of the brain and must be observed .  the first law  the prime rule of robotic existence  safeguards the life and well being of all humans .     he paused  rubbed at his cheek  then added     it   s something of which we would like to persuade all earth if we could .         it   s just that he seems formidable .         granted .  but whatever he seems  you   ll find that he is useful .         i   m not sure in what way .  our conversations were not very helpful in that respect .  still  i agreed to look at the object and i   m doing it .         we   ll do more than look  professor .  have you brought a book .         i have .         may i see it .      professor goodfellow reached down without actually taking his eyes off the metal in human shape that confronted him .  from the briefcase at his feet  he withdrew a book .   lanning held out his hand for it and looked at the backstrip .     physical chemistry of electrolytes in solution .  fair enough  sir .  you selected this yourself  at random .  it was no suggestion of mine  this particular text .  am i right .         yes .      lanning passed the book to robot ez    .       the professor jumped a little .     no .  that   s a valuable book .     lanning raised his eyebrows and they looked like shaggy coconut icing .  he said     easy has no intention of tearing the book in two as a feat of strength  i assure you .  it can handle a book as carefully as you or i .  go ahead  easy .         thank you  sir     said easy .  then  turning its metal bulk slightly  it added     with your permission  professor goodfellow .      the professor stared  then said     yes   yes  of course .      with a slow and steady manipulation of metal fingers  easy turned the pages of the book  glancing at the left page  then the right  turning the page  glancing left  then right  turning the page and so on for minute after minute .   the sense of its power seemed to dwarf even the large cement walled room in which they stood and to reduce the two human watchers to something considerably less than life size .   goodfellow muttered     the light isn   t very good .         it will do .      then  rather more sharply     but what is he doing .         patience  sir .      the last page was turned eventually .  lanning asked     well  easy .      the robot said     it is a most accurate book and there is little to which i can point .  on line    of page     the word    positive    is spelled p o i s t i v e .  the comma in line   of page    is superfluous  whereas one should have been used on line    of page    .  the plus sign in equation xiv   on page     should be a minus sign if it is to be consistent with the previous equations           wait .  wait .     cried the professor .     what is he doing .         doing .     echoed lanning in sudden irascibility .     why  man  he has already done it .  he has proofread that book .         proofread it .         yes .  in the short time it took him to turn those pages  he caught every mistake in spelling  grammar and punctuation .  he has noted errors in word order and detected inconsistencies .  and he will retain the information  letter perfect  indefinitely .      the professor   s mouth was open .  he walked rapidly away from lanning and easy and as rapidly back .  he folded his arms across his chest and stared at them .  finally he said     you mean this is a proofreading robot .      lanning nodded .     among other things .         but why do you show it to me .         so that you might help me persuade the university to obtain it for use .         to read proof .         among other things     lanning repeated patiently .   the professor drew his pinched face together in a kind of sour disbelief .     but this is ridiculous .         why .         the university could never afford to buy this half ton   it must weigh that at least   this half ton proofreader .         proofreading is not all it will do .  it will prepare reports from outlines  fill out forms  serve as an accurate memory file  grade papers        all picayune .        lanning said     not at all  as i can show you in a moment .  but i think we can discuss this more comfortably in your office  if you have no objection .         no  of course not     began the professor mechanically and took a half step as though to turn .  then he snapped out     but the robot   we can   t take the robot .  really  doctor  you   ll have to crate it up again .         time enough .  we can leave easy here .         unattended .         why not .  he knows he is to stay .  professor goodfellow  it is necessary to understand that a robot is far more reliable than a human being .         i would be responsible for any damage           there will be no damage .  i guarantee that .  look  it   s after hours .  you expect no one here  i imagine  before tomorrow morning .  the truck and my two men are outside .  u .  s .  robots will take any responsibility that may arise .  none will .  call it a demonstration of the reliability of the robot .      the professor allowed himself to be led out of the storeroom .  nor did he look entirely comfortable in his own office  five stories up .   he dabbed at the line of droplets along the upper half of his forehead with a white handkerchief .      as you know very well  dr .  lanning  there are laws against the use of robots on earth   s surface     he pointed out .      the laws  professor goodfellow  are not simple ones .  robots may not be used on public thoroughfares or within public edifices .  they may not be used on private grounds or within private structures except under certain restrictions that usually turn out to be prohibitive .  the university  however  is a large and privately owned institution that usually receives preferential treatment .  if the robot is used only in a specific room for only academic purposes  if certain other restrictions are observed and if the men and women having occasion to enter the room cooperate fully  we may remain within the law .         but all that trouble just to read proof .         the uses would be infinite .  professor .  robotic labor has so far been used only to relieve physical drudgery .  isn   t there such a thing as mental drudgery .  when a professor capable of the most useful creative thought is forced to spend two weeks painfully checking the spelling of lines of print and i offer you a machine that can do it in thirty minutes  is that picayune .         but the price           the price need not bother you .  you cannot buy ez    .  u .  s .  robots does not sell its products .  but the university can lease ez    for a thousand dollars a year   considerably less than the cost of a single microwave spectograph continuous recording attachment .      goodfellow looked stunned .  lanning followed up his advantage by saying     i only ask that you put it up to whatever group makes the decisions here .  i would be glad to speak to them if they want more information .         well     goodfellow said doubtfully     i can bring it up at next week   s senate meeting .  i can   t promise that will do any good  though .         naturally     said lanning .     the defense attorney was short and stubby and carried himself rather portentously  a stance that had the effect of accentuating his double chin .  he stared at professor goodfellow  once that witness had been handed over  and said     you agreed rather readily  did you not .      the professor said briskly     i suppose i was anxious to be rid of dr .  lanning .  i would have agreed to anything .         with the intention of forgetting about it after he left .         well           nevertheless  you did present the matter to a meeting of the executive board of the university senate .         yes  i did .         so that you agreed in good faith with dr .  lanning   s suggestions .  you weren   t just going along with a gag .  you actually agreed enthusiastically  did you not .         i merely followed ordinary procedures .         as a matter of fact  you weren   t as upset about the robot as you now claim you were .  you know the three laws of robotics and you knew them at the time of your interview with dr .  lanning .         well  yes .         and you were perfectly willing to leave a robot at large and unattended .         dr .  lanning assured me           surely you would never have accepted his assurance if you had had the slightest doubt that the robot might be in the least dangerous .      the professor began frigidly     i had every faith in the word           that is all     said defense abruptly .   as professor goodfellow  more than a bit ruffled  stood down  justice shane leaned forward and said     since i am not a robotics man myself  i would appreciate knowing precisely what the three laws of robotics are .  would dr .  lanning quote them for the benefit of the court .      dr .  lanning looked startled .  he had been virtually bumping heads with the gray haired woman at his side .  he rose to his feet now and the woman looked up  too   expressionlessly .   dr .  lanning said     very well  your honor .     he paused as though about to launch into an oration and said  with laborious clarity     first law  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  second law  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  third law  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .         i see     said the judge  taking rapid notes .     these laws are built into every robot  are they .         into every one .  that will be borne out by any roboticist .         and into robot ez    specifically .         yes  your honor .         you will probably be required to repeat those statements under oath .         i am ready to do so  your honor .     he sat down again .   dr .  susan calvin  robopsychologist in chief for u .  s .  robots  who was the gray haired woman sitting next to lanning  looked at her titular superior without favor  but then she showed favor to no human being .  she said     was goodfellow   s testimony accurate   alfred .         essentially     muttered lanning .     he wasn   t as nervous as all that about the robot and he was anxious enough to talk business with me when he heard the price .  but there doesn   t seem to be any drastic distortion .      dr .  calvin said thoughtfully     it might have been wise to put the price higher than a thousand .         we were anxious to place easy .         i know .  too anxious  perhaps .  they   ll try to make it look as  though we had an ulterior motive .      lanning looked exasperated .     we did .  i admitted that at the university senate meeting .         they can make it look as if we had one beyond the one we admitted .      scott robertson  son of the founder of u .  s .  robots and still owner of a majority of the stock  leaned over from dr .  calvin   s other side and said in a kind of explosive whisper     why can   t you get easy to talk so we   ll know where we   re at .         you know he can   t talk about it  mr .  robertson .         make him .  you   re the psychologist  dr .  calvin .  make him .         if i   m the psychologist  mr .  robertson     said susan calvin coldly     let me make the decisions .  my robot will not be made to do anything at the price of his well being .      robertson frowned and might have answered  but justice shane was tapping his gavel in a polite sort of way and they grudgingly fell silent .   francis j .  hart  head of the department of english and dean of graduate studies  was on the stand .  he was a plump man  meticulously dressed in dark clothing of a conservative cut  and possessing several strands of hair traversing the pink top of his cranium .  he sat well back in the witness chair with his hands folded neatly in his lap and displaying  from time to time  a tight lipped smile .   he said     my first connection with the matter of the robot ez    was on the occasion of the session of the university senate executive committee at which the subject was introduced by professor goodfellow .  thereafter  on the tenth of april of last year  we held a special meeting on the subject  during which i was in the chair .         were minutes kept of the meeting of the executive committee .  of the special meeting  that is .         well  no .  it was a rather unusual meeting .     the dean smiled briefly .     we thought it might remain confidential .         what transpired at the meeting .        dean hart was not entirely comfortable as chairman of that meeting .  nor did the other members assembled seem completely calm .  only dr .  lanning appeared at peace with himself .  his tall  gaunt figure and the shock of white hair that crowned him reminded hart of portraits he had seen of andrew jackson .   samples of the robot   s work lay scattered along the central regions of the table and the reproduction of a graph drawn by the robot was now in the hands of professor minott of physical chemistry .  the chemist   s lips were pursed in obvious approval .   hart cleared his throat and said     there seems no doubt that the robot can perform certain routine tasks with adequate competence .  i have gone over these  for instance  just before coming in and there is very little to find fault with .      he picked up a long sheet of printing  some three times as long as the average book page .  it was a sheet of galley proof  designed to be corrected by authors before the type was set up in page form .  along both of the wide margins of the galley were proofmarks  neat and superbly legible .  occasionally  a word of print was crossed out and a new word substituted in the margin in characters so fine and regular it might easily have been print itself .  some of the corrections were blue to indicate the original mistake had been the author   s  a few in red  where the printer had been wrong .      actually     said lanning     there is less than very little to find fault with .  i should say there is nothing at all to find fault with  dr .  hart .  i   m sure the corrections are perfect  insofar as the original manuscript was .  if the manuscript against which this galley was corrected was at fault in a matter of fact rather than of english  the robot is not competent to correct it .         we accept that .  however  the robot corrected word order on occasion and i don   t think the rules of english are sufficiently hidebound for us to be sure that in each case the robot   s choice was the correct one .         easy   s positronic brain     said lanning  showing large teeth as he smiled     has been molded by the contents of all the standard works on the subject .  i   m sure you cannot point to a case where the robot   s choice was definitely the incorrect one .      professor minott looked up from the graph he still held .     the question in my mind  dr .  lanning  is why we need a robot at all  with all the difficulties in public relations that would entail .  the science of automation has surely reached the point where your company could design a machine  an ordinary computer of a type known and accepted by the public  that would correct galleys .         i am sure we could     said lanning stiffly     but such a machine would require that the galleys be translated into special symbols or  at the least  transcribed on tapes .  any corrections would emerge in symbols .  you would need to keep men employed translating words to symbols  symbols to words .  furthermore  such a computer could do no other job .  it couldn   t prepare the graph you hold in your hand  for instance .      minott grunted .     lanning went on .     the hallmark of the positronic robot is its flexibility .  it can do a number of jobs .  it is designed like a man so that it can use all the tools and machines that have  after all  been designed to be used by a man .  it can talk to you and you can talk to it .  you can actually reason with it up to a point .  compared to even a simple robot  an ordinary computer with a non positronic brain is only a heavy adding machine .      goodfellow looked up and said     if we all talk and reason with the robot  what are the chances of our confusing it .  i suppose it doesn   t have the capability of absorbing an infinite amount of data .         no  it hasn   t .  but it should last five years with ordinary use .  it will know when it will require clearing  and the company will do the job without charge .         the company will .         yes .  the company reserves the right to service the robot outside the ordinary course of its duties .  it is one reason we retain control of our positronic robots and lease rather than sell them .  in the pursuit of its ordinary functions  any robot can be directed by any man .  outside its ordinary functions  a robot requires expert handling  and that we can give it .  for instance  any of you might clear an ez robot to an extent by telling it to forget this item or that .  but you would be almost certain to phrase the order in such a way as to cause it to forget too much or too little .  we would detect such tampering  because we have built in safeguards .  however  since there is no need for clearing the robot in its ordinary work  or for doing other useless things  this raises no problem .        dean hart touched his head as though to make sure his carefully cultivated strands lay evenly distributed and said     you are anxious to have us take the machine .  yet surely it is a losing proposition for u .  s .  robots .  one thousand a year is a ridiculously low price .  is it that you hope through this to rent other such machines to other universities at a more reasonable price .         certainly that   s a fair hope     said lanning .      but even so  the number of machines you could rent would be limited .  i doubt if you could make it a paying proposition .      lanning put his elbows on the table and earnestly leaned forward .     let me put it bluntly  gentlemen .  robots cannot be used on earth  except in certain special cases  because of prejudice against them on the part of the public .  u .  s .  robots is a highly successful corporation with our extraterrestrial and spaceflight markets alone  to say nothing of our computer subsidiaries .  however  we are concerned with more than profits alone .  it is our firm belief that the use of robots on earth itself would mean a better life for all eventually  even if a certain amount of economic dislocation resulted at first .      the labor unions are naturally against us  but surely we may expect cooperation from the large universities .  the robot  easy  will help you by relieving you of scholastic drudgery   by assuming  if you permit it  the role of galley slave for you .  other universities and research institutions will follow your lead  and if it works out  then perhaps other robots of other types may be placed and the public   s objections to them broken down by stages .      minott murmured     today northeastern university  tomorrow the world .      angrily  lanning whispered to susan calvin     i wasn   t nearly that eloquent and they weren   t nearly that reluctant .  at a thousand a year  they were jumping to get easy .  professor minott told me he   d never seen as beautiful a job as that graph he was holding and there was no mistake on the galley or anywhere else .  hart admitted it freely .      the severe vertical lines on dr .  calvin   s face did not soften .     you should have demanded more money than they could pay  alfred  and let them beat you down .         maybe     he grumbled .   prosecution was not quite done with professor hart .     after dr .  lanning left  did you vote on whether to accept robot ez    .         yes  we did .         with what result .         in favor of acceptance  by majority vote .         what would you say influenced the vote .     defense objected immediately .   prosecution rephrased the question .     what influenced you  personally  in your individual vote .  you did vote in favor  i think .         i voted in favor  yes .  i did so largely because i was impressed by dr .  lanning   s feeling that it was our duty as members of the world   s intellectual leadership to allow robotics to help man in the solution of his problems .         in other words  dr .  lanning talked you into it .         that   s his job .  he did it very well .         your witness .      defense strode up to the witness chair and surveyed professor hart for a long moment .  he said     in reality  you were all pretty eager to have robot ez    in your employ  weren   t you .         we thought that if it could do the work  it might be useful .         if it could do the work .  i understand you examined the samples of robot ez      s original work with particular care on the day of the meeting which you have just described .         yes  i did .  since the machine   s work dealt primarily with the handling of the english language  and since that is my field of competence  it seemed logical that i be the one chosen to examine the work .         very good .  was there anything on display on the table at the time of the meeting which was less than satisfactory .  i have all the material here as exhibits .  can you point to a single unsatisfactory item .         well           it   s a simple question .  was there one single solitary unsatisfactory item .  you inspected it .  was there .      the english professor frowned .     there wasn   t .         i also have some samples of work done by robot ez    during the course of his fourteen month employ at northeastern .  would you examine these and tell me if there is anything wrong with them in even one particular .      hart snapped     when he did make a mistake  it was a beauty .         answer my question     thundered defense     and only the question i am putting to you .  is there anything wrong with the material .      dean hart looked cautiously at each item .     well  nothing .         barring the matter concerning which we are here engaged .  do you know of any mistake on the part of ez    .         barring the matter for which this trial is being held  no .        defense cleared his throat as though to signal end of paragraph .  he said .     now about the vote concerning whether robot ez    was to be employed or not .  you said there was a majority in favor .  what was the actual vote .         thirteen to one  as i remember .         thirteen to one .  more than just a majority  wouldn   t you say .         no  sir .    all the pedant in dean hart was aroused .     in the english language  the word    majority    means    more than half .     thirteen out of fourteen is a majority  nothing more .         but an almost unanimous one .         a majority all the same .      defense switched ground .     and who was the lone holdout .      dean hart looked acutely uncomfortable .     professor simon ninheimer .      defense pretended astonishment .     professor ninheimer .  the head of the department of sociology .         yes  sir .         the plaintiff .         yes  sir .      defense pursed his lips .     in other words  it turns out that the man bringing the action for payment of          damages against my client .  united states robots and mechanical men corporation was the one who from the beginning opposed the use of the robot   although everyone else on the executive committee of the university senate was persuaded that it was a good idea .         he voted against the motion  as was his right .         you didn   t mention in your description of the meeting any remarks made by professor ninheimer .  did he make any .         i think he spoke .         you think .         well  he did speak .         against using the robot .         yes .         was he violent about it .      dean hart paused .     he was vehement .      defense grew confidential .     how long have you known professor ninheimer  dean hart .         about twelve years .         reasonably well .         i should say so  yes .         knowing him  then  would you say he was the kind of man who might continue to bear resentment against a robot  all the more so because an adverse vote had        prosecution drowned out the remainder of the question with an indignant and vehement objection of his own .  defense motioned the witness down and justice shane called luncheon recess .     robertson mangled his sandwich .  the corporation would not founder for loss of three quarters of a million  but the loss would do it no particular good .  he was conscious  moreover  that there would be a much more costly long term setback in public relations .   he said sourly     why all this business about how easy got into the university .  what do they hope to gain .      the attorney for defense said quietly     a court action is like a chess game  mi .  robertson .  the winner is usually the one who can see more moves ahead  and my friend at the prosecutor   s table is no beginner .  they can show damage  that   s no problem .  their main effort lies in anticipating our defense .  they must be counting on us to try to show that easy couldn   t possibly have committed the offense   because of the laws of robotics .         all right     said robertson     that is our defense .  an absolutely airtight one .         to a robotics engineer .  not necessarily to a judge .  they   re setting themselves up a position from which they can demonstrate that ez    was no ordinary robot .  it was the first of its type to be offered to the public .  it was an experimental model that needed field testing and the university was the only decent way to provide such testing .  that would look plausible in the light of dr .  lanning   s strong efforts to place the robot and the willingness of u .  s .  robots to lease it for so little .  the prosecution would then argue that the field test proved easy to have been a failure .  now do you see the purpose of what   s been going on .         but ez    was a perfectly good model     argued robertson .     it was the twenty seventh in production .         which is really a bad point     said defense somberly .     what was wrong with the first twenty six .  obviously something .  why shouldn   t there be something wrong with the twenty seventh  too .         there was nothing wrong with the first twenty six except that they weren   t complex enough for the task .  these were the first positronic brains of the sort to be constructed and it was rather hit and miss to begin with .  but the three laws held in all of them .  no robot is so imperfect that the three laws don   t hold .         dr .  lanning has explained this to me  mr .  robertson  and i am willing to take his word for it .  the judge  however  may not be .  we are expecting a decision from an honest and intelligent man who knows no robotics and thus may be led astray .  for instance  if you or dr .  lanning or dr .  calvin were to say on the stand that any positronic brains were constructed    hit and miss     as you just did  prosecution would tear you apart in cross examination .  nothing would salvage our case .  so that   s something to avoid .      robertson growled     if only easy would talk .      defense shrugged .     a robot is incompetent as a witness  so that would do us no good .         at least we   d know some of the facts .  we   d know how it came to do such a thing .      susan calvin fired up .  a dullish red touched her cheeks and her voice had a trace of warmth in it .     we know how easy came to do it .  it was ordered to .  i   ve explained this to counsel and i   ll explain it to you now .         ordered to by whom .     asked robertson in honest astonishment .   no one ever told him anything  he thought resentfully .  these research people considered themselves the owners of u .  s .  robots  by god .       by the plaintiff     said dr .  calvin .     in heaven   s name  why .         i don   t know why yet .  perhaps just that we might be sued  that he might gain some cash .     there were blue glints in her eyes as she said that .      then why doesn   t easy say so .         isn   t that obvious .  it   s been ordered to keep quiet about the matter .         why should that be obvious .     demanded robertson truculently .     well  it   s obvious to me .  robot psychology is my profession .  if  easy will not answer questions about the matter directly  he will answer questions on the fringe of the matter .  by measuring increased hesitation in his answers as the central question is approached  by measuring the area of blankness and the intensity of counterpotentials set up  it is possible to tell with scientific precision that his troubles are the result of an order not to talk  with its strength based on first law .  in other words  he   s been told that if he talks  harm will be done a human being .  presumably harm to the unspeakable professor ninheimer  the plaintiff  who  to the robot  would seem a human being .         well  then     said robertson     can   t you explain that if he keeps quiet  harm will be done to u .  s .  robots .         u .  s .  robots is not a human being and the first law of robotics does not recognize a corporation as a person the way ordinary laws do .  besides  it would be dangerous to try to lift this particular sort of inhibition .  the person who laid it on could lift it off least dangerously  because the robot   s motivations in that respect are centered on that person .  any other course       she shook her head and grew almost impassioned .     i won   t let the robot be damaged .      lanning interrupted with the air of bringing sanity to the problem .     it seems to me that we have only to prove a robot incapable of the act of which easy is accused .  we can do that .         exactly     said defense  in annoyance .     you can do that .  the only witnesses capable of testifying to easy   s condition and to the nature of easy   s state of mind are employees of u .  s .  robots .  the judge can   t possibly accept their testimony as unprejudiced .         how can he deny expert testimony .         by refusing to be convinced by it .  that   s his right as the judge .  against the alternative that a man like professor ninheimer deliberately set about ruining his own reputation  even for a sizable sum of money  the judge isn   t going to accept the technicalities of your engineers .  the judge is a man  after all .  if he has to choose between a man doing an impossible thing and a robot doing an impossible thing  he   s quite likely to decide in favor of the man .         a man can do an impossible thing     said lanning     because we don   t know all the complexities of the human mind and we don   t know what  in a given human mind  is impossible and what is not .  we do know what is really impossible to a robot .         well  we   ll see if we can   t convince the judge of that     defense replied wearily .      if all you say is so     rumbled robertson     i don   t see how you can .         we   ll see .  it   s good to know and be aware of the difficulties involved  but let   s not be too downhearted .  i   ve tried to look ahead a few moves in the chess game  too .     with a stately nod in the direction of the robopsychologist  he added     with the help of the good lady here .      lanning looked from one to the other and said     what the devil is this .      but the bailiff thrust his head into the room and announced somewhat breathlessly that the trial was about to resume .   they took their seats  examining the man who had started all the trouble .   simon ninheimer owned a fluffy head of sandy hair  a face that narrowed past a beaked nose toward a pointed chin  and a habit of sometimes hesitating before key words in his conversation that gave him an air of a seeker after an almost unbearable precision .  when he said     the sun rises in the   uh   east     one was certain he had given due consideration to the possibility that it might at some time rise in the west .   prosecution said     did you oppose employment of robot ez    by the university .         i did  sir .         why was that .         i did not feel that we understood the   uh   motives of u .  s .  robots thoroughly .  i mistrusted their anxiety to place the robot with us .         did you feel that it was capable of doing the work that it was allegedly designed to do .         i know for a fact that it was not .         would you state your reasons .        simon ninheimer   s book  entitled social tensions involved in space flight and their resolution  had been eight years in the making .  ninheimer   s search for precision was not confined to his habits of speech  and in a subject like sociology  almost inherently imprecise  it left him breathless .   even with the material in galley proofs  he felt no sense of completion .  rather the reverse  in fact .  staring at the long strips of print  he felt only the itch to tear the lines of type apart and rearrange them differently .   jim baker  instructor and soon to be assistant professor of sociology  found ninheimer  three days after the first batch of galleys had arrived from the printer  staring at the handful of paper in abstraction .  the galleys came in three copies  one for ninheimer to proofread  one for baker to proofread independently  and a third  marked    original     which was to receive the final corrections  a combination of those made by ninheimer and by baker  after a conference at which possible conflicts and disagreements were ironed out .  this had been their policy on the several papers on which they had collaborated in the past three years and it worked well .   baker  young and ingratiatingly soft voiced  had his own copies of the galleys in his hand .  he said eagerly     i   ve done the first chapter and it contains some typographical beauts .         the first chapter always has them     said ninheimer distantly .     do you want to go over it now .      ninheimer brought his eyes to grave focus on baker .     i haven   t done anything on the galleys  jim .  i don   t think i   ll bother .      baker looked confused .     not bother .      ninheimer pursed his lips .     i   ve asked about the   uh   workload of the machine .  after all  he was originally   uh   promoted as a proofreader .  they   ve set a schedule .         the machine .  you mean easy .         i believe that is the foolish name they gave it .         but  dr .  ninheimer  i thought you were staying clear of it           i seem to be the only one doing so .  perhaps i ought to take my share of the   uh   advantage .         oh .  well  i seem to have wasted time on this first chapter  then     said the younger man ruefully .      not wasted .  we can compare the machine   s result with yours as a check .         if you want to  but           yes .         i doubt that we   ll find anything wrong with easy   s work .  it   s supposed never to have made a mistake .         i dare say     said ninheimer dryly .     the first chapter was brought in again by baker four days later .  this time it was ninheimer   s copy  fresh from the special annex that had been built to house easy and the equipment it used .   baker was jubilant .     dr .  ninheimer  it not only caught everything i caught   it found a dozen errors i missed .  the whole thing took it twelve minutes .      ninheimer looked over the sheaf  with the neatly printed marks and symbols in the margins .  he said     it is not as complete as you and i would have made it .  we would have entered an insert on suzuki   s work on the neurological effects of low gravity .         you mean his paper in sociological reviews .         of course .         well  you can   t expect impossibilities of easy .  it can   t read the literature for us .         i realize that .  as a matter of fact  i have prepared the insert .  i will see the machine and make certain it knows how to   uh   handle inserts .         it will know .         i prefer to make certain .      ninheimer had to make an appointment to see easy  and then could get nothing better than fifteen minutes in the late evening .   but the fifteen minutes turned out to be ample .  robot ez    understood the matter of inserts at once .   ninheimer found himself uncomfortable at close quarters with the robot for the first time .  almost automatically  as though it were human  he found himself asking     are you happy with your work .         most happy  professor ninheimer     said easy solemnly  the photocells that were its eyes gleaming their normal deep red .      you know me .         from the fact that you present me with additional material to include in the galleys  it follows that you are the author .  the author   s name  of course  is at the head of each sheet of galley proof .         i see .  you make   uh   deductions  then .  tell me      he couldn   t resist the question      what do you think of the book so far .      easy said     i find it very pleasant to work with .         pleasant .  that is an odd word for a   uh   a mechanism without emotion .  i   ve been told you have no emotion .         the words of your book go in accordance with my circuits     easy explained .     they set up little or no counterpotentials .  it is in my brain paths to translate this mechanical fact into a word such as    pleasant .     the emotional context is fortuitous .         i see .  why do you find the book pleasant .         it deals with human beings  professor  and not with inorganic materials or mathematical symbols .  your book attempts to understand human beings and to help increase human happiness .         and this is what you try to do and so my book goes in accordance with your circuits .  is that it .         that is it  professor .      the fifteen minutes were up .  ninheimer left and went to the university library  which was on the point of closing .  he kept them open long enough to find an elementary text on robotics .  he took it home with him .   except for occasional insertion of late material  the galleys went to easy and from him to the publishers with little intervention from ninheimer at first   and none at all later .   baker said  a little uneasily     it almost gives me a feeling of uselessness .         it should give you a feeling of having time to begin a new project     said ninheimer  without looking up from the notations he was making in the current issue of social science abstracts .      i   m just not used to it .  i keep worrying about the galleys .  it   s silly  i know .         it is .         the other day i got a couple of sheets before easy sent them off to           what .     ninheimer looked up  scowling .  the copy of abstracts slid shut .     did you disturb the machine at its work .         only for a minute .  everything was all right .  oh  it changed one word .  you referred to something as    criminal     it changed the word to    reckless .     it thought the second adjective fit in better with the context .      ninheimer grew thoughtful .     what did you think .         you know  i agreed with it .  i let it stand .      ninheimer turned in his swivel chair to face his young associate .     see here  i wish you wouldn   t do this again .  if i am to use the machine  i wish the   uh   full advantage of it .  if i am to use it and lose your   uh   services anyway because you supervise it when the whole point is that it requires no supervision  i gain nothing .  do you see .         yes  dr .  ninheimer     said baker  subdued .  the advance copies of social tensions arrived in dr .  ninheimer   s office on the eighth of may .  he looked through it briefly  flipping pages and pausing to read a paragraph here and there .  then he put his copies away .   as he explained later  he forgot about it .  for eight years  he had worked at it  but now  and for months in the past  other interests had engaged him while easy had taken the load of the book off his shoulders .  he did not even think to donate the usual complimentary copy to the university library .  even baker  who had thrown himself into work and had steered clear of the department head since receiving his rebuke at their last meeting  received no copy .   on the sixteenth of june that stage ended .  ninheimer received a phone call and stared at the image in the    plate with surprise .      speidell .  are you in town .         no  sir .  i   m in cleveland .     speidell   s voice trembled with emotion .      then why the call .         because i   ve just been looking through your new book .  ninheimer  are you mad .  have you gone insane .        ninheimer stiffened .     is something   uh   wrong .     he asked in alarm .      wrong .  i refer you to page     .  what in blazes do you mean by interpreting my work as you do .  where in the paper cited do i make the claim that the criminal personality is nonexistent and that it is the law enforcement agencies that are the true criminals .  here  let me quote           wait .  wait .     cried ninheimer  trying to find the page .     let me see .  let me see .  .  . good god .         well .         speidell  i don   t see how this could have happened .  i never wrote this .         but that   s what   s printed .  and that distortion isn   t the worst .  you look at page     and imagine what ipatiev is going to do to you when he sees the hash you   ve made of his findings .  look  ninheimer  the book is riddled with this sort of thing .  i don   t know what you were thinking of   but there   s nothing to do but get the book off the market .  and you   d better be prepared for extensive apologies at the next association meeting .         speidell  listen to me       but speidell had flashed off with a force that had the    plate glowing with after images for fifteen seconds .   it was then that ninheimer went through the book and began marking off passages with red ink .   he kept his temper remarkably well when he faced easy again  but his lips were pale .  he passed the book to easy and said     will you read the marked passages on pages               and     .      easy did so in four glances .     yes  professor ninheimer .         this is not as i had it in the original galleys .         no  sir .  it is not .         did you change it to read as it now does .         yes  sir .         why .         sir  the passages as they read in your version were most uncomplimentary to certain groups of human beings .  i felt it advisable to change the wording to avoid doing them harm .         how dared you do such a thing .         the first law  professor  does not let me  through any inaction  allow harm to come to human beings .  certainly  considering your reputation in the world of sociology and the wide circulation your book would receive among scholars  considerable harm would come to a number of the human beings you speak of .         but do you realize the harm that will come to me now .         it was necessary to choose the alternative with less harm .     professor ninheimer  shaking with fury  staggered away .  it was clear to him that u .  s .  robots would have to account to him for this .     there was some excitement at the defendants    table  which increased as prosecution drove the point home .      then robot ez    informed you that the reason for its action was based on the first law of robotics .         that is correct  sir .         that  in effect  it had no choice .         yes  sir .         it follows then that u .  s .  robots designed a robot that would of necessity rewrite books to accord with its own conceptions of what was right .  and yet they palmed it off as simple proofreader .  would you say that .      defense objected firmly at once  pointing out that the witness was being asked for a decision on a matter in which he had no competence .  the judged admonished prosecution in the usual terms  but there was no doubt that the exchange had sunk home   not least upon the attorney for the defense .   defense asked for a short recess before beginning cross examination  using a legal technicality for the purpose that got him five minutes .   he leaned over toward susan calvin .     is it possible  dr .  calvin  that professor ninheimer is telling the truth and that easy was motivated by the first law .      calvin pressed her lips together  then said     no .  it isn   t possible .  the last part of ninheimer   s testimony is deliberate perjury .  easy is not designed to be able to judge matters at the stage of abstraction represented by an advanced textbook on sociology .  it would never be able to tell that certain groups of humans would be harmed by a phrase in such a book .  its mind is simply not built for that .         i suppose  though  that we can   t prove this to a layman     said defense pessimistically .      no     admitted calvin .     the proof would be highly complex .  our way out is still what it was .  we must prove ninheimer is lying  and nothing he has said need change our plan of attack .         very well  dr .  calvin     said defense     i must accept your word in this .  we   ll go on as planned .      in the courtroom  the judge   s gavel rose and fell and dr .  ninheimer took the stand once more .  he smiled a little as one who feels his position to be impregnable and rather enjoys the prospect of countering a useless attack .   defense approached warily and began softly .     dr .  ninheimer  do you mean to say that you were completely unaware of these alleged changes in your manuscript until such time as dr .  speidell called you on the sixteenth of june .         that is correct  sir .         did you never look at the galleys after robot ez    had proofread them .         at first i did  but it seemed to me a useless task .  i relied on the claims of u .  s .  robots .  the absurd   uh   changes were made only in the last quarter of the book after the robot  i presume  had learned enough about sociology           never mind your presumptions .     said defense .     i understood your colleague  dr .  baker  saw the later galleys on at least one occasion .  do you remember testifying to that effect .         yes  sir .  as i said  he told me about seeing one page  and even there  the robot had changed a word .        again defense broke in .     don   t you find it strange  sir  that after over a year of implacable hostility to the robot  after having voted against it in the first place and having refused to put it to any use whatever  you suddenly decided to put your book  your magnum opus  into its hands .         i don   t find that strange .  i simply decided that i might as well use the machine .         and you were so confident of robot ez      all of a sudden   that you didn   t even bother to check your galleys .         i told you i was   uh   persuaded by u .  s .  robots    propaganda .         so persuaded that when your colleague  dr .  baker  attempted to check on the robot  you berated him soundly .         i didn   t berate him .  i merely did not wish to have him   uh   waste his time .  at least  i thought then it was a waste of time .  i did not see the significance of that change in a word at the        defense said with heavy sarcasm     i have no doubt you were instructed to bring up that point in order that the word change be entered in the record       he altered his line to forestall objection and said     the point is that you were extremely angry with dr .  baker .         no  sir .  not angry .         you didn   t give him a copy of your book when you received it .         simple forgetfulness .  i didn   t give the library its copy  either .      ninheimer smiled cautiously .     professors are notoriously absentminded .      defense said     do you find it strange that  after more than a year of perfect work  robot ez    should go wrong on your book .  on a book  that is  which was written by you  who was  of all people  the most implacably hostile to the robot .         my book was the only sizable work dealing with mankind that it had to face .  the three laws of robotics took hold then .         several times  dr .  ninheimer     said defense     you have tried to sound like an expert on robotics .  apparently you suddenly grew interested in robotics and took out books on the subject from the library .  you testified to that effect  did you not .         one book  sir .  that was the result of what seems to me to have been   uh   natural curiosity .         and it enabled you to explain why the robot should  as you allege  have distorted your book .         yes  sir .         very convenient .  but are you sure your interest in robotics was not intended to enable you to manipulate the robot for your own purposes .      ninheimer flushed .     certainly not  sir .     defense   s voice rose .     in fact  are you sure the alleged altered passages were not as you had them in the first place .      the sociologist half rose .     that   s   uh   uh   ridiculous .  i have the galleys        he had difficulty speaking and prosecution rose to insert smoothly     with your permission  your honor  i intend to introduce as evidence the set of galleys given by dr .  ninheimer to robot ez    and the set of galleys mailed by robot ez    to the publishers .  i will do so now if my esteemed colleague so desires  and will be willing to allow a recess in order that the two sets of galleys may be compared .        defense waved his hand impatiently .     that is not necessary .  my honored opponent can introduce those galleys whenever he chooses .  i   m sure they will show whatever discrepancies are claimed by the plaintiff to exist .  what i would like to know of the witness  however  is whether he also has in his possession dr .  baker   s galleys .         dr .  baker   s galleys .     ninheimer frowned .  he was not yet quite master of himself .      yes  professor .  i mean dr .  baker   s galleys .  you testified to the effect that dr .  baker had received a separate copy of the galleys .  i will have the clerk read your testimony if you are suddenly a selective type of amnesiac .  or is it just that professors are  as you say  notoriously absent minded .      ninheimer said     i remember dr .  baker   s galleys .  they weren   t necessary once the job was placed in the care of the proofreading machine           so you burned them .         no .  i put them in the waste basket .         burned them  dumped them   what   s the difference .  the point is you got rid of them .         there   s nothing wrong       began ninheimer weakly .      nothing wrong .     thundered defense .     nothing wrong except that there is now no way we can check to see if  on certain crucial galley sheets  you might not have substituted a harmless blank one from dr .  baker   s copy for a sheet in your own copy which you had deliberately mangled in such a way as to force the robot to        prosecution shouted a furious objection .  justice shane leaned forward  his round face doing its best to assume an expression of anger equivalent to the intensity of the emotion felt by the man .   the judge said     do you have any evidence  counselor  for the extraordinary statement you have just made .      defense said quietly     no direct evidence  your honor .  but i would like to point out that  viewed properly  the sudden conversion of the plaintiff from anti roboticism  his sudden interest in robotics  his refusal to check the galleys or to allow anyone else to check them  his careful neglect to allow anyone to see the book immediately after publication  all very clearly point           counselor     interrupted the judge impatiently     this is not the place for esoteric deductions .  the plaintiff is not on trial .  neither are you prosecuting him .  i forbid this line of attack and i can only point out that the desperation that must have induced you to do this cannot help but weaken your case .  if you have legitimate questions to ask  counselor  you may continue with your cross examination .  but i warn you against another such exhibition in this courtroom .         i have no further questions  your honor .      robertson whispered heatedly as counsel for the defense returned to his table     what good did that do  for god   s sake .  the judge is dead set against you now .      defense replied calmly     but ninheimer is good and rattled .  and we   ve set him up for tomorrow   s move .  he   ll be ripe .      susan calvin nodded gravely .     the rest of prosecution   s case was mild in comparison .  dr .  baker was called and bore out most of ninheimer   s testimony .  drs .  speidell and ipatiev were called  and they expounded most movingly on their shock and dismay at certain quoted passages in dr .  ninheimer   s book .  both gave their professional opinion that dr .  ninheimer   s professional reputation had been seriously impaired .   the galleys were introduced in evidence  as were copies of the finished book .   defense cross examined no more that day .  prosecution rested and the trial was recessed till the next morning .   defense made his first motion at the beginning of the proceedings on the second day .  he requested that robot ez    be admitted as a spectator to the proceedings .   prosecution objected at once and justice shane called both to the bench .   prosecution said hotly     this is obviously illegal .  a robot may not be in any edifice used by the general public .         this courtroom     pointed out defense     is closed to all but those having an immediate connection with the case .         a large machine of known erratic behavior would disturb my clients and my witnesses by its very presence .  it would make hash out of the proceedings .      the judge seemed inclined to agree .  he turned to defense and said rather unsympathetically     what are the reasons for your request .      defense said     it will be our contention that robot ez    could not possibly  by the nature of its construction  have behaved as it has been described as behaving .  it will be necessary to present a few demonstrations .      prosecution said     i don   t see the point  your honor .  demonstrations conducted by men employed at u .  s .  robots are worth little as evidence when u .  s .  robots is the defendant .         your honor     said defense     the validity of any evidence is for you to decide  not for the prosecuting attorney .  at least  that is my understanding .      justice shane  his prerogatives encroached upon  said     your understanding is correct .  nevertheless  the presence of a robot here does raise important legal questions .         surely  your honor  nothing that should be allowed to override the requirements of justice .  if the robot is not present  we are prevented from presenting our only defense .      the judge considered .     there would be the question of transporting the robot here .         that is a problem with which u .  s .  robots has frequently been faced .  we have a truck parked outside the courtroom  constructed according to the laws governing the transportation of robots .  robot ez    is in a packing case inside with two men guarding it .  the doors to the truck are properly secured and all other necessary precautions have been taken .         you seem certain     said justice shane  in renewed ill temper     that judgment on this point will be in your favor .         not at all  your honor .  if it is not  we simply turn the truck about .  i have made no presumptions concerning your decision .      the judge nodded .     the request on the part of the defense is granted .      the crate was carried in on a large dolly and the two men who handled it opened it .  the courtroom was immersed in a dead silence .     susan calvin waited as the thick slabs of celluform went down  then held out one hand .     come  easy .      the robot looked in her direction and held out its large metal arm .  it towered over her by two feet but followed meekly  like a child in the clasp of its mother .  someone giggled nervously and choked it off at a hard glare from dr .  calvin .   easy seated itself carefully in a large chair brought by the bailiff  which creaked but held .   defense said     when it becomes necessary  your honor  we will prove that this is actually robot ez     the specific robot in the employ of northeastern university during the period of time with which we are concerned .         good     his honor said .     that will be necessary .  i  for one  have no idea how you can tell one robot from another .         and now     said defense     i would like to call my first witness to the stand .  professor simon ninheimer  please .      the clerk hesitated  looked at the judge .  justice shane asked  with visible surprise     you are calling the plaintiff as your witness .         yes  your honor .         i hope that you   re aware that as long as he   s your witness  you will be allowed none of the latitude you might exercise if you were cross examining an opposing witness .      defense said smoothly     my only purpose in all this is to arrive at the truth .  it will not be necessary to do more than ask a few polite questions .         well     said the judge dubiously     you   re the one handling the case .  call the witness .      ninheimer took the stand and was informed that he was still under oath .  he looked more nervous than he had the day before  almost apprehensive .   but defense looked at him benignly .      now  professor ninheimer  you are suing my clients in the amount of          .         that is the   uh   sum .  yes .         that is a great deal of money .         i have suffered a great deal of harm .         surely not that much .  the material in question involves only a few passages in a book .  perhaps these were unfortunate passages  but after all  books sometimes appear with curious mistakes in them .      ninheimer   s nostrils flared .     sir  this book was to have been the climax of my professional career .  instead  it makes me look like an incompetent scholar  a perverter of the views held by my honored friends and associates  and a believer of ridiculous and   uh   outmoded viewpoints .  my reputation is irretrievably shattered .  i can never hold up my head in any   uh   assemblage of scholars  regardless of the outcome of this trial .  i certainly cannot continue in my career  which has been the whole of my life .  the very purpose of my life has been   uh   aborted and destroyed .      defense made no attempt to interrupt the speech  but stared abstractedly at his fingernails as it went on .   he said very soothingly     but surely  professor ninheimer  at your present age  you could not hope to earn more than   let us be generous    l o ooo during the remainder of your life .  yet you are asking the court to award you five times as much .        ninheimer said  with an even greater burst of emotion     it is not in my lifetime alone that i am ruined .  i do not know for how many generations i shall be pointed at by sociologists as a   uh   a fool or maniac .  my real achievements will be buried and ignored .  i am ruined not only until the day of my death  but for all time to come  because there will always be people who will not believe that a robot made those insertions        it was at this point that robot ez    rose to his feet .  susan calvin made no move to stop him .  she sat motionless  staring straight ahead .  defense sighed softly .   easy   s melodious voice carried clearly .  it said     i would like to explain to everyone that i did insert certain passages in the galley proofs that seemed directly opposed to what had been there at first        even the prosecuting attorney was too startled at the spectacle of a seven foot robot rising to address the court to be able to demand the stopping of what was obviously a most irregular procedure .   when he could collect his wits  it was too late .  for ninheimer rose in the witness chair  his face working .   he shouted wildly     damn you  you were instructed to keep your mouth shut about        he ground to a choking halt  and easy was silent  too .  prosecution was on his feet now  demanding that a mistrial be declared .   justice shane banged his gavel desperately .     silence .  silence .  certainly there is every reason here to declare a mistrial  except that in the interests of justice i would like to have professor ninheimer complete his statement .  i distinctly heard him say to the robot that the robot had been instructed to keep its mouth shut about something .  there was no mention in your testimony  professor ninheimer  as to any instructions to the robot to keep silent about anything .      ninheimer stared wordlessly at the judge .  justice shane said     did you instruct robot ez    to keep silent about something .  and if so  about what .         your honor       began ninheimer hoarsely  and couldn   t continue .   the judge   s voice grew sharp .     did you  in fact  order the inserts in question to be made in the galleys and then order the robot to keep quiet about your part in this .      prosecution objected vigorously  but ninheimer shouted     oh  what   s the use .  yes .  yes .    and he ran from the witness stand .  he was stopped at the door by the bailiff and sank hopelessly into one of the last rows of seats  head buried in both hands .   justice shane said     it is evident to me that robot ez    was brought here as a trick .  except for the fact that the trick served to prevent a serious miscarriage of justice  i would certainly hold attorney for the defense in contempt .  it is clear now  beyond any doubt  that the plaintiff has committed what is to me a completely inexplicable fraud since  apparently  he was knowingly ruining his career in the process        judgment  of course  was for the defendant .     dr .  susan calvin had herself announced at dr .  ninheimer   s bachelor quarters in university hall .  the young engineer who had driven the car offered to go up with her  but she looked at him scornfully .      do you think he   ll assault me .  wait down here .      ninheimer was in no mood to assault anyone .  he was packing  wasting no time  anxious to be away before the adverse conclusion of the trial became general knowledge .   he looked at calvin with a queerly defiant air and said     are you coming to warn me of a countersuit .  if so  it will get you nothing .  i have no money  no job  no future .  i can   t even meet the costs of the trial .         if you   re looking for sympathy     said calvin coldly     don   t look for it here .  this was your doing .  however  there will be no countersuit  neither of you nor of the university .  we will even do what we can to keep you from going to prison for perjury .  we aren   t vindictive .         oh  is that why i   m not already in custody for forswearing myself .  i had wondered .  but then     he added bitterly     why should you be vindictive .  you have what you want now .         some of what we want  yes     said calvin .     the university will keep easy in its employ at a considerably higher rental fee .  furthermore  certain underground publicity concerning the trial will make it possible to place a few more of the ez models in other institutions without danger of a repetition of this trouble .         then why have you come to see me .         because i don   t have all of what i want yet .  i want to know why you hate robots as you do .  even if you had won the case  your reputation would have been ruined .  the money you might have obtained could not have compensated for that .  would the satisfaction of your hatred for robots have done so .         are you interested in human minds  dr .  calvin .     asked ninheimer  with acid mockery .      insofar as their reactions concern the welfare of robots  yes .  for that reason  i have learned a little of human psychology .         enough of it to be able to trick met        that wasn   t hard     said calvin  without pomposity .     the difficult thing was doing it in such a way as not to damage easy .         it is like you to be more concerned for a machine than for a man .     he looked at her with savage contempt .   it left her unmoved .     it merely seems so  professor ninheimer .  it is only by being concerned for robots that one can truly be concerned for twenty first century man .  you would understand this if you were a roboticist .             i have read enough robotics to know i don   t want to be a roboticist .         pardon me  you have read a book on robotics .  it has taught you nothing .  you learned enough to know that you could order a robot to do many things  even to falsify a book  if you went about it properly .  you learned enough to know that you could not order him to forget something entirely without risking detection  but you thought you could order him into simple silence more safely .  you were wrong .         you guessed the truth from his silencer       it wasn   t guessing .  you were an amateur and didn   t know enough to cover your tracks completely .  my only problem was to prove the matter to the judge and you were kind enough to help us there  in your ignorance of the robotics you claim to despise .           is there any purpose in this discussion .     asked ninheimer wearily .      for me  yes     said susan calvin     because i want you to understand how completely you have misjudged robots .  you silenced easy by telling him that if he told anyone about your own distortion of the book  you would lose your job .  that set up a certain potential within easy toward silence  one that was strong enough to resist our efforts to break it down .  we would have damaged the brain if we had persisted .      on the witness stand  however  you yourself put up a higher counterpotential .  you said that because people would think that you  not a robot  had written the disputed passages in the book  you would lose far more than just your job .  you would lose your reputation  your standing  your respect  your reason for living .  you would lose the memory of you after death .  a new and higher potential was set up by you   and easy talked .         oh  god     said ninheimer  turning his head away .  calvin was inexorable .  she said     do you understand why he talked .  it was not to accuse you  but to defend you .  it can be mathematically shown that he was about to assume full blame for your crime  to deny that you had anything to do with it .  the first law required that .  he was going to lie   to damage himself   to bring monetary harm to a corporation .  all that meant less to him than did the saving of you .  if you really understood robots and robotics  you would have let him talk .  but you did not understand  as i was sure you wouldn   t  as i guaranteed to the defense attorney that you wouldn   t .  you were certain  in your hatred of robots  that easy would act as a human being would act and defend itself at your expense .  so you flared out at him in panic   and destroyed yourself .      ninheimer said with feeling     i hope some day your robots turn on you and kill you .         don   t be foolish     said calvin .     now i want you to explain why you   ve done all this .      ninheimer grinned a distorted  humorless grin .     i am to dissect my mind  am i  for your intellectual curiosity  in return for immunity from a charge of perjury .         put it that way if you like     said calvin emotionlessly .     but explain .         so that you can counter future anti robot attempts more efficiently .  with greater understanding .         i accept that .         you know     said ninheimer     i   ll tell you   just to watch it do you no good at all .  you can   t understand human motivation .  you can only understand your damned machines because you   re a machine yourself  with skin on .        he was breathing hard and there was no hesitation in his speech  no searching for precision .  it was as though he had no further use for precision .   he said     for two hundred and fifty years  the machine has been replacing man and destroying the handcraftsman .  pottery is spewed out of molds and presses .  works of art have been replaced by identical gimcracks stamped out on a die .  call it progress  if you wish .  the artist is restricted to abstractions  confined to the world of ideas .  he must design something in mind   and then the machine does the rest .      do you suppose the potter is content with mental creation .  do you suppose the idea is enough .  that there is nothing in the feel of the clay itself  in watching the thing grow as hand and mind work together .  do you suppose the actual growth doesn   t act as a feedback to modify and improve the idea .         you are not a potter     said dr .  calvin .     i am a creative artist .  i design and build articles and books .  there is more to it than the mere thinking of words and of putting them in the right order .  if that were all  there would be no pleasure in it  no return .      a book should take shape in the hands of the writer .  one must actually see the chapters grow and develop .  one must work and rework and watch the changes take place beyond the original concept even .  there is taking the galleys in hand and seeing how the sentences look in print and molding them again .  there are a hundred contacts between a man and his work at every stage of the game and the contact itself is pleasurable and repays a man for the work he puts into his creation more than anything else could .  your robot would take all that away .         so does a typewriter .  so does a printing press .  do you propose to return to the hand illumination of manuscripts .         typewriters and printing presses take away some  but your robot would deprive us of all .  your robot takes over the galleys .  soon it  or other robots  would take over the original writing  the searching of the sources  the checking and cross checking of passages  perhaps even the deduction of conclusions .  what would that leave the scholar .  one thing only   the barren decisions concerning what orders to give the robot next .  i want to save the future generations of the world of scholarship from such a final hell .  that meant more to me than even my own reputation and so i set out to destroy u .  s .  robots by whatever means .         you were bound to fail     said susan calvin .     i was bound to try     said simon ninheimer .  calvin turned and left .  she did her best to feel no pang of sympathy for the broken man .   she did not entirely succeed .       christmas without rodney    it all started with gracie  my wife of nearly forty years  wanting to give rodney time off for the holiday season and it ended with me in an absolutely impossible situation .  i   ll tell you about it if you don   t mind because i   ve got to tell somebody .  naturally  i   m changing names and details for our own protection .   it was just a couple of months ago  mid december  and gracie said to me     why don   t we give rodney time off for the holiday season .  why shouldn   t he celebrate christmas  too .      i remember i had my optics unfocused at the time  there   s a certain amount of relief in letting things go hazy when you want to rest or just listen to music  but i focused them quickly to see if gracie were smiling or had a twinkle in her eye .  not that she has much of a sense of humor  you understand .   she wasn   t smiling .  no twinkle .  i said     why on earth should we give him time off .         why not .         do you want to give the freezer a vacation  the sterilizer  the holoviewer .  shall we just turn off the power supply .         come  howard     she said .     rodney isn   t a freezer or a sterilizer .  he   s a person .         he   s not a person .  he   s a robot .  he wouldn   t want a vacation .         how do you know .  and he   s a person .  he deserves a chance to rest and just revel in the holiday atmosphere .      i wasn   t going to argue that    person    thing with her .  i know you   ve all read those polls which show that women are three times as likely to resent and fear robots as men are .  perhaps that   s because robots tend to do what was once called  in the bad old days     women   s work    and women fear being made useless  though i should think they   d be delighted .  in any case  gracie is delighted and she simply adores rodney .   that   s her word for it .  every other day she says     i just adore rodney .       you   ve got to understand that rodney is an old fashioned robot whom we   ve had about seven years .  he   s been adjusted to fit in with our old fashioned house and our old fashioned ways and i   m rather pleased with him myself .  sometimes i wonder about getting one of those slick  modern jobs  which are automated to death  like the one our son  delancey  has  but gracie would never stand for it .   but then i thought of delancey and i said     how are we going to give rodney time off  gracie .  delancey is coming in with that gorgeous wife of his     i was using    gorgeous    in a sarcastic sense  but gracie didn   t notice   it   s amazing how she insists on seeing a good side even when it doesn   t exist     and how are we going to have the house in good shape and meals made and all the rest of it without rodney .         but that   s just it     she said  earnestly .     delancey and hortense could bring their robot and he could do it all .  you know they don   t think much of rodney  and they   d love to show what theirs can do and rodney can have a rest .      i grunted and said     if it will make you happy  i suppose we can do it .  it   ll only be for three days .  but i don   t want rodney thinking he   ll get every holiday off .      it was another joke  of course  but gracie just said  very earnestly     no  howard  i will talk to him and explain it   s only just once in a while .      she can   t quite understand that rodney is controlled by the three laws of robotics and that nothing has to be explained to him .   so i had to wait for delancey and hortense  and my heart was heavy .  delancey is my son  of course  but he   s one of your upwardly mobile  bottom line individuals .  he married hortense because she has excellent connections in business and can help him in that upward shove .  at least  i hope so  because if she has another virtue i have never discovered it .   they showed up with their robot two days before christmas .  the robot was as glitzy as hortense and looked almost as hard .  he was polished to a high gloss and there was none of rodney   s clumping .  hortense   s robot  i   m sure she dictated the design  moved absolutely silently .  he kept showing up behind me for no reason and giving me heart failure every time i turned around and bumped into him .   worse  delancey brought eight year old leroy .  now he   s my grandson  and i would swear to hortense   s fidelity because i   m sure no one would voluntarily touch her  but i   ve got to admit that putting him through a concrete mixer would improve him no end .   he came in demanding to know if we had sent rodney to the metal reclamation unit yet .   he called it the    bust up place .      hortense sniffed and said     since we have a modern robot with us  i hope you keep rodney out of sight .      i said nothing  but gracie said     certainly  dear .  in fact  we   ve given rodney time off .      delancey made a face but didn   t say anything .  he knew his mother .   i said  pacifically     suppose we start off by having rambo make something good to drink  eh .  coffee  tea  hot chocolate  a bit of brandy        rambo was their robot   s name .  i don   t know why except that it starts with r .  there   s no law about it  but you   ve probably noticed for yourself that almost every robot has a name beginning with r .  r for robot  i suppose .  the usual name is robert .  there must be a million robot roberts in the northeast corridor alone .   and frankly  it   s my opinion that   s the reason human names just don   t start with r any more .  you get bob and dick but not robert or richard .  you get posy and trudy  but not rose or ruth .  sometimes you get unusual r   s .  i know of three robots called rutabaga  and two that are rameses .  but hortense is the only one i know who named a robot rambo  a syllable combination i   ve never encountered  and i   ve never liked to ask why .  i was sure the explanation would prove to be unpleasant .   rambo turned out to be useless at once .  he was  of course  programmed for the delancey hortense menage and that was utterly modern and utterly automated .  to prepare drinks in his own home  all rambo had to do was to press appropriate buttons .   why anyone would need a robot to press buttons  i would like to have explained to me .    he said so .  he turned to hortense and said in a voice like honey  it wasn   t rodney   s city boy voice with its trace of brooklyn      the equipment is lacking  madam .      and hortense drew a sharp breath .     you mean you still don   t have a robotized kitchen  grandfather .      she called me nothing at all  until leroy was born  howling of course  and then she promptly called me    grandfather .     naturally  she never called me howard .  that would tend to show me to be human  or  more unlikely  show her to be human .    i said     well  it   s robotized when rodney is in it .         i dare say     she said .     but we   re not living in the twentieth century  grandfather .      i thought  how i wish we were   but i just said     well  why not program rambo how to operate our controls .  i   m sure he can pour and mix and heat and do whatever else is necessary .         i   m sure he can     said hortense     but thank fate he doesn   t have to .  i   m not going to interfere with his programming .  it will make him less efficient .      gracie said  worried  but amiable     but if we don   t interfere with his programming  then i   ll just have to instruct him  step by step  but i don   t know how it   s done .  i   ve never done it .      i said     rodney can tell him .      gracie said     oh  howard  we   ve given rodney a vacation .         i know  but we   re not going to ask him to do anything  just tell rambo here what to do and then rambo can do it .      whereupon rambo said stiffly     madam  there is nothing in my programming or in my instructions that would make it mandatory for me to accept orders given me by another robot  especially one that is an earlier model .      hortense said  soothingly     of course  rambo .  i   m sure that grandfather and grandmother understand that .      i noticed that delancey never said a word .  i wonder if he ever said a word when his dear wife was present .    i said     all right  i tell you what .  i   ll have rodney tell me  and then i will tell rambo .      rambo said nothing to that .  even rambo is subject to the second law of robotics which makes it mandatory for him to obey human orders .   hortense   s eyes narrowed and i knew that she would like to tell me that rambo was far too fine a robot to be ordered about by the likes of me  but some distant and rudimentary near human waft of feeling kept her from doing so .   little leroy was hampered by no such quasi human restraints .  he said     i don   t want to have to look at rodney   s ugly puss .  i bet he don   t know how to do anything and if he does  ol    grampa would get it all wrong anyway .      it would have been nice  i thought  if i could be alone with little leroy for five minutes and reason calmly with him  with a brick  but a mother   s instinct told hortense never to leave leroy alone with any human being whatever .   there was nothing to do  really  but get rodney out of his niche in the closet where he had been enjoying his own thoughts  i wonder if a robot has his own thoughts when he is alone  and put him to work .  it was hard .  he would say a phrase  then i would say the same phrase  then rambo would do something  then rodney would say another phrase and so on .   it all took twice as long as if rodney were doing it himself and it wore me out  i can tell you  because everything had to be like that  using the dishwasher sterilizer  cooking the christmas feast  cleaning up messes on the table or on the floor  everything .   gracie kept moaning that rodney   s vacation was being ruined  but she never seemed to notice that mine was  too  though i did admire hortense for her manner of saying something unpleasant at every moment that some statement seemed called for .  i noticed  particularly  that she never repeated herself once .  anyone can be nasty  but to be unfailingly creative in one   s nastiness filled me with a perverse desire to applaud now and then .   but  really  the worst thing of all came on christmas eve .  the tree had been put up and i was exhausted .  we didn   t have the kind of situation in which an automated box of ornaments was plugged into an electronic tree  and at the touch of one button there would result an instantaneous and perfect distribution of ornaments .  on our tree  of ordinary  old fashioned plastic  the ornaments had to be placed  one by one  by hand .   hortense looked revolted  but i said      actually  hortense  this means you can be creative and make your own arrangement .      hortense sniffed  rather like the scrape of claws on a rough plaster wall  and left the room with an obvious expression of nausea on her face .  i bowed in the direction of her retreating back  glad to see her go  and then began the tedious task of listening to rodney   s instructions and passing them on to rambo .       when it was over  i decided to rest my aching feet and mind by sitting in a chair in a far and rather dim corner of the room .  i had hardly folded my aching body into the chair when little leroy entered .  he didn   t see me  i suppose  or  then again  he might simply have ignored me as being part of the less important and interesting pieces of furniture in the room .   he cast a disdainful look on the tree and said  to rambo     listen  where are the christmas presents .  i   ll bet old gramps and gram got me lousy ones  but i ain   t going to wait for no tomorrow morning .      rambo said     i do not know where they are  little master .         huh .     said leroy  turning to rodney .     how about you  stink face .  do you know where the presents are .      rodney would have been within the bounds of his programming to have refused to answer on the grounds that he did not know he was being addressed  since his name was rodney and not stink face .  i   m quite certain that that would have been rambo   s attitude .  rodney  however  was of different stuff .  he answered politely     yes  i do  little master .         so where is it  you old puke .      rodney said     i don   t think it would be wise to tell you  little master .  that would disappoint gracie and howard who would like to give the presents to you tomorrow morning .         listen     said little leroy     who you think you   re talking to  you dumb robot .  now i gave you an order .  you bring those presents to me .     and in an attempt to show rodney who was master  he kicked the robot in the shin .   it was a mistake .  i saw it would be that a second before and that was a joyous second .  little leroy  after all  was ready for bed  though i doubted that he ever went to bed before he was good and ready  .  therefore  he was wearing slippers .  what   s more  the slipper sailed off the foot with which he kicked  so that he ended by slamming his bare toes hard against the solid chrome steel of the robotic shin .   he fell to the floor howling and in rushed his mother .     what is it  leroy .  what is it .      whereupon little leroy had the immortal gall to say     he hit me .  that old monster robot hit me .      hortense screamed .  she saw me and shouted     that robot of yours must be destroyed .      i said     come  hortense .  a robot can   t hit a boy .  first law of robotics prevents it .         it   s an old robot  a broken robot .  leroy says           leroy lies .  there is no robot  no matter how old or how broken  who could hit a boy .         then he did it .  grampa did it     howled leroy .      i wish i did     i said  quietly     but no robot would have allowed me to .  ask your own .  ask rambo if he would have remained motionless while either rodney or i had hit your boy .  rambo .      i put it in the imperative  and rambo said     i would not have allowed any harm to come to the little master  madam  but i did not know what he purposed .  he kicked rodney   s shin with his bare foot  madam .      hortense gasped and her eyes bulged in fury .     then he had a good reason to do so .  i   ll still have your robot destroyed .         go ahead  hortense .  unless you   re wining to ruin your robot   s efficiency by trying to reprogram him to lie  he win bear witness to just what preceded the kick and so  of course  with pleasure  win i .      hortense left the next morning  carrying the pale faced leroy with her  it turned out he had broken a toe   nothing he didn   t deserve  and an endlessly wordless delancey .   gracie wrung her hands and implored them to stay  but i watched them leave without emotion .  no  that   s a lie .  i watched them leave with lots of emotion  an pleasant .   later  i said to rodney  when gracie was not present     i   m sorry  rodney .  that was a horrible christmas  an because we tried to have it without you .  we   ll never do that again  i promise .         thank you  sir     said rodney .     i must admit that there were times these two days when i earnestly wished the laws of robotics did not exist .      i grinned and nodded my head  but that night i woke up out of a sound sleep and began to worry .  i   ve been worrying ever since .   i admit that rodney was greatly tried  but a robot can   t wish the laws of robotics did not exist .  he can   t  no matter what the circumstances .   if i report this  rodney will undoubtedly be scrapped  and if we   re issued a new robot as recompense  gracie will simply never forgive me .  never .  no robot  however new  however talented  can possibly replace rodney in her affection .   in fact  i   ll never forgive myself .  quite apart from my own liking for rodney  i couldn   t bear to give hortense the satisfaction .   but if i do nothing  i live with a robot capable of wishing the laws of robotics did not exist .  from wishing they did not exist to acting as if they did not exist is just a step .  at what moment will he take that step and in what form will he show that he has done so .   what do i do .  what do i do .       robots i have known    mechanical men  or  to use capek   s now universally accepted term  robots  are a subject to which the modern science fiction writer has turned again and again .  there is no uninvented invention  with the possible exception of the spaceship  that is so clearly pictured in the minds of so many  a sinister form  large  metallic  vaguely human  moving like a machine and speaking with no emotion .   the key word in the description is    sinister    and therein lies a tragedy  for no science fiction theme wore out its welcome as quickly as did the robot .  only one robot plot seemed available to the average author  the mechanical man that proved a menace  the creature that turned against its creator  the robot that became a threat to humanity .  and almost all stories of this sort were heavily surcharged  either explicitly or implicitly  with the weary moral that    there are some things mankind must never seek to learn .      this sad situation has  since       been largely ameliorated .  stories about robots abound  a newer viewpoint  more mechanistic and less moralistic  has developed .  for this development  some people  notably mr .  groff conklin in the introduction to his science fiction anthology entitled    science fiction thinking machines     published in       have seen fit to attach at least partial credit to a series of robot stories i wrote beginning in      .  since there is probably no one on earth less given to false modesty than myself  i accept said partial credit with equanimity and ease  modifying it only to include mr .  john w .  campbell  jr .   editor of     astounding science fiction     with whom i had many fruitful discussions on robot stories .   my own viewpoint was that robots were story material  not as blasphemous imitations of life  but merely as advanced machines .  a machine does not    turn against its creator    if it is properly designed .  when a machine  such as a power saw  seems to do so by occasionally lopping off a limb  this regrettable tendency towards evil is combated by the installation of safety devices .  analogous safety devices would  it seemed obvious  be developed in the case of robots .  and the most logical place for such safety devices would seem to be in the circuit patterns of the robotic    brain .      let me pause to explain that in science fiction  we do not quarrel intensively concerning the actual engineering of the robotic    brain .     some mechanical device is assumed which in a volume that approximates that of the human brain must contain all the circuits necessary to allow the robot a range of perception and response reasonably equivalent to that of a human being .  how that can be done without the use of mechanical units the size of a protein molecule or  at the very least  the size of a brain cell  is not explained .  some authors may talk about transistors and printed circuits .  most say nothing at all .  my own pet trick is to refer  somewhat mystically  to    positronic brains     leaving it to the ingenuity of the reader to decide what positrons have to do with it and to his good will to continue reading after having failed to reach a decision .   in any case  as i wrote my series of robot stories  the safety devices gradually crystallized in my mind as    the three laws of robotics .      these three laws were first explicitly stated in    runaround .      as finally perfected  the three laws read as follows .     first law   a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   second law   a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .   third law   a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     these laws are firmly built into the robotic brain  or at least the circuit equivalents are .  naturally  i don   t describe the circuit equivalents .  in fact  i never discuss the engineering of the robots for the very good reason that i am colossally ignorant of the practical aspects of robotics .   the first law  as you can readily see  immediately eliminates that old  tired plot which i will not offend you by referring to any further .   although  at first flush  it may appear that to set up such restrictive rules must hamper the creative imagination  it has turned out that the laws of robotics have served as a rich source of plot material .  they have proved anything but a mental road block .   an example would be the story    runaround    to which i have already referred .  the robot in that story  an expensive and experimental model  is designed for operation on the sunside of the planet mercury .  the third law has been built into him more strongly than usual for obvious economic reasons .  he has been sent out by his human employers  as the story begins  to obtain some liquid selenium for some vital and necessary repairs .   liquid selenium lies about in puddles in the heat of mercury   s sunward side  i will ask you to believe .    unfortunately  the robot was given his order casually so that the second law circuit set up was weaker than usual .  still more unfortunately  the selenium pool to which the robot was sent was near a site of volcanic activity  as a result of which there were sizable concentrations of carbon monoxide in the area .  at the temperature of mercury   s sunside  i surmised that carbon monoxide would react fairly quickly with iron to form volatile iron carbonyls so that the robot   s more delicate joints might be badly damaged .  the further the robot penetrates into this area  the greater the danger to his existence and the more intensive is the third law effect driving him away .  the second law  however  ordinarily the superior  drives him onward .  at a certain point  the unusually weak second law potential and the unusually strong third law potential reach a balance and the robot can neither advance nor retreat .  he can only circle the selenium pool on the equipotential locus that makes a rough circle about the site .   meanwhile  our heroes must have the selenium .  they chase after the robot in special suits  discover the problem and wonder how to correct it .  after several failures  the correct answer is hit upon .  one of the men deliberately exposes himself to mercury   s sun in such a way that unless the robot rescues him  he will surely die .  that brings the first law into operation  which being superior to both second and third  pulls the robot out of his useless orbit and brings on the necessary happy ending .   it is in the story    runaround     by the way  that i believe i first made use of the term    robotics     implicitly defined as the science of robot design  construction  maintenance  etc  .  years later  i was told that i had invented the term and that it had never seen publication before .  i do not know whether this is true .  if it is true  i am happy  because i think it is a logical and useful word  and i hereby donate it to real workers in the field with all good will .   none of my other robot stories spring so immediately out of the three laws as does    runaround    but all are born of the laws in some way .  there is the story  for instance  of the mind reading robot who was forced to lie because he was unable to tell any human being anything other than that which the human in question wished to hear .  the truth  you see  would almost invariably cause    harm    to the human being in the form of disappointment  disillusion  embarrassment  chagrin and other similar emotions  all of which were but too plainly visible to the robot .   then there was the puzzle of the man who was suspected of being a robot  that is  of having a quasi protoplasmic body and a robot   s    positronic brain .     one way of proving his humanity would be for him to break the first law in public  so he obliges by deliberately striking a man .  but the story ends in doubt because there is still the suspicion that the other    man    might also be a robot and there is nothing in the three laws that would prevent a robot from hitting another robot .   and then we have the ultimate robots  models so advanced that they are used to precalculate such things as weather  crop harvests  industrial production figures  political developments and so on .  this is done in order that world economy may be less subject to the whims of those factors which are now beyond man   s control .  but these ultimate robots  it seems  are still subject to the first law .  they cannot through inaction allow human beings to come to harm  so they deliberately give answers which are not necessarily truthful and which cause localized economic upsets so designed as to maneuver mankind along the road that leads to peace and prosperity .  so the robots finally win the mastery after all  but only for the good of man .   the interrelationship of man and robot is not to be neglected .  mankind may know of the existence of the three laws on an intellectual level and yet have an ineradicable fear and distrust for robots on an emotional level .  if you wanted to invent a term  you might call it a    frankenstein complex .     there is also the more practical matter of the opposition of labor unions  for instance  to the possible replacement of human labor by robot labor .   this  too  can give rise to stories .  my first robot story concerned a robot nursemaid and a child .  the child adored its robot as might be expected  but the mother feared it  as might also be expected .  the nub of the story lay in the mother   s attempt to get rid of it and in the child   s reaction to that .   my first full length robot novel     the caves of steel            peers further into the future  and is laid in a time when other planets  populated by emigrating earthmen  have adopted a thoroughly robotized economy  but where earth itself  for economic and emotional reasons  still objects to the introduction of the metal creatures .  a murder is committed  with robot hatred as the motive .  it is solved by a pair of detectives  one a man  one a robot  with a great portion of the deductive reasoning  to which detective stories are prone  revolving about the three laws and their implications .   i have managed to convince myself that the three laws are both necessary and sufficient for human safety in regard to robots .  it is my sincere belief that some day when advanced human like robots are indeed built  something very like the three laws will be built into them .  i would enjoy being a prophet in this respect  and i regret only the fact that the matter probably cannot be arranged in my lifetime .        this essay was written in      .  in the years since     robotics    has indeed entered the english language and is universally used  and i have lived to see roboticists taking the three laws very seriously .     the new teachers    the percentage of older people in the world is increasing and that of younger people decreasing  and this trend will continue if the birthrate should drop and medicine continue to extend the average life span .   in order to keep older people imaginative and creative and to prevent them from becoming an ever growing drag on a shrinking pool of creative young  i have recommended frequently that our educational system be remodeled and that education be considered a lifelong activity .   but how can this be done .  where will an the teachers come from .   who says  however  that an teachers must be human beings or even animate .   suppose that over the next century communications satellites become numerous and more sophisticated than those we   ve placed in space so far .  suppose that in place of radio waves the more capacious laser beam of visible light becomes the chief communications medium .   under these circumstances  there would be room for many minions of separate channels for voice and picture  and it is easy to imagine every human being on earth having a particular television wavelength assigned to her or him .   each person  child  adult  or elderly  can have his own private outlet to which could be attached  at certain desirable periods of time  his or her personal teaching machine .  it would be a far more versatile and interactive teaching machine than anything we could put together now  for computer technology will also have advanced in the interval .   we can reasonably hope that the teaching machine will be sufficiently intricate and flexible to be capable of modifying its own program  that is     learning     as a result of the student   s input .   in other words  the student will ask questions  answer questions  make statements  offer opinions  and from all of this  the machine will be able to gauge the student well enough to adjust the speed and intensity of its course of instruction and  what   s more  shift it in the direction of the student interest displayed .   we can   t imagine a personal teaching machine to be very big  however .  it might resemble a television set in size and appearance .  can so small an object contain enough information to teach the students as much as they want to know  in any direction intellectual curiosity may lead them .  no  not if the teaching machine is self contained   but need it be .   in any civilization with computer science so advanced as to make teaching machines possible  there will surely be thoroughly computerized central libraries .  such libraries may even be interconnected into a single planetary library .   all teaching machines would be plugged into this planetary library and each could then have at its disposal any book  periodical  document  recording  or video cassette encoded there .  if the machine has it  the student would have it too  either placed directly on a viewing screen  or reproduced in print on paper for more leisurely study .   of course  human teachers will not be totally eliminated .  in some subjects  human interaction is essential   athletics  drama  public speaking  and so on .  there is also value  and interest  in groups of students working in a particular field   getting together to discuss and speculate with each other and with human experts  sparking each other to new insights .   after this human interchange they may return  with some relief  to the endlessly knowledgeable  endlessly flexible  and  most of all  endlessly patient machines .   but who will teach the teaching machines .   surely the students who learn will also teach .  students who learn freely in those fields and activities that interest them are bound to think  speculate  observe  experiment  and  now and then  come up with something of their own that may not have been previously known .   they would transmit that knowledge back to the machines  which will in turn record it  with due credit  presumably  in the planetary library   thus making it available to other teaching machines .  all will be put back into the central hopper to serve as a new and higher starting point for those who come after  the teaching machines will thus make it possible for the human species to race forward to heights and in directions now impossible to foresee .   but i am describing only the mechanics of learning .  what of the content .  what subjects will people study in the age of the teaching machine .  i   ll speculate on that in the next essay .     whatever you wish    the difficulty in deciding on what the professions of the future would be is that it all depends on the kind of future we choose to have .  if we allow our civilization to be destroyed  the only profession of the future will be scrounging for survival  and few will succeed at it .   suppose  though  that we keep our civilization alive and flourishing and  therefore  that technology continues to advance .  it seems logical that the professions of such a future would include computer programming  lunar mining  fusion engineering  space construction  laser communications  neurophysiology  and so on .   i can   t help but think  however  that the advance of computerization and automation is going to wipe out the subwork of humanity   the dull pushing and shoving and punching and clicking and filing and all the other simple and repetitive motions  both physical and mental  that can be done perfectly easily   and better   by machines no more complicated than those we can already build .   in short  the world could be so well run that only a relative handful of human    foremen    would be needed to engage in the various professions and supervisory work necessary to keep the world   s population fed  housed  and cared for .   what about the majority of the human species in this automated future .  what about those who don   t have the ability or the desire to work at the professions of the future    or for whom there is no room in those professions .  it may be that most people will have nothing to do of what we think of as work nowadays .   this could be a frightening thought .  what will people do without work .  won   t they sit around and be bored  or worse  become unstable or even vicious .  the saying is that satan finds mischief still for idle hands to do .   but we judge from the situation that has existed till now  a situation in which people are left to themselves to rot .   consider that there have been times in history when an aristocracy lived in idleness off the backs of flesh and blood machines called slaves or serfs or peasants .  when such a situation was combined with a high culture  however  aristocrats used their leisure to become educated in literature  the arts  and philosophy .  such studies were not useful for work  but they occupied the mind  made for interesting conversation and an enjoyable life .   these were the liberal arts  arts for free men who didn   t have to work with their hands .  and these were considered higher and more satisfying than the mechanical arts  which were rarely materially useful .   perhaps  then  the future will see a world aristocracy supported by the only slaves that can humanely serve in such a post sophisticated machines .  and there will be an infinitely newer and broader liberal arts program  taught by the teaching machines  from which each person could choose .   some might choose computer technology or fusion engineering or lunar mining or any of the professions that would seem vital to the proper functioning of the world .  why not .  such professions  placing demands on human imagination and skill  would be very attractive to many  and there will surely be enough who will be voluntarily drawn to these occupations to fill them adequately .   but to most people the field of choice might be far less cosmic .  it might be stamp collecting  pottery  ornamental painting  cooking  dramatics  or whatever .  every field will be an elective  and the only guide will be    whatever you wish .      each person  guided by teaching machines sophisticated enough to offer a wide sampling of human activities  can then choose what he or she can best and most willingly do .   is the individual person wise enough to know what he or she can best do .     why not .  who else can know .  and what can a person do best except that which he or she wants to do most .   won   t people choose to do nothing .  sleep their lives away .   if that   s what they want  why not .    except that i have a feeling they won   t .  doing nothing is hard work  and  it seems to me  would be indulged in only by those who have never had the opportunity to evolve out of themselves something more interesting and  therefore  easier to do .   in a properly automated and educated world  then  machines may prove to be the true humanizing influence .  it may be that machines will do the work that makes life possible and that human beings will do all the other things that make life pleasant and worthwhile .     the friends we make    the term    robot    dates back only sixty years .  it was invented by the czech playwright  karel capek  in his play  r .  u .  r .   and is a czech word meaning worker .   the idea  however  is far older .  it is as old as man   s longing for a servant as smart as a human being  but far stronger  and incapable of growing weary  bored  or dissatisfied .  in the greek myths  the god of the forge  hephaistos  had two golden girls   as bright and alive as flesh and blood girls   to help him .  and the island of crete was guarded  in the myths  by a bronze giant named talos  who circled its shores perpetually and tirelessly  watching for intruders .   are robots possible  though .  and if they are  are they desirable .   mechanical devices with gears and springs and ratchets could certainly make manlike devices perform manlike actions  but the essence of a successful robot is to have it think   and think well enough to perform useful functions without being continually supervised .   but thinking takes a brain .  the human being is made up of microscopic neurons  each of which has an extraordinarily complex substructure .  there are    billion neurons in the brain and    billion supporting cells  all hooked together in a very intricate pattern .  how can anything like that be duplicated by some man made device in a robot .   it wasn   t until the invention of the electronic computer thirty five years ago that such a thing became conceivable .  since its birth  the electronic computer has grown ever more compact  and each year it becomes possible to pack more and more information into less and less volume .   in a few decades  might not enough versatility to direct a robot be packed into a volume the size of the human brain .  such a computer would not have to be as advanced as the human brain  but only advanced enough to guide the actions of a robot designed  let us say  to vacuum rugs  to run a hydraulic press  to survey the lunar surface .   a robot would  of course  have to include a self contained energy source  we couldn   t expect it to be forever plugged into a wall socket .  this  however  can be handled .  a battery that needs periodic charging is not so different from a living body that needs periodic feeding .   but why bother with a humanoid shape .  would it not be more sensible to devise a specialized machine to perform a particular task without asking it to take on all the inefficiencies involved in arms  legs  and torso .  suppose you design a robot that can hold a finger in a furnace to test its temperature and turn the heating unit on and off to maintain that temperature nearly constant .  surely a simple thermostat made of a bimetallic strip will do the job as well .   consider  though  that over the thousands of years of man   s civilization  we have built a technology geared to the human shape .  products for humans    use are designed in size and form to accommodate the human body   how it bends and how long  wide  and heavy the various bending parts are .  machines are designed to fit the human reach and the width and position of human fingers .   we have only to consider the problems of human beings who happen to be a little taller or shorter than the norm   or even just left handed   to see how important it is to have a good fit into our technology .   if we want a directing device then  one that can make use of human tools and machines  and that can fit into the technology  we would find it useful to make that device in the human shape  with all the bends and turns of which the human body is capable .  nor would we want it to be too heavy or too abnormally proportioned .  average in all respects would be best .   then too  we relate to all nonhuman things by finding  or inventing  something human about them .  we attribute human characteristics to our pets  and even to our automobiles .  we personify nature and all the products of nature and  in earlier times  made human shaped gods and goddesses out of them .   surely  if we are to take on thinking partners   or  at the least  thinking servants   in the form of machines  we will be more comfortable with them  and we will relate to them more easily  if they are shaped like humans .   it will be easier to be friends with human shaped robots than with specialized machines of unrecognizable shape .  and i sometimes think that  in the desperate straits of humanity today  we would be grateful to have nonhuman friends  even if they are only friends we build ourselves .     our intelligent tools    robots don   t have to be very intelligent to be intelligent enough .  if a robot can follow simple orders and do the housework  or run simple machines in a cut and dried  repetitive way  we would be perfectly satisfied .   constructing a robot is hard because you must fit a very compact computer inside its skull  if it is to have a vaguely human shape .  making a sufficiently complex computer as compact as the human brain is also hard .   but robots aside  why bother making a computer that compact .  the units that make up a computer have been getting smaller and smaller  to be sure   from vacuum tubes to transistors to tiny integrated circuits and silicon chips .  suppose that  in addition to making the units smaller  we also make the whole structure bigger .   a brain that gets too large would eventually begin to lose efficiency because nerve impulses don   t travel very quickly .  even the speediest nerve impulses travel at only about   .    miles a minute .  a nerve impulse can flash from one end of the brain to the other in one four hundred fortieth of a second  but a brain   miles long  if we could imagine one  would require   .   minutes for a nerve impulse to travel its length .  the added complexity made possible by the enormous size would fall apart simply because of the long wait for information to be moved and processed within it .   computers  however  use electric impulses that travel at more than    million miles per minute .  a computer     miles wide would still flash electric impulses from end to end in about one four hundred fortieth of a second .  in that respect  at least  a computer of that asteroidal size could still process information as quickly as the human brain could .   if  therefore  we imagine computers being manufactured with finer and finer components  more and more intricately interrelated  and also imagine those same computers becoming larger and larger  might it not be that the computers would eventually become capable of doing all the things a human brain can do .   is there a theoretical limit to how intelligent a computer can become .   i   ve never heard of any .  it seems to me that each time we learn to pack more complexity into a given volume  the computer can do more .  each time we make a computer larger  while keeping each portion as densely complex as before  the computer can do more .   eventually  if we learn how to make a computer sufficiently complex and sufficiently large  why should it not achieve a human intelligence .   some people are sure to be disbelieving and say     but how can a computer possibly produce a great symphony  a great work of art  a great new scientific theory .      the retort i am usually tempted to make to this question is     can you .     but  of course  even if the questioner is ordinary  there are extraordinary people who are geniuses .  they attain genius  however  only because atoms and molecules within their brains are arranged in some complex order .  there   s nothing in their brains but atoms and molecules .  if we arrange atoms and molecules in some complex order in a computer  the products of genius should be possible to it  and if the individual parts are not as tiny and delicate as those of the brain  we compensate by making the computer larger .   some people may say     but computers can only do what they   re programmed to do .      the answer to that is     true .  but brains can do only what they   re programmed to do   by their genes .  part of the brain   s programming is the ability to learn  and that will be part of a complex computer   s programming .      in fact  if a computer can be built to be as intelligent as a human being  why can   t it be made more intelligent as well .   why not  indeed .  maybe that   s what evolution is all about .  over the space of three billion years  hit and miss development of atoms and molecules has finally produced  through glacially slow improvement  a species intelligent enough to take the next step in a matter of centuries  or even decades .  then things will really move .   but if computers become more intelligent than human beings  might they not replace us .  well  shouldn   t they .  they may be as kind as they are intelligent and just let us dwindle by attrition .  they might keep some of us as pets  or on reservations .   then too  consider what we   re doing to ourselves right now   to all living things and to the very planet we live on .  maybe it is time we were replaced .  maybe the real danger is that computers won   t be developed to the point of replacing us fast enough .   think about it .       i present this view only as something to think about .  i consider a quite different view in    intelligences together    later in this collection .     the laws of robotics    it isn   t easy to think about computers without wondering if they will ever    take over .      will they replace us  make us obsolete  and get rid of us the way we got rid of spears and tinderboxes .   if we imagine computerlike brains inside the metal imitations of human beings that we call robots  the fear is even more direct .  robots look so much like human beings that their very appearance may give them rebellious ideas .   this problem faced the world of science fiction in the       and        and many were the cautionary tales written of robots that were built and then turned on their creators and destroyed them .   when i was a young man i grew tired of that caution  for it seemed to me that a robot was a machine and that human beings were constantly building machines .  since all machines are dangerous  one way or another  human beings built safeguards into them .   in       therefore  i began to write a series of stories in which robots were presented sympathetically  as machines that were carefully designed to perform given tasks  with ample safeguards built into them to make them benign .   in a story i wrote in october       i finally presented the safeguards in the specific form of    the three laws of robotics .       i invented the word robotics  which had never been used before .    here they are     .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where those orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence except where such protection would conflict with the first and second law .   these laws were programmed into the computerized brain of the robot  and the numerous stories i wrote about robots took them into account .  indeed  these laws proved so popular with the readers and made so much sense that other science fiction writers began to use them  without ever quoting them directly   only i may do that   and all the old stories of robots destroying their creators died out .   ah  but that   s science fiction .  what about the work really being done now on computers and on artificial intelligence .  when machines are built that begin to have an intelligence of their own  will something like the three laws of robotics be built into them .   of course they will  assuming the computer designers have the least bit of intelligence .  what   s more  the safeguards will not merely be like the three laws of robotics  they will be the three laws of robotics .   i did not realize  at the time i constructed those laws  that humanity has been using them since the dawn of time .  just think of them as    the three laws of tools     and this is the way they would read     .  a tool must be safe to use .    obviously .  knives have handles and swords have hilts .  any tool that is sure to harm the user  provided the user is aware  will never be used routinely whatever its other qualifications .      .  a tool must perform its function  provided it does so safely .     .  a tool must remain intact during use unless its destruction is required for safety or unless its destruction is part of its function .   no one ever cites these three laws of tools because they are taken for granted by everyone .  each law  were it quoted  would be sure to be greeted by a chorus of    well  of course .      compare the three laws of tools  then  with the three laws of robotics  law by law  and you will see that they correspond exactly .  and why not  since the robot or  if you will  the computer  is a human tool .   but are safeguards sufficient .  consider the effort that is put into making the automobile safe   yet automobiles still kill        americans a year .  consider the effort that is put into making banks secure   yet there are still bank robberies in a steady drumroll .  consider the effort that is put into making computer programs secure   yet there is the growing danger of computer fraud .   computers  however  if they get intelligent enough to    take over     may also be intelligent enough no longer to require the three laws .  they may  of their own benevolence  take care of us and guard us from harm .   some of you may argue  though  that we   re not children and that it would destroy the very essence of our humanity to be guarded .   really .  look at the world today and the world in the past and ask yourself if we   re not children   and destructive children at that   and if we don   t need to be guarded in our own interest .   if we demand to be treated as adults  shouldn   t we act like adults .  and when do we intend to start .     future fantastic    in the past  three fundamental advances in human communication evolved that altered every facet of our world enormously and permanently .  the first advance was speech  the second writing  and the third printing .   now we face a fourth advance in communication every bit as important as the first three   the computer .  this fourth revolution will enable most human beings to be more creative than they   ve ever been before .  and provided we do not destroy the world by nuclear warfare  overpopulation or pollution  we will have a world of the technochild   a world as different from our present one as today   s is from the world of the caveman .  how will the lives of the next generation be different from their parents and grandparents .   one immediate response is to view the computer merely as another form of amusement  rather like a super tv .  it can be used for complex games  for making contact with friends  or for various trivial pursuits .  still  such things can change the world .  for one thing  communication by computer networks can wipe out the feeling of distance .  it can make the globe seem like a neighborhood  and this can have important consequences   the development of the concept of humanity as a single society  not as a collection of endlessly and inevitably warring social segments .  the world might develop a global lingua franca  a language  no doubt something quite close to today   s english  that everyone can understand  even though people would retain their individual languages for local use .   then  too  since communication will be so easy and since mechanical and electronic devices can be controlled remotely  telemetering  for example  makes it possible even now for engineers to send instructions to   and obtain obedience from   devices sailing past planets billions of miles away   computers will reduce the necessity of using physical transportation to gain or gather information .   there will  of course  be no bar to travel .  you can still be a tourist or visit friends or family in person rather than by closed circuit television .  but you will not have to battle hordes of people merely to carry or receive information that can be transferred by computer .   this means that the technochildren of tomorrow will be accustomed to living in a decentralized world  to reaching out in a variety of ways from their homes   or wherever they are   to do what needs doing .  at one and the same time  they will feel both entirely isolated and in total contact .     the children of the next generation   and the society they will create   will see the greatest impact from computers in the area of education .  currently our society is intent on educating as many children as possible .  the limit in the number of teachers means that students learn in mass .  every student in a school district or state or nation is taught the same thing at the same time in more or less the same way .  but because each child has individual interests and methods of learning  the experience of mass education turns out to be unpleasant .  the result is that most adults resist the learning process in postschool life  they   ve had enough of it .   learning could be pleasant  even all absorbingly fascinating  if children studied something that specifically interested them individually  on their own time and in their own way .  such study is currently possible through public libraries .  but the library is a clumsy tool .  one must go there  borrowing is limited to a few volumes  and books must be returned after a short time .   clearly the solution is to move libraries into the home .  just as record players brought home the concert hall and television brought home the movie theater  the computer can bring home the public library .  tomorrow   s technochildren will have a ready means of sating their curiosity .  they will know at an early age how to command their computers to give listings of materials .  as their interests are aroused  and guided  it is to be hoped  by their teachers at school   they will learn more in less time and find new byways to follow .   education will have a strong component of self motivation added to it .  the ability to follow a personal path will encourage the technochild to associate learning with pleasure and grow into a lively technoadult   eager  curious  and ready to expand the mental environment for as long as his or her brain remains physically undulled by the ravages of old age .   this new approach to education can also influence another area of life  work .  until now  most human beings have worked at jobs that seriously underutilized the brain .  in the ages when work consisted largely of brutish physical labor  few ever had the chance to lift their eyes to the stars or ponder abstractions .  even when the industrial revolution brought machinery that could lift the load of physical labor from the backs of humanity  meaningless    skilled    work took its place .  today employees on the assembly line and in offices still perform jobs that require little thought .   for the first time in history  skilled machines  or robots  will be able to do those mindless jobs .  any job that is so simple and repetitive that a robot can do it as well as  if not better than  a person is beneath the dignity of the human brain .  as technochildren turn into adults and move into the work world  they will have time to exercise more creativity  to work in the fields of drama  science  literature  government  and entertainment .  and they will be ready for this kind of work as a result of the computerized revolution in education .   some might believe that it   s simply impossible to expect people to be creative in large numbers .  but that thinking comes from a world in which only a few escape the mental destruction of jobs that don   t use the brain .  we   ve been through this before  it was always assumed that literacy  for example  was the province of the few who had minds peculiarly adapted to the complicated task of reading and writing .  of course  with the advent of printing and mass education  it turned out that most human beings could be literate .     what does all this mean .  that we will be dealing with a world of leisure .  once computers and robots are doing the dull  mechanical work  the world will start running itself to a far greater extent than ever before .  will there be more    renaissance people    as a result .  yes .  currently leisure is a small segment of life that is used narrowly because of lack of time  or is wasted on doing nothing in a desperate attempt to get far away from the hated workaday world .  with leisure filling most of one   s time  there will be no sensation of racing the clock  no compulsion to enter into a wild spree against the slavery of hateful work .  people will sample a variety of interests without haste  become skillful or knowledgeable in a number of areas  and cultivate different talents at various times .   this is not just guesswork .  there have been eras in history when people had slaves   the brutalized  human version of the computer   to do the work for them .  others have had patrons to support them .  when even a few people have had ample leisure time to pursue their interests  the result has been an explosion of variegated culture .  the golden age of athens in the late fifth century b . c .  and the italian renaissance in the   th to   th centuries are the most famous examples .   not only will people have the freedom to pursue hobbies and interests and dreams  but a great number of them will also want to share their talents .  so many of us have a bit of the ham in us .  we sing in the shower  take part in amateur theatrical productions  or love to swing along in parades .  it is my guess that the   st century may see a society in which one third of the population will be engaged in entertaining the other two thirds .   and there are bound to be new forms of entertainment that one can now foresee only dimly .  three dimensional tv is easy to forecast .  and space may become a new arena for activity .  in near zero gravity  for example  the manipulation of balls may produce far more complicated forms of tennis or soccer .  ballet and even social dancing may become incredibly startling and require a new kind of coordination that   s delightful to watch  as it will be as easy to move up and down as it is to move forward and backward or left and right .     what about those people who choose not to share their bents and interests and instead retire into worlds of their own .  someone who is interested  for example  in learning about the history of costumes and who is capable of exploring the libraries of the world from an isolated comer might simply stay there .  might we  then  find ourselves in a society in which an unprecedented number of people are intellectual hermits .  might we breed a race of introverts .   i think the chances are slim .  people who grow ferociously interested in one aspect of knowledge or expertise are quite likely to be filled with missionary zeal .  they will want to share their knowledge with others .  even today  someone who has an obscure field of interest is far more likely to want to explain it to everyone he or she meets than to sit silently in a comer .  if there   s any danger  it   s that an arcane interest will nurture a loquacious bore rather than a hermit .   we must not forget the tendency of those who share interests to wish to get together  to form a temporary subuniverse that is a haven of concentrated special fascination .  in the        for example  someone had the idea of organizing a convention for star trek fans  expecting a few hundred at most to attend .  instead  fans poured in by the thousands  and television was supposed to be an isolating medium .   .  on line gatherings  in which the computer is the medium and people are actively involved  will experience similarly high levels of participation .   and in between the formal get togethers  there will be a kaleidoscope of people linked into global communities by computerized communication .  perpetual conventions will take place  in which individuals continually drop in and out  bringing in findings or ideas and leaving stimulated .  there will be a constant melange of teaching and learning .   what i foresee is a society in intense creative ferment  people reaching out to others  new thoughts arising and spreading at a speed never before imagined  change and variety filling the planet  to say nothing of the smaller  artificial worlds that will be constructed in space  .  it will be a new world that will look back at earlier centuries as having been only half alive .     the machine and the robot    to a physicist  a machine is any device that transfers a force from the point where it is applied to another point where it is used and  in the process  changes its intensity or direction .   in this sense it is difficult for a human being to make use of anything that is not part of his body without  in the process  using a machine .  a couple of million years ago  when one could scarcely decide whether the most advanced hominids were more humanlike than apelike  pebbles were already being chipped and their sharp edges used to cut or scrape .   and even a chipped pebble is a machine  for the force applied to the blunt edge by the hand is transmitted to the sharp end and  in the process  intensified .  the force spread over the large area of the blunt end is equal to the force spread over the small area of the sharp end .  the pressure  force per area  is therefore increased  and without ever increasing the total force  that force is intensified in action .  the sharp edge pebble could  by the greater pressure it exerts  force its way through an object  as a rounded pebble  or a man   s hand  could not .   in actual practice  however  few people  other than physicists at their most rigid  would call a chipped pebble a machine .  in actual practice  we think of machines as relatively complicated devices  and are more likely to use the name if the device is somewhat removed from direct human guidance and manipulation .   the further a device is removed from human control  the more authentically mechanical it seems  and the whole trend in technology has been to devise machines that are less and less under direct human control and more and more seem to have the beginning of a will of their own .  a chipped pebble is almost part of the hand it never leaves .  a thrown spear declares a sort of independence the moment is its released .   the clear progression away from direct and immediate control made it possible for human beings  even in primitive times  to slide forward into extrapolation  and to picture devices still less controllable  still more independent than anything of which they had direct experience .  immediately we have a form of fantasy   which some  defining the term more broadly than i would  might even call science fiction .   man can move on his feet by direct and intimate control  or on horseback  controlling the more powerful animal muscles by rein and heel  or on ship  making use of the invisible power of the wind .  why not progress into further etherealization by way of seven league boots  flying carpets  self propelled boats .  the power used in these cases was    magic     the tapping of the superhuman and transcendental energies of gods or demons .   nor did these imaginings concern only the increased physical power of inanimate objects  but even increased mental power of objects which were still viewed as essentially inanimate .  artificial intelligence is not really a modern concept .   hephaistos  the greek god of the forge  is pictured in the iliad as having golden mechanical women  which were as mobile and as intelligent as flesh and blood women  and which helped him in his palace .   why not .  after all  if a human smith makes inanimate metal objects of the base metal iron  why should not a god smith make far more clever inanimate metal objects of the noble metal gold .  it is an easy extrapolation  of the sort that comes as second nature to science fiction writers  who  in primitive times  had to be myth makers  in default of science  .   but human artisans  if clever enough  could also make mechanical human beings .  consider talos  a bronze warrior made by that thomas edison of the greek myths  oaedalus .  talos guarded the shores of crete  circling the island once each day and keeping off all intruders .  the fluid that kept him alive was kept within his body by a plug at his heel .  when the argonauts landed on crete  medea used her magic to pull out the plug and talos lost all his pseudoanimation .    it is easy to ascribe a symbolic meaning to this myth .  crete  starting in the fourth millennium b . c .   before the greeks had yet entered greece  had a navy  the first working navy in human history .  the cretan navy made it possible for the islanders to establish an empire over what became the nearby islands and mainland .  the greek barbarians  invading the land  were more or less under cretan dominion to begin with .  the bronze armored warriors carried by the ships guarded the cretan mainland for two thousand years   and then failed .  the plug was pulled  so to speak  when the island of thera exploded in a vast volcanic eruption in      b . c .  and a tsunami greatly weakened the cretan civilization   and the greeks took over .  still  the fact that a myth is a sort of vague and distorted recall of something actual does not alter its function of indicating a way of human thinking .    from the start  then  the machine has faced mankind with a double aspect .  as long as it is completely under human control  it is useful and good and makes a better life for people .  however  it is the experience of mankind  and was already his experience in quite early times  that technology is a cumulative thing  that machines are invariably improved  and that the improvement is always in the direction of etherealization  always in the direction of less human control and more auto control   and at an accelerating rate .   as the human control decreases  the machine becomes frightening in exact proportion .  even when the human control is not visibly decreasing  or is doing so at an excessively low rate  it is a simple task for human ingenuity to look forward to a time when the machine may go out of control altogether  and the fear of that can be felt in advance .     what is the fear .   the simplest and most obvious fear is that of the possible harm that comes from machinery out of control .  in fact  any technological advance  however fundamental  has the double aspect of good harm and  in response  is viewed with a double aspect of love fear .   fire warms you  gives you light  cooks your food  smelts your ore   and  out of control  burns and kills .  your knives and spears kill your animal enemies and your human foes and  out of your control  are used by your foes to kill you .  you can run down the list and build examples indefinitely and there has never been any human activity which  on getting out of control and doing harm  has raised the sigh among many of     oh  if we had only stuck to the simple and virtuous lives of our ancestors who were not cursed with this new fangled misery .      yet is this fear of piecemeal harm from this advance or that the kind of deep seated terror so difficult to express that it finds its way into the myths .   i think not .  fear of machinery for the discomfort and occasional harm it brings has  at least until very recently  not moved humanity to more than that occasional sigh .  the love of the uses of machinery has always far overbalanced such fears  as we might judge if we consider that very rarely in the history of mankind has any culture voluntarily given up significant technological advance because of the inconvenience or harm of its side effects .  there have been involuntary retreats from technology as a result of warfare  civil strife  epidemics  or natural disasters  but the results of that are precisely what we call a    dark age    and the population suffering from one does its best over the generations to get back on the track and restore the technology .   mankind has always chosen to counter the evils of technology  not by abandonment of technology  but by additional technology .  the smoke of an indoor fire was countered by the chimney .  the danger of the spear was countered by the shield .  the danger of the mass army was countered by the city wall .   this attitude  despite the steady drizzle of backwardist outcries  has continued to the present .  thus the characteristic technological product of our present life is the automobile .  it pollutes the air  assaults our eardrums  kills fifty thousand americans a year and inflicts survivable injuries on hundreds of thousands .   does anyone seriously expect americans to give up their murderous little pets voluntarily .  even those who attend rallies to denounce the mechanization of modern life are quite likely to reach those rallies by automobile .   the first moment when the magnitude of possible evil was seen by many people as uncounterable by any conceivable good came with the fission bomb in      .  never before had any technological advance set off demands for abandonment by so large a percentage of the population .   in fact  the reaction to the fission bomb set a new fashion .  people were readier to oppose other advances they saw as unacceptably harmful in their side effects biological warfare  the sst  certain genetic experiments on micro organisms  breeder reactors  spray cans .   and even so  not one of these items has yet been given up .     but we   re on the right track .  the fear of the machine is not at the deepest level of the soul if the harm it does is accompanied by good  too  or if the harm is merely to some people   the few who happen to be on the spot in a vehicular collision  for instance .   the majority  after all  escape  and reap the good of the machine .   no  it is when the machine threatens all mankind in any way so that each individual human being begins to feel that he  himself  will not escape  that fear overwhelms love .   but since technology has begun to threaten the human race as a whole only in the last thirty years  were we immune to fear before that   or has the human race always been threatened .   after all  is physical destruction by brute energy of a type only now in our fist  the only way in which human beings can be destroyed .  might not the machine destroy the essence of humanity  our minds and souls  even while leaving our bodies intact and secure and comfortable .   it is a common fear  for instance  that television makes people unable to read and pocket computers will make them unable to add .  or think of the spartan king who  on observing a catapult in action  mourned that that would put an end to human valor .   certainly such subtle threats to humanity have existed and been recognized through all the long ages when man   s feeble control over nature made it impossible for him to do himself very much physical harm .   the fear that machinery might make men effete is not yet  in my opinion  the basic and greatest fear .  the one  it seems to me  that hits closest to the core is the general fear of irreversible change .  consider   there are two kinds of change that we can gather from the universe about us .  one is cyclic and benign .   day both follows and is followed by night .  summer both follows and is followed by winter .  rain both follows and is followed by clear weather  and the net result is  therefore  no change .  that may be boring  but it is comfortable and induces a feeling of security .   in fact  so comfortable is the notion of short term cyclic change implying long term changelessness  that human beings labor to find it everywhere .  in human affairs  there is the notion that one generation both follows and is followed by another  that one dynasty both follows and is followed by another  that one empire both follows and is followed by another .  it is not a good analogy to the cycles of nature since the repetitions are not exact  but it is good enough to be comforting .   so strongly do human beings want the comfort of cycles that they will seize upon one even when the evidence is insufficient   or even when it actually points the other way .   with respect to the universe  what evidence we have points to a hyperbolic evolution  a universe that expands forever out of the initial big bang and ends as formless gas and black holes .  yet our emotions drag us  against the evidence  to notions of oscillating  cyclic  repeating universes  in which even the black holes are merely gateways to new big bangs .   but then there is the other change  to be avoided at all costs   the irreversible  malignant change  the one way change  the permanent change  the change never to return .   what is so fearful about it .  the fact is that there is one such change that lies so close to ourselves that it distorts the entire universe for us .   we are  after all  old  and though we were once young we shall never be young again .  irreversible .  our friends are dead  and though they were once alive  they shall never be alive again .  irreversible .  the fact is that life ends in death and that is not a cyclic change and we fear that end and know it is useless to fight it .   what is worse is that the universe doesn   t die with us .  callously and immortally it continues onward in its cyclic changes  adding to the injury of death the insult of indifference .   and what is still worse is that other human beings don   t die with us .  there are younger human beings  born later  who were helpless and dependent on us to start with  but who grow into supplanting nemeses and take our places as we age and die .  to the injury of death is added the insult of supplantation .   did i say it is useless to fight this honor of death accompanied by indifference and supplantation .  not quite .  the uselessness is apparent only if we cling to the rational  but there is no law that says we must cling to it  and human beings do not  in fact  do so .   death can be avoided by simply denying it exists .  we can suppose that life on earth is an illusion  a short testing period prior to entry into some afterlife where all is eternal and there is no question of irreversible change .  or we can suppose that it is only the body that is subject to death and that there is an immortal component of ourselves  not subject to irreversible change  which might  after the death of one body  enter another  in indefinite  cyclic repetitions of life .   these mythic inventions of afterlife and transmigration may make life tolerable for many human beings and enable them to face death with reasonable equanimity   but the fear of death and supplantation is only masked and overlaid  it is not removed .   in fact  the greek myths involve the successive supplantation of one set of immortals by another   in what seems to be a despairing admission that not even eternal life and superhuman power can remove the danger of irreversible change and the humiliation of being supplanted .   to the greeks it was disorder  chaos  that first ruled the universe  and it was supplanted by ouranos  the sky   whose intricate powdering of stars and complexly moving planets symbolized order     kosmos     .   but ouranos was castrated by kronos  his son .  kronos  his brothers  his sisters  and their progeny then ruled the universe .   kronos feared that he would be served by his children as he had served his father  a kind of cycle of irreversible changes  and devoured his children as they were born .  he was duped by his wife  however  who managed to save her last born  zeus  and to spirit him away to safety .  zeus grew to adult godhood  rescued his siblings from his father   s stomach  warred against kronos and those who followed him  defeated him  and replaced him as ruler .    there are supplantation myths among other cultures  too  even in our own   as the one in which satan tried to supplant god and failed  a myth that reached its greatest literary expression in john milton   s paradise lost .    and was zeus safe .  he was attracted to the sea nymph thetis and would have married her had he not been informed by the fates that thetis was destined to bear a son mightier than his father .  that meant it was not safe for zeus  or for any other god  either  to marry her .  she was therefore forced  much against her will  to marry peleus  a mortal  and bear a mortal son  the only child the myths describe her as having .  that son was achilles  who was certainly far mightier than his father  and  like talos  had only his heel as his weak point through which he might be killed  .   now  then  translate this fear of irreversible change and of being supplanted into the relationship of man and machine and what do we have .  surely the great fear is not that machinery will harm us   but that it will supplant us .  it is not that it will render us ineffective   but that it will make us obsolete .     the ultimate machine is an intelligent machine and there is  only one basic plot to the intelligent machine story   that it is created to serve man  but that it ends by dominating man .  it cannot exist without threatening to supplant us  and it must therefore be destroyed or we will be .   there is the danger of the broom of the sorcerer   s apprentice  the golem of rabbi loew  the monster created by dr .  frankenstein .  as the child born of our body eventually supplants us  so does the machine born of our mind .   mary shelley   s frankenstein  which appeared in       represents a peak of fear  however  for  as it happened  circumstances conspired to reduce that fear  at least temporarily .   between the year       which saw the end of a series of general european wars  and       which saw the beginning of another  there was a brief period in which humanity could afford the luxury of optimism concerning its relationship to the machine .  the industrial revolution seemed suddenly to uplift human power and to bring on dreams of a technological utopia on earth in place of the mythic one in heaven .  the good of machines seemed to far outbalance the evil and the response of love far outbalance the response of fear .   it was in that interval that modern science fiction began   and by modern science fiction i refer to a form of literature that deals with societies differing from our own specifically in the level of science and technology  and into which we might conceivably pass from our own society by appropriate changes in that level .   this differentiates science fiction from fantasy or from    speculative fiction     in which the fictional society cannot be connected with our own by any rational set of changes .    modern science fiction  because of the time of its beginning  took on an optimistic note .  man   s relationship to the machine was one of use and control .  man   s power grew and man   s machines were his faithful tools  bringing him wealth and security and carrying him to the farthest reaches of the universe .   this optimistic note continues to this day  particularly among those writers who were molded in the years before the coming of the fission bomb   notably  robert heinlein  arthur c .  clarke  and myself .   nevertheless  with world war i  disillusionment set in .  science and technology  which promised an eden  turned out to be capable of delivering hell was well .  the beautiful airplane that fulfilled the age old dream of flight could deliver bombs .  the chemical techniques that produced anesthetics  dyes  and medicines produced poison gas as well .   the fear of supplantation rose again .  in       not long after the end of world war i  karel capek   s drama r . u . r .  appeared and it was the tale of frankenstein again  escalated to the planetary level .  not a single monster was created but millions of robots  capek   s word  meaning    worker     a mechanical one  that is  .  and it was not a single monster turning upon his single creator  but robots turning on humanity  wiping them out and supplanting them .   from the beginning of the science fiction magazine in      to       a third of a century or a generation  optimism and pessimism battled each other in science fiction  with optimism   thanks chiefly to the influence of john w .  campbell  jr .    having the better of it .   beginning in       i wrote a series of influential robot stories that self consciously combated the    frankenstein complex    and made of the robots the servants  friends  and allies of humanity .   it was pessimism  however  that won in the end  and for two reasons   first  machinery grew more frightening .  the fission bomb threatened physical destruction  of course  but worse still was the rapidly advancing electronic computer .  those computers seemed to steal the human soul .  deftly they solved our routine problems and more and more we found ourselves placing our questions in the hands of these machines with increasing faith  and accepting their answers with increasing humility .   all that fission and fusion bombs can do is destroy us  the computer might supplant us .   the second reason is more subtle  for it involved a change in the nature of the science fiction writer .   until       there were many branches of fiction  with science fiction perhaps the least among them .  it brought its writers less in prestige and money than almost any other branch  so that no one wrote science fiction who wasn   t so fascinated by it that he was willing to give up any chance at fame and fortune for its sake .  often that fascination stemmed from an absorption in the romance of science so that science fiction writers would naturally picture men as winning the universe by learning to bend it to their will .   in the        however  competition with tv gradually killed the magazines that supported fiction  and by the time the     s arrived the only form of fiction that was flourishing  and even expanding  was science fiction .  its magazines continued and an incredible paperback boom was initiated .  to a lesser extent it invaded movies and television  with its greatest triumphs undoubtedly yet to come .   this meant that in the     s and        young writers began to write science fiction not because they wanted to  but because it was there   and because very little else was there .  it meant that many of the new generation of science fiction writers had no knowledge of science  no sympathy for it   and were in fact rather hostile to it .  such writers were far more ready to accept the fear half of the love fear relationship of man to machine .   as a result  contemporary science fiction  far more often than not  is presenting us  over and over  with the myth of the child supplanting the parent  zeus supplanting kronos  satan supplanting god  the machine supplanting humanity .   nightmares they are  and they are to be read as such .      but allow me my own cynical commentary at the end .  remember that although kronos foresaw the danger of being supplanted  and though he destroyed his children to prevent it   he was supplanted anyway  and rightly so  for zeus was the better ruler .   so it may be that although we will hate and fight the machines  we will be supplanted anyway  and rightly so  for the intelligent machines to which we will give birth may  better than we  carry on the striving toward the goal of understanding and using the universe  climbing to heights we ourselves could never aspire to .     the new profession    back in       i wrote a story in which the leading character was named susan calvin .   good heavens  that   s nearly half a century ago .   she was a    robopsychologist    by profession and knew everything there was to know about what made robots tick .  it was a science fiction story  of course .  i wrote other stories about susan calvin over the next few years  and as i described matters  she was born in       went to columbia  majored in robotics  and graduated in      .  she went on to do graduate work and by      was working at a firm called u . s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .  i didn   t really take any of this seriously at the time i wrote it .  what i was writing was    just science fiction .      oddly enough  however  it   s working out .  robots are in use on the assembly lines and are increasing in importance each year .  the automobile companies are installing them in their factories by the tens of thousands .  increasingly  they will appear elsewhere as well  while ever more complex and intelligent robots will be appearing on the drawing boards .  naturally  these robots are going to wipe out many jobs  but they are going to create jobs  too .  the robots will have to be designed  in the first place .  they will have to be constructed and installed .  then  since nothing is perfect  they will occasionally go wrong and have to be repaired .  to keep the necessity for repair to a minimum  they will have to be intelligently maintained .  they may even have to be modified to do their work differently on occasion .   to do all this  we will need a group of people whom we can call  in general  robot technicians .  there are some estimates that by the time my fictional susan calvin gets out of college  there will be over   million robot technicians in the united states alone  and perhaps   million in the world generally .  susan won   t be alone .  to these technicians  suppose we add all the other people that will be employed by those rapidly growing industries that are directly or indirectly related to robotics .  it may well turn out that the robots will create more jobs than they will wipe out   but  of course  the two sets of jobs will be different  which means there will be a difficult transition period in which those whose jobs have vanished are retrained so that they can fill new jobs that have appeared .   this may not be possible in every case  and there will have to be innovative social initiatives to take care of those who  because of age or temperament  cannot fit in to the rapidly changing economic scene .   in the past  advances in technology have always necessitated the upgrading of education .  agricultural laborers didn   t have to be literate  but factory workers did  so once the industrial revolution came to pass  industrialized nations had to establish public schools for the mass education of their populations .  there must now be a further advance in education to go along with the new high tech economy .  education in science and technology will have to be taken more seriously and made lifelong  for advances will occur too rapidly for people to be able to rely solely on what they learned as youngsters .   wait .  i have mentioned robot technicians  but that is a general term .  susan calvin was not a robot technician  she was  specifically  a robopsychologist .  she dealt with robotic    intelligence     with robots    ways of    thinking .     i have not yet heard anyone use that term in real life  but i think the time will come when it will be used  just as    robotics    was used after i had invented that term .  after all  robot theoreticians are trying to develop robots that can see  that can understand verbal instructions  that can speak in reply .  as robots are expected to do more and more tasks  more and more efficiently  and in a more and more versatile way  they will naturally seem more    intelligent .     in fact  even now  there are scientists at mit and elsewhere who are working very seriously on the question of    artificial intelligence .      still  even if we design and construct robots that can do their jobs in such a way as to seem intelligent  it is scarcely likely that they will be intelligent in the same way that human beings are .  for one thing  their    brains    will be constructed of materials different from the ones in our brains .  for another  their brains will be made up of different components hooked together and organized in different ways  and will approach problems  very likely  in a totally different manner .   robotic intelligence may be so different from human intelligence that it will take a new discipline    robopsychology      to deal with it .  that is where susan calvin will come in .  it is she and others like her who will deal with robots  where ordinary psychologists could not begin to do so .  and this might turn out to be the most important aspect of robotics  for if we study in detail two entirely different kinds of intelligence  we may learn to understand intelligence in a much more general and fundamental way than is now possible .  specifically  we will learn more about human intelligence than may be possible to learn from human intelligence alone .     the robot as enemy .     it was back in      that i invented    the three laws of robotics     and of these  the first law is  of course  the most important .  it goes as follows      a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     in my stories  i always make it clear that the laws  especially the first law  are an inalienable part of all robots and that robots cannot and do not disobey them .   i also make it clear  though perhaps not as forcefully  that these laws aren   t inherent in robots .  the ores and raw chemicals of which robots are formed do not already contain the laws .  the laws are there only because they are deliberately added to the design of the robotic brain  that is  to the computers that control and direct robotic action .  robots can fail to possess the laws  either because they are too simple and crude to be given behavior patterns sufficiently complex to obey them or because the people designing the robots deliberately choose not to include the laws in their computerized makeup .   so far   and perhaps it will be so for a considerable time to come   it is the first of these alternatives that holds sway .  robots are simply too crude and primitive to be able to foresee that an act of theirs will harm a human being and to adjust their behavior to avoid that act .  they are  so far  only computerized levers capable of a few types of rote behavior  and they are unable to step beyond the very narrow limits of their instructions .  as a result  robots have already killed human beings  just as enormous numbers of noncomputerized machines have .  it is deplorable but understandable  and we can suppose that as robots are developed with more elaborate sense perceptions and with the capability of more flexible responses  there will be an increasing likelihood of building safety factors into them that will be the equivalent of the three laws .   but what about the second alternative .  will human beings deliberately build robots without the laws .  i   m afraid that is a distinct possibility .  people are already talking about security robots .  there could be robot guards patrolling the grounds of a building or even its hallways .  the function of these robots could be to challenge any person entering the grounds or the building .  presumably  persons who belonged there  or who were invited there  would be carrying  or would be given  some card or other form of identification that would be recognized by the robot  who would then let them pass .  in our security conscious times  this might even seem a good thing .  it would cut down on vandalism and terrorism and it would  after all  only be fulfilling the function of a trained guard dog .   but security breeds the desire for more security .  once a robot became capable of stopping an intruder  it might not be enough for it merely to sound an alarm .  it would be tempting to endow the robot with the capability of ejecting the intruder  even if it would do injury in the process   just as a dog might injure you in going for your leg or throat .  what would happen  though  when the chairman of the board found he had left his identifying card in his other pants and was too upset to leave the building fast enough to suit the robot .  or what if a child wandered into the building without the proper clearance .  i suspect that if the robot roughed up the wrong person  there would be an immediate clamor to prevent a repetition of the error .   to go to a further extreme  there is talk of robot weapons  computerized planes  tanks  artillery  and so on  that would stalk the enemy relentlessly  with superhuman senses and stamina .  it might be argued that this would be a way of sparing human beings .  we could stay comfortably at home and let our intelligent machines do the fighting for us .  if some of them were destroyed   well  they are only machines .  this approach to warfare would be particularly useful if we had such machines and the enemy didn   t .   but even so  could we be sure that our machines could always tell an enemy from a friend .  even when all our weapons are controlled by human hands and human brains  there is the problem of    friendly fire .      american weapons can accidentally kill american soldiers or civilians and have actually done so in the past .  this is human error  but nevertheless it   s hard to take .  but what if our robot weapons were to accidentally engage in    friendly fire    and wipe out american people  or even just american property .  that would be far harder to take  especially if the enemy had worked out stratagems to confuse our robots and encourage them to hit our own side  .  no  i feel confident that attempts to use robots without safeguards won   t work and that  in the end  we will come round to the three laws .     intelligences together    in    our intelligent tools    i mentioned the possibility that robots might become so intelligent that they would eventually replace us .  i suggested  with a touch of cynicism  that in view of the human record  such a replacement might be a good thing .  since then  robots have rapidly become more and more important in industry  and  although they are as yet quite idiotic on the intelligence scale  they are advancing quickly .   perhaps  then  we ought to take another look at the matter of robots  or computers   which are the actual driving mechanism of robots  replacing us .  the outcome  of course  depends on how intelligent computers become and whether they will become so much more intelligent than we are that they will regard us as no more than pets  at best  or vermin  at worst .  this implies that intelligence is a simple thing that can be measured with something like a ruler or a thermometer  or an iq test  and then expressed in a single number .  if the average human being is measured as     on an overall intelligence scale  then as soon as the average computer passes      we will be in trouble .   is that the way it works  though .  surely there must be considerable variety in such a subtle quality as intelligence  different species of it  so to speak .  i presume it takes intelligence to write a coherent essay  to choose the right words  and to place them in the right order .  i also presume it takes intelligence to study some intricate technical device  to see how it works and how it might be improved   or how it might be repaired if it had stopped working .  as far as writing is concerned  my intelligence is extremely high  as far as tinkering is concerned  my intelligence is extremely low .  well  then  am i a genius or an imbecile .  the answer is  neither .  i   m just good at some things and not good at others   and that   s true of everyone of us .   suppose  then  we think about the origins of both human intelligence and computer intelligence .  the human brain is built up essentially of proteins and nucleic acids  it is the product of over   billion years of hit or miss evolution  and the driving forces of its development have been adaptation and survival .  computers  on the other hand  are built up essentially of metal and electron surges  they are the product of some forty years of deliberate human design and development  and the driving force of their development has been the human desire to meet perceived human needs .  if there are many aspects and varieties of intelligence among human beings themselves  isn   t it certain that human and computer intelligences are going to differ widely since they have originated and developed under such different circumstances  out of such different materials  and under the impulse of such different drives .   it would seem that computers  even comparatively simple and primitive specimens  are extraordinarily good in some ways .  they possess capacious memories  have virtually instant and unfailing recall  and demonstrate the ability to carry through vast numbers of repetitive arithmetical operations without weariness or error .  if that sort of thing is the measure of intelligence  then already computers are far more intelligent than we are .  it is because they surpass us so greatly that we use them in a million different ways and know that our economy would fall apart if they all stopped working at once .   but such computer ability is not the only measure of intelligence .  in fact  we consider that ability of so little value that no matter how quick a computer is and how impressive its solutions  we see it only as an overgrown slide rule with no true intelligence at all .  what the human specialty seems to be  as far as intelligence is concerned  is the ability to see problems as a whole  to grasp solutions through intuition or insight  to see new combinations  to be able to make extraordinarily perceptive and creative guesses .  can   t we program a computer to do the same thing .  not likely  for we don   t know how we do it .   it would seem  then  that computers should get better and better in their variety of point by point  short focus intelligence  and that human beings  thanks to increasing knowledge and understanding of the brain and the growing technology of genetic engineering  may improve in their own variety of whole problem  long focus intelligence .  each variety of intelligence has its advantages and  in combination  human intelligence and computer intelligence   each filling in the gaps and compensating for the weaknesses of the other   can advance far more rapidly than either one could alone .  it will not be a case of competing and replacing at all  but of intelligences together  working more efficiently than either alone within the laws of nature .     my robots    i wrote my first robot story     robbie     in may of       when i was only nineteen years old .   what made it different from robot stories that had been written earlier was that i was determined not to make my robots symbols .  they were not to be symbols of humanity   s overweening arrogance .  they were not to be examples of human ambitions trespassing on the domain of the almighty .  they were not to be a new tower of babel requiring punishment .   nor were the robots to be symbols of minority groups .  they were not to be pathetic creatures that were unfairly persecuted so that i could make aesopic statements about jews  blacks or any other mistreated members of society .  naturally  i was bitterly opposed to such mistreatment and i made that plain in numerous stories and essays   but not in my robot stories .   in that case  what did i make my robots .    i made them engineering devices .  i made them tools .  i made them machines to serve human ends .  and i made them objects with built in safety features .  in other words  i set it up so that a robot could not kill his creator  and having outlawed that heavily overused plot  i was free to consider other  more rational consequences .   since i began writing my robot stories in       i did not mention computerization in their connection .  the electronic computer had not yet been invented and i did not foresee it .  i did foresee  however  that the brain had to be electronic in some fashion .  however     electronic    didn   t seem futuristic enough .  the positron   a subatomic particle exactly like the electron but of opposite electric charge   had been discovered only four years before i wrote my first robot story .  it sounded very science fictional indeed  so i gave my robots    positronic brains    and imagined their thoughts to consist of flashing streams of positrons  coming into existence  then going out of existence almost immediately .  these stories that i wrote were therefore called    the positronic robot series     but there was no greater significance than what i have just described to the use of positrons rather than electrons .   at first  i did not bother actually systematizing  or putting into words  just what the safeguards were that i imagined to be built into my robots .  from the very start  though  since i wasn   t going to have it possible for a robot to kill its creator  i had to stress that robots could not harm human beings  that this was an ingrained part of the makeup of their positronic brains .   thus  in the very first printed version of    robbie     i had a character refer to a robot as follows     he just can   t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he   s a machine  made so .      after writing    robbie     which john campbell  of astounding science fiction  rejected  i went on to other robot stories which campbell accepted .  on december           i came to him with an idea for a mind reading robot  which later became    liar .      and john was dissatisfied with my explanations of why the robot behaved as it did .  he wanted the safeguard specified precisely so that we could understand the robot .  together  then  we worked out what came to be known as the    three laws of robotics .      the concept was mine  for it was obtained out of the stories i had already written  but the actual wording  if i remember correctly  was beaten out then and there by the two of us .   the three laws were logical and made sense .  to begin with  there was the question of safety  which had been foremost in my mind when i began to write stories about my robots .  what   s more i was aware of the fact that even without actively attempting to do harm  one could quietly  by doing nothing  allow harm to come .  what was in my mind was arthur hugh clough   s cynical    the latest decalog     in which the ten commandments ate rewritten in deeply satirical machiavellian fashion .  the one item most frequently quoted is     thou shalt not kill  but needst not strive   officiously to keep alive .      for that reason i insisted that the first law  safety  had to be in two parts and it came out this way     .  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   having got that out of the way  we had to pass on to the second law  service  .  naturally  in giving the robot the built in necessity to follow orders  you couldn   t forfeit the overall concern of safety .  the second law had to read as follows  then     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .   and finally  we had to have a third law  prudence  .  a robot was bound to be an expensive machine and it must not needlessly be damaged or destroyed .  naturally  this must not be used as a way of compromising either safety or service .  the third law  therefore  had to read as follows     .  a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .   of course  these laws are expressed in words  which is an imperfection .  in the positronic brain  they are competing positronic potentials that are best expressed in terms of advanced mathematics  which is well beyond my ken  i assure you  .  however  even so  there are clear ambiguities .  what constitutes    harm    to a human being .  must a robot obey orders given it by a child  by a madman  by a malevolent human being .  must a robot give up its own expensive and useful existence to prevent a trivial harm to an unimportant human being .  what is trivial and what is unimportant .   these ambiguities are not shortcomings as far as a writer is concerned .  if the three laws were perfect and unambiguous there would be no room for stories .  it is in the nooks and crannies of the ambiguities that all one   s plots can lodge  and which provide a foundation  if you   ll excuse the pun  for robot city .   i did not specifically state the three laws in words in    liar .     which appeared in the may      astounding .  i did do so  however  in my next robot story     runaround     which appeared in the march      astounding .  in that issue on line seven of page one hundred  i have a character say     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics     and i then quote them .  that incidentally  as far as i or anyone else has been able to tell  represents the first appearance in print of the word    robotics      which  apparently  i invented .   since then  i have never had occasion  over a period of over forty years during which i wrote many stories and novels dealing with robots  to be forced to modify the three laws .  however  as time passed  and as my robots advanced in complexity and versatility  i did feel that they would have to reach for something still higher .  thus  in robots and empire  a novel published by doubleday in       i talked about the possibility that a sufficiently advanced robot might feel it necessary to consider the prevention of harm to humanity generally as taking precedence over the prevention of harm to an individual .  this i called the    zeroth law of robotics     but i   m still working on that .   my invention of the three laws of robotics is probably my most important contribution to science fiction .  they are widely quoted outside the field  and no history of robotics could possibly be complete without mention of the three laws .  in       john wiley and sons published a huge tome  handbook of industrial robotics  edited by shimon y .  nof  and  at the editor   s request  i wrote an introduction concerning the three laws .   now it is understood that science fiction writers generally have created a pool of ideas that form a common stock into which all writers can dip .  for that reason  i have never objected to other writers who have used robots that obey the three laws .  i have  rather  been flattered and  honestly  modem science fictional robots can scarcely appear without those laws .   however  i have firmly resisted the actual quotation of the three laws by any other writer .  take the laws for granted  is my attitude in this matter  but don   t recite them .  the concepts are everyone   s but the words are mine .     the laws of humanics    my first three robot novels were  essentially  murder mysteries  with elijah baley as the detective .  of these first three  the second novel  the naked sun  was a locked room mystery  in the sense that the murdered person was found with no weapon on the site and yet no weapon could have been removed either .   i managed to produce a satisfactory solution but i did not do that sort of thing again .   the fourth robot novel  robots and empire  was not primarily a murder mystery .  elijah baley had died a natural death at a good  old age  the book veered toward the foundation universe so that it was clear that both my notable series  the robot series and the foundation series  were going to be fused into a broader whole .   no  i didn   t do this for some arbitrary reason .  the necessities arising out of writing sequels in the     s to tales originally written in the       and     s forced my hand .    in robots and empire  my robot character  giskard  of whom i was very fond  began to concern himself with    the laws of humanics     which  i indicated  might eventually serve as the basis for the science of psychohistory  which plays such a large role in the foundation series .   strictly speaking  the laws of humanics should be a description  in concise form  of how human beings actually behave .  no such description exists  of course .  even psychologists  who study the matter scientifically  at least  i hope they do  cannot present any    laws    but can only make lengthy and diffuse descriptions of what people seem to do .  and none of them are prescriptive .  when a psychologist says that people respond in this way to a stimulus of that sort  he merely means that some do at some times .  others may do it at other times  or may not do it at all .   if we have to wait for actual laws prescribing human behavior in order to establish psychohistory  and surely we must  then i suppose we will have to wait a long time .   well  then  what are we going to do about the laws of humanics .  i suppose what we can do is to start in a very small way  and then later slowly build it up  if we can .   thus  in robots and empire  it is a robot  giskard  who raises the question of the laws of humanics .  being a robot  he must view everything from the standpoint of the three laws of robotics   these robotic laws being truly prescriptive  since robots are forced to obey them and cannot disobey them .   the three laws of robotics are       a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .       a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .       a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   well  then  it seems to me that a robot could not help but think that human beings ought to behave in such a way as to make it easier for robots to obey those laws .   in fact  it seems to me that ethical human beings should be as anxious to make life easier for robots as the robots themselves would .  i took up this matter in my story    the bicentennial man     which was published in      .  in it  i had a human character say in part      if a man has the right to give a robot any order that does not involve harm to a human being  he should have the decency never to give a robot any order that involves harm to a robot  unless human safety absolutely requires it .  with great power goes great responsibility  and if the robots have three laws to protect men  is it too much to ask that men have a law or two to protect robots .      for instance  the first law is in two parts .  the first part     a robot may not injure a human being     is absolute and nothing need be done about that .  the second part     or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm     leaves things open a bit .  a human being might be about to come to harm because of some event involving an inanimate object .  a heavy weight might be likely to fall upon him  or he may slip and be about to fall into a lake  or anyone of uncountable other misadventures of the sort may be involved .  here the robot simply must try to rescue the human being  pull him from under  steady him on his feet and so on .  or a human being might be threatened by some form of life other than human   a lion  for instance   and the robot must come to his defense .   but what if harm to a human being is threatened by the action of another human being .  there a robot must decide what to do .  can he save one human being without harming the other .  or if there must be harm  what course of action must he pursue to make it minimal .   it would be a lot easier for the robot  if human beings were as concerned about the welfare of human beings  as robots are expected to be .  and  indeed  any reasonable human code of ethics would instruct human beings to care for each other and to do no harm to each other .  which is  after all  the mandate that humans gave robots .  therefore the first law of humanics from the robots    standpoint is       a human being may not injure another human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   if this law is carried through  the robot will be left guarding the human being from misadventures with inanimate objects and with non human life  something which poses no ethical dilemmas for it .  of course  the robot must still guard against harm done a human being unwittingly by another human being .  it must also stand ready to come to the aid of a threatened human being  if another human being on the scene simply cannot get to the scene of action quickly enough .  but then  even a robot may unwittingly harm a human being  and even a robot may not be fast enough to get to the scene of action in time or skilled enough to take the necessary action .  nothing is perfect .   that brings us to the second law of robotics  which compels a robot to obey all orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  this means that human beings can give robots any order without limitation as long as it does not involve harm to a human being .   but then a human being might order a robot to do something impossible  or give it an order that might involve a robot in a dilemma that would do damage to its brain .  thus  in my short story    liar .      published in       i had a human being deliberately put a robot into a dilemma where its brain burnt out and ceased to function .   we might even imagine that as a robot becomes more intelligent and self aware  its brain might become sensitive enough to undergo harm if it were forced to do something needlessly embarrassing or undignified .  consequently  the second law of humanics would be       a human being must give orders to a robot that preserve robotic existence  unless such orders cause harm or discomfort to human beings .   the third law of robotics is designed to protect the robot  but from the robotic view it can be seen that it does not go far enough .  the robot must sacrifice its existence if the first or second law makes that necessary .  where the first law is concerned  there can be no argument .  a robot must give up its existence if that is the only way it can avoid doing harm to a human being or can prevent harm from coming to a human being .  if we admit the innate superiority of any human being to any robot  which is something i am a little reluctant to admit  actually   then this is inevitable .   on the other hand  must a robot give up its existence merely in obedience to an order that might be trivial  or even malicious .  in    the bicentennial man     i have some hoodlums deliberately order a robot to take itself apart for the fun of watching that happen .  the third law of humanics must therefore be       a human being must not harm a robot  or  through inaction  allow a robot to come to harm  unless such harm is needed to keep a human being from harm or to allow a vital order to be carried out .   of course  we cannot enforce these laws as we can the robotic laws .  we cannot design human brains as we design robot brains .  it is  however  a beginning  and i honestly think that if we are to have power over intelligent robots  we must feel a corresponding responsibility for them  as the human character in my story    the bicentennial man    said .     cybernetic organism    a robot is a robot and an organism is an organism .   an organism  as we all know  is built up of cells .  from the molecular standpoint  its key molecules are nucleic acids and proteins .  these float in a watery medium  and the whole has a bony support system .  if is useless to go on with the description  since we are all familiar with organisms and since we are examples of them ourselves .   a robot  on the other hand  is  as usually pictured in science fiction  an object  more or less resembling a human being  constructed out of strong  rust resistant metal .  science fiction writers are generally chary of describing the robotic details too closely since they are not usually essential to the story and the writers are generally at a loss how to do so .   the impression one gets from the stories  however  is that a robot is wired  so that it has wires through which electricity flows rather than tubes through which blood flows .  the ultimate source of power is either unnamed  or is assumed to partake of the nature of nuclear power .   what of the robotic brain .   when i wrote my first few robot stories in      and       i imagined a    positronic brain    of a spongy type of platinum iridium alloy .  it was platinum iridium because that is a particularly inert metal and is least likely to undergo chemical changes .  it was spongy so that it would offer an enormous surface on which electrical patterns could be formed and un formed .  it was    positronic    because four years before my first robot story  the positron had been discovered as a reverse kind of electron  so that    positronic    in place of    electronic    had a delightful science fiction sound .   nowadays  of course  my positronic platinum iridium brain is hopelessly archaic .  even ten years after its invention it became outmoded .  by the end of the     s  we came to realize that a robot   s brain must be a kind of computer .  indeed  if a robot were to be as complex as the robots in my most recent novels  the robot brain computer must be every bit as complex as the human brain .  it must be made of tiny microchips no larger than  and as complex as  brain cells .   but now let us try to imagine something that is neither organism nor robot  but a combination of the two .  perhaps we can think of it as an organism robot or    orbot .     that would clearly be a poor name  for it is only    robot    with the first two letters transposed .  to say    orgabot     instead  is to be stuck with a rather ugly word .   we might call it a robot organism  or a    robotanism     which  again  is ugly or    roborg .     to my ears     roborg    doesn   t sound bad  but we can   t have that .  something else has arisen .   the science of computers was given the name    cybernetics    by norbert weiner a generation ago  so that if we consider something that is part robot and part organism and remember that a robot is cybernetic in nature  we might think of the mixture as a    cybernetic organism     or a    cyborg .     in fact  that is the name that has stuck and is used .   to see what a cyborg might be  let   s try starting with a human organism and moving toward a robot  and when we are quite done with that  let   s start with a robot and move toward a human being .   to move from a human organism toward a robot  we must begin replacing portions of the human organism with robotic parts .  we already do that in some ways .  for instance  a good percentage of the original material of my teeth is now metallic  and metal is  of course  the robotic substance par excellence .   the replacements don   t have to be metallic  of course .  some parts of my teeth are now ceramic in nature  and can   t be told at a glance from the natural dentine .  still  even though dentine is ceramic in appearance and even  to an extent  in chemical structure  it was originally laid down by living material and bears the marks of its origin .  the ceramic that has replaced the dentine shows no trace of life  now or ever .   we can go further .  my breastbone  which had to be split longitudinally in an operation a few years back is now held together by metallic staples  which have remained in place ever since .  my sister in law has an artificial hip joint replacement .  there are people who have artificial arms or legs and such non living limbs are being designed  as time passes on  to be ever more complex and useful .  there are people who have lived for days and even months with artificial hearts  and many more people who live for years with pacemakers .   we can imagine  little by little  this part and that part of the human being replaced by inorganic materials and engineering devices .  is there any part which we would find difficult to replace  even in imagination .   i don   t think anyone would hesitate there .  replace every part of the human being but one   the limbs  the heart  the liver  the skeleton  and so on   and the product would remain human .  it would be a human being with artificial parts  but it would be a human being .   but what about the brain .   surely  if there is one thing that makes us human it is the brain .  if there is one thing that makes us a human individual  it is the intensely complex makeup  the emotions  the learning  the memory content of our particular brain .  you can   t simply replace a brain with a thinking device off some factory shelf .  you have to put in something that incorporates all that a natural brain has learned  that possesses all its memory  and that mimics its exact pattern of working .   an artificial limb might not work exactly like a natural one  but might still serve the purpose .  the same might be true of an artificial lung  kidney  or liver .  an artificial brain  however  must be the precise replica of the brain it replaces  or the human being in question is no longer the same human being .   it is the brain  then  that is the sticking point in going from human organism to robot .   and the reverse .   in    the bicentennial man     i described the passage of my robot hero  andrew martin  from robot to man .  little by little  he had himself changed  till his every visible part was human in appearance .  he displayed an intelligence that was increasingly equivalent  or even superior  to that of a man .  he was an artist  a historian  a scientist  an administrator .  he forced the passage of laws guaranteeing robotic rights  and achieved respect and admiration in the fullest degree .   yet at no point could he make himself accepted as a man .  the sticking point  here  too  was his robotic brain .  he found that he had to deal with that before the final hurdle could be overcome .   therefore  we come down to the dichotomy  body and brain .  the ultimate cyborgs are those in which the body and brain don   t match .  that means we can have two classes of complete cyborgs   a  a robotic brain in a human body  or  b  a human brain in a robotic body .   we can take it for granted that in estimating the worth of a human being  or a robot  for that matter  we judge first by superficial appearance .   i can very easily imagine a man seeing a woman of superlative beauty and gazing in awe and wonder at the sight .     what a beautiful woman     he will say  or think  and he could easily imagine himself in love with her on the spot .  in romances  i believe that happens as a matter of routine .  and  of course  a woman seeing a man of superlative beauty is surely likely to react in precisely the same way .   if you fall in love with a striking beauty  you are scarcely likely to spend much time asking if she  or he  of course  has any brains  or possesses a good character  or has good judgment or kindness or warmth .  if you find out eventually that good looks are the person   s only redeeming quality  you are liable to make excuses and continue to be guided  for a time at least  by the conditioned reflex of erotic response .  eventually  of course  you will tire of good looks without content  but who knows how long that will take .   on the other hand  a person with a large number of good qualities who happened to be distinctly plain might not be likely to entangle you in the first place unless you were intelligent enough to see those good qualities so that you might settle down to a lifetime of happiness .   what i am saying  then  is that a cyborg with a robotic brain in a human body is going to be accepted by most  if not all  people as a human being  while a cyborg with a human brain in a robotic body is going to be accepted by most  if not all  people as a robot .  you are  after all   at least to most people   what you seem to be .   these two diametrically opposed cyborgs will not  however  pose a problem to human beings to the same degree .   consider the robotic brain in the human body and ask why the transfer should be made .  a robotic brain is better off in a robotic body since a human body is far the more fragile of the two .  you might have a young and stalwart human body in which the brain has been damaged by trauma and disease  and you might think     why waste that magnificent human body .  let   s put a robotic brain in it so that it can live out its life .      if you were to do that  the human being that resulted would not be the original .  it would be a different individual human being .  you would not be conserving an individual but merely a specific mindless body .  and a human body  however fine  is  without the brain that goes with it  a cheap thing .  every day  half a million new bodies come into being .  there is no need to save anyone of them if the brain is done .   on the other hand  what about a human brain in a robotic body .  a human brain doesn   t last forever  but it can last up to ninety years without falling into total uselessness .  it is not at all unknown to have a ninety year old who is still sharp  and capable of rational and worthwhile thought .  and yet we also know that many a superlative mind has vanished after twenty or thirty years because the body that housed it  and was worthless in the absence of the mind  had become uninhabitable through trauma or disease .  there would be a strong impulse then to transfer a perfectly good  even superior  brain into a robotic body to give it additional decades of useful life .   thus  when we say    cyborg    we are very likely to think  just about exclusively  of a human brain in a robotic body   and we are going to think of that as a robot .   we might argue that a human mind is a human mind  and that it is the mind that counts and not the surrounding support mechanism  and we would be right .  i   m sure that any rational court would decide that a human brain cyborg would have all the legal rights of a man .  he could vote  he must not be enslaved  and so on .   and yet suppose a cyborg were challenged     prove that you have a human brain and not a robotic brain  before i let you have human rights .      the easiest way for a cyborg to offer the proof is for him to demonstrate that he is not bound by the three laws of robotics .  since the three laws enforce socially acceptable behavior  this means he must demonstrate that he is capable of human  i . e .  nasty  behavior .  the simplest and most unanswerable argument is simply to knock the challenger down  breaking his jaw in the process  since no robot could do that .   in fact  in my story    evidence     which appeared in       i use this as a way of proving someone is not a robot   but in that case there was a catch .    but if a cyborg must continually offer violence in order to prove he has a human brain  that will not necessarily win him friends .   for that matter  even if he is accepted as human and allowed to vote and to rent hotel rooms and do all the other things human beings can do  there must nevertheless be some regulations that distinguish between him and complete human beings .  the cyborg would be stronger than a man  and his metallic fists could be viewed as lethal weapons .  he might still be forbidden to strike a human being  even in self defense .  he couldn   t engage in various sports on an equal basis with human beings  and so on .   ah  but need a human brain be housed in a metallic robotic body .  what about housing it in a body made of ceramic and plastic and fiber so that it looks and feels like a human body   and has a human brain besides .   but you know  i suspect that the cyborg will still have his troubles .  he   ll be different .  no matter how small the difference is  people will seize upon it .   we know that people who have human brains and full human bodies sometimes hate each other because of a slight difference in skin pigmentation  or a slight variation in the shape of the nose  eyes  lips  or hair .   we know that people who show no difference in any of the physical characteristics that have come to represent a cause for hatred  may yet be at daggers drawn over matters that are not physical at all  but cultural   differences in religion  or in political outlook  or in place of birth  or in language  or in just the accent of a language .   let   s face it .  cyborgs will have their difficulties  no matter what .     the sense of humor    would a robot feel a yearning to be human .   you might answer that question with a counter question .  does a chevrolet feel a yearning to be a cadillac .   the counter question makes the unstated comment that a machine has no yearnings .   but the very point is that a robot is not quite a machine  at least in potentiality .  a robot is a machine that is made as much like a human being as it is possible to make it  and somewhere there may be a boundary line that may be crossed .   we can apply this to life .  an earthworm doesn   t yearn to be a snake  a hippopotamus doesn   t yearn to be an elephant .  we have no reason to think such creatures are self conscious and dream of something more than they are .  chimpanzees and gorillas seem to be self aware  but we have no reason to think that they yearn to be human .   a human being  however  dreams of an afterlife and yearns to become one of the angels .  somewhere  life crossed a boundary line .  at some point a species arose that was not only aware of itself but had the capacity to be dissatisfied with itself .   perhaps a similar boundary line will someday be crossed in the construction of robots .   but if we grant that a robot might someday aspire to humanity  in what way would he so aspire .  he might aspire to the possession of the legal and social status that human beings are born to .  that was the theme of my story    the bicentennial man     and in his pursuit of such status  my robot hero was willing to give up all his robotic qualities  one by one  right down to his immortality .   that story  however  was more philosophical than realistic .  what is there about a human being that a robot might properly envy   what human physical or mental characteristic .  no sensible robot would envy human fragility  or human incapacity to withstand mild changes in the environment  or human need for sleep  or aptitude for the trivial mistake  or tendency to infectious and degenerative disease  or incapacitation through illogical storms of emotion .   he might  more properly  envy the human capacity for friendship and love  his wide ranging curiosity  his eagerness for experience .  i would like to suggest  though  that a robot who yearned for humanity might well find that what he would most want to understand  and most frustratingly fail to understand  would be the human sense of humor .   the sense of humor is by no means universal among human beings  though it does cut across all cultures .  i have known many people who didn   t laugh  but who looked at you in puzzlement or perhaps disdain if you tried to be funny .  i need go no further than my father  who routinely shrugged off my cleverest sallies as unworthy of the attention of a serious man .   fortunately  my mother laughed at all my jokes  and most uninhibitedly  or i might have grown up emotionally stunted .    the curious thing about the sense of humor  however  is that  as far as i have observed  no human being will admit to its lack .  people might admit they hate dogs and dislike children  they might cheerfully own up to cheating on their income tax or on their marital partner as a matter of right  and might not object to being considered inhumane or dishonest  through the simple expediency of switching adjectives and calling themselves realistic or businesslike .   however  accuse them of lacking a sense of humor and they will deny it hotly every time  no matter how openly and how often they display such a lack .  my father  for instance  always maintained that he had a keen sense of humor and would prove it as soon as he heard a joke worth laughing at  though he never did  in my experience  .   why  then  do people object to being accused of humorlessness .  my theory is that people recognize  subliminally  if not openly  that a sense of humor is typically human  more so than any other characteristic  and refuse demotion to subhumanity .   only once did i take up the matter of a sense of humor in a science fiction story  and that was in my story    jokester     which first appeared in the december       issue of infinity science fiction and which was most recently reprinted in my collection the best science fiction of isaac asimov  doubleday        .   the protagonist of the story spent his time telling jokes to a computer  i quoted six of them in the course of the story  .  a computer  of course  is an immobile robot  or  which is the same thing  a robot is a mobile computer  so the story deals with robots and jokes .  unfortunately  the problem in the story for which a solution was sought was not the nature of humor  but the source of all the jokes one hears .  and there is an answer  too  but you   ll have to read the story for that .   however  i don   t just write science fiction .  i write whatever it falls into my busy little head to write  and  by some undeserved stroke of good fortune  my various publishers are under the weird impression that it is illegal not to publish any manuscript i hand them .   you can be sure that i never disabuse them of this ridiculous notion .    thus  when i decided to write a joke book  i did  and houghton mifflin published it in      under the title of isaac asimov   s treasury of humor .  in it  i told     jokes that i happened to have as part of my memorized repertoire .   i also have enough for a sequel to be entitled isaac asimov laughs again  but i can   t seem to get around to writing it no matter how long i sit at the keyboard and how quickly i manipulate the keys .   i interspersed those jokes with my own theories concerning what is funny and how one makes what is funny even funnier .   mind you  there are as many different theories of humor as there are people who write on the subject  and no two theories are alike .  some are  of course  much stupider than others  and i felt no embarrassment whatever in adding my own thoughts on the subject to the general mountain of commentary .   it is my feeling  to put it as succinctly as possible  that the one necessary ingredient in every successful joke is a sudden alteration in point of view .  the more radical the alteration  the more suddenly it is demanded  the more quickly it is seen  the louder the laugh and the greater the joy .   let me give you an example with a joke that is one of the few i made up myself     jim comes into a bar and finds his best friend  bill  at a corner table gravely nursing a glass of beer and wearing a look of solemnity on his face .  jim sits down at the table and says sympathetically     what   s the matter  bill .      bill sighs  and says     my wife ran off yesterday with my best friend .      jim says  in a shocked voice     what are you talking about  bill .  i   m your best friend .      to which bin answers softly     not anymore .        i trust you see the change in point of view .  the natural supposition is that poor bill is sunk in gloom over a tragic loss .  it is only with the last three words that you realize  quite suddenly  that he is  in actual fact  delighted .  and the average human male is sufficiently ambivalent about his wife  however beloved she might be  to greet this particular change in point of view with delight .   now  if a robot is designed to have a brain that responds to logic only  and of what use would any other kind of robot brain be to humans who are hoping to employ robots for their own purposes .    a sudden change in point of view would be hard to achieve .  it would imply that the rules of logic were wrong in the first place or were capable of a flexibility that they obviously don   t have .  in addition  it would be dangerous to build ambivalence into a robot brain .  what we want from him is decision and not the to be or not to be of a hamlet .   imagine  then  telling a robot the joke i have just given you  and imagine the robot staring at you solemnly after you are done  and questioning you  thus .   robot     but why is jim no longer bill   s best friend .  you have not described jim as doing anything that would cause bill to be angry with him or disappointed in him .      you     well  no  it   s not that jim has done anything .  it   s that someone else has done something for bill that was so wonderful  that he has been promoted over jim   s head and has instantly become bill   s new best friend .      robot     but who has done this .     you     the man who ran away with bill   s wife  of course .     robot  after a thoughtful pause      but that can   t be so .  bill must have felt profound affection for his wife and a great sadness over her loss .  is that not how human males feel about their wives  and how they would react to their loss .      you     in theory  yes .  however  it turns out that bill strongly disliked his wife and was glad someone had run off with her .      robot  after another thoughtful pause      but you did not say that was so .      you     i know .  that   s what makes it funny .  i led you in one direction and then suddenly let you know that was the wrong direction .      robot     is it funny to mislead a person .      you  giving up      well  let   s get on with building this house .      in fact  some jokes actually depend on the illogical responses of human beings .  consider this one     the inveterate horse player paused before taking his place at the betting windows  and offered up a fervent prayer to his maker .      blessed lord     he murmured with mountain moving sincerity .     i know you don   t approve of my gambling  but just this once  lord  just this once  please let me break even .  i need the money so badly .        if you were so foolish as to tell this joke to a robot  he would immediately say     but to break even means that he would leave the races with precisely the amount of money he had when he entered .  isn   t that so .         yes  that   s so .         then  if he needs the money so badly  all he need do is not bet at all  and it would be just as though he had broken even .         yes  but he has this unreasoning need to gamble .         you mean even if he loses .         yes .         but that makes no sense .         but the point of the joke is that the gambler doesn   t understand this .         you mean it   s funny if a person lacks any sense of logic and is possessed of not even the simplest understanding .      and what can you do but turn back to building the house again .   but tell me  is this so different from dealing with the ordinary humorless human being .  i once told my father this joke     mrs .  jones  the landlady  woke up in the middle of the night because there were strange noises outside her door .  she looked out  and there was robinson  one of her boarders  forcing a frightened horse up the stairs .   she shrieked     what are you doing  mr .  robinson .      he said     putting the horse in the bathroom .         for goodness sake  why .         well  old higginbotham is such a wise guy .  whatever i tell him  he answers     i know .  i know     in such a superior way .  well  in the morning  he   ll go to the bathroom and he   ll come out yelling     there   s a horse in the bathroom .     and i   ll yawn and say     i know  i know .            and what was my father   s response .  he said     isaac  isaac .  you   re a city boy  so you don   t understand .  you can   t push a horse up the stairs if he doesn   t want to go .      personally  i thought that was funnier than the joke .   anyway  i don   t see why we should particularly want a robot to have a sense of humor  but the point is that the robot himself might want to have one   and how do we give it to him .     robots in combination    i have been inventing stories about robots now for very nearly half a century .  in that time  i have rung almost every conceivable change upon the theme .   mind you  it was not my intention to compose an encyclopedia of robot nuances  it was not even my intention to write about them for half a century .  it just happened that i survived that long and maintained my interest in the concept .  and it also just happened that in attempting to think of new story ideas involving robots  i ended up thinking about nearly everything .   for instance  in the sixth volume of the robot city series  there are the    chemfets     which have been introduced into the hero   s body in order to replicate and  eventually  give him direct psycho electronic control over the core computer  and hence all the robots of robot city .   well  in my book foundation   s edge  doubleday         my hero  golan trevize  before taking off in a spaceship  makes contact with an advanced computer by placing his hands on an indicated place on the desk before him .      and as he and the computer held hands  their thinking merged .  .  .       .  .  . he saw the room with complete clarity   not just in the direction in which he was looking  but all around and above and below .      he saw every room in the spaceship  and he saw outside as well .  the sun had risen .  .  . but he could look at it directly without being dazzled .  .  .      he felt the gentle wind and its temperature  and the sounds of the world about him .  he detected the planet   s magnetic field and the tiny electrical charges on the wall of the ship .      he became aware of the controls of the ship .  .  . he knew .  .  . that if he wanted to lift the ship  or turn it  or accelerate  or make use of any of its abilities  the process was the same as that of performing the analogous process to his body .  he had but to use his will .      that was as close as i could come to picturing the result of a mind computer interface  and now  in connection with this new book  i can   t help thinking of it further .   i suppose that the first time human beings learned how to form an interface between the human mind and another sort of intelligence was when they tamed the horse and learned how to use it as a form of transportation .  this reached its highest point when human beings rode horses directly  and when a pull at a rein  the touch of a spur  a squeeze of the knees  or just a cry  could make the horse react in accordance with the human will .   it is no wonder that primitive greeks seeing horsemen invade the comparatively broad thessalian plains  the part of greece most suitable to horsemanship  thought they were seeing a single animal with a human torso and a horse   s body .  thus was invented the centaur .   again  there are    trick drivers .     there are expert    stunt men    who can make an automobile do marvelous things .  one might expect that a new guinea native who had never seen or heard of an automobile before might believe that such stunts were being carried through by a strange and monstrous living organism that had  as part of its structure  a portion with a human appearance within its stomach .   but a person plus a horse is but an imperfect fusion of intelligence  and a person plus an automobile is but an extension of human muscles by mechanical linkages .  a horse can easily disobey signals  or even run away in uncontrollable panic .  and an automobile can break down or skid at an inconvenient moment .   the fusion of human and computer  however  ought to be a much closer approach to the ideal .  it may be an extension of the mind itself as i tried to make plain in foundation   s edge  a multiplication and intensification of sense perception  an incredible extension of the will .   under such circumstances  might not the fusion represent  in a very real sense  a single organism  a kind of cybernetic    centaur    .  and once such a union is established  would the human fraction wish to break it .  would he not feel such a break to be an unbearable loss and be unable to live with the impoverishment of mind and will he would then have to face .  in my novel  golan trevize could break away from the computer at will and suffered no ill effects as a result  but perhaps that is not realistic .     another issue that appears now and then in the robot city series concerns the interaction of robot and robot .   this has not played a part in most of my stories  simply because i generally had a single robot character of importance in any given story and i dealt entirely with the matter of the interaction between that single robot and various human beings .   consider robots in combination .   the first law states that a robot cannot injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   but suppose two robots are involved  and that one of them  through inadvertence  lack of knowledge  or special circumstances  is engaged in a course of action  quite innocently  that will clearly injure a human being   and suppose the second robot  with greater knowledge or insight  is aware of this .  would he not be required by the first law to stop the first robot from committing the injury .  if there were no other way  would he not be required by the first law to destroy the first robot without hesitation or regret .   thus  in my book robots and empire  doubleday         a robot is introduced to whom human beings have been defined as those speaking with a certain accent .  the heroine of the book does not speak with that accent and therefore the robot feels free to kill her .  that robot is promptly destroyed by a second robot .   the situation is similar for the second law  in which robots are forced to obey orders given them by human beings provided those orders do not violate the first law .   if  of two robots  one through inadvertence or lack of understanding does not obey an order  the second must either carry through the order itself  or force the first to do so .   thus  in an intense scene in robots and empire  the villainess gives one robot a direct order .  the robot hesitates because the order may cause harm to the heroine .  for a while  then  there is a confrontation in which the villainess reinforces her own order while a second robot tries to reason the first robot into a greater realization of the harm that will be done to the heroine .  here we have a case where one robot urges another to obey the second law in a truer manner  and to withstand a human being in so doing .     it is the third law  however  that brings up the knottiest problem where robots in combination are concerned .   the third law states that a robot must protect its own existence  where that is consistent with the first and second laws .   but what if two robots are concerned .  is each merely concerned with its own existence  as a literal reading of the third law would make it seem .  or would each robot feel the need for helping the other maintain its own existence .   as i said  this problem never arose with me as long as i dealt with only one robot per story .   sometimes there were other robots but they were distinctly subsidiary characters   merely spear carriers  so to speak .    however  first in the robots of dawn  doubleday         and then in its sequel robots and empire  i had two robots of equal importance .  one of these was r .  daneel olivaw  a humaniform robot  who could not easily be told from a human being  who had earlier appeared in the caves of steel  ooubleday         and in its sequel  the naked sun  ooubleday        .  the other was r .  giskard reventlov  who had a more orthodox metallic appearance .  both robots were advanced to the point where their minds were of human complexity .   it was these two robots who were engaged in the struggle with the villainess  the lady vasilia .  it was giskard who  such were the exigencies of the plot  was being ordered by vasilia to leave the service of gladia  the heroine  and enter her own .  and it was daneel who tenaciously argued the point that giskard ought to remain with gladia .  giskard has the ability to exert a limited mental control over human beings  and daneel points out that vasilia ought to be controlled for gladia   s safety .  he even argues the good of humanity in the abstract     the zeroth law     in favor of such an action .   daneel   s arguments weaken the effect of vasilia   s orders  but not sufficiently .  giskard is made to hesitate  but cannot be forced to take action .   vasilia  however  decides that daneel is too dangerous  if he continues to argue  he might force giskard his way .  she therefore orders her own robots to inactivate daneel and further orders daneel not to resist .  daneel must obey the order and vasilia   s robots advance to the task .   it is then that giskard acts .  her four robots are inactivated and vasilia herself crumples into a forgetful sleep .  later daneel asks giskard to explain what happened .   giskard says     when she ordered the robots to dismantle you  friend daneel  and showed a clear emotion of pleasure at the prospect  your need  added to what the concept of the zeroth law had already done  superseded the second law and rivaled the first law .  it was the combination of the zeroth law  psychohistory  my loyalty to lady gladia  and your need that dictated my action .      daneel now argues that his own need  he being merely a robot  ought not to have influenced giskard at all .  giskard obviously agrees  yet he says      it is a strange thing  friend daneel .  i do not know how it came about .  .  . at the moment when the robots advanced toward you and lady vasilia expressed her savage pleasure  my positronic pathway pattern re formed in an anomalous fashion .  for a moment  i thought of you   as a human being   and i reacted accordingly .      daneel said     that was wrong .      giskard said     i know that .  and yet   and yet  if it were to happen again  i believe the same anomalous change would take place again .      and daneel cannot help but feel that if the situation were reversed  he  too  would act in the same way .   in other words  the robots had reached a stage of complexity where they had begun to lose the distinction between robots and human beings  where they could see each other as    friends     and have the urge to save each other   s existence .       isaac asimov is the author of over     books  including three hugo award winners and numerous bestsellers as well as countless stories and scientific essays .  he was
