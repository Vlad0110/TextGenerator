copyright     about the publisher      begin reading     everything starts somewhere  although many physicists disagree .   but people have always been dimly aware of the problem with the start of things .  they wonder aloud how the snowplow driver gets to work  or how the makers of dictionaries look up the spellings of the words .  yet there is the constant desire to find some point in the twisting  knotting  raveling nets of space time on which a metaphorical finger can be put to indicate that here  here  is the point where it all began     something began when the guild of assassins enrolled mister teatime  who saw things differently from other people  and one of the ways that he saw things differently from other people was in seeing other people as things  later  lord downey of the guild said     we took pity on him because he   d lost both parents at an early age .  i think that  on reflection  we should have wondered a bit more about that     .   but it was much earlier even than that when most people forgot that the very oldest stories are  sooner or later  about blood .  later on they took the blood out to make the stories more acceptable to children  or at least to the people who had to read them to children rather than the children themselves  who  on the whole  are quite keen on blood provided it   s being shed by the deserving    and then wondered where the stories went .   and earlier still when something in the darkness of the deepest caves and gloomiest forests thought  what are they  these creatures .  i will observe them        and much  much earlier than that  when the discworld was formed  drifting onward through space atop four elephants on the shell of the giant turtle  great a   tuin .   possibly  as it moves  it gets tangled like a blind man in a cobwebbed house in those highly specialized little space time strands that try to breed in every history they encounter  stretching them and breaking them and tugging them into new shapes .   or possibly not  of course .  the philosopher didactylos has summed up an alternative hypothesis as    things just happen .  what the hell .         the senior wizards of unseen university stood and looked at the door .   there was no doubt that whoever had shut it wanted it to stay shut .  dozens of nails secured it to the door frame .  planks had been nailed right across .  and finally it had  up until this morning  been hidden by a bookcase that had been put in front of it .      and there   s the sign  ridcully     said the dean .     you have read it  i assume .  you know .  the sign which says    do not  under any circumstances  open this door    .         of course i   ve read it     said ridcully .     why d   yer think i want it opened .         er   why .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      to see why they wanted it shut  of course .       he gestured to modo  the university   s gardener and odd job dwarf  who was standing by with a crowbar .      go to it  lad .      the gardener saluted .     right you are  sir .      against a background of splintering timber  ridcully went on     it says on the plans that this was a bathroom .  there   s nothing frightening about a bathroom  for gods    sake .  i want a bathroom .  i   m fed up with sluicing down with you fellows .  it   s unhygienic .  you can catch stuff .  my father told me that .  where you get lots of people bathing together  the verruca gnome is running around with his little sack .         is that like the tooth fairy .     said the dean sarcastically .      i   m in charge here and i want a bathroom of my own     said ridcully firmly .     and that   s all there is to it  all right .  i want a bathroom in time for hogswatchnight  understand .      and that   s a problem with beginnings  of course .  sometimes  when you   re dealing with occult realms that have quite a different attitude to time  you get the effect a little way before the cause .   from somewhere on the edge of hearing came a glingleglingleglingle noise  like little silver bells .      at about the same time as the archchancellor was laying down the law  susan sto helit was sitting up in bed  reading by candlelight .   frost patterns curled across the windows .   she enjoyed these early evenings .  once she had put the children to bed she was more or less left to herself .  mrs .  gaiter was pathetically scared of giving her any instructions even though she paid susan   s wages .   not that the wages were important  of course .  what was important was that she was being her own person and holding down a real job .  and being a governess was a real job .  the only tricky bit had been the embarrassment when her employer found out that she was a duchess  because in mrs .  gaiter   s book  which was a rather short book with big handwriting  the upper crust wasn   t supposed to work .  it was supposed to loaf around .  it was all susan could do to stop her curtseying when they met .   a flicker made her turn her head .   the candle flame was streaming out horizontally  as though in a howling wind .   she looked up .  the curtains billowed away from the window  which        flung itself open with a clatter .   but there was no wind .   at least  no wind in this world .   images formed in her mind .  a red ball   the sharp smell of snow   and then they were gone  and instead there were        teeth .     said susan  aloud .     teeth  again .      she blinked .  when she opened her eyes the window was  as she knew it would be  firmly shut .  the curtain hung demurely .  the candle flame was innocently upright .  oh  no  not again .  not after all this time .  everything had been going so well        thusan .      she looked around .  her door had been pushed open and a small figure stood there  barefoot in a nightdress .   she sighed .     yes  twyla .         i   m afwaid of the monster in the cellar  thusan .  it   s going to eat me up .      susan shut her book firmly and raised a warning finger .      what have i told you about trying to sound ingratiatingly cute  twyla .     she said .   the little girl said     you said i mustn   t .  you said that exaggerated lisping is a hanging offense and i only do it to get attention .         good .  do you know what monster it is this time .         it   s the big hairy one wif        susan raised the finger .     uh .     she warned .         with eight arms     twyla corrected herself .      what  again .  oh  all right .      she got out of bed and put on her dressing gown  trying to stay quite calm while the child watched her .  so they were coming back .  oh  not the monster in the cellar .  that was all in a day   s work .  but it looked as if she was going to start remembering the future again .   she shook her head .  however far you ran away  you always caught yourself up .   but monsters were easy  at least .  she   d learned how to deal with monsters .  she picked up the poker from the nursery fender and went down the back stairs  with twyla following her .   the gaiters were having a dinner party .  muffled voices came from the direction of the dining room .   then  as she crept past  a door opened and yellow light spilled out and a voice said     ye gawds  there   s a gel in a nightshirt out here with a poker .      she saw figures silhouetted in the light and made out the worried face of mrs .  gaiter .      susan .  er   what are you doing .      susan looked at the poker and then back at the woman .     twyla said she   s afraid of a monster in the cellar  mrs .  gaiter .         and yer going to attack it with a poker  eh .     said one of the guests .  there was a strong atmosphere of brandy and cigars .      yes     said susan simply .      susan   s our governess     said mrs .  gaiter .     er   i told you about her .      there was a change in the expression on the faces peering out from the dining room .  it became a sort of amused respect .      she beats up monsters with a poker .     said someone .      actually  that   s a very clever idea     said someone else .     little gel gets it into her head there   s a monster in the cellar  you go in with the poker and make a few bashing noises while the child listens  and then everything   s all right .  good thinkin     that girl .  ver    sensible .  ver    modern .         is that what you   re doing  susan .     said mrs .  gaiter anxiously .      yes  mrs .  gaiter     said susan obediently .      this i   ve got to watch  by io .  it   s not every day you see monsters beaten up by a gel     said the man behind her .  there was a swish of silk and a cloud of cigar smoke as the diners poured out into the hall .   susan sighed again and went down the cellar stairs  while twyla sat demurely at the top  hugging her knees .   a door opened and shut .   there was a short period of silence and then a terrifying scream .  one woman fainted and a man dropped his cigar .      you don   t have to worry  everything will be all right     said twyla calmly .     she always wins .  everything will be all right .      there were thuds and clangs  and then a whirring noise  and finally a sort of bubbling .   susan pushed open the door .  the poker was bent at right angles .  there was nervous applause .      ver    well done     said a guest .     ver    persykological .  clever idea  that  bendin    the poker .  and i expect you   re not afraid any more  eh  little girl .         no     said twyla .      ver    persykological .         susan says don   t get afraid  get angry     said twyla .      er  thank you  susan     said mrs .  gaiter  now a trembling bouquet of nerves .     and  er  now  sir geoffrey  if you   d all like to come back into the parlor   i mean  the drawing room        the party went back up the hall .  the last thing susan heard before the door shut was    dashed convincin     the way she bent the poker like that        she waited .      have they all gone  twyla .         yes  susan .         good .     susan went back into the cellar and emerged towing something large and hairy with eight legs .  she managed to haul it up the steps and down the other passage to the back yard  where she kicked it out .  it would evaporate before dawn .      that   s what we do to monsters     she said .   twyla watched carefully .      and now it   s bed for you  my girl     said susan  picking her up .      c   n i have the poker in my room for the night .         all right .         it only kills monsters  doesn   t it    .     the child said sleepily  as susan carried her upstairs .      that   s right     susan said .     all kinds .      she put the girl to bed next to her brother and leaned the poker against the toy cupboard .   the poker was made of some cheap metal with a brass knob on the end .  she would  susan reflected  give quite a lot to be able to use it on the children   s previous governess .      g   night .         good night .      she went back to her own small bedroom and got back into bed  watching the curtains suspiciously .   it would be nice to think she   d imagined it .  it would also be stupid to think that  too .  but she   d been nearly normal for two years now  making her own way in the real world  never remembering the future at all     perhaps she had just dreamed things  but even dreams could be real     .   she tried to ignore the long thread of wax that suggested the candle had  just for a few seconds  streamed in the wind .      as susan sought sleep  lord downey sat in his study catching up on the paperwork .   lord downey was an assassin .  or  rather  an assassin .  the capital letter was important .  it separated those curs who went around murdering people for money from the gentlemen who were occasionally consulted by other gentlemen who wished to have removed  for a consideration  any inconvenient razor blades from the candyfloss of life .   the members of the guild of assassins considered themselves cultured men who enjoyed good music and food and literature .  and they knew the value of human life .  to a penny  in many cases .   lord downey   s study was oak paneled and well carpeted .  the furniture was very old and quite worn  but the wear was the wear that comes only when very good furniture is carefully used over several centuries .  it was matured furniture .   a log fire burned in the grate .  in front of it a couple of dogs were sleeping in the tangled way of large hairy dogs everywhere .   apart from the occasional doggy snore or the crackle of a shifting log  there were no other sounds but the scratching of lord downey   s pen and the ticking of the grandfather clock by the door   small  private noises which only served to define the silence .   at least  this was the case until someone cleared their throat .   the sound suggested very clearly that the purpose of the exercise was not to erase the presence of a troublesome bit of biscuit  but merely to indicate in the politest possible way the presence of the throat .   downey stopped writing but did not raise his head .   then  after what appeared to be some consideration  he said in a businesslike voice     the doors are locked .  the windows are barred .  the dogs do not appear to have woken up .  the squeaky floorboards haven   t .  other little arrangements which i will not specify seem to have been bypassed .  that severely limits the possibilities .  i really doubt that you are a ghost and gods generally do not announce themselves so politely .  you could  of course  be death  but i don   t believe he bothers with such niceties and  besides  i am feeling quite well .  hmm .      something hovered in the air in front of his desk .      my teeth are in fine condition so you are unlikely to be the tooth fairy .  i   ve always found that a stiff brandy before bedtime quite does away with the need for the sandman .  and  since i can carry a tune quite well  i suspect i   m not likely to attract the attention of old man trouble .  hmm .      the figure drifted a little nearer .      i suppose a gnome could get through a mousehole  but i have traps down     downey went on .     bogeymen can walk through walls but would be very loath to reveal themselves .  really  you have me at a loss .  hmm .      and then he looked up .   a gray robe hung in the air .  it appeared to be occupied  in that it had a shape  although the occupant was not visible .   the prickly feeling crept over downey that the occupant wasn   t invisible  merely not  in any physical sense  there at all .      good evening     he said .   the robe said  good evening  lord downey .   his brain registered the words .  his ears swore they hadn   t heard them .   but you did not become head of the assassins    guild by taking fright easily .  besides  the thing wasn   t frightening .  it was  thought downey  astonishingly dull .  if monotonous drabness could take on a shape  this would be the shape it would choose .      you appear to be a specter     he said .   our nature is not a matter for discussion  arrived in his head .  we offer you a commission .      you wish someone inhumed .     said downey .   brought to an end .   downey considered this .  it was not as unusual as it appeared .  there were precedents .  anyone could buy the services of the guild .  several zombies had  in the past  employed the guild to settle scores with their murderers .  in fact the guild  he liked to think  practiced the ultimate democracy .  you didn   t need intelligence  social position  beauty or charm to hire it .  you just needed money which  unlike the other stuff  was available to everyone .  except for the poor  of course  but there was no helping some people .      brought to an end       that was an odd way of putting it .      we can       he began .   the payment will reflect the difficulty of the task .      our scale of fees        the payment will be three million dollars .   downey sat back .  that was four times higher than any fee yet earned by any member of the guild  and that had been a special family rate  including overnight guests .      no questions asked  i assume .     he said  buying time .   no questions answered .      but does the suggested fee represent the difficulty involved .  the client is heavily guarded .      not guarded at all .  but almost certainly impossible to delete with conventional weapons .   downey nodded .  this was not necessarily a big problem  he said to himself .  the guild had amassed quite a few unconventional weapons over the years .  delete .  an unusual way of putting it        we like to know for whom we are working     he said .   we are sure you do .      i mean that we need to know your name .  or names .  in strict client confidentiality  of course .  we have to write something down in our files .      you may think of us as   the auditors .      really .  what is it you audit .      everything .      i think we need to know something about you .      we are the people with three million dollars .   downey took the point  although he didn   t like it .  three million dollars could buy a lot of no questions .      really .     he said .     in the circumstances  since you are a new client  i think we would like payment in advance .      as you wish .  the gold is now in your vaults .      you mean that it will shortly be in our vaults     said downey .   no .  it has always been in your vaults .  we know this because we have just put it there .   downey watched the empty hood for a moment  and then without shifting his gaze he reached out and picked up the speaking tube .      mr .  winvoe .     he said  after whistling into it .     ah .  good .  tell me  how much do we have in our vaults at the moment .  oh  approximately .  to the nearest million  say .     he held the tube away from his ear for a moment  and then spoke into it again .     well  be a good chap and check anyway  will you .      he hung up the tube and placed his hands flat on the desk in front of him .      can i offer you a drink while we wait .     he said .   yes .  we believe so .   downey stood up with some relief and walked over to his large drinks cabinet .  his hand hovered over the guild   s ancient and valuable tantalus  with its labeled decanters of mur  nig  trop and yeksihw .       and what would you like to drink .     he said  wondering where the auditor kept its mouth .  his hand hovered for just a moment over the smallest decanter  marked nosiop .   we do not drink .      but you did just say i could offer you a drink        indeed .  we judge you fully capable of performing that action .      ah .     downey   s hand hesitated over the whiskey decanter  and then he thought better of it .  at that point  the speaking tube whistled .      yes  mr .  winvoe .  really .  indeed .  i myself have frequently found loose change under sofa cushions  it   s amazing how it mou   no  no  i wasn   t being   yes  i did have some reason to   no  no blame attaches to you in any   no  i could hardly see how it   yes  go and have a rest  what a good idea .  thank you .      he hung up the tube again .  the cowl hadn   t moved .      we will need to know where  when and  of course  who     he said  after a moment .   the cowl nodded .  the location is not on any map .  we would like the task to be completed within the week .  this is essential .  as for the who     a drawing appeared on downey   s desk and in his head arrived the words  let us call him the fat man .      is this a joke .     said downey .   we do not joke .   no  you don   t  do you  downey thought .  he drummed his fingers .      there are many who would say this   person does not exist     he said .   he must exist .  how else could you so readily recognize his picture .  and many are in correspondence with him .      well  yes  of course  in a sense he exists        in a sense everything exists .  it is cessation of existence that concerns us here .      finding him would be a little difficult .      you will find persons on any street who can tell you his approximate address .      yes  of course     said downey  wondering why anyone would call them    persons .     it was an odd usage .     but  as you say  i doubt that they could give a map reference .  and even then  how could the   the fat man be inhumed .  a glass of poisoned sherry  perhaps .      the cowl had no face to crack a smile .   you misunderstand the nature of employment  it said in downey   s head .   he bridled at this .  assassins were never employed .  they were engaged or retained or commissioned  but never employed .  only servants were employed .      what is it that i misunderstand  exactly .     he said .   we pay .  you find the ways and means .   the cowl began to fade .      how can i contact you .     said downey .   we will contact you .  we know where you are .  we know where everyone is .   the figure vanished .  at the same moment the door was flung open to reveal the distraught figure of mr .  winvoe  the guild treasurer .      excuse me  my lord  but i really had to come up .     he flung some disks on the desk .     look at them .      downey carefully picked up a golden circle .  it looked like a small coin  but        no denomination .     said winvoe .     no heads  no tails  no milling .  it   s just a blank disk .  they   re all just blank disks .      downey opened his mouth to say     valueless .     he realized that he was half hoping that this was the case .  if they  whoever they were  had paid in worthless metal then there wasn   t even the glimmering of a contract .  but he could see this wasn   t the case .  assassins learned to recognize money early in their careers .      blank disks     he said     of pure gold .      winvoe nodded mutely .      that     said downey     will do nicely .         it must be magical .     said winvoe .     and we never accept magical money .      downey bounced the coin on the desk a couple of times .  it made a satisfyingly rich thunking noise .  it wasn   t magical .  magical money would look real  because its whole purpose was to deceive .  but this didn   t need to ape something as human and adulterated as mere currency .  this is gold  it told his fingers .  take it or leave it .   downey sat and thought  while winvoe stood and worried .      we   ll take it     he said .      but           thank you  mr .  winvoe .  that is my decision     said downey .  he stared into space for a while  and then smiled .     is mister teatime still in the building .      winvoe stood back .     i thought the council had agreed to dismiss him     he said stiffly .     after that business with           mister teatime does not see the world in quite the same way as other people     said downey  picking up the picture from his desk and looking at it thoughtfully .      well  indeed  i think that is certainly true .         please send him up .      the guild attracted all sorts of people  downey reflected .  he found himself wondering how it had come to attract winvoe  for one thing .  it was hard to imagine him stabbing anyone in the heart in case he got blood on the victim   s wallet .  whereas mister teatime     the problem was that the guild took young boys and gave them a splendid education and incidentally taught them how to kill  cleanly and dispassionately  for money and for the good of society  or at least that part of society that had money  and what other kind of society was there .   but very occasionally you found you   d got someone like mister teatime  to whom the money was merely a distraction .  mister teatime had a truly brilliant mind  but it was brilliant like a fractured mirror  all marvelous facets and rainbows but  ultimately  also something that was broken .   mister teatime enjoyed himself too much .  and other people  also .   downey had privately decided that some time soon mister teatime was going to meet with an accident .  like many people with no actual morals  lord downey did have standards  and teatime repelled him .  assassination was a careful game  usually played against people who knew the rules themselves or at least could afford the services of those who did .  there was considerable satisfaction in a clean kill .  what there wasn   t supposed to be was pleasure in a messy one .  that sort of thing led to talk .   on the other hand  teatime   s corkscrew of a mind was exactly the tool to deal with something like this .  and if he didn   t   well  that was hardly downey   s fault  was it .   he turned his attention to the paperwork for a while .  it was amazing how the stuff mounted up .  but you had to deal with it .  it wasn   t as though they were murderers  after all     there was a knock at the door .  he pushed the paperwork aside and sat back .      come in  mister teatime     he said .  it never hurt to put the other fellow slightly in awe of you .   in fact the door was opened by one of the guild   s servants  carefully balancing a tea tray .      ah  carter     said lord downey  recovering magnificently .     just put it on the table over there  will you .         yes  sir     said carter .  he turned and nodded .     sorry  sir  i will go and fetch another cup directly  sir .         what .         for your visitor  sir .         what visitor .  oh  when mister teati        he stopped .  he turned .   there was a young man sitting on the hearth rug  playing with the dogs .      mister teatime .         it   s pronounced teh ah tim eh  sir     said teatime  with just a hint of reproach .     everyone gets it wrong  sir .         how did you do that .         pretty well  sir .  i got mildly scorched on the last few feet  of course .      there were some lumps of soot on the hearth rug .  downey realized he   d heard them fall  but that hadn   t been particularly extraordinary .  no one could get down the chimney .  there was a heavy grid firmly in place near the top of the flue .      but there   s a blocked in fireplace behind the old library     said teatime  apparently reading his thoughts .     the flues connect  under the bars .  it was really a stroll  sir .         really           oh  yes  sir .      downey nodded .  the tendency of old buildings to be honeycombed with sealed chimney flues was a fact you learned early in your career .  and then  he told himself  you forgot .  it always paid to put the other fellow in awe of you  too .  he had forgotten they taught that  too .      the dogs seem to like you     he said .      i get on well with animals  sir .      teatime   s face was young and open and friendly .  or  at least  it smiled all the time .  but the effect was spoiled for most people by the fact that it had only one eye .  some unexplained accident had taken the other one  and the missing orb had been replaced by a ball of glass .  the result was disconcerting .  but what bothered lord downey far more was the man   s other eye  the one that might loosely be called normal .  he   d never seen such a small and sharp pupil .  teatime looked at the world through a pinhole .   he found he   d retreated behind his desk again .  there was that about teatime .  you always felt happier if you had something between you and him .      you like animals  do you .     he said .     i have a report here that says you nailed sir george   s dog to the ceiling .         couldn   t have it barking while i was working  sir .         some people would have drugged it .         oh .     teatime looked despondent for a moment  but then he brightened .     but i definitely fulfilled the contract  sir .  there can be no doubt about that  sir .  i checked sir george   s breathing with a mirror as instructed .  it   s in my report .         yes  indeed .     apparently the man   s head had been several feet from his body at that point .  it was a terrible thought that teatime might see nothing incongruous about this .      and   the servants    .     he said .      couldn   t have them bursting in  sir .      downey nodded  half hypnotized by the glassy stare and the pinhole eyeball .  no  you couldn   t have them bursting in .  and an assassin might well face serious professional opposition  possibly even by people trained by the same teachers .  but an old man and a maidservant who   d merely had the misfortune to be in the house at the time     there was no actual rule  downey had to admit .  it was just that  over the years  the guild had developed a certain ethos and members tended to be very neat about their work  even shutting doors behind them and generally tidying up as they went .  hurting the harmless was worse than a transgression against the moral fabric of society  it was a breach of good manners .  it was worse even than that .  it was bad taste .  but there was no actual rule        that was all right  wasn   t it  sir .     said teatime  with apparent anxiety .      it  uh   lacked elegance     said downey .      ah .  thank you  sir .  i am always happy to be corrected .  i shall remember that next time .      downey took a deep breath .      it   s about that i wish to talk     he said .  he held up the picture of   what had the thing called him .    the fat man .      as a matter of interest     he said     how would you go about inhuming this   gentleman .      anyone else  he was sure  would have burst out laughing .  they would have said things like    is this a joke  sir .     teatime merely leaned forward  with a curious intent expression .      difficult  sir .         certainly     downey agreed .      i would need some time to prepare a plan  sir     teatime went on .      of course  and        there was a knock at the door and carter came in with another cup and saucer .  he nodded respectfully to lord downey and crept out again .      right  sir     said teatime .      i   m sorry .     said downey  momentarily distracted .      i have now thought of a plan  sir     said teatime  patiently .      you have .         yes  sir .         as quickly as that .         yes  sir .         ye gods .         well  sir  you know we are encouraged to consider hypothetical problems    .         oh  yes .  a very valuable exercise       downey stopped  and then looked shocked .      you mean you have actually devoted time to considering how to inhume the hogfather .     he said weakly .     you   ve actually sat down and thought out how to do it .  you   ve actually devoted your spare time to the problem .         oh  yes  sir .  and the soul cake duck .  and the sandman .  and death .      downey blinked again .     you   ve actually sat down and considered how to           yes  sir .  i   ve amassed quite an interesting file .  in my own time  of course .         i want to be quite certain about this  mister teatime .  you   have   applied   yourself to a study of ways of killing death .         only as a hobby  sir .         well  yes  hobbies  yes  i mean  i used to collect butterflies myself     said downey  recalling those first moments of awakening pleasure at the use of poison and the pin     but           actually  sir  the basic methodology is exactly the same as it would be for a human .  opportunity  geography  technique   you just have to work with the known facts about the individual concerned .  of course  with this one such a lot is known .         and you   ve worked it all out  have you .     said downey  almost fascinated .      oh  a long time ago  sir .         when  may i ask .         i think it was when i was lying in bed one hogswatchnight  sir .      my gods  thought downey  and to think that i just used to listen for sleigh bells .      my word     he said aloud .      i may have to check some details  sir .  i   d appreciate access to some of the books in the dark library .  but  yes  i think i can see the basic shape .         and yet   this person   some people might say that he is technically immortal .         everyone has their weak point  sir .         even death .         oh  yes .  absolutely .  very much so .         really .      downey drummed his fingers on the desk again .  the boy couldn   t possibly have a real plan  he told himself .  he certainly had a skewed mind   skewed .  it was a positive helix   but the fat man wasn   t just another target in some mansion somewhere .  it was reasonable to assume that people had tried to trap him before .   he felt happy about this .  teatime would fail  and possibly even fail fatally if his plan was stupid enough .  and maybe the guild would lose the gold  but maybe not .      very well     he said .     i don   t need to know what your plan is .         that   s just as well  sir .         what do you mean .         because i don   t propose to tell you  sir .  you   d be obliged to disapprove of it .         i am amazed that you are so confident that it can work  teatime .         i just think logically about the problem  sir     said the boy .  he sounded reproachful .      logically .     said downey .      i suppose i just see things differently from other people     said teatime .      it was a quiet day for susan  although on the way to the park gawain trod on a crack in the pavement .  on purpose .   one of the many terrors conjured up by the previous governess   s happy way with children had been the bears that waited around in the street to eat you if you stood on the cracks .   susan had taken to carrying the poker under her respectable coat .  one wallop generally did the trick .  they were amazed that anyone else saw them .      gawain .     she said  eyeing a nervous bear who had suddenly spotted her and was now trying to edge away nonchalantly .      yes .         you meant to tread on that crack so that i   d have to thump some poor creature whose only fault is wanting to tear you limb from limb .         i was just skipping           quite .  real children don   t go hoppity skip unless they are on drugs .      he grinned at her .      if i catch you being twee again i will knot your arms behind your head     said susan levelly .   he nodded  and went to push twyla off the swings .   susan relaxed  satisfied .  it was her personal discovery .  ridiculous threats didn   t worry them at all  but they were obeyed .  especially the ones in graphic detail .   the previous governess had used various monsters and bogeymen as a form of discipline .  there was always something waiting to eat or carry off bad boys and girls for crimes like stuttering or defiantly and aggravatingly persisting in writing with their left hand .  there was always a scissor man waiting for a little girl who sucked her thumb  always a bogeyman in the cellar .  of such bricks is the innocence of childhood constructed .   susan   s attempts at getting them to disbelieve in the things only caused the problems to get worse .   twyla had started to wet the bed .  this may have been a crude form of defense against the terrible clawed creature that she was certain lived under it .   susan had found out about this one the first night  when the child had woken up crying because of a bogeyman in the closet .   she   d sighed and gone to have a look .  she   d been so angry that she   d pulled it out  hit it over the head with the nursery poker  dislocated its shoulder as a means of emphasis and kicked it out of the back door .   the children refused to disbelieve in the monsters because  frankly  they knew damn well the things were there .   but she   d found that they could  very firmly  also believe in the poker .   now she sat down on a bench and read a book .  she made a point of taking the children  every day  somewhere where they could meet others of the same age .  if they got the hang of the playground  she thought  adult life would hold no fears .  besides  it was nice to hear the voices of little children at play  provided you took care to be far enough away not to hear what they were actually saying .   there were lessons later on .  these were going a lot better now she   d got rid of the reading books about bouncy balls and dogs called spot .  she   d got gawain on to the military campaigns of general tacticus  which were suitably bloodthirsty but  more importantly  considered too difficult for a child .  as a result his vocabulary was doubling every week and he could already use words like    disemboweled    in everyday conversation .  after all  what was the point of teaching children to be children .  they were naturally good at it .   and she was  to her mild horror  naturally good with them .  she wondered suspiciously if this was a family trait .  and if  to judge by the way her hair so readily knotted itself into a prim bun  she was destined for jobs like this for the rest of her life .   it was her parents    fault .  they hadn   t meant it to turn out like this .  at least  she hoped charitably that they hadn   t .   they   d wanted to protect her  to keep her way from the worlds outside this one  from what people thought of as the occult  from   well  from her grandfather  to put it bluntly .  this had  she felt  left her a little twisted up .   of course  to be fair  that was a parent   s job .  the world was so full of sharp bends that if they didn   t put a few twists in you  you wouldn   t stand a chance of fitting in .  and they   d been conscientious and kind and given her a good home and even an education .   it had been a good education  too .  but it had only been later on that she   d realized that it had been an education in  well  education .  it meant that if ever anyone needed to calculate the volume of a cone  then they could confidently call on susan sto helit .  anyone at a loss to recall the campaigns of general tacticus or the square root of    .   would not find her wanting .  if you needed someone who could talk about household items and things to buy in the shops in five languages  then susan was at the head of the queue .  education had been easy .   learning things had been harder .   getting an education was a bit like a communicable sexual disease .  it made you unsuitable for a lot of jobs and then you had the urge to pass it on .   she   d become a governess .  it was one of the few jobs a known lady could do .  and she   d taken to it well .  she   d sworn that if she did indeed ever find herself dancing on rooftops with chimney sweeps she   d beat herself to death with her own umbrella .   after tea she read them a story .  they liked her stories .  the one in the book was pretty awful  but the susan version was well received .  she translated as she read .         and then jack chopped down the beanstalk  adding murder and ecological vandalism to the theft  enticement and trespass charges already mentioned  but he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done .  which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you   re a hero  because no one asks inconvenient questions .  and now     she closed the book with a snap     it   s time for bed .      the previous governess had taught them a prayer which included the hope that some god or other would take their soul if they died while they were asleep and  if susan was any judge  had the underlying message that this would be a good thing .   one day  susan averred  she   d hunt that woman down .      susan     said twyla  from somewhere under the blankets .      yes .         you know last week we wrote letters to the hogfather .         yes .         only   in the park rachel says he doesn   t exist and it   s your father really .  and everyone else said she was right .      there was a rustle from the other bed .  twyla   s brother had turned over and was listening surreptitiously .   oh dear  thought susan .  she had hoped she could avoid this .  it was going to be like that business with the soul cake duck all over again .      does it matter if you get the presents anyway .     she said  making a direct appeal to greed .         es .      oh dear  oh dear .  susan sat down on the bed  wondering how the hell to get through this .  she patted the one visible hand .      look at it this way  then     she said  and took a deep mental breath .     wherever people are obtuse and absurd   and wherever they have  by even the most generous standards  the attention span of a small chicken in a hurricane and the investigative ability of a one legged cockroach   and wherever people are inanely credulous  pathetically attached to the certainties of the nursery and  in general  have as much grasp of the realities of the physical universe as an oyster has of mountaineering   yes  twyla  there is a hogfather .      there was silence from under the bedclothes  but she sensed that the tone of voice had worked .  the words had meant nothing .  that  as her grandfather might have said  was humanity all over .      g   night .         good night     said susan .      it wasn   t even a bar .  it was just a room where people drank while they waited for other people with whom they had business .  the business usually involved the transfer of ownership of something from one person to another  but then  what business doesn   t .   five businessmen sat round a table  lit by a candle stuck in a saucer .  there was an open bottle between them .  they were taking some care to keep it away from the candle flame .         s gone six     said one  a huge man with dreadlocks and a beard you could keep goats in .     the clocks struck ages ago .  he ain   t coming .  let   s go .         sit down  will you .  assassins are always late .     cos of style  right .         this one   s mental .         eccentric .         what   s the difference .         a bag of cash .      the three that hadn   t spoken yet looked at one another .      what   s this .  you never said he was an assassin     said chickenwire .     he never said the guy was an assassin  did he  banjo .      there was a sound like distant thunder .  it was banjo lilywhite clearing his throat .      dat   s right     said a voice from the upper slopes .     youse never said .      the others waited until the rumble died away .  even banjo   s voice hulked .      he   s      the first speaker waved his hands vaguely  trying to get across the point that someone was a hamper of food  several folding chairs  a tablecloth  an assortment of cooking gear and an entire colony of ants short of a picnic      mental .  and he   s got a funny eye .         it   s just glass  all right .     said the one known as catseye  signaling a waiter for four beers and a glass of milk .     and he   s paying ten thousand dollars each .  i don   t care what kind of eye he   s got .         i heard it was made of the same stuff they make them fortune telling crystals out of .  you can   t tell me that   s right .  and he looks at you with it     said the first speaker .  he was known as peachy  although no one had ever found out why .    catseye sighed .  certainly there was something odd about mister teatime  there was no doubt about that .  but there was something weird about all assassins .  and the man paid well .  lots of assassins used informers and locksmiths .  it was against the rules  technically  but standards were going down everywhere  weren   t they .  usually they paid you late and sparsely  as if they were doing the favor .  but teatime was okay .  true  after a few minutes talking to him your eyes began to water and you felt you needed to scrub your skin even on the inside  but no one was perfect  were they .   peachy leaned forward .     you know what .     he said .     i reckon he could be here already .  in disguise .  laughing at us .  well  if he   s in here laughing at us       he cracked his knuckles .   medium dave lilywhite  the last of the five  looked around .  there were indeed a number of solitary figures in the low  dark room .  most of them wore cloaks with big hoods .  they sat alone  in corners  hidden by the hoods .  none of them looked very friendly .      don   t be daft  peachy     catseye murmured .      that   s the sort of thing they do     peachy insisted .     they   re masters of disguise .         with that eye of his .         that guy sitting by the fire has got an eye patch     said medium dave .  medium dave didn   t speak much .  he watched a lot .   the others turned to stare .      he   ll wait till we   re off our guard then go ahahaha     said peachy .      they can   t kill you unless it   s for money     said catseye .  but now there was a soup  on of doubt in his voice .   they kept their eyes on the hooded man .  he kept his eye on them .   if asked to describe what they did for a living  the five men around the table would have said something like    this and that    or    the best i can     although in banjo   s case he   d have probably said    dur .     they were  by the standards of an uncaring society  criminals  although they wouldn   t have thought of themselves as such and couldn   t even spell words like    nefarious .     what they generally did was move things around .  sometimes the things were on the wrong side of a steel door  say  or in the wrong house .  sometimes the things were in fact people who were far too unimportant to trouble the assassins    guild with  but who were nevertheless inconveniently positioned where they were and could much better be located on  for example  a sea bed somewhere .   none of the five belonged to any formal guild and they generally found their clients among those people who  for their own dark reasons  didn   t want to put the guilds to any trouble  sometimes because they were guild members themselves .  they had plenty of work .  there was always something that needed transferring from a to b or  of course  to the bottom of the c .      any minute now     said peachy  as the waiter brought their beers .   banjo cleared his throat .  this was a sign that another thought had arrived .      what i don    unnerstan     he said     is           yes .     said his brother .         what i don    unnerstan is  how longaz diz place had waiters .         good evening     said teatime  putting down the tray .   they stared at him in silence .   he gave them a friendly smile .   peachy   s huge hand slapped the table .      you crept up on us  you little       he began .   men in their line of business develop a certain prescience .  medium dave and catseye  who were sitting on either side of peachy  leaned away nonchalantly .      hi .     said teatime .  there was a blur  and a knife shuddered in the table between peachy   s thumb and index finger .   he looked down at it in horror .      my name   s teatime     said teatime .     which one are you .            m   peachy     said peachy  still staring at the vibrating knife .      that   s an interesting name     said teatime .     why are you called peachy  peachy .      medium dave coughed .   peachy looked up into teatime   s face .  the glass eye was a mere ball of faintly glowing gray .  the other eye was a little dot in a sea of white .  peachy   s only contact with intelligence had been to beat it up and rob it whenever possible  but a sudden sense of self preservation glued him to his chair .         cos i don   t shave     he said .      peachy don   t like blades  mister     said catseye .      and do you have a lot of friends  peachy .     said teatime .      got a few  yeah        with a sudden whirl of movement that made the men start  teatime spun away  grabbed a chair  swung it up to the table and sat down on it .  three of them had already got their hands on their swords .      i don   t have many     he said  apologetically .     don   t seem to have the knack .  on the other hand   i don   t seem to have any enemies at all .  not one .  isn   t that nice .         teatime had been thinking  in the cracking  buzzing fireworks display that was his head .  what he had been thinking about was immortality .   he might have been quite  quite insane  but he was no fool .  there were  in the assassins    guild  a number of paintings and busts of famous members who had  in the past  put   no  of course  that wasn   t right .  there were paintings and busts of the famous clients of members  with a noticeably modest brass plaque screwed somewhere nearby  bearing some unassuming little comment like    departed this vale of tears on grune    year of the sideways leech  with the assistance of the hon .  k .  w .  dobson  viper house  .     many fine old educational establishments had dignified memorials in some hall listing the old boys who had laid down their lives for monarch and country .  the guild   s was very similar  except for the question of whose life had been laid .   every guild member wanted to be up there somewhere .  because getting up there represented immortality .  and the bigger your client  the more incredibly discreet and restrained would be the little brass plaque  so that everyone couldn   t help but notice your name .   in fact  if you were very  very renowned  they wouldn   t even have to write down your name at all     the men around the table watched him .  it was always hard to know what banjo was thinking  or even if he was thinking at all  but the other four were thinking along the lines of  bumptious little twit  like all assassins .  thinks he knows it all .  i could take him down one handed  no trouble .  but   you hear stories .  those eyes give me the creeps        so what   s the job .     said chickenwire .      we don   t do jobs     said teatime .     we perform services .  and the service will earn each of you ten thousand dollars .         that   s a lot more   n thieves    guild rate     said medium dave .      i   ve never liked the thieves    guild     said teatime  without turning his head .      why not .         they ask too many questions .         we don   t ask questions     said chickenwire quickly .      we shall suit one another perfectly     said teatime .     do have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little troupe .      chickenwire saw medium dave   s lips start to frame the opening letters    who       these letters he deemed inauspicious at this time .  he kicked medium dave   s leg under the table .   the door opened slightly .  a figure came in  but only just .  it inserted itself in the gap and sidled along the wall in a manner calculated not to attract attention .  calculated  that is  by someone not good at this sort of calculation .   it looked at them over its turned up collar .      that   s a wizard     said peachy .   the figure hurried over and dragged up a chair .      no  i   m not .     it hissed .     i   m incognito .         right  mr .  gnito     said medium dave .     you   re just someone in a pointy hat .  this is my brother banjo  that   s peachy  this is chick        the wizard looked desperately at teatime .      i didn   t want to come .         mr .  sideney here is indeed a wizard     said teatime .     a student  anyway .  but down on his luck at the moment  hence his willingness to join us on this venture .         exactly how far down on his luck .     said medium dave .   the wizard tried not to meet anyone   s gaze .      i made a misjudgment to do with a wager     he said .      lost a bet  you mean .     said chickenwire .      i paid up on time     said sideney .      yes  but chrysoprase the troll has this odd little thing about money that turns into lead the next day     said teatime cheerfully .     so our friend needs to earn a little cash in a hurry and in a climate where arms and legs stay on .         no one said anything about there being magic in all this     said peachy .      our destination is   probably you should think of it as something like a wizard   s tower  gentlemen     said teatime .      it isn   t an actual wizard   s tower  is it .     said medium dave .     they got a very odd sense of humor when it comes to booby traps .         no .         guards .         i believe so .  according to legend .  but nothing very much .      medium dave narrowed his eyes .     there   s valuable stuff in this   tower .         oh  yes .         why ain   t there many guards  then .         the   person who owns the property probably does not realize the value of what   of what they have .         locks .     said medium dave .      on our way we shall be picking up a locksmith .         who .         mr .  brown .      they nodded .  everyone   at least  everyone in    the business     and everyone in    the business    knew what    the business    was  and if you didn   t know what    the business    was you weren   t a businessman   knew mr .  brown .  his presence anywhere around a job gave it a certain kind of respectability .  he was a neat  elderly man who   d invented most of the tools in his big leather bag .  no matter what cunning you   d used to get into a place  or overcome a small army  or find the secret treasure room  sooner or later you sent for mr .  brown  who   d turn up with his leather bag and his little springy things and his little bottles of strange alchemy and his neat little boots .  and he   d do nothing for ten minutes but look at the lock  and then he   d select a piece of bent metal from a ring of several hundred almost identical pieces  and under an hour later he   d be walking away with a neat ten percent of the takings .  of course  you didn   t have to use mr .  brown   s services .  you could always opt to spend the rest of your life looking at a locked door .      all right .  where is this place .     said peachy .   teatime turned and smiled at him .     if i   m paying you  why isn   t it me who   s asking the questions .      peachy didn   t even try to outstare the glass eye a second time .      just want to be prepared  that   s all     he mumbled .      good reconnaissance is the essence of a successful operation     said teatime .  he turned and looked up at the bulk that was banjo and added     what is this .         this is banjo     said medium dave  rolling himself a cigarette .      does it do tricks .      time stood still for a moment .  the other men looked at medium dave .  he was known to ankh morpork   s professional underclass as a thoughtful  patient man  and considered something of an intellectual because some of his tattoos were spelled right .  he was reliable in a tight spot and  above all  he was honest  because good criminals have to be honest .  if he had a fault  it was a tendency to deal out terminal and definitive retribution to anyone who said anything about his brother .   if he had a virtue  it was a tendency to pick his time .  medium dave   s fingers tucked the tobacco into the paper and raised it to his lips .      no     he said .   chickenwire tried to defrost the conversation .     he   s not what you   d call bright  but he   s always useful .  he can lift two men in each hand .  by their necks .         yur     said banjo .      he looks like a volcano     said teatime .      really .     said medium dave lilywhite .  chickenwire reached out hastily and pushed him back down in his seat .   teatime turned and smiled at him .      i do so hope we   re going to be friends  mr .  medium dave     he said .     it really hurts to think i might not be among friends .     he gave him another bright smile .  then he turned back to the rest of the table .      are we resolved  gentlemen .      they nodded .  there was some reluctance  given the consensus view that teatime belonged in a room with soft walls  but ten thousand dollars was ten thousand dollars  possibly even more .      good     said teatime .  he looked banjo up and down .     then i suppose we might as well make a start .      and he hit banjo very hard in the mouth .      death in person did not turn up upon the cessation of every life .  it was not necessary .  governments govern  but prime ministers and presidents do not personally turn up in people   s homes to tell them how to run their lives  because of the mortal danger this would present .  there are laws instead .   but from time to time death checked up to see that things were functioning properly or  to put it another and more accurate way  properly ceasing to function in the less significant areas of his jurisdiction .   and now he walked through dark seas .   silt rose in clouds around his feet as he strode along the trench bottom .  his robes floated out around him .   there was silence  pressure and utter  utter darkness .  but there was life down here  even this far below the waves .  there were giant squid  and lobsters with teeth on their eyelids .  there were spidery things with their stomachs on their feet  and fish that made their own light .  it was a quiet  black nightmare world  but life lives everywhere that life can .  where life can   t  this takes a little longer .   death   s destination was a slight rise in the trench floor .  already the water around him was getting warmer and more populated  by creatures that looked as though they had been put together from the bits left over from everything else .   unseen but felt  a vast column of scalding hot water was welling up from a fissure .  somewhere below were rocks heated to near incandescence by the disc   s magical field .   spires of minerals had been deposited around this vent .  and  in this tiny oasis  a type of life had grown up .  it did not need air or light .  it did not even need food in the way that most other species would understand the term .   it just grew at the edge of the streaming column of water  looking like a cross between a worm and a flower .   death kneeled down and peered at it  because it was so small .  but for some reason  in this world without eyes or light  it was also a brilliant red .  the profligacy of life in these matters never ceased to amaze him .   he reached inside his robe and pulled out a small roll of black material  like a jeweler   s tool kit .  with great care he took from one of its pouches a scythe about an inch long  and held it expectantly between thumb and forefinger .   somewhere overhead a shard of rock was dislodged by a stray current and tumbled down  raising little puffs of silt as it bounced off the tubes .   it landed just beside the living flower and then rolled  wrenching it from the rock .   death flicked the tiny scythe just as the bloom faded     the omnipotent eyesight of various supernatural entities is often remarked upon .  it is said they can see the fall of every sparrow .   and this may be true .  but there is only one who is always there when it hits the ground .   the soul of the tube worm was very small and uncomplicated .  it wasn   t bothered about sin .  it had never coveted its neighbor   s polyps .  it had never gambled or drunk strong liquor .  it had never bothered itself with questions like    why am i here .     because it had no concept at all of    here    or  for that matter  of    i .      nevertheless  something was cut free under the surgical edge of the scythe and vanished in the roiling waters .   death carefully put the instrument away and stood up .  all was well  things were functioning satisfactorily  and        but they weren   t .   in the same way that the best of engineers can hear the tiny change that signals a bearing going bad long before the finest of instruments would detect anything wrong  death picked up a discord in the symphony of the world .  it was one wrong note among billions but all the more noticeable for that  like a tiny pebble in a very large shoe .   he waved a finger in the waters .  for a moment a blue  door shaped outline appeared .  he stepped through it and was gone .   the tube creatures didn   t notice him go .  they hadn   t noticed him arrive .  they never ever noticed anything .  a cart trundled through the freezing foggy streets  the driver hunched in his seat .  he seemed to be all big thick brown overcoat .   a figure darted out of the swirls and was suddenly on the box next to him .      hi .     it said .     my name   s teatime .  what   s yours .            ere  you get down  i ain   t allowed to give li        the driver stopped .  it was amazing how teatime had been able to thrust a knife through four layers of thick clothing and stop it just at the point where it pricked the flesh .      sorry .     said teatime  smiling brightly .      er   there ain   t nothing valuable  y   know  nothing valuable  only a few bags of           oh dear     said teatime  his face a sudden acre of concern .     well  we   ll just have to see  won   t we   what is your name  sir .         ernie .  er .  ernie     said ernie .     yes .  ernie .  er        teatime turned his head slightly .      come along  gentlemen .  this is my friend ernie .  he   s going to be our driver for tonight .      ernie saw half a dozen figures emerge from the fog and climb into the cart behind him .  he didn   t turn to look at them .  by the pricking of his kidneys he knew this would not be an exemplary career move .  but it seemed that one of the figures  a huge shambling mound of a creature  was carrying a long bundle over its shoulder .  the bundle moved and made muffled noises .      do stop shaking  ernie .  we just need a lift     said teatime  as the cart rumbled over the cobbles .      where to  mister .         oh  we don   t mind .  but first  i   d like you to stop in sator square  near the second fountain .      the knife was withdrawn .  ernie stopped trying to breathe through his ears .      er           what is it .  you do seem tense  ernie .  i always find a neck massage helps .         i ain   t rightly allowed to carry passengers  see .  charlie   ll give me a right telling off           oh  don   t you worry about that     said teatime  slapping him on the back .     we   re all friends here .         what   re we bringing the girl for .     said a voice behind them .         s not right  hittin    girls     said a deep voice .     our mam said no hittin    girls .  only bad boys do that  our mam said           you be quiet  banjo .         our mam said           shssh .  ernie here doesn   t want to listen to our troubles     said teatime  not taking his gaze off the driver .      me .  deaf as a post  me     burbled ernie  who in some ways was a very quick learner .     can   t hardly see more   n a few feet  neither .  got no recollection for them faces that i do see  come to that .  bad memory .  hah .  talk about bad memory .  cor  sometimes i can be like as it were on the cart  talking to people  hah  just like i   m talking to you now  and then when they   re gone  hah  try as i might  do you think i can remember anything about them or how many they were or what they were carrying or anything about any girl or anything .     by this time his voice was a high pitched wheeze .     hah .  sometimes i forget me own name .         it   s ernie  isn   t it .     said teatime  giving him a happy smile .     ah  and here we are .  oh dear .  there seems to be some excitement .      there was the sound of fighting somewhere ahead  and then a couple of masked trolls ran past with three watchmen after them .  they all ignored the cart .      i heard the de bris gang were going to have a go at packley   s strong room tonight     said a voice behind ernie .      looks like mr .  brown won   t be joining us  then     said another voice .  there was a snigger .      oh  i don   t know about that  mr .  lilywhite  i don   t know about that at all     said a third voice  and this one was from the direction of the fountain .     could you take my bag while i climb up  please .  do be careful  it   s a little heavy .      it was a neat little voice .  the owner of a voice like that kept his money in a shovel purse and always counted his change carefully .  ernie thought all this  and then tried very hard to forget that he had .      on you go  ernie     said teatime .     round behind the university  i think .      as the cart rolled on  the neat little voice said     you grab all the money and then you get out very smartly .  am i right .      there was a murmur of agreement .      learned that on my mother   s knee  yeah .         you learned a lot of stuff across your ma   s knee  mr .  lilywhite .         don   t you say nuffin    about our mam .     the voice was like an earthquake .      this is mr .  brown  banjo .  you smarten up .         he dint ort to tork about our mam .         all right .  all right .  hello  banjo   i think i may have a sweet somewhere   yes  there you are .  yes  your ma knew the way all right .  you go in quietly  you take your time  you get what you came for and you leave smartly and in good order .  you don   t hang around at the scene to count it out and tell one another what brave lads you are  am i right .         you seem to have done all right  mr .  brown .     the cart rattled toward the other side of the square .      just a little for expenses  mr .  catseye .  a little hogswatch present  you might say .  never take the lot and run .  take a little and walk .  dress neat .  that   s my motto .  dress neat and walk away slowly .  never run .  never run .  the watch   ll always chase a running man .  they   re like terriers for giving chase .  no  you walk out slow  you walk round the corner  you wait till there   s a lot of excitement  then you turn around and walk back .  they can   t cope with that  see .  half the time they   ll stand aside to let you walk past .     good evening  officers     you say  and then you go home for your tea .         wheee .  gets you out of trouble  i can see that .  if you   ve got the nerve .         oh  no  mr .  peachy .  doesn   t get you out of .  keeps you out of .      it was like a very good schoolroom  ernie thought  and immediately tried to forget  .  or a back street gym when a champion prizefighter had just strolled in .      what   s up with your mouth  banjo .         he lost a tooth  mr .  brown     said another voice  and sniggered .      lost a toot     mr .  brown     said the thunder that was banjo .      keep your eyes on the road  ernie     said teatime beside him .     we don   t want an accident  do we        the road here was deserted  despite the bustle of the city behind them and the bulk of the university nearby .  there were a few streets  but the buildings were abandoned .  and something was happening to the sound .  the rest of ankh morpork seemed very far away  the sounds arriving as if through quite a thick wall .  they were entering that scorned little corner of ankh morpork that had long been the site of the university   s rubbish pits and was now known as the unreal estate .      bloody wizards     muttered ernie  automatically .      i beg your pardon .     said teatime .      my great grandpa said we used t   own prop   ty round here .  low levels of magic  my arse .  hah  it   s all right for them wizards  they got all kindsa spells to protect    em .  bit of magic here  bit of magic there   stands to reason it   s got to go somewhere  right .         there used to be warning signs up     said the neat voice from behind .      yeah  well  warning signs in ankh morpork might as well have    good firewood    written on them     said someone else .      i mean  stands to reason  they chuck out an old spell for exploding this  and another one for twiddlin    that  and another one for making carrots grow  they finish up interfering with one another  who knows what they   ll end up doing .     said ernie .     great grandpa said sometimes they   d wake up in the morning and the cellar   d be higher than the attic .  and that weren   t the worst     he added darkly .      yeah  i heard where it got so bad you could walk down the street and meet yourself coming the other way     someone supplied .     it got so   s you didn   t know it was bum or breakfast time  i heard .         the dog used to bring home all kinds of stuff     said ernie .     great grandpa said half the time they used to dive behind the sofa if it came in with anything in its mouth .  corroded fire spells startin    to fizz  broken wands with green smoke coming out of    em and i don   t know what else   and if you saw the cat playing with anything  it was best not to try to find out what it was  i can tell you .      he twitched the reins  his current predicament almost forgotten in the tide of hereditary resentment .      i mean  they say all the old spell books and stuff was buried deep and they recycle the used spells now  but that don   t seem much comfort when your potatoes started walkin    about     he grumbled .     my great grandpa went to see the head wizard about it  and he said      he put on a strangled nasal voice which was his idea of how you talked when you   d got an education         oh  there might be some temp   ry inconvenience now  my good man  but just you come back in fifty thousand years .     bloody wizards .      the horse turned a corner .   this was a dead end street .  half collapsed houses  windows smashed  doors stolen  leaned against one another on either side .      i heard they said they were going to clean up this place     said someone .      oh  yeah     said ernie  and spat .  when it hit the ground it ran away .     and you know what .  you get loonies coming in all the time now  poking around  pulling things about           just at the wall up ahead     said teatime conversationally .     i think you generally go through just where there   s a pile of rubble by the old dead tree  although you wouldn   t see it unless you looked closely .  but i   ve never seen how you do it              ere  i can   t take you lot through     said ernie .     lifts is one thing  but not taking people through        teatime sighed .     and we were getting on so well .  listen  ernie   ern   you will take us through or  and i say this with very considerable regret  i will have to kill you .  you seem a nice man .  conscientious .  a very serious overcoat and sensible boots .         but if   n i take you through           what   s the worst that can happen .     said teatime .     you   ll lose your job .  whereas if you don   t  you   ll die .  so if you look at it like that  we   re actually doing you a favor .  oh  do say yes .         er       ernie   s brain felt all twisted .  the lad was definitely what ernie thought of as a toff  and he seemed nice and friendly  but it didn   t all add up .  the tone and the content didn   t match .      besides     said teatime     if you   ve been coerced  it   s not your fault  is it .  no one can blame you .  no one could blame anyone who   d been coerced at knife point .         oh  well  i s   pose  if we   re talking coerced       ernie muttered .  going along with things seemed to be the only way .   the horse stopped and stood waiting with the patient look of an animal that probably knows the route better than the driver .   ernie fumbled in his overcoat pocket and took out a small tin  rather like a snuffbox .  he opened it .  there was glowing dust inside .      what do you do with that .     said teatime  all interest .      oh  you just takes a pinch and throws it in the air and it goes twing and it opens the soft place     said ernie .      so   you don   t need any special training or anything .         er   you just chucks it at the wall there and it goes twing     said ernie .      really .  may i try .      teatime took the tin from his unresisting hand and threw a pinch of dust into the air in front of the horse .  it hovered for a moment and then produced a narrow  glittering arch in the air .  it sparkled and went        twing .      aw     said a voice behind them .     innat nice  eh  our davey .         yeah .         all pretty sparkles           and then you just drive forward .     said teatime .      that   s right     said ernie .     quick  mind .  it only stays open for a little while .      teatime pocketed the little tin .     thank you very much  ernie .  very much indeed .      his other hand lashed out .  there was a glint of metal .  the carter blinked  and then fell sideways off his seat .   there was silence from behind  tinted with horror and possibly just a little terrible admiration .      wasn   t he dull .     said teatime  picking up the reins .      snow began to fall .  it fell on the recumbent shape of ernie  and it also fell through several hooded gray robes that hung in the air .   there appeared to be nothing inside them .  you could believe they were there merely to mark a certain point in space .   well  said one  we are frankly impressed .   indeed  said another .  we would never have thought of doing it this way .   he is certainly a resourceful human  said a third .   the beauty of it all  said the first   or it may have been the second  because absolutely nothing distinguished the robes   is that there is so much else we will control .   quite  said another .  it is really amazing how they think .  a sort of   illogical logic .   children  said another .  who would have thought it .  but today the children  tomorrow the world .   give me a child until he is seven and he   s mine for life  said another .   there was a dreadful pause .   the consensus beings that called themselves the auditors did not believe in anything  except possibly immortality .  and the way to be immortal  they knew  was to avoid living .  most of all they did not believe in personality .  to be a personality was to be a creature with a beginning and an end .  and since they reasoned that in an infinite universe any life was by comparison unimaginably short  they died instantly .  there was a flaw in their logic  of course  but by the time they found this out it was always too late .  in the meantime  they scrupulously avoided any comment  action or experience that set them apart     you said    me     said one .   ah .  yes .  but  you see  we were quoting  said the other one hurriedly .  some religious person said that .  about educating children .  and so would logically say    me .     but i wouldn   t use that term of myself  of   damn .   the robe vanished in a little puff of smoke .   let that be a lesson to us  said one of the survivors  as another and totally indistinguishable robe popped into existence where the stricken colleague had been .   yes  said the newcomer .  well  it certainly appears     it stopped .  a dark shape was approaching through the snow .   it   s him  it said .   they faded hurriedly   not simply vanishing  but spreading out and thinning until they were just lost in the background .      the dark figure stopped by the dead carter and reached down .   could i give you a hand .   ernie looked up gratefully .      cor  yeah     he said .  he got to his feet  swaying a little .     here  your fingers   re cold  mister .      sorry .      what   d he go and do that for .  i did what he said .  he could   ve killed me .      ernie felt inside his overcoat and pulled out a small and  at this point  strangely transparent silver flask .      i always keep a nip on me these cold nights     he said .     keeps me spirits up .      yes indeed .  death looked around briefly and sniffed the air .      how   m i going to explain all this  then  eh .     said ernie  taking a pull .   sorry .  that was very rude of me .  i wasn   t paying attention .      i said what   m i going to tell people .  letting some blokes ride off with my cart neat as you like   that   s gonna be the sack for sure  i   m gonna be in big trouble        ah .  well .  there at least i have some good news  ernest .  and  then again  i have some bad news .   ernie listened .  once or twice he looked at the corpse at his feet .  he looked smaller from the outside .  he was bright enough not to argue .  some things are fairly obvious when it   s a seven foot skeleton with a scythe telling you them .      so i   m dead  then     he concluded .   correct .      er   the priest said that   you know   after you   re dead   it   s like going through a door and on one side of it there   s   he   well  a terrible place    .      death looked at his worried  fading face .   through a door        that   s what he said        i expect it depends on the direction you   re walking in .      when the street was empty again  except for the fleshy abode of the late ernie  the gray shapes came back into focus .   honestly  he gets worse and worse  said one .   he was looking for us  said another .  did you notice .  he suspects something .  he gets so   concerned about things .   yes   but the beauty of this plan  said a third  is that he can   t interfere .   he can go everywhere  said one .   no  said another .  not quite everywhere .   and  with ineffable smugness  they faded into the foreground .   it started to snow quite heavily .      it was the night before hogswatch .  all through the house        one creature stirred .  it was a mouse .   and someone  in the face of all appropriateness  had baited a trap .  although  because it was the festive season  they   d used a piece of pork crackling .  the smell of it had been driving the mouse mad all day but now  with no one about  it was prepared to risk it .   the mouse didn   t know it was a trap .  mice aren   t good at passing on information .  young mice aren   t taken up to famous trap sites and told     this is where your uncle arthur passed away .     all it knew was that  what the hey  here was something to eat .  on a wooden board with some wire round it .   a brief scurry later and its jaw had closed on the rind .   or  rather  passed through it .   the mouse looked around at what was now lying under the big spring  and thought     oops        then its gaze went up to the black clad figure that had faded into view by the wainscoting .      squeak .     it asked .   squeak  said the death of rats .   and that was it  more or less .   afterward  the death of rats looked around with interest .  in the nature of things his very important job tended to take him to rickyards and dark cellars and the inside of cats and all the little dank holes where rats and mice finally found out if there was a promised cheese .  this place was different .   it was brightly decorated  for one thing .  ivy and mistletoe hung in bunches from the bookshelves .  brightly colored streamers festooned the walls  a feature seldom found in most holes or even quite civilized cats .   the d  ath of rats took a leap onto a chair and from there on to the table and in fact right into a glass of amber liquid  which tipped over and broke .  a puddle spread around four turnips and began to soak into a note which had been written rather awkwardly on pink writing paper .   it read       dere hogfather   for hogswatch i would like a drum an a dolly an a teddybear an a gharstley omnian inquisision torchure chamber with wind up rock and nearly real blud you can use agian .  you can get it from the toy shoppe in short strete .  it is    .   p .  i have been good an here is a glars of sherre an a pork pie for you and turnips for gouger an tusker an rooter an snot snouter .  i hop the chimney is big enough but my friend willaim says you are your father really .   yrs .  virginia prood .       the death of rats nibbled a bit of the pork pie because when you are the personification of the death of small rodents you have to behave in certain ways .  he also piddled on one of the turnips for the same reason  although only metaphorically  because when you are a small skeleton in a black robe there are also some things you technically cannot do .   then he leapt down from the table and left sherry flavored footprints all the way to the tree that stood in a pot in the corner .  it was really only a bare branch of oak  but so much shiny holly and mistletoe had been wired onto it that it gleamed in the light of the candles .   there was tinsel on it  and glittering ornaments  and small bags of chocolate money .   the death of rats peered at his hugely distorted reflection in a glass ball  and then looked up at the mantelpiece .   he reached it in one jump  and ambled curiously through the cards that had been ranged along it .  his gray whiskers twitched at messages like    wishing you joye and all goode cheer at hogswatchtime   all through the yeare .     a couple of them had pictures of a big jolly fat man carrying a sack .  in one of them he was riding in a sleigh drawn by four enormous pigs .   the death of rats sniffed at a couple of long stockings that had been hung from the mantelpiece  over the fireplace in which a fire had died down to a few sullen ashes .   he was aware of a subtle tension in the air  a feeling that here was a scene that was also a stage  a round hole  as it were  waiting for a round peg     there was a scraping noise .  a few lumps of soot thumped into the ashes .   the grim squeaker nodded to himself .   the scraping became louder  and was followed by a moment of silence and then a clang as something landed in the ashes and knocked over a set of ornamental fire irons .   the rat watched carefully as a red robed figure pulled itself upright and staggered across the hearth rug  rubbing its shin where it had been caught by the toasting fork .   it reached the table and read the note .  the death of rats thought he heard a groan .   the turnips were pocketed and so  to the death of rats    annoyance  was the pork pie .  he was pretty sure it was meant to be eaten here  not taken away .   the figure scanned the dripping note for a moment  and then turned around and approached the mantelpiece .  the death of rats pulled back slightly behind    season   s greetings .      a red gloved hand took down a stocking .  there was some creaking and rustling and it was replaced  looking a lot fatter   the larger box sticking out of the top had  just visible  the words    victim figures not included .         yrs .      the death of rats couldn   t see much of the donor of this munificence .  the big red hood hid all the face  apart from a long white beard .   finally  when the figure finished  it stood back and pulled a list out of its pocket .  it held it up to the hood and appeared to be consulting it .  it waved its other hand vaguely at the fireplace  the sooty footprints  the empty sherry glass and the stocking .  then it bent forward  as if reading some tiny print .   ah  yes  it said .  er   ho .  ho .  ho .   with that  it ducked down and entered the chimney .  there was some scrabbling before its boots gained a purchase  and then it was gone .   the death of rats realized he   d begun to gnaw his little scythe   s handle in sheer shock .   squeak .   he landed in the ashes and swarmed up the sooty cave of the chimney .  he emerged so fast that he shot out with his legs still scrabbling and landed in the snow on the roof .   there was a sleigh hovering in the air by the gutter .   the red hooded figure had just climbed in and appeared to be talking to someone invisible behind a pile of sacks .   here   s another pork pie .      any mustard .     said the sacks .     they   re a treat with mustard .      it does not appear so .      oh  well .  pass it over anyway .      it looks very bad .      nah     s just where something   s nibbled it        i mean the situation .  most of the letters   they don   t really believe .  they pretend to believe  just in case .   i fear it may be too late .  it has spread so fast and back in time  too .      never say die  master .  that   s our motto  eh .     said the sacks  apparently with their mouth full .   i can   t say it   s ever really been mine .      i meant we   re not going to be intimidated by the certain prospect of complete and utter failure  master .      aren   t we .  oh  good .  well  i suppose we   d better be going .  the figure picked up the reins .  up  gouger .  up  rooter .  up  tusker .  up  snouter .  giddyup .   the four large boars harnessed to the sleigh did not move .   why doesn   t that work .  said the figure in a puzzled  heavy voice .      beats me  master     said the sacks .   it works on horses .      you could try    pig hooey .         pig hooey .  they waited .  no   doesn   t seem to reach them .   there was some whispering .   really .  you think that would work .      it   d bloody well work on me if i was a pig  master .      very well  then .   the figure gathered up the reins again .   apple .  sauce .   the pigs    legs blurred .  silver light flicked across them  and exploded outward .  they dwindled to a dot  and vanished .   squeak .   the death of rats skipped across the snow  slid down a drain pipe and landed on the roof of a shed .   there was a raven perched there .  it was staring disconsolately at something .   squeak .      look at that  willya .     said the raven rhetorically .  it waved a claw at a bird feeder in the garden below .     they hangs up half a bloody coconut  a lump of bacon rind  a handful of peanuts in a bit of wire and they think they   re the gods    gift to the nat   ral world .  huh .  do i see eyeballs .  do i see entrails .  i think not .  most intelligent bird in the temperate latitudes an    i gets the cold shoulder just because i can   t hang upside down and go twit  twit .  look at robins  now .  stroppy little evil buggers  fight like demons  but all they got to do is go bob bob bobbing along and they can   t move for bread crumbs .  whereas me myself can recite poems and repeat many hum   rous phrases        squeak .      yes .  what .      the death of rats pointed at the roof and then the sky and jumped up and down excitedly .  the raven swiveled one eye upward .      oh  yes .  him     he said .     turns up at this time of year .  tends to be associated distantly with robins  which        squeak .  squee ik ik ik .  the death of rats pantomimed a figure landing in a grate and walking around a room .  squeak eek ik ik  squeak    heek heek heek .     ik ik squeak .      been overdoing the hogswatch cheer  have you .  been rooting around in the brandy butter .      squeak .   the raven   s eyes revolved .      look  death   s death .  it   s a full time job right .  it   s not as though you can run  like  a window cleaning round on the side or nip round after work cutting people   s lawns .      squeak .      oh  please yourself .      the raven crouched a little to allow the tiny figure to hop on to its back  and then lumbered into the air .      of course  they can go mental  your occult types     it said  as it swooped over the moonlit garden .     look at old man trouble  for one        squeak .      oh  i   m not suggesting          susan didn   t like biers but she went there anyway  when the pressure of being normal got too much .  biers  despite the smell and the drink and the company  had one important virtue .  in biers no one took any notice .  of anything .  hogswatch was traditionally supposed to be a time for families but the people who drank in biers probably didn   t have families  some of them looked as though they might have had litters  or clutches .  some of them looked as though they   d probably eaten their relatives  or at least someone   s relatives .   biers was where the undead drank .  and when igor the barman was asked for a bloody mary  he didn   t mix a metaphor .   the regular customers didn   t ask questions  and not only because some of them found anything above a growl hard to articulate .  none of them was in the answers business .  everyone in biers drank alone  even when they were in groups .  or packs .   despite the decorations put up inexpertly by igor the barman to show willing   biers was not a family place .   family was a subject susan liked to avoid .   currently she was being aided in this by a gin and tonic .  in biers  unless you weren   t choosy  it paid to order a drink that was transparent because igor also had undirected ideas about what you could stick on the end of a cocktail stick .  if you saw something spherical and green  you just had to hope that it was an olive .   she felt hot breath on her ear .  a bogeyman had sat down on the stool beside her .      woss a normo doin    in a place like this  then .     it rumbled  causing a cloud of vaporized alcohol and halitosis to engulf her .     hah  you fink it   s cool comin    down here an    swannin    around in a black dress wid all the lost boys  eh .  dabblin    in a bit of designer darkness  eh .      susan moved her stool away a little .  the bogeyman grinned .      want a bogeyman under yer bed  eh .         now then  shlimazel     said igor  without looking up from polishing a glass .      well  woss she down here for  eh .     said the bogeyman .  a huge hairy hand grabbed susan   s arm .     o   course  maybe what she wants is           i ain   t telling you again  shlimazel     said igor .   he saw the girl turn to face shlimazel .   igor wasn   t in a position to see her face fully  but the bogeyman was .  he shot back so quickly that he fell off his stool .   and when the girl spoke  what she said was only partly words but also a statement  written in stone  of how the future was going to be .      go away and stop bothering me .      she turned back and gave igor a polite and slightly apologetic smile .  the bogeyman struggled frantically out of the wreckage of his stool and loped toward the door .   susan felt the drinkers turn back to their private preoccupations .  it was amazing what you could get away with in biers .   igor put down the glass and looked up at the window .  for a drinking den that relied on darkness it had rather a large one but  of course  some customers did arrive by air .   something was tapping on it now .   igor lurched over and opened it .   susan looked up .      oh  no        the death of rats leapt down onto the counter  with the raven fluttering after it .   squeak squeak eek .  eek .  squeak ik ik    heek heek heek .     sq        go away     said susan coldly .     i   m not interested .  you   re just a figment of my imagination .      the raven perched on a bowl behind the bar and said     ah  great .      squeak .      what   re these .     said the raven  flicking something off the end of its beak .     onions .  pfah .         go on  go away  the pair of you     said susan .      the rat says your granddad   s gone mad     said the raven .     says he   s pretending to be the hogfather .         listen  i just don   t   what .         red cloak  long beard        heek .  heek .  heek .         going    ho  ho  ho     driving around in the big sleigh drawn by the four piggies  the whole thing           pigs .  what happened to binky .         search me .  o    course  it can happen  as i was telling the rat only just now        susan put her hands over her ears  more for desperate theatrical effect than for the muffling they gave .      i don   t want to know .  i don   t have a grandfather .      she had to hold onto that .   the death of rats squeaked at length .      the rat says you must remember  he   s tall  not what you   d call fleshy  he carries a scythe           go away .  and take the   the rat with you .      she waved her hand wildly and  to her horror and shame  knocked the little hooded skeleton over an ashtray .   eek .   the raven took the rat   s cowl in its beak and tried to drag him away  but a tiny skeletal fist shook its scythe .   eek ik eek squeak .      he says  you don   t mess with the rat     said the raven .   in a flurry of wings they were gone .   igor closed the window .  he didn   t pass any comment .      they weren   t real     said susan  hurriedly .     well  that is   the raven   s probably real  but he hangs around with the rat           which isn   t real     said igor .      that   s right .     said susan  gratefully .     you probably didn   t see a thing .         that   s right     said igor .     not a thing .         now   how much do i owe you .     said susan .   igor counted on his fingers .      that   ll be a dollar for the drinks     he said     and five pence because the raven that wasn   t here messed in the pickles .        it was the night before hogswatch .   in the archchancellor   s new bathroom modo wiped his hands on a piece of rag and looked proudly at his handiwork .  shining porcelain gleamed back at him .  copper and brass shone in the lamplight .   he was a little worried that he hadn   t been able to test everything  but mr .  ridcully had said     i   ll test it when i use it     and modo never argued with the gentlemen  as he thought of them .  he knew that they all knew a lot more than he knew  and was quite happy knowing this .  he didn   t meddle with the fabric of time and space  and they kept out of his greenhouses .  the way he saw it  it was a partnership .   he   d been particularly careful to scrub the floors .  mr .  ridcully had been very specific about that .      verruca gnome     he said to himself  giving a tap a last polish .     what an imagination the gentlemen do have        far off  unheard by anyone  was a faint little noise  like the ringing of tiny silver bells .   glingleglingleglingle     and someone landed abruptly in a snow drift and said     bugger .     which is a terrible thing to say as your first word ever .     overhead  heedless of the new and somewhat angry life that was even now dusting itself off  the sleigh soared onward through time and space .   i   m finding the beard a bit of a trial  said death .      why   ve you got to have the beard .     said the voice from among the sacks .     i thought you said people see what they expect to see .      children don   t .  too often they see what   s there .      well  at least it   s keeping you in the right frame of mind  master .  in character  sort of thing .      but going down the chimney .  where   s the sense in that .  i can just walk through the walls .      walking through the walls is not right  neither     said the voice from the sacks .   it works for me .      it   s got to be chimneys .  same as the beard  really .      a head thrust itself out from the pile .  it appeared to belong to the oldest  most unpleasant pixie in the universe .  the fact that it was underneath a jolly little green hat with a bell on it did not do anything to improve matters .   it waved a crabbed hand containing a thick wad of letters  many of them on pastel colored paper  often with bunnies and teddy bears on them  and written mostly in crayon .      you reckon these little buggers   d be writing to someone who walked through walls .     it said .     and the    ho  ho  ho    could use some more work  if you don   t mind my saying so .      ho .  ho .  ho .      no  no  no .     said albert .     you got to put a bit of life in it  sir  no offense intended .  it   s got to be a big fat laugh .  you got to   you got to sound like you   re pissing brandy and crapping plum pudding  sir  excuse my klatchian .      really .  how do you know all this .      i was young once  sir .  hung up my stocking like a good boy every year .  for to get it filled with toys  just like you   re doing .  mind you  in those days basically it was sausages and black puddings if you were lucky .  but you always got a pink sugar piglet in the toe .  it wasn   t a good hogswatch unless you   d eaten so much you were sick as a pig  master .      death looked at the sacks .   it was a strange but demonstrable fact that the sacks of toys carried by the hogfather  no matter what they really contained  always appeared to have sticking out of the top a teddy bear  a toy soldier in the kind of colorful uniform that would stand out in a disco  a drum and a red and white candy cane .  the actual contents always turned out to be something a bit garish and costing    .    .   death had investigated one or two .  there had been a real agatean ninja  for example  with fearsome death grip  and a captain carrot one man night watch with a complete wardrobe of toy weapons  each of which cost as much as the original wooden doll in the first place .   mind you  the stuff for the girls was just as depressing .  it seemed to be nearly all horses .  most of them were grinning .  horses  death felt  shouldn   t grin .  any horse that was grinning was planning something .   he sighed again .   then there was this business of deciding who   d been naughty or nice .  he   d never had to think about that sort of thing before .  naughty or nice  it was ultimately all the same .   still  it had to be done right .  otherwise it wouldn   t work .   the pigs pulled up alongside another chimney .      here we are  here we are     said albert .     james riddle  aged eight .      hah  yes .  he actually says in his letter     i bet you don   t exist    cos everyone knows its yore parents .     oh  yes  said death  with what almost sounded like sarcasm  i   m sure his parents are just impatient to bang their elbows in twelve feet of narrow unswept chimney  i don   t think .  i shall tread extra soot into his carpet .      right  sir .  good thinking .  speaking of which   down you go  sir .      how about if i don   t give him anything as a punishment for not believing .      yeah  but what   s that going to prove .      death sighed .  i suppose you   re right .      did you check the list .      yes .  twice .  are you sure that   s enough .      definitely .      couldn   t really make head or tail of it  to tell you the truth .  how can i tell if he   s been naughty or nice  for example .      oh  well   i don   t know   has he hung his clothes up  that sort of thing        and if he has been good i may give him this klatchian war chariot with real spinning sword blades .      that   s right .      and if he   s been bad .   albert scratched his head .     when i was a lad  you got a bag of bones .     s   mazing how kids got better behaved toward the end of the year .      oh dear .  and now .   albert held a package up to his ear and rustled it .     sounds like socks .      socks .      could be a woolly vest .      serve him right  if i may venture to express an opinion     albert looked across the snowy rooftops and sighed .  this wasn   t right .  he was helping because  well  death was his master and that   s all there was to it  and if the master had a heart it would be in the right place .  but        are you sure we ought to be doing this  master .      death stopped  halfway out of the chimney .   can you think of a better alternative  albert .   and that was it .  albert couldn   t .   someone had to do it .     there were bears on the street again .   susan ignored them and didn   t even make a point of not treading on the cracks .   they just stood around  looking a bit puzzled and slightly transparent  visible only to children and susan .  news like susan gets around .  the bears had heard about the poker .  nuts and berries  their expressions seemed to say .  that   s what we   re here for .  big sharp teeth .  what big shar   oh  these big sharp teeth .    they   re just for  er  cracking nuts .  and some of these berries can be really vicious .   the city   s clocks were striking six when she got back to the house .  she was allowed her own key .  it wasn   t as if she was a servant  exactly .   you couldn   t be a duchess and a servant .  but it was all right to be a governess .  it was understood that it wasn   t exactly what you were  it was merely a way of passing the time until you did what every girl  or gel  was supposed to do in life  i . e .   marry some man .  it was understood that you were playing .   the parents were in awe of her .  she was the daughter of a duke  whereas mr .  gaiter was a man to be reckoned with in the wholesale boots and shoes business .  mrs .  gaiter was bucking for a transfer into the upper classes  which she currently hoped to achieve by reading books on etiquette .  she treated susan with the kind of worried deference she thought was due to anyone who   d known the difference between a serviette and a napkin from birth .   susan had never before come across the idea that you could rise in society by  as it were  gaining marks  especially since such noblemen as she   d met in her father   s house had used neither serviette nor napkin but a state of mind  which was    drop it on the floor  the dogs   ll eat it .      when mrs .  gaiter had tremulously asked her how one addressed the second cousin of a queen  susan had replied without thinking     we called him jamie  usually     and mrs .  gaiter had had to go and have a headache in her room .   mr .  gaiter just nodded when he met her in a passage and never said very much to her .  he was pretty sure he knew where he stood in boots and shoes and that was that .   gawain and twyla  who   d been named by people who apparently loved them  had been put to bed by the time susan got in  at their own insistence .  it   s a widely held belief at a certain age that going to bed early makes tomorrow come faster .   she went to tidy up the schoolroom and get things ready for the morning  and began to pick up the things the children had left lying around .  then something tapped at a window pane .   she peered out at the darkness  and then opened the window .  a drift of snow fell down outside .   in the summer the window opened into the branches of a cherry tree .  in the winter dark  they were little gray lines where the snow had settled on them .      who   s that .     said susan .   something hopped through the frozen branches .      tweet tweet tweet  would you believe .     said the raven .      not you again .         you wanted maybe some dear little robin .  listen  your grand           go away .      susan slammed the window and pulled the curtains across .  she put her back to them  to make sure  and tried to concentrate on the room .  it helped to think about   normal things .   there was the hogswatch tree  a rather smaller version of the grand one in the hall .  she   d helped the children to make paper decorations for it .  yes .  think about that .   there were the paper chains .  there were the bits of holly  thrown out from the main rooms for not having enough berries on them  and now given fake modeling clay berries and stuck in anyhow on shelves and behind pictures .   there were two stockings hanging from the mantelpiece of the small schoolroom grate .  there were twyla   s paintings  all blobby blue skies and violently green grass and red houses with four square windows .  there were     normal things     she straightened up and stared at them  her fingernails beating a thoughtful tattoo on a wooden pencil case .   the door was pushed open .  it revealed the tousled shape of twyla  hanging onto the doorknob with one hand .      susan  there   s a monster under my bed again        the click of susan   s fingernails stopped .         i can hear it moving about        susan sighed and turned toward the child .      all right  twyla .  i   ll be along directly .      the girl nodded and went back to her room  leaping into bed from a distance as a precaution against claws .   there was a metallic tzing as susan withdrew the poker from the little brass stand it shared with the tongs and the coal shovel .   she sighed .  normality was what you made it .   she went into the children   s bedroom and leaned over as if to tuck twyla up .  then her hand darted down and under the bed .  she grabbed a handful of hair .  she pulled .   the bogeyman came out like a cork but before it could get its balance it found itself spread eagled against the wall with one arm behind its back .  but it did manage to turn its head  to see susan   s face glaring at it from a few inches away .   gawain bounced up and down on his bed .      do the voice on it .  do the voice on it .     he shouted .      don   t do the voice  don   t do the voice .     pleaded the bogeyman urgently .      hit it on the head with the poker .         not the poker .  not the poker .         it   s you  isn   t it     said susan .     from this afternoon           aren   t you going to poke it with the poker .     said gawain .      not the poker .     whined the bogeyman .      new in town .     whispered susan .      yes .     the bogeyman   s forehead wrinkled with puzzlement .     here  how come you can see me .         then this is a friendly warning  understand .  because it   s hogswatch .      the bogeyman tried to move .     you call this friendly .         ah  you want to try for unfriendly .     said susan  adjusting her grip .      no  no  no  i like friendly .         this house is out of bounds  right .         you a witch or something .     moaned the bogeyman .      i   m just   something .  now   you won   t be around here again  will you .  otherwise it   ll be the blanket next time .         no .         i mean it .  we   ll put your head under the blanket .         no .         it   s got fluffy bunnies on it           no .         off you go  then .      the bogeyman half fell  half ran toward the door .         s not right     it mumbled .     you   re not s   posed to see us if you ain   t dead or magic      s not fair           try number nineteen     said susan  relenting a little .     the governess there doesn   t believe in bogeymen .         right .     said the monster hopefully .      she believes in algebra  though .         ah .  nice .     the bogeyman grinned hugely .  it was amazing the sort of mischief that could be caused in a house where no one in authority thought you existed .      i   ll be off  then     it said .     er .  happy hogswatch .         possibly     said susan  as it slunk away .      that wasn   t as much fun as the one last month     said gawain  getting between the sheets again .     you know  when you kicked him in the trousers           just you two get to sleep now     said susan .      verity said the sooner we got to sleep the sooner the hogfather would come     said twyla conversationally .      yes     said susan .     unfortunately  that might be the case .      the remark passed right over their heads .  she wasn   t sure why it had gone through hers  but she knew enough to trust her senses .   she hated that kind of sense .  it ruined your life .  but it was the sense she had been born with .   the children were tucked in  and she closed the door quietly and went back to the schoolroom .   something had changed .   she glared at the stockings  but they were unfulfilled .  a paper chain rustled .   she stared at the tree .  tinsel had been twined around it  badly pasted together decorations had been hung on it .  and on top was the fairy made of     she crossed her arms  looked up at the ceiling  and sighed theatrically .      it   s you  isn   t it .     she said .   squeak .      yes  it is .  you   re sticking out your arms like a scarecrow and you   ve stuck a little star on your scythe  haven   t you    .      the death of rats hung his head guiltily .   squeak .      you   re not fooling anyone .      squeak .      get down from there this minute .      squeak .      and what did you do with the fairy .         it   s shoved under a cushion on the chair     said a voice from the shelves on the other side of the room .  there was a clicking noise and the raven   s voice added     these damn eyeballs are hard  aren   t they .      susan raced across the room and snatched the bowl away so fast that the raven somersaulted and landed on its back .      they   re walnuts .     she shouted  as they bounced around her .     not eyeballs .  this is a schoolroom .  and the difference between a school and a a a raven deli catessen is that they hardly ever have eyeballs lying around in bowls in case a raven drops in for a quick snack .  understand .  no eyeballs .  the world is full of small round things that aren   t eyeballs .  okay .      the raven   s own eyes revolved .         n    i suppose a bit of warm liver   s out of the question           shut up .  i want both of you out of here right now .  i don   t know how you got in here           there   s a law against coming down the chimney on hogswatchnight .            but i don   t want you back in my life  understand .         the rat said you ought to be warned even if you were crazy     said the raven sulkily .     i didn   t want to come  there   s a donkey dropped dead just outside the city gates  i   ll be lucky now if i get a hoof           warned .     said susan .   there it was again .  the change in the weather of the mind  a sensation of tangible time     the death of rats nodded .   there was a scrabbling sound far overhead .  a few flakes of soot dropped down the chimney .   squeak  said the rat  but very quietly .   susan was aware of a new sensation  as a fish might be aware of a new tide  a spring of fresh water flowing into the sea .  time was pouring into the world .   she glanced up at the clock .  it was just on half past six .   the raven scratched its beak .      the rat says   the rat says  you   d better watch out          there were others at work on this shining hogswatch eve .  the sandman was out and about  dragging his sack from bed to bed .  jack frost wandered from window pane to window pane  making icy patterns .   and one tiny hunched shape slid and slithered along the gutter  squelching its feet in slush and swearing under its breath .   it wore a stained black suit and  on its head  the type of hat known in various parts of the multiverse as    bowler        derby    or    the one that makes you look a bit of a twit .     the hat had been pressed down very firmly and  since the creature had long pointy ears  these had been forced out sideways and gave it the look of a small malignant wing nut .   the thing was a gnome by shape but a fairy by profession .  fairies aren   t necessarily little twinkly creatures .  it   s purely a job description  and the commonest ones aren   t even visible .   a fairy is simply any creature currently employed under supernatural laws to take things away or  as in the case of the small creature presently climbing up the inside of a drain pipe and swearing  to bring things .   oh  yes .  he does .  someone has to do it  and he looks the right gnome for the job .   oh  yes .     sideney was worried .  he didn   t like violence  and there had been a lot of it in the last few days  if days passed in this place .  the men   well  they only seemed to find life interesting when they were doing something sharp to someone else and  while they didn   t bother him much in the same way that lions don   t trouble themselves with ants  they certainly worried him .   but not as much as teatime did .  even the brute called chickenwire treated teatime with caution  if not respect  and the monster called banjo just followed him around like a puppy .   the enormous man was watching him now .   he reminded sideney too much of ronnie jenks  the bully who   d made his life miserable at gammer wimblestone   s dame school .  ronnie hadn   t been a pupil .  he was the old woman   s grandson or nephew or something  which gave him a license to hang around the place and beat up any kid smaller or weaker or brighter than he was  which more or less meant he had the whole world to choose from .  in those circumstances  it was particularly unfair that he always chose sideney .   sideney hadn   t hated ronnie .  he   d been too frightened .  he   d wanted to be his friend .  oh  so much .  because that way  just possibly  he wouldn   t have his head trodden on such a lot and would actually get to eat his lunch instead of having it thrown in the privy .  and it had been a good day when it had been his lunch .   and then  despite all ronnie   s best efforts  sideney had grown up and gone to university .  occasionally his mother told him how ronnie was getting on  she assumed  in the way of mothers  that because they had been small boys at school together they had been friends  .  apparently he ran a fruit stall and was married to a girl called angie .   this was not enough punishment  sideney considered .   banjo even breathed like ronnie  who had to concentrate on such an intellectual exercise and always had one blocked nostril .  and his mouth open all the time .  he looked as though he was living on invisible plankton .   he tried to keep his mind on what he was doing and ignore the labored gurgling behind him .  a change in its tone made him look up .      fascinating     said teatime .     you make it look so easy .      sideney sat back  nervously .      um   it should be fine now  sir     he said .     it just got a bit scuffed when we were piling up the       he couldn   t bring himself to say it  he even had to avert his eyes from the heap  it was the sound they   d made .        the things     he finished .      we don   t need to repeat the spell .     said teatime .      oh  it   ll keep going forever     said sideney .     the simple ones do .  it   s just a state change  powered by the   the   it just keeps going        he swallowed .      so     he said     i was thinking   since you don   t actually need me  sir  perhaps           mr .  brown seems to be having some trouble with the locks on the top floor     said teatime .     that door we couldn   t open  remember .  i   m sure you   ll want to help .      sideney   s face fell .      um  i   m not a locksmith           they appear to be magical .      sideney opened his mouth to say     but i   m very bad at magical locks     and then thought much better of it .  he had already fathomed that if teatime wanted you to do something  and you weren   t very good at it  then your best plan  in fact quite possibly your only plan  was to learn to be good at it very quickly .  sideney was not a fool .  he   d seen the way the others reacted around teatime  and they were men who did things he   d only dreamed of .    at which point he was relieved to see medium dave walk down the stairs  and it said a lot for the effect of teatime   s stare that anyone could be relieved to have it punctuated by someone like medium dave .      we   ve found another guard  sir .  up on the sixth floor .  he   s been hiding .      teatime stood up .     oh dear     he said .     not trying to be heroic  was he .         he   s just scared .  shall we let him go .         let him go .     said teatime .     far too messy .  i   ll go up there .  come along  mr .  wizard .      sideney followed him reluctantly up the stairs .   the tower   if that   s what it was  he thought  he was used to the odd architecture at unseen university and this made uu look normal   was a hollow tube .  no fewer than four spiral staircases climbed the inside  crisscrossing on landings and occasionally passing through one another in defiance of generally accepted physics .  but that was practically normal for an alumnus of unseen university  although technically sideney had not alumed .  what threw the eye was the absence of shadows .  you didn   t notice shadows  how they delineated things  how they gave texture to the world  until they weren   t there .  the white marble  if that   s what it was  seemed to glow from the inside .  even when the impossible sun shone through a window it barely caused faint gray smudges where honest shadows should be .  the tower seemed to avoid darkness .   that was even more frightening than the times when  after a complicated landing  you found yourself walking up by stepping down the underside of a stair and the distant floor now hung overhead like a ceiling .  he   d noticed that even the other men shut their eyes when that happened .  teatime  though  took those stairs three at a time  laughing like a kid with a new toy .   they reached an upper landing and followed a corridor .  the others were gathered by a closed door .      he   s barricaded himself in     said chickenwire .   teatime tapped on it .     you in there     he said .     come on out .  you have my word you won   t be harmed .         no .      teatime stood back .     banjo  knock it down     he said .   banjo lumbered forward .  the door withstood a couple of massive kicks and then burst open .   the guard was cowering behind an overturned cabinet .  he cringed back as teatime stepped over it .     what   re you doing here .     he shouted .     who are you .         ah  i   m glad you asked .  i   m your worst nightmare .     said teatime cheerfully .   the man shuddered .      you mean   the one with the giant cabbage and the sort of whirring knife thing .         sorry .     teatime looked momentarily nonplussed .      then you   re the one about where i   m falling  only instead of ground underneath it   s all           no  in fact i   m        the guard sagged .     awww  not the one where there   s all this kind of  you know  mud and then everything goes blue           no  i   m           oh  shit  then you   re the one where there   s this door only there   s no floor beyond it and then there   s these claws           no     said teatime .     not that one .     he withdrew a dagger from his sleeve .     i   m the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you stone dead .      the guard grinned with relief .     oh  that one     he said .     but that one   s not very        he crumpled around teatime   s suddenly out thrust fist .  and then  just like the others had done  he faded .      rather a charitable act there  i feel     teatime said as the man vanished .     but it is nearly hogswatch  after all .        death  pillow slipping gently under his red robe  stood in the middle of the nursery carpet     it was an old one .  things ended up in the nursery when they had seen a complete tour of duty in the rest of the house .  long ago  someone had made it by carefully knotting long bits of brightly colored rag into a sacking base  giving it the look of a deflated rastafarian hedgehog .  things lived among the rags .  there were old rusks  bits of toy  buckets of dust .  it had seen life .  it may even have evolved some .   now the occasional lump of grubby melting snow dropped onto it .   susan was crimson with anger .      i mean  why .     she demanded  walking around the figure .     this is hogswatch .  it   s supposed to be jolly  with mistletoe and holly  and   and other things ending in olly .  it   s a time when people want to feel good about things and eat until they explode .  it   s a time when they want to see all their relatives        she stopped that sentence .      i mean it   s a time when humans are really human     she said .     and they don   t want a   a skeleton at the feast .  especially one  i might add  who   s wearing a false beard and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe .  i mean  why .      death looked nervous .   albert said it would help me get into the spirit of the thing .  er   it   s good to see you again     there was a small squelchy noise .   susan spun around  grateful right now for any distraction .      don   t think i can   t hear you .  they   re grapes  understand .  and the other things are satsumas .  get out of the fruit bowl .         can   t blame a bird for trying     said the raven sulkily  from the table .      and you  you leave those nuts alone .  they   re for tomorrow .      skqueaf  said the death of rats  swallowing hurriedly .   susan turned back to death .  the hogfather   s artificial stomach was now at groin level .      this is a nice house     she said .     and this is a good job .  and it   s real  with normal people .  and i was looking forward to a real life  where normal things happen .  and suddenly the old circus comes to town .  look at yourselves .  three stooges  no waiting .  well  i don   t know what   s going on  but you can all leave again  right .  this is my life .  it doesn   t belong to any of you .  it   s not going to        there was a muffled curse  a rush of soot  and a skinny old man landed in the grate .      bum .     he said .      good grief .     raged susan .     and here is pixie albert .  well  well  well .  come along in  do .  if the real hogfather doesn   t come soon there   s not going to be room .      he won   t be joining us  said death .  the pillow slid softly onto the rug .      oh  and why not .  both of the children did letters to him     said susan .     there   re rules  you know .      yes .  there are rules .  and they   re on the list .  i checked it .   albert pulled the pointy hat off his head and spat out some soot .      right .  he did .  twice     he said .     anything to drink around here .         so what have you turned up for .     susan demanded .     and if it   s for business reasons  i will add  then that outfit is in extremely poor taste        the hogfather is   unavailable .      unavailable .  at hogswatch .      yes .      why .      he is   let me see   there isn   t an entirely appropriate human word  so   let   s settle for   dead .  yes .  he is dead .     susan had never hung up a stocking .  she   d never looked for eggs laid by the soul cake duck .  she   d never put a tooth under her pillow in the serious expectation that a dentally inclined fairy would turn up .   it wasn   t that her parents didn   t believe in such things .  they didn   t need to believe in them .  they knew they existed .  they just wished they didn   t .   oh  there had been presents  at the right time  with a careful label saying who they were from .  and a superb egg on soul cake morning  filled with sweets .  juvenile teeth earned no less than a dollar each from her father  without argument .   but it was all straightforward .   she knew now that they   d been trying to protect her .  she hadn   t known then that her father had been death   s apprentice for a while  and that her mother was death   s adopted daughter .  she   d had very dim recollections of being taken a few times to see someone who   d been quite  well  jolly  in a strange  thin way .  and the visits had suddenly stopped .  and she   d met him later and  yes  he had his good side  and for a while she   d wondered why her parents had been so unfeeling and     she knew now why they   d tried to keep her away .  there was far more to genetics than little squirmy spirals .   she could walk through walls when she really had to .  she could use a tone of voice that was more like actions than words  that somehow reached inside people and operated all the right switches .  and her hair     that had only happened recently  though .  it used to be unmanageable  but at around the age of seventeen she had found it more or less managed itself .   that had lost her several young men .  someone   s hair rearranging itself into a new style  the tresses curling around themselves like a nest of kittens  could definitely put the crimp on any relationship .   she   d been making good progress  though .  she could go for days now without feeling anything other than entirely human .   but it was always the case  wasn   t it .  you could go out into the world  succeed on your own terms  and sooner or later some embarrassing old relative was bound to turn up .     grunting and swearing  the gnome clambered out of another drain pipe  jammed its hat firmly on its head  threw its sack onto a snowdrift and jumped down after it .         s a good one     he said .     ha  take    im weeks to get rid of that one .      he took a crumpled piece of paper out of a pocket and examined it closely .  then he looked at an elderly figure working away quietly at the next house .   it was standing by a window  drawing with great concentration on the glass .   the gnome wandered up  interested  and watched critically .      why just fern patterns .     he said  after a while .     pretty  yeah  but you wouldn   t catch me puttin    a penny in your hat for fern patterns .      the figure turned  brush in hand .      i happen to like fern patterns     said jack frost coldly .      it   s just that people expect  you know  sad big eyed kids  kittens lookin    out of boots  little doggies  that sort of thing .         i do ferns .         or big pots of sunflowers  happy seaside scenes           and ferns .         i mean  s   posing some big high priest wanted you to paint the temple ceiling with gods    n    angels and such like  what   d you do then .         he could have as many gods and angels as he liked  provided they              looked like ferns .         i resent the implication that i am solely fern fixated     said jack frost .     i can also do a very nice paisley pattern .         what   s that look like  then .         well   it does  admittedly  have a certain ferny quality to the uninitiated eye .     frost leaned forward .     who   re you .      the gnome took a step backward .      you   re not a tooth fairy  are you .  i see more and more of them about these days .  nice girls .         nah .  nah .  not teeth     said the gnome  clutching his sack .      what  then .      the gnome told him .      really .     said jack frost .     i thought they just turned up .         well  come to that  i thought frost on the windows just happened all by itself     said the gnome .        ere  you don   t half look spiky .  i bet you go through a lot of bed sheets .         i don   t sleep     said frost icily  turning away .     and now  if you   ll excuse me  i have a large number of windows to do .  ferns aren   t easy .  you need a steady hand .           what do you mean dead .     susan demanded .      how can the hogfather be dead .  he   s   isn   t he what you are .  an        anthropomorphic personification .  yes .  he has become so .  the spirit of hogswatch .      but   how .  how can anyone kill the hogfather .  poisoned sherry .  spikes in the chimney .      there are   more subtle ways .      coff .  coff .  coff .  oh dear  this soot     said albert loudly .     chokes me up something cruel .         and you   ve taken over .     said susan  ignoring him .     that   s sick .      death contrived to look hurt .      i   ll just go and have a look somewhere     said albert  brushing past her and opening the door .   she pushed it shut quickly .      and what are you doing here  albert .     she said  clutching at the straw .     i thought you   d die if you ever came back to the world .      ah  but we are not in the world  said death .  we are in the special congruent reality created for the hogfather .  normal rules have to be suspended .  how else could anyone get around the entire world in one night .         s right     said albert  leering .     one of the hogfather   s little helpers  me .  official .  got the pointy green hat and everything .     he spotted the glass of sherry and couple of turnips that the children had left on the table  and bore down on them .   susan looked shocked .  a couple of days earlier she   d taken the children to the hogfather   s grotto in one of the big shops in the maul .  of course  it wasn   t the real one  but it had turned out to be a fairly good actor in a red suit .  there had been people dressed up as pixies  and a picket outside the shop by the campaign for equal heights .    none of the pixies had looked anything like albert .  if they had  people would have only gone into the grotto armed .      been good     ave yer .     said albert  and spat into the fireplace .   susan stared at him .   death leaned down .  she stared up into the blue glow of his eyes .   you are keeping well .  he said .      yes .      self reliant .  making your own way in the world .      yes .      good .  well  come  albert .  we will load the stockings and get on with things .   a couple of letters appeared in death   s hand .   someone christened the child twyla .      i   m afraid so  but why        and the other one gawain .      yes .  but look  how        why gawain .      i   suppose it   s a good strong name for a fighter        a self fulfilling prophecy  i suspect .  i see the girl writes in green crayon on pink paper with a mouse in the corner .  the mouse is wearing a dress .      i ought to point out that she decided to do that so the hogfather would think she was sweet     said susan .     including the deliberate bad spelling .  but look  why are you        she says she is five years old .      in years  yes .  in cynicism  she   s about thirty five .  why are you doing the        but she believes in the hogfather .      she   d believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her .  but you   re not going to leave without telling me        death hung the stockings back on the mantelpiece .   now we must be going .  happy hogswatch .  er   oh  yes  ho .  ho .  ho .      nice sherry     said albert  wiping his mouth .   rage overtook susan   s curiosity .  it had to travel quite fast .      you   ve actually been drinking the actual drinks little children leave out for the actual hogfather .     she said .      yeah  why not .  he ain   t drinking    em .  not where he   s gone .         and how many have you had  may i ask .         dunno  ain   t counted     said albert happily .   one million  eight hundred thousand  seven hundred and six  said death .  and sixty eight thousand  three hundred and nineteen pork pies .  and one turnip .      it looked pork pie shaped     said albert .     everything does  after a while .         then why haven   t you exploded .         dunno .  always had a good digestion .      to the hogfather  all pork pies are as one pork pie .  except the one like a turnip .  come  albert .  we have trespassed on susan   s time .      why are you doing this .     susan screamed .   i am sorry .  i cannot tell you .  forget you saw me .  it   s not your business .      not my business .  how can        and now   we must be going        nighty night     said albert .   the clock struck  twice  for the half hour .  it was still half past six .   and they were gone .     the sleigh hurtled across the sky .      she   ll try to find out what this is all about  you know     said albert .   oh dear .      especially after you told her not to .      you think so .      yeah     said albert .   dear me .  i still have a lot to learn about humans  don   t i .      oh   i dunno       said albert .   obviously it would be quite wrong to involve a human in all this .  that is why  you will recall  i clearly forbade her to take an interest .      yeah   you did        besides  it   s against the rules .      you said them little gray buggers had already broken the rules .      yes  but i can   t just wave a magic wand and make it all better .  there must be procedures .  death stared ahead for a moment and then shrugged .  and we have so much to do .  we have promises to keep .      well  the night is young     said albert  sitting back in the sacks .   the night is old .  the night is always old .   the pigs galloped on .  then     no  it ain   t .      i   m sorry .      the night isn   t any older than the day  master .  it stands to reason .  there must have been a day before anyone knew what the night was .      yes  but it   s more dramatic .      oh .  right  then .        susan stood by the fireplace .   it wasn   t as though she disliked death .  death considered as an individual rather than life   s final curtain was someone she couldn   t help liking  in a strange kind of way .   even so     the idea of the grim reaper filling the hogswatch stockings of the world didn   t fit well in her head  no matter which way she twisted it .  it was like trying to imagine old man trouble as the tooth fairy .  oh  yes .  old man trouble   now there was a nasty one for you     but honestly  what kind of sick person went round creeping into little children   s bedrooms all night .   well  the hogfather  of course  but     there was a little tinkling sound from somewhere near the base of the hogswatch tree .   the raven backed away from the shards of one of the glittering balls .      sorry     it mumbled .     bit of a species reaction there .  you know   round  glittering   sometimes you just gotta peck           that chocolate money belongs to the children .      squeak .  said the death of rats  backing away from the shiny coins .      why   s he doing this .      squeak .      you don   t know either .      squeak .      is there some kind of trouble .  did he do something to the real hogfather .      squeak .      why won   t he tell me .      squeak .      thank you .  you   ve been very helpful .      something ripped  behind her .  she turned and saw the raven carefully removing a strip of red wrapping paper from a package .      stop that this minute .      it looked up guiltily .      it   s only a little bit     it said .     no one   s going to miss it .         what do you want it for  anyway .         we   re attracted to bright colors  right .  automatic reaction .         that   s jackdaws .         damn .  is it .      the death of rats nodded .  squeak .      oh  so suddenly you   re mr .  ornithologist  are you .     snapped the raven .   susan sat down and held out her hand .   the death of rats leapt onto it .  she could feel its claws  like tiny pins .   it was just like those scenes where the sweet and pretty heroine sings a little duet with mr .  bluebird .   similar  anyway .   in general outline  at least .  but with more of a pg rating .      has he gone funny in the head .      squeak .  the rat shrugged .      but it could happen  couldn   t it .  he   s very old  and i suppose he sees a lot of terrible things .      squeak .      all the trouble in the world     the raven translated .      i understood     said susan .  that was a talent  too .  she didn   t understand what the rat said .  she just understood what it meant .      there   s something wrong and he won   t tell me .     said susan .   that made her even more angry .      but albert is in on it  too     she added .   she thought  thousands  millions of years in the same job .  not a nice one .  it isn   t always cheerful old men passing away at a great age .  sooner or later  it was bound to get anyone down .   someone had to do something .  it was like that time when twyla   s grandmother had started telling everyone that she was the empress of krull and had stopped wearing clothes .   and susan was bright enough to know that the phrase    someone ought to do something    was not  by itself  a helpful one .  people who used it never added the rider    and that someone is me .     but someone ought to do something  and right now the whole pool of someones consisted of her  and no one else .   twyla   s grandmother had ended up in a nursing home overlooking the sea at quirm .  that sort of option probably didn   t apply here .  besides  he   d be unpopular with the other residents .     she concentrated .  this was the simplest talent of them all .  she was amazed that other people couldn   t do it .  she shut her eyes  placed her hands palm down in front of her at shoulder height  spread her fingers and lowered her hands .   when they were halfway down she heard the clock stop ticking .  the last tick was long drawn out  like a death rattle .   time stopped .   but duration continued .   she   d always wondered  when she was small  why visits to her grandfather could go on for days and yet  when they got back  the calendar was still plodding along as if they   d never been away .   now she knew the why  although probably no human being would ever really understand the how .  sometimes  somewhere  somehow  the numbers on the clock did not count .   between every rational moment were a billion irrational ones .  somewhere behind the hours there was a place where the hogfather rode  the tooth fairies climbed their ladders  jack frost drew his pictures  the soul cake duck laid her chocolate eggs .  in the endless spaces between the clumsy seconds death moved like a witch dancing through raindrops  never getting wet .   humans could liv   no  humans couldn   t live here  no  because even when you diluted a glass of wine with a bathful of water you might have more liquid but you still had the same amount of wine .  a rubber band was still the same rubber band no matter how far it was stretched .   humans could exist here  though .   it was never too cold  although the air did prickle like winter air on a sunny day .  but out of human habit susan got her cloak out of the closet .   squeak .      haven   t you got some mice and rats to see to  then .         nah     s pretty quiet just before hogswatch     said the raven  who was trying to fold the red paper between his claws .     you get a lot of gerbils and hamsters and that in a few days  mind .  when the kids forget to feed them or try to find out what makes them go .      of course  she   d be leaving the children .  but it wasn   t as if anything could happen to them .  there wasn   t any time for it to happen to them in .   she hurried down the stairs and let herself out of the front door .   snow hung in the air .  it was not a poetic description .  it hovered like the stars .  when flakes touched susan they melted with little electric flashes .   there was a lot of traffic in the street  but it was fossilized in time .  she walked carefully between it until she reached the entrance to the park .   the snow had done what even wizards and the watch couldn   t do  which was clean up ankh morpork .  it hadn   t had time to get dirty .  in the morning it   d probably look as though the city had been covered in coffee meringue  but for now it mounded the bushes and trees in pure white .   there was no noise .  the curtains of snow shut out the city lights .  a few yards into the park and she might as well be in the country .   she stuck her fingers into her mouth and whistled .      y   know  that could   ve been done with a bit more ceremony     said the raven  who   d perched on a snow encrusted twig .      shut up .            s good  though .  better than most women could do .         shut up .      they waited .      why have you stolen that piece of red paper from a little girl   s present .     said susan .      i   ve got plans     said the raven darkly .   they waited again .   she wondered what would happen if it didn   t work .  she wondered if the rat would snigger .  it had the most annoying snigger in the world .   then there were hoofbeats and the floating snow burst open and the horse was there .   binky trotted round in a circle  and then stood and steamed .   he wasn   t saddled .  death   s horse didn   t let you fall .   if i get on  susan thought  it   ll all start again .  i   ll be out of the light and into the world beyond this one .  i   ll fall off the tightrope .   but a voice inside her said  you want to  though   don   t you    .   ten seconds later there was only the snow .   the raven turned to the death of rats .      any idea where i can get some string .      squeak .     she was watched .   one said  who is she .   one said  do we remember that death adopted a daughter .  the young woman is her daughter .   one said  she is human .   one said  mostly .   one said  can she be killed .   one said  oh  yes .   one said  well  that   s all right  then .   one said  er   we don   t think we   re going to get into trouble over this  do we .  all this is not exactly   authorized .  we don   t want questions asked .   one said  we have a duty to rid the universe of sloppy thinking .   one said  everyone will be grateful when they find out .     binky touched down lightly on death   s lawn .   susan didn   t bother with the front door but went around the back  which was never locked .   there had been changes .  one significant change  at least .   there was a cat flap in the door .   she stared at it .   after a second or two a ginger cat came through the flap  gave her an i   m not hungry and you   re not interesting look and padded off into the gardens .   susan pushed open the door into the kitchen .   cats of every size and color covered every surface .  hundreds of eyes swiveled to watch her .   it was mrs .  gammage all over again  she thought .  the old woman was a regular in biers for the company and was quite gaga  and one of the symptoms of those going completely yo yo was that they broke out in chronic cats .  usually cats who   d mastered every detail of feline existence except the whereabouts of the dirt box .   several of them had their noses in a bowl of cream .   susan had never been able to see the attraction in cats .  they were owned by the kind of people who liked puddings .  there were actual people in the world whose idea of heaven would be a chocolate cat .      push off  the lot of you     she said .     i   ve never known him to have pets .      the cats gave her a look to indicate that they were intending to go somewhere else in any case and strolled off  licking their chops .   the bowl slowly filled up again .   they were obviously living cats .  only life had color here .  everything else was created by death .  color  along with plumbing and music  were arts that escaped the grasp of his genius .   she left them in the kitchen and wandered along to the study .   there were changes here  too .  by the look of it  he   d been trying to learn to play the violin again .  he   d never been able to understand why he couldn   t play music .   the desk was a mess .  books lay open  piled on one another .  they were the ones susan had never learned to read .  some of the characters hovered above the pages or moved in complicated little patterns as they read you while you read them .   intricate devices had been scattered across the top .  they looked vaguely navigational  but on what oceans and under which stars .   several pages of parchment had been filled up with death   s own handwriting .  it was immediately recognizable .  no one else susan had ever met had handwriting with serifs .   it looked as though he   d been trying to work something out .   not klatch .  not howondaland .  not the empire .   let us say    million children at   lb of toys per child .   equals        tons .        tons per hour .   memo  don   t forget the sooty footprints .  more  practice on the ho ho ho .   cushion .       she put the paper back carefully .   sooner or later it   d get to you .  death was fascinated by humans  and study was never a one way thing .  a man might spend his life peering at the private life of elementary particles and then find he either knew who he was or where he was  but not both .  death had picked up   humanity .  not the real thing  but something that might pass for it until you examined it closely .   the house even imitated human houses .  death had created a bedroom for himself  despite the fact that he never slept .  if he really picked things up from humans  had he tried insanity .  it was very popular  after all .   perhaps  after all these millennia  he wanted to be nice .   she let herself into the room of lifetimers .  she   d liked the sound of it  when she was a little girl .  but now the hiss of sand from millions of hourglasses  and the little pings and pops as full ones vanished and new empty ones appeared  was not so enjoyable .  now she knew what was going on .  of course  everyone died sooner or later .  it just wasn   t right to be listening to it happening .   she was about to leave when she noticed the open door in a place where she had never seen a door before .   it was disguised .  a whole section of shelving  complete with its whispering glasses  had swung out .   susan pushed it back and forth with a finger .  when it was shut  you   d have to look hard to see the crack .   there was a much smaller room on the other side .  it was merely the size of  say  a cathedral .  and it was lined floor to ceiling with more hourglasses that susan could just see dimly in the light from the big room .  she stepped inside and snapped her fingers .      light     she commanded .  a couple of candles sprang into life .   the hourglasses were   wrong .   the ones in the main room  however metaphorical they might be  were solid looking things of wood and brass and glass .  but these looked as though they were made of highlights and shadows with no real substance at all .   she peered at a large one .   the name in it was  offler .      the crocodile god .     she thought .   well  gods had a life  presumably .  but they never actually died  as far as she knew .  they just dwindled away to a voice on the wind and a footnote in some textbook on religion .   there were other gods lined up .  she recognized a few of them .   but there were smaller lifetimers on the shelf .  when she saw the labels she nearly burst out laughing .      the tooth fairy .  the sandman .  john barleycorn .  the soul cake duck .  the god of   what .      she stepped back  and something crunched under her feet .   there were shards of glass on the floor .  she reached down and picked up the biggest .  only a few letters remained of the name etched into the glass     hogfa        oh  no   it   s true .  granddad  what have you done .      when she left  the candles winked out .  darkness sprang back .   and in the darkness  among the spilled sand  a faint sizzle and a tiny spark of light        mustrum ridcully adjusted the towel around his waist .      how   re we doing  mr .  modo .      the university gardener saluted .      the tanks are full  mr .  archchancellor  sir .     he said brightly .     and i   ve been stoking the hot water boilers all day .      the other senior wizards clustered in the doorway .      really  mustrum  i really think this is most unwise     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it was surely sealed up for a purpose .         remember what it said on the door     said the dean .      oh  they just wrote that on it to keep people out     said ridcully  opening a fresh bar of soap .      well  yes     said the chair of indefinite studies .     that   s right .  that   s what people do .         it   s a bathroom     said ridcully .     you are all acting as if it   s some kind of a torture chamber .         a bathroom     said the dean     designed by bloody stupid johnson .  archchancellor weatherwax only used it once and then had it sealed up .  mustrum  i beg you to reconsider .  it   s a johnson .      there was something of a pause  because even ridcully had to adjust his mind around this .   the late  or at least severely delayed  bergholt stuttley johnson was generally recognized as the worst inventor in the world  yet in a very specialized sense .  merely bad inventors made things that failed to operate .  he wasn   t among these small fry .  any fool could make something that did absolutely nothing when you pressed the button .  he scorned such fumble fingered amateurs .  everything he built worked .  it just didn   t do what it said on the box .  if you wanted a small ground to air missile  you asked johnson to design an ornamental fountain .  it amounted to pretty much the same thing .  but this never discouraged him  or the morbid curiosity of his clients .  music  landscape gardening  architecture   there was no start to his talents .   nevertheless  it was a little bit surprising to find that bloody stupid had turned to bathroom design .  but  as ridcully said  it was known that he had designed and built several large musical organs and  when you got right down to it  it was all just plumbing  wasn   t it .   the other wizards  who   d been there longer than the archchancellor  took the view that if bloody stupid johnson had built a fully functional bathroom he   d actually meant it to be something else .      y   know  i   ve always felt that mr .  johnson was a much maligned man     said ridcully  eventually .      well  yes  of course he was     said the lecturer in recent runes  clearly exasperated .     that   s like saying that jam attracts wasps  you see .         not everything he made worked badly     said ridcully stoutly  flourishing his scrubbing brush .     look at that thing they use down in the kitchens for peelin    the potatoes  for example .         ah  you mean the thing with the brass plate on it saying    improved manicure device     archchancellor .         listen  it   s just water     snapped ridcully .     even johnson couldn   t do much harm with water .  modo  open the sluices .      the rest of the wizards backed away as the gardener turned a couple of ornate brass wheels .      i   m fed up with groping around for the soap like you fellows .     shouted the archchancellor  as water gushed through hidden channels .     hygiene .  that   s the ticket .         don   t say we didn   t warn you     said the dean  shutting the door .      er  i still haven   t worked out where all the pipes lead  sir     modo ventured .      we   ll find out  never you fear     said ridcully happily .  he removed his hat and put on a shower cap of his own design .  in deference to his profession  it was pointy .  he picked up a yellow rubber duck .      man the pumps  mr .  modo .  or dwarf them  of course  in your case .         yes  archchancellor .      modo hauled on a lever .  the pipes started a hammering noise and steam leaked out of a few joints .   ridcully took a last look around the bathroom .   it was a hidden treasure  no doubt about it .  say what you like  old johnson must sometimes have got it right  even if it was only by accident .  the entire room  including the floor and ceiling  had been tiled in white  blue and green .  in the center  under its crown of pipes  was johnson   s patent    typhoon    superior indoor ablutorium with automatic soap dish  a sanitary poem in mahogany  rosewood and copper .   he   d got modo to polish every pipe and brass tap until they gleamed .  it had taken ages .   ridcully shut the frosted door behind him .   the inventor of the ablutionary marvel had decided to make a mere shower a fully controllable experience  and one wall of the large cubicle held a marvelous panel covered with brass taps cast in the shape of mermaids and shells and  for some reason  pomegranates .  there were separate feeds for salt water  hard water and soft water and huge wheels for accurate control of temperature .  ridcully inspected them with care .   then he stood back  looked around at the tiles and sang     mi  mi  mi .      his voice reverberated back at him .      a perfect echo .     said ridcully  one of nature   s bathroom baritones .   he picked up a speaking tube that had been installed to allow the bather to communicate with the engineer .      all cisterns go  mr .  modo .         aye  aye  sir .      ridcully opened the tap marked    spray    and leapt aside  because part of him was still well aware that johnson   s inventiveness didn   t just push the edge of the envelope but often went across the room and out through the wall of the sorting office .   a gentle shower of warm water  almost a caressing mist  enveloped him .      my word .     he exclaimed  and tried another tap .      shower    turned out to be a little more invigorating .     torrent    made him gasp for breath and    deluge    sent him groping to the panel because the top of his head felt that it was being removed .     wave    sloshed a wall of warm salt water from one side of the cubicle to the other before it disappeared into the grating that was set into the middle of the floor .      are you all right  sir .     modo called out .      marvelous .  and there   s a dozen knobs i haven   t tried yet .      modo nodded  and tapped a valve .  ridcully   s voice  raised in what he considered to be song  boomed out through the thick clouds of steam .      oh  iiiiiii knew a   er   an agricultural worker of some description  possibly a thatcher     and i knew him well  and he   he was a farmer  now i come to think of it   and he had a daughter and her name i can   t recall at the moment   and   where was i .  ah yes .  chorus   something something  a humorously shaped vegetable  a turnip  i believe  something something and the sweet and the sweet nightingaleeeeaarggooooooh arrghh oh oh oh        the song shut off suddenly .  all modo could hear was a ferocious gushing noise .      archchancellor .      after a moment a voice answered from near the ceiling .  it sounded somewhat high and hesitant .      er   i wonder if you would be so very good as to shut the water off from out there  my dear chap .  er   quite gently  if you wouldn   t mind        modo carefully spun a wheel .  the gushing sound gradually subsided .      ah .  well done     said the voice  but now from somewhere nearer floor level .     well .  jolly good job .  i think we can definitely call it a success .  yes  indeed .  er .  i wonder if you could help me walk for a moment .  i inexplicably feel a little unsteady on my feet        modo pushed open the door and helped ridcully out and onto a bench .  he looked rather pale .      yes  indeed     said the archchancellor  his eyes a little glazed .     astoundingly successful .  er .  just a minor point  modo           yes  sir .         there   s a tap in there we perhaps should leave alone for now     said ridcully .     i   d esteem it a service if you could go and make a little sign to hang on it .         yes  sir .         saying    do not touch at all     or something like that .         right  sir .         hang it on the one marked    old faithful .            yes  sir .         no need to mention it to the other fellows .         yes  sir .         ye gods  i   ve never felt so clean .      from a vantage point among some ornamental tile work near the ceiling a small gnome in a bowler hat watched ridcully carefully .   when modo had gone  the archchancellor slowly began to dry himself on a big fluffy towel .  as he got his composure back  so another song wormed its way under his breath .      on the second day of hogswatch i   sent my true love back  a nasty little letter  hah  yes indeed  and a partridge in a pear tree        the gnome slid down onto the tiles and crept up behind the briskly shaking shape .   ridcully  after a few more trial runs  settled on a song which evolves somewhere on every planet where there are winters .  it   s often dragooned into the service of some local religion and a few words are changed  but it   s really about things that have to do with gods only in the same way that roots have to do with leaves .         the rising of the sun  and the running of the deer        ridcully spun .  a corner of wet towel caught the gnome on the ear and flicked it onto its back .      i saw you creeping up .     roared the archchancellor .     what   s the game  then .  small time thief  are you .      the gnome slid backward on the soapy surface .         ere  what   s your game  mister  you ain   t supposed to be able to see me .         i   m a wizard .  we can see things that are really there  you know     said ridcully .     and in the case of the bursar  things that aren   t there  too .  what   s in this bag .         you don   t wanna open the bag  mister .  you really don   t wanna open the bag .         why .  what have you got in it .      the gnome sagged .     it ain   t what   s in it  mister .  it   s what   ll come out .  i has to let    em out one at a time  no knowin    what   d happen if they all gets out at once .      ridcully looked interested  and started to undo the string .      you   ll really wish you hadn   t  mister .     the gnome pleaded .      will i .  what   re you doing here  young man .      the gnome gave up .      well   you know the tooth fairy .         yes .  of course     said ridcully .      well   i ain   t her .  but   it   s sort of like the same business           what .  you take things away .         er   not take away  as such .  more sort of   bring           ah   like new teeth .         er   like new verrucas     said the gnome .      death threw the sack into the back of the sleigh and climbed in after it .      you   re doing well  master     said albert .   this cushion is still uncomfortable  said death  hitching his belt .  i am not used to a big fat stomach .      just a stomach   s the best i could do  master .  you   re starting off with a handicap  sort of thing .      albert unscrewed the top off a bottle of cold tea .  all the sherry had made him thirsty .      doing well  master     he repeated  taking a pull .     all the soot in the fireplace  the footprints  them swigged sherries  the sleigh tracks all over the roofs   it   s got to work .      you think so .      sure .      and i made sure some of them saw me .  i know if they are peeping  death added proudly .      well done  sir .      yes .      though here   s a tip  though .  just    ho  ho  ho    will do .  don   t say     cower  brief mortals    unless you want them to grow up to be moneylenders or some such .      ho .  ho .  ho .      yes  you   re really getting the hang of it .     albert looked down hurriedly at his notebook so that death wouldn   t see his face .     now  i got to tell you  master  what   ll really do some good is a public appearance .  really .      oh .  i don   t normally do them .      the hogfather   s more of a public figure  master .  and one good public appearance   ll do more good than any amount of letting kids see you by accident .  good for the old belief muscles .      really .  ho .  ho .  ho .      right  right  that   s really good  master .  where was i   yes   the shops   ll be open late .  lots of kiddies get taken to see the hogfather  you see .  not the real one  of course .  just some ole geezer with a pillow up his jumper  saving yer presence  master .      not real .  ho .  ho .  ho .      oh  no .  and you don   t need        the children know this .  ho .  ho .  ho .   albert scratched his nose .     s   pose so  master .      this should not be .  no wonder there has been   this difficulty .  belief was compromised .  ho .  ho .  ho .      could be  master .  er  the    ho  ho           where does this travesty take place .  ho .  ho .  ho .   albert gave up .     well  crumley   s in the maul  for one .  very popular  the hogfather grotto .  they always have a good hogfather  apparently .      let   s get there and sleigh them .  ho .  ho .  ho .      right you are  master .      that was a pune or play on words  albert .  i don   t know if you noticed .      i   m laughing like hell deep down  sir .      ho .  ho .  ho .      archchancellor ridcully grinned .   he often grinned .  he was one of those men who grinned even when they were annoyed  but right now he grinned because he was proud .  a little sore still  perhaps  but still proud .      amazing bathroom  ain   t it .     he said .     they had it walled up  you know .  damn silly thing to do .  i mean  perhaps there were a few teething troubles     he shifted gingerly     but that   s only to be expected .  it   s got everything  d   you see .  footbaths in the shape of clam shells  look .  a whole wardrobe for dressing gowns .  and that tub over there   s got a big blower thingy so   s you get bubbly water without even havin    to eat starchy food .  and this thingy here with the mermaids holdin    it up   s a special pot for your toenail clippings .  it   s got everything  this place .         a special pot for nail clippings .     said the verruca gnome .      oh  can   t be too careful     said ridcully  lifting the lid of an ornate jar marked bath salts and pulling out a bottle of wine .     get hold of something like someone   s nail clipping and you   ve got    em under your control .  that   s real old magic .  dawn of time stuff .      he held the wine bottle up to the light .      should be cooled nicely by now     he said  extracting the cork .     verrucas  eh .         wish i knew why     said the gnome .      you mean you don   t know .         nope .  suddenly i wake up and i   m the verruca gnome .         puzzling  that     said ridcully .     my dad used to say the verruca gnome turned up if you walked around in bare feet but i never knew you existed .  i thought he just made it up .  i mean  tooth fairies  yes  and them little buggers that live in flowers  used to collect    em myself as a lad  but can   t recall anything about verrucas .     he drank thoughtfully .     got a distant cousin called verruca  as a matter of fact .  it   s quite a nice sound  when you come to think of it .      he looked at the gnome over the top of his glass .   you didn   t become archchancellor without a feeling for subtle wrongness in a situation .  well  that wasn   t quite true .  it was more accurate to say that you didn   t remain archchancellor for very long .      good job  is it .     he said thoughtfully .      dandruff   d be better     said the gnome .     at least i   d be out in the fresh air .         i think we   d better check up on this     said ridcully .     of course  it might be nothing .         oh  thank you     said the verruca gnome  gloomily .      it was a magnificent grotto this year  vernon crumley told himself .  the staff had worked really hard .  the hogfather   s sleigh was a work of art in itself  and the pigs looked really real and a wonderful shade of pink .   the grotto took up nearly all of the first floor .  one of the pixies had been disciplined for smoking behind the magic tinkling waterfall  and the clockwork dolls of all nations showing how we could all get along were a bit jerky and giving trouble but all in all  he told himself  it was a display to delight the hearts of kiddies everywhere .   the kiddies were queuing up with their parents and watching the display owlishly .   and the money was coming in .  oh  how the money was coming in .   so that the staff would not be tempted  mr .  crumley had set up an arrangement of overhead wires across the ceilings of the store .  in the middle of each floor was a cashier in a little cage .  staff took money from customers  put it in a little clockwork cable car  sent it whizzing overhead to the cashier  who   d make change and start it rattling back again .  thus there was no possibility of temptation  and the little trolleys were shooting back and forth like fireworks .   mr .  crumley loved hogswatch .  it was for the kiddies  after all .   he tucked his fingers in the pockets of his waistcoat and beamed .      everything going well  miss harding .         yes  mr .  crumley     said the cashier  meekly .      jolly good .     he looked at the pile of coins .   a bright little zigzag crackled off them and earthed itself on the metal grille .   mr .  crumley blinked .  in front of him sparks flashed off the steel rims of miss harding   s spectacles .   the grotto display changed .  for just a fraction of a second mr .  crumley had the sensation of speed  as though what appeared had screeched to a halt .  which was ridiculous .   the four pink papier m  ch   pigs exploded .  a cardboard snout bounced off mr .  crumley   s head .   there  sweating and grunting in the place where the little piggies had been  were   well  he assumed they were pigs  because hippopotamuses didn   t have pointy ears and rings through their noses .  but the creatures were huge and gray and bristly and a cloud of acrid mist hung over each one .   and they didn   t look sweet .  there was nothing charming about them .  one turned to look at him with small  red eyes  and didn   t go    oink     which was the sound that mr .  crumley  born and raised in the city  had always associated with pigs .   it went    ghnaaarrrwnnkh .      the sleigh had changed  too .  he   d been very pleased with that sleigh .  it had delicate silver curly bits on it .  he   d personally supervised the gluing on of every twinkling star .  but the splendor of it was lying in glittering shards around a sleigh that looked as though it had been built of crudely sawn tree trunks laid on two massive wooden runners .  it looked ancient and there were faces carved on the wood  nasty crude grinning faces that looked quite out of place .   parents were yelling and trying to pull their children away  but they weren   t having much luck .  the children were gravitating toward it like flies to jam .   mr .  crumley ran toward the terrible thing  waving his hands .      stop that .  stop that .     he screamed .     you   ll frighten the kiddies .      he heard a small boy behind him say     they   ve got tusks .  cool .      his sister said     hey  look  that one   s doing a wee .     a tremendous cloud of yellow steam arose .     look  it   s going all the way to the stairs .  all those who can   t swim hold onto the banisters .         they eat you if you   re bad  you know     said a small girl with obvious approval .     all up .  even the bones .  they crunch them .      another  older  child opined     don   t be childish .  they   re not real .  they   ve just got a wizard in to do the magic .  or it   s all done by clockwork .  everyone knows they   re not really r        one of the boars turned to look at him .  the boy moved behind his mother .   mr .  crumley  tears of anger streaming down his face  fought through the milling crowd until he reached the hogfather   s grotto .  he grabbed a frightened pixie .      it   s the campaign for equal heights that   ve done this  isn   t it .     he shouted .     they   re out to ruin me .  and they   re ruining it for all the kiddies .  look at the lovely dolls .      the pixie hesitated .  children were clustering around the pigs  despite the continued efforts of their mothers .  the small girl was giving one of them an orange .   but the animated display of dolls of all nations was definitely in trouble .  the musical box underneath was still playing    wouldn   t it be nice if everyone was nice    but the rods that animated the figures had got twisted out of shape  so that the klatchian boy was rhythmically hitting the omnian girl over the head with his ceremonial spear  while the girl in agatean national costume was kicking a small llamedosian druid repeatedly in the ear .  a chorus of small children was cheering them on indiscriminately .      there   s  er  there   s more trouble in the grotto  mr .  crum       the pixie began .   a red and white figure pushed its way through the crush and rammed a false beard into mr .  crumley   s hands .      that   s it     said the old man in the hogfather costume .     i don   t mind the smell of oranges and the damp trousers but i ain   t putting up with this .      he stamped off through the queue .  mr .  crumley heard him add     and he   s not even doin    it right .      mr .  crumley forced his way onward .   someone was sitting in the big chair .  there was a child on his knee .  the figure was   strange .  it was definitely in something like a hogfather costume but mr .  crumley   s eye kept slipping  it wouldn   t focus  it skittered away and tried to put the figure on the very edge of vision .  it was like trying to look at your own ear .      what   s going on here .  what   s going on here .     crumley demanded .   a hand took his shoulder firmly .  he turned round and looked into the face of a grotto pixie .  at least  it was wearing the costume of a grotto pixie  although somewhat askew  as if it had been put on in a hurry .      who are you .      the pixie took the soggy cigarette end out of its mouth and leered at him .      call me uncle heavy     he said .      you   re not a pixie .         nah  i   m a fairy cobbler  mister .      behind crumley  a voice said   and what do you want for hogswatch  small human .   mr .  crumley turned in horror .   in front of   well  he had to think of it as the usurping hogfather   was a small child of indeterminate sex who seemed to be mostly woollen bobble hat .   mr .  crumley knew how it was supposed to go .  it was supposed to go like this  the child was always struck dumb and the attendant mother would lean forward and catch the hogfather   s eye and say very pointedly  in that voice adults use when they   re conspiring against children     you want a baby tinkler doll  don   t you  doreen .  and the just like mummy cookery set you   ve got in the window .  and the cut out kitchen range book .  and what do you say .      and the stunned child would murmur       nk you    and get given a balloon or an orange .   this time  though  it didn   t work like that .   mother got as far as    you want a        why are your hands on bits of string  child .   the child looked down the length of its arms to the dangling mittens affixed to its sleeves .  it held them up for inspection .      glubs     it said .   i see .  very practical .      are you weal .     said the bobble hat .   what do you think .   the bobble hat sniggered .     i saw your piggy do a wee .     it said  and implicit in the tone was the suggestion that this was unlikely to be dethroned as the most enthralling thing the bobble hat had ever seen .   oh .  er   good .      it had a gwate big        what do you want for hogswatch .  said the hogfather hurriedly .   mother took her economic cue again  and said briskly     she wants a        the hogfather snapped his fingers impatiently .  the mother   s mouth slammed shut .   the child seemed to sense that here was a once in a lifetime opportunity and spoke quickly .      i wanta narmy .  anna big castle wif pointy bits     said the child .     anna swored .      what do you say .  prompted the hogfather .      a big swored .     said the child  after a pause for deep cogitation .   that   s right .   uncle heavy nudged the hogfather .      they   re supposed to thank you     he said .   are you sure .  people don   t  normally .      i meant they thank the hogfather     albert hissed .     which is you  right .      yes  of course .  ahem .  you   re supposed to say thank you .         nk you .      and be good .  this is part of the arrangement .         es .      then we have a contract .  the hogfather reached into his sack and produced        a very large model castle with  as correctly interpreted  pointy blue cone roofs on turrets suitable for princesses to be locked in        a box of several hundred assorted knights and warriors        and a sword .  it was four feet long and glinted along the blade .   the mother took a deep breath .      you can   t give her that .     she screamed .     it   s not safe .      it   s a sword  said the hogfather .  they   re not meant to be safe .      she   s a child .     shouted crumley .   it   s educational .      what if she cuts herself .      that will be an important lesson .   uncle heavy whispered urgently .   really .  oh  well .  it   s not for me to argue  i suppose .   the blade went wooden .      and she doesn   t want all that other stuff .     said doreen   s mother  in the face of previous testimony .     she   s a girl .  anyway  i can   t afford big posh stuff like that .      i thought i gave it away  said the hogfather  sounding bewildered .      you do .     said the mother .      you do .     said crumley  who   d been listening in horror .     you don   t .  that   s our merchandise .  you can   t give it away .  hogswatch isn   t about giving it all away .  i mean   yes  of course  of course things are given away     he corrected himself  aware that people were watching     but first they have to be bought  d   you see  i mean   haha .     he laughed nervously  increasingly aware of the strangeness around him and the rangy look of uncle heavy .     it   s not as though the toys are made by little elves at the hub  ahaha           damn right     said uncle heavy sagely .     you   d have to be a maniac even to think of giving an elf a chisel  less   n you want their initials carved on your forehead .         you mean this is all free .     said doreen   s mother sharply  not to be budged from what she saw as the central point .   mr .  crumley looked helplessly at the toys .  they certainly didn   t look like any of his stock .   then he tried to look hard at the new hogfather .  every cell in his brain was telling him that here was a fat jolly man in a red and white suit .   well   nearly every cell .  a few of the sparkier ones were saying that his eyes were reporting something else  but they couldn   t agree on what .  a couple had shut down completely .   the words escaped through his teeth .      it   seems to be     he said .      although it was hogswatch the university buildings were bustling .  wizards didn   t go to bed early in any case   and of course there was the hogswatchnight feast to look forward to at midnight .   it would give some idea of the scale of the hogswatchnight feast that a light snack at uu consisted of a mere three or four courses  not counting the cheese and nuts .   some of the wizards had been practicing for weeks .  the dean in particular could now lift a twenty pound turkey on one fork .  having to wait until midnight merely put a healthy edge on appetites already professionally honed .   there was a general air of pleasant expectancy about the place  a general sizzling of salivary glands  a general careful assembling of the pills and powders against the time  many hours ahead  when eighteen courses would gang up somewhere below the rib cage and mount a counterattack .   ridcully stepped out into the snow and turned up his collar .  the lights were all on in the high energy magic building .      i don   t know  i don   t know     he muttered .     hogswatchnight and they   re still working .  it   s just not natural .  when i was a student i   d have been sick twice by now        in fact ponder stibbons and his group of research students had made a concession to hogswatchnight .  they   d draped holly over hex and put a paper hat on the big glass dome containing the main ant heap .   every time he came in here  it seemed to ridcully  something more had been done to the   engine  or thinking machine  or whatever it was .  sometimes stuff turned up overnight .  occasionally  according to stibbons  hex hims   itself would draw plans for extra bits that he   it needed .  it all gave ridcully the willies  and an additional willy was engendered right now when he saw the bursar sitting in front of the thing .  for a moment  he forgot all about verrucas .      what   re you doing here  old chap .     he said .     you should be inside  jumping up and down to make more room for tonight .         hooray for the pink  gray and green     said the bursar .      er   we thought hex might be of   you know   help  sir     said ponder stibbons  who liked to think of himself as the university   s token sane person .     with the bursar   s problem .  we thought it might be a nice hogswatch present for him .         ye gods  bursar   s got no problems     said ridcully  and patted the aimlessly smiling man on the head while mouthing the words    mad as a spoon .        mind just wanders a bit  that   s all .  i said mind wanders a bit  eh .  only to be expected  spends far too much time addin    up numbers .  doesn   t get out in the fresh air .  i said  you don   t get out in the fresh air  old chap .         we thought  er  he might like someone to talk to     said ponder .      what .  what .  but i talk to him all the time .  i   m always trying to take him out of himself     said ridcully .     it   s important to stop him mopin    around the place .         er   yes   certainly     said ponder diplomatically .  he recalled the bursar as a man whose idea of an exciting time had once been a soft boiled egg .     so   er   well  let   s give it another try  shall we .  are you ready  mr .  dinwiddie .         yes  thank you  a green one with cinnamon if it   s not too much trouble .         can   t see how he can talk to a machine     said ridcully  in a sullen voice .     the thing   s got no damn ears .         ah  well  in fact we made it one ear     said ponder .     er        he pointed to a large drum in a maze of tubes .      isn   t that old windle poons   s ear trumpet sticking out of the end .     said ridcully suspiciously .      yes  archchancellor .     ponder cleared his throat .     sound  you see  comes in waves        he stopped .  wizardly premonitions rose in his mind .  he just knew ridcully was going to assume he was talking about the sea .  there was going to be one of those huge bottomless misunderstandings that always occurred whenever anyone tried to explain anything to the archchancellor .  words like    surf     and probably    ice cream    and    sand    were just        it   s all done by magic  archchancellor     he said  giving up .      ah .  right     said ridcully .  he sounded a little disappointed .     none of that complicated business with springs and cogwheels and tubes and stuff  then .         that   s right  sir     said ponder .     just magic .  sufficiently advanced magic .         fair enough .  what   s it do .         hex can hear what you say .         interesting .  saves all that punching holes in bits of cards and hitting keys you lads are forever doing  then           watch this  sir     said ponder .     all right  adrian  initialize the gbl .         how do you do that  then .     said ridcully  behind him .      it   it means pull the great big lever     ponder said  reluctantly .      ah .  takes less time to say .      ponder sighed .     yes  that   s right  archchancellor .      he nodded to one of the students  who pulled a large red lever marked    do not pull .     gears spun  somewhere inside hex .  little trapdoors opened in the ant farms and millions of ants began to scurry along the networks of glass tubing .  ponder tapped at the huge wooden keyboard .      beats me how you fellows remember how to do all this stuff     said ridcully  still watching him with what ponder considered to be amused interest .      oh  it   s largely intuitive  archchancellor     said ponder .     obviously you have to spend a lot of time learning it first  though .  now  then  bursar     he added .     if you   d just like to say something           he says  say something  bursaaar .     yelled ridcully helpfully  into the bursar   s ear .      corkscrew .  it   s a tickler  that   s what nanny says     said the bursar .   things started to spin inside hex .  at the back of the room a huge converted waterwheel covered with sheep skulls began to turn  ponderously .   and the quill pen in its network of springs and guiding arms started to write       why do you think you are a tickler .       for a moment the bursar hesitated .  then he said     i   ve got a spoon of my own  you know .          tell me about your spoon         er   it   s a little spoon            does your spoon worry you .       the bursar frowned .  then he seemed to rally .     whoops  here comes mr .  jelly     he said  but he didn   t sound as though his heart was in it .       how long have you been mr .  jelly .       the bursar glared .     are you making fun of me .     he said .      amazin    .     said ridcully .     it   s got him stumped .     s better than dried frog pills .  how did you work it out .         er       said ponder .     it sort of just happened           amazin        said ridcully .  he knocked the ashes out of his pipe on hex   s    anthill inside    sticker  causing ponder to wince .     this thing   s a kind of big artificial brain  then .         you could think of it like that     said ponder  carefully .     of course  hex doesn   t actually think .  not as such .  it just appears to be thinking .         ah .  like the dean     said ridcully .     any chance of fitting a brain like this into the dean   s head .         it does weigh ten tons  archchancellor .         ah .  really .  oh .  quite a large crowbar would be in order  then .     he paused  and then reached into his pocket .     i knew i   d come here for something     he added .     this here chappie is the verruca gnome           hello     said the verruca gnome shyly .         who seems to have popped into existence to be with us here tonight .  and  you know  i thought  this is a bit odd .  of course  there   s always something a bit unreal about hogswatchnight     said ridcully .     last night of the year and so on .  the hogfather whizzin    around and so forth .  time of the darkest shadows and so on .  all the old year   s occult rubbish pilin    up .  anythin    could happen .  i just thought you fellows might check up on this .  probably nothing to worry about .         a verruca gnome .     said ponder .   the gnome clutched his sack protectively .      makes about as much sense as a lot of things  i suppose     said ridcully .     after all  there   s a tooth fairy  ain    there .  you might as well wonder why we have a god of wine and not a god of hangovers        he stopped .      anyone else hear that noise just then .     he said .      sorry  archchancellor .         sort of glingleglingleglingle .  like little tinkly bells .         didn   t hear anything like that  sir .         oh .     ridcully shrugged .     anyway   what was i saying   yes   no one   s ever heard of a verruca gnome until tonight .         that   s right     said the gnome .     even i   ve never heard of me until tonight  and i   m me .         we   ll see what we can find out  archchancellor     said ponder diplomatically .      good man .     ridcully put the gnome back in his pocket and looked up at hex .      amazin        he said again .     he just looks as though he   s thinking  right .         er   yes .         but he   s not actually thinking .         er   no .         so   he just gives the impression of thinking but really it   s just a show .         er   yes .         just like everyone else  then  really     said ridcully .      the boy gave the hogfather an appraising stare as he sat down on the official knee .      let   s be absolutely clear .  i know you   re just someone dressed up     he said .     the hogfather is a biological and temporal impossibility .  i hope we understand one another .      ah .  so i don   t exist .      correct .  this is just a bit of seasonal frippery and  i may say  rampantly commercial .  my mother   s already bought my presents .  i instructed her as to the right ones  of course .  she often gets things wrong .      the hogfather glanced briefly at the smiling  worried image of maternal ineffectiveness hovering nearby .   how old are you  boy .   the child rolled his eyes .     you   re not supposed to say that     he said .     i have done this before  you know .  you have to start by asking me my name .      aaron fidget     the pines     edgeway road  ankh morpork .      i expect someone told you     said aaron .     i expect these people dressed up as pixies get the information from the mothers .      and you are eight  going on   oh  about forty five  said the hogfather .      there   s forms to fill in when they pay  i expect     said aaron .   and you want walnut   s inoffensive reptiles of the sto plains  a display cabinet  a collector   s album  a killing jar and a lizard press .  what is a lizard press .      you can   t glue them in when they   re still fat  or didn   t you know that .  i expect she told you about them when i was momentarily distracted by the display of pencils .  look  shall we end this charade .  just give me my orange and we   ll say no more about it .      i can give far more than oranges .      yes  yes  i saw all that .  probably done in collusion with accomplices to attract gullible customers .  oh dear  you   ve even got a false beard .  by the way  old chap  did you know that your pig        yes .      all done by mirrors and string and pipes  i expect .  it all looked very artificial to me .      the hogfather snapped his fingers .      that   s probably a signal  i expect     said the boy  getting down .     thank you very much .      happy hogswatch  said the hogfather as the boy walked away .   uncle heavy patted him on the shoulder .      well done  master     he said .     very patient .  i   d have given him a clonk athwart the ear hole  myself .      oh  i   m sure he   ll see the error of his ways .  the red hood turned so that only albert could see into its depths .  right around the time he opens those boxes his mother was carrying     ho .  ho .  ho .         don   t tie it so tight .  don   t tie it so tight .      squeak .   there was a bickering behind susan as she sought along the shelves in the canyons of death   s huge library  which was so big that clouds would form in it if they dared .      right  right     said the voice she was trying to ignore .     that   s about right .  i   ve got to be able to move my wings  right .      squeak .      ah     said susan  under her breath .     the hogfather        he had several shelves  not just one book .  the first volume seemed to be written on a roll of animal skin .  the hogfather was old .      okay  okay .  how does it look .      squeak .      miss .     said the raven  seeking a second opinion .   susan looked up .  the raven bounced past  its breast bright red .      twit  twit     it said .     bobbly bobbly bob .  hop hop hopping along           you   re fooling no one but yourself     said susan .     i can see the string .      she unrolled the scroll .      maybe i should sit on a snowy log     mumbled the raven behind her .     that   s probably the trick  right enough .         i can   t read this .     said susan .     the letters are all   odd           ethereal runes     said the raven .     the hogfather ain   t human  after all .      susan ran her hands over the thin leather .  the   shapes flowed around her fingers .   she couldn   t read them but she could feel them .  there was the sharp smell of snow  so vivid that her breath condensed in the air .  there were sounds  hooves  the snap of branches in a freezing forest     a bright shining ball     susan jerked awake and thrust the scroll aside .  she unrolled the next one  which looked as though it was made of strips of bark .  characters hovered over the surface .  whatever they were  they had never been designed to be read by the eye  you could believe they were a braille for the touching mind .  images ribboned across her senses   wet fur  sweat  pine  soot  iced air  the tang of damp ash  pig   manure  her governess mind hastily corrected .  there was blood   and the taste of   beans .  it was all images without words .  almost   animal .      but none of this is right .  everyone knows he   s a jolly old fat man who hands out presents to kids .     she said aloud .      is .  is .  not was .  you know how it is     said the raven .      do i .         it   s like  you know  industrial retraining     said the bird .     even gods have to move with the times  am i right .  he was probably quite different thousands of years ago .  stands to reason .  no one wore stockings  for one thing .     he scratched at his beak .      yersss     he continued expansively     he was probably just your basic winter demi urge .  you know   blood on the snow  making the sun come up .  starts off with animal sacrifice  y   know  hunt some big hairy animal to death  that kind of stuff .  you know there   s some people up on the ramtops who kill a wren at hogswatch and walk around from house to house singing about it .  with a whack fol oh diddle dildo .  very folkloric  very myffic .         a wren .  why .         i dunno .  maybe someone said  hey  how   d you like to hunt this evil bastard of an eagle with his big sharp beak and great ripping talons  sort of thing  or how about instead you hunt this wren  which is basically about the size of a pea and goes    twit    .  go on  you choose .  anyway  then later on it sinks to the level of religion and then they start this business where some poor bugger finds a special bean in his tucker  oho  everyone says  you   re king  mate  and he thinks    this is a bit of all right    only they don   t say it wouldn   t be a good idea to start any long books     cos next thing he   s legging it over the snow with a dozen other buggers chasing him with holy sickles so   s the earth   ll come to life again and all this snow   ll go away .  very  you know   ethnic .  then some bright spark thought  hey  looks like that damn sun comes up anyway  so how come we   re giving those druids all this free grub .  next thing you know  there   s a job vacancy .  that   s the thing about gods .  they   ll always find a way to  you know   hang on .         the damn sun comes up anyway     susan repeated .     how do you know that .         oh  observation .  it happens every morning .  i seen it .         i meant all that stuff about holy sickles and things .      the raven contrived to look smug .      very occult bird  your basic raven     he said .     blind io the thunder god used to have these myffic ravens that flew everywhere and told him everything that was going on .         used to .         weeelll   you know how he   s not got eyes in his face  just these  like  you know  free floating eyeballs that go and zoom around       the raven coughed in species embarrassment .     bit of an accident waiting to happen  really .         do you ever think of anything except eyeballs .         well   there   s entrails .      squeak .      he   s right  though     said susan .     gods don   t die .  never completely die        there   s always somewhere  she told herself .  inside some stone  perhaps  or the words of a song  or riding the mind of some animal  or maybe in a whisper on the wind .  they never entirely go  they hang onto the world by the tip of a fingernail  always fighting to find a way back .  once a god  always a god .  dead  perhaps  but only like the world in winter        all right     she said .     let   s see what happened to him        she reached out for the last book and tried to open it at random     the feeling lashed at her out of the book  like a whip        hooves  fear  blood  snow  cold  night     she dropped the scroll .  it slammed shut .   squeak .      i   m   all right .      she looked down at the book and knew that she   d been given a friendly warning  such as a pet animal might give when it was crazed with pain but just still tame enough not to claw and bite the hand that fed it   this time .  wherever the hogfather was   dead  alive  somewhere   he wanted to be left alone     she eyed the death of rats .  his little eye sockets flared blue in a disconcertingly familiar way .   squeak .  eek .      the rat says  if he wanted to find out about the hogfather  he   d go to the castle of bones .         oh  that   s just a nursery tale     said susan .     that   s where the letters are supposed to go that are posted up the chimney .  that   s just an old story .      she turned .  the rat and the raven were staring at her .  and she realized that she   d been too normal .   squeak .      the rat says     what d   you mean  just .        said the raven .      chickenwire sidled toward medium dave in the garden .  if you could call it a garden .  it was the land round the   house .  if you could call it a house .  no one said much about it  but every so often you just had to get out .  it didn   t feel right  inside .   he shivered .     where   s himself .     he said .      oh  up at the top     said medium dave .     still trying to open that room .         the one with all the locks .         yeah .      medium dave was rolling a cigarette .  inside the house   or tower  or both  or whatever   you couldn   t smoke  not properly .  when you smoked inside it tasted horrible and you felt sick .      what for .  we done what we came to do  didn   t we .  stood there like a bunch of kids and watched that wet wizard do all his chanting  it was all i could do to keep a straight face .  what   s he after now .         he just said if it was locked that bad he wanted to see inside .         i thought we were supposed to do what we came for and go .         yeah .  you tell him .  want a roll up .      chickenwire took the bag of tobacco and relaxed .     i   ve seen some bad places in my time  but this takes the serious biscuit .         yeah .         it   s the cute that wears you down .  and there   s got to be something else to eat than apples .         yeah .         and that damn sky .  that damn sky is really getting on my nerves .         yeah .      they kept their eyes averted from that damn sky .  for some reason  it made you feel that it was about to fall on you .  and it was worse if you let your eyes stray to the gap where a gap shouldn   t be .  the effect was like getting a toothache in your eyeballs .   in the distance banjo was swinging on a swing .  odd  that  dave thought .  banjo seemed perfectly happy here .      he found a tree that grows lollipops yesterday     he said moodily .     well  i say yesterday  but how can you tell .  and he follows the man around like a dog .  no one ever laid a punch on banjo since our mam died .  he   s just like a little boy  you know .  inside .  always has been .  looks to me for everything .  used to be  if i told him    punch someone     he   d do it .         and they stayed punched .         yeah .  now he follows him around everywhere .  it makes me sick .         what are you doing here  then .         ten thousand dollars .  and he says there   s more  you know .  more than we can imagine .      he was always teatime .      he ain   t just after money .         yeah  well  i didn   t sign up for world domination     said medium dave .     that sort of thing gets you into trouble .         i remember your mam saying that sort of thing     said chickenwire .  medium dave rolled his eyes .  everyone remembered ma lilywhite .     very straight lady was your ma .  tough but fair .         yeah   tough .         i recall that time she strangled glossy ron with his own leg     chickenwire went on .     she had a wicked right arm on her  your mam .         yeah .  wicked .         she wouldn   t have stood for someone like teatime .         yeah     said medium dave .      that was a lovely funeral you boys gave her .  most of the shades turned up .  very respectful .  all them flowers .  an    everyone looking so       chickenwire floundered       happy .  in a sad way  o    course .         yeah .         have you got any idea how to get back home .      medium dave shook his head .      me neither .  find the place again  i suppose .     chickenwire shivered .     i mean  what he did to that carter   i mean  well  i wouldn   t even act like that to me own dad           yeah .         ordinary mental  yes  i can deal with that .  but he can be talking quite normal  and then           yeah .         maybe the both of us could creep up on him and           yeah  yeah .  and how long   ll we live .  in seconds .         we could get lucky       chickenwire began .      yeah .  you   ve seen him .  this isn   t one of those blokes who threatens you .  this is one of those blokes who   d kill you soon as look at you .  easier  too .  we got to hang on  right .  it   s like that saying about riding a tiger .         what saying about riding a tiger .     said chickenwire suspiciously .      well       medium dave hesitated .     you   well  you get branches slapping you in the face  fleas  that sort of thing .  so you got to hang on .  think of the money .  there   s bags of it in there .  you saw it .         i keep thinking of that glass eye watching me .  i keep thinking it can see right in my head .         don   t worry  he doesn   t suspect you of anything .         how d   you know .         you   re still alive  yeah .         in the grotto of the hogfather  a round eyed child .   happy hogswatch .  ho .  ho .  ho .  and your name is   euphrasia goat  correct .      go on  dear  answer the nice man .            s .      and you are six years old .      go on  dear .  they   re all the same at this age  aren   t they              s .      and you want a pony           s .     a small hand pulled the hogfather   s hood down to mouth level .  heavy uncle albert heard a ferocious whispering .  then the hogfather leaned back .   yes  i know .  what a naughty pig it was  indeed .   his shape flickered for a moment  and then a hand went into the sack .   here is a bridle for your pony  and a saddle  and a rather strange hard hat and a pair of those trousers that make you look as though you have a large rabbit in each pocket .      but we can   t have a pony  can we  euffie  because we live on the third floor        oh  yes .  it   s in the kitchen .      i   m sure you   re making a little joke  hogfather     said mother  sharply .   ho .  ho .  yes .  what a jolly fat man i am .  in the kitchen .  what a joke .  dollies and so on will be delivered later as per your letter .      what do you say  euffie .            nk you .            ere  you didn   t really put a pony in their kitchen  did you .     said heavy uncle albert as the line moved on .   don   t be foolish  albert .  i said that to be jolly .      oh  right .  hah  for a minute        it   s in the bedroom .      ah        more hygienic .      well  it   ll make sure of one thing     said albert .     third floor .  they   re going to believe all right .      yes .  you know  i think i   m getting the hang of this .  ho .  ho .  ho .      at the hub of the discworld  the snow burned blue and green .  the aurora corealis hung in the sky  curtains of pale cold fire that circled the central mountains and cast their spectral light over the ice .   they billowed  swirled and then trailed a ragged arm on the end of which was a tiny dot that became  when the eye of imagination drew nearer  binky .   he trotted to a halt and stood on the air .  susan looked down .   and then found what she was looking for .  at the end of a valley of snow mounded trees something gleamed brightly  reflecting the sky .   the castle of bones .   her parents had sat her down one day when she was about six or seven and explained how such things as the hogfather did not really exist  how they were pleasant little stories that it was fun to know  how they were not real .  and she had believed it .  all the fairies and bogeymen  all those stories from the blood and bone of humanity  were not really real .   they   d lied .  a seven foot skeleton had turned out to be her grandfather .  not a flesh and blood grandfather  obviously .  but a grandfather  you could say  in the bone .   binky touched down and trotted over the snow .   was the hogfather a god .  why not .  thought susan .  there were sacrifices  after all .  all that sherry and pork pie .  and he made commandments and rewarded the good and he knew what you were doing .  if you believed  nice things happened to you .  sometimes you found him in a grotto  and sometimes he was up there in the sky     the castle of bones loomed over her now .  it certainly deserved the capital letters  up this close .   she   d seen a picture of it in one of the children   s books .  despite its name  the woodcut artist had endeavored to make it look   sort of jolly .   it wasn   t jolly .  the pillars at the entrance were hundreds of feet high .  each of the steps leading up was taller than a man .  they were the gray green of old ice .   ice .  not bone .  there were faintly familiar shapes to the pillars  possibly a suggestion of femur or skull  but it was made of ice .   binky was not challenged by the high stairs .  it wasn   t that he flew .  it was simply that he walked on a ground level of his own devising .   snow had blown over the ice .  susan looked down at the drifts .  death left no tracks  but there were the faint outlines of booted footprints .  she   d be prepared to bet they belonged to albert .  and   yes  half obscured by the snow   it looked as though a sleigh had stood here .  animals had milled around .  but the snow was covering everything .   she dismounted .  this was certainly the place described  but it still wasn   t right .  it was supposed to be a blaze of light and abuzz with activity  but it looked like a giant mausoleum .   a little way beyond the pillars was a very large slab of ice  cracked into pieces .  far above  stars were visible through the hole it had left in the roof .  even as she stared up  a few small lumps of ice thumped into a snowdrift .   the raven popped into existence and fluttered wearily onto a stump of ice beside her .      this place is a morgue     said susan .         s goin    to be mine  if i do   any more flyin    tonight     panted the raven  as the death of rats got off its back .     i never signed up for all this long distance  faster   n time stuff .  i should be back in a forest somewhere  making excitingly decorated constructions to attract females .         that   s bower birds     said susan .     ravens don   t do that .         oh  so it   s typecasting now  is it .     said the raven .     i   m missing meals here  you do know that .      it swiveled its independently sprung eyes .      so where   s all the lights .     it said .     where   s all the noise .  where   s all the jolly little buggers in pointy hats and red and green suits  hitting wooden toys unconvincingly yet rhythmically with hammers .         this is more like the temple of some old thunder god     said susan .   squeak .      no  i read the map right .  anyway  albert   s been here  too .  there   s cigarette ash all over the place .      the rat jumped down and walked around for a moment  bony snout near the ground .  after a few moments of snuffling it gave a squeak and hurried off into the gloom .   susan followed .  as her eyes grew more accustomed to the faint blue green light she made out something rising out of the floor .  it was a pyramid of steps  with a big chair on top .   behind her  a pillar groaned and twisted slightly .   squeak .      that rat says this place reminds him of some old mine     said the raven .     you know  after it   s been deserted and no one   s been paying attention to the roof supports and so on .  we see a lot of them .      at least these steps were human sized  susan thought  ignoring the chatter .  snow had come in through another gap in the roof .  albert   s footprints had stamped around quite a lot here .      maybe the old hogfather crashed his sleigh     the raven suggested .   squeak .      well  it could   ve happened .  pigs are not notably aerodynamic  are they .  and with all this snow  you know  poor visibility  big cloud ahead turns out too late to be a mountain  there   s buggers in saffron robes looking down at you  poor devil tries to remember whether you   re supposed to shove someone   s head between your legs  then wham  and it   s all over bar some lucky mountaineers making an awful lot of sausages and finding the flight recorder .      squeak .      yes  but he   s an old man .  probably shouldn   t be in the sky at his time of life .      susan pulled at something half buried in the snow .   it was a red and white striped candy cane .   she kicked the snow aside elsewhere and found a wooden toy soldier in the kind of uniform that would only be inconspicuous if you wore it in a nightclub for chameleons on hard drugs .  some further probing found a broken trumpet .   there was some more groaning in the darkness .   the raven cleared its throat .      what the rat meant about this place being like a mine     he said     was that abandoned mines tend to creak and groan in the same way  see .  no one looking after the pit props .  things fall in .  next thing you know you   re a squiggle in the sandstone .  we shouldn   t hang around is what i   m saying .      susan walked farther in  lost in thought .   this was all wrong .  the place looked as though it had been deserted for years  which couldn   t be true .   the column nearest her creaked and twisted slightly .  a fine haze of ice crystals dropped from the roof .   of course  this wasn   t exactly a normal place .  you couldn   t build an ice palace this big .  it was a bit like death   s house .  if he abandoned it for too long all those things that had been suspended  like time and physics  would roll over it .  it would be like a dam bursting .   she turned to leave and heard the groan again .  it wasn   t dissimilar to the tortured sounds being made by the ice  except that ice  afterward  didn   t moan .     oh  me        there was a figure lying in a snowdrift .  she   d almost missed it because it was wearing a long white robe .  it was spread eagled  as though it had planned to make snow angels and had then decided against it .   and it wore a little crown  apparently of vine leaves .   and it kept groaning .   she looked up .  the roof was open here  too .  but no one could have fallen that far and survived .   no one human  anyway .   he looked human and  in theory  quite young .  but it was only in theory because  even by the secondhand light of the glowing snow  his face looked like someone had been sick with it .      are you all right .     she ventured .   the recumbent figure opened its eyes and stared straight up .      i wish i was dead       it moaned .  a piece of ice the size of a house fell down in the far depths of the building and exploded in a shower of sharp little shards .      you may have come to the right place     said susan .  she grabbed the boy under his arms and hauled him out of the snow .     i think leaving would be a very good idea around now  don   t you .  this place is going to fall apart .         oh  me        she managed to get one of his arms around her neck .      can you walk .         oh  me           it might help if you stopped saying that and tried walking .         i   m sorry  but i seem to have   too many legs .  ow .      susan did her best to prop him up as  swaying and slipping  they made their way back to the exit .      my head     said the boy .     my head .  my head .  my head .  feels awful .  my head .  feels like someone   s hitting it .  my head .  with a hammer .      someone was .  there was a small green and purple imp sitting amid the damp curls and holding a very large mallet .  it gave susan a friendly nod and brought the hammer down again .      oh  me           that wasn   t necessary .     said susan .      you telling me my job .     said the imp .     i suppose you could do it better  could you .         i wouldn   t do it at all .         well  someone   s got to do it     said the imp .      he   s part .  of the .  arrangement     said the boy .      yeah  see .     said the imp .     can you hold the hammer while i go and coat his tongue with yellow gunk .         get down right now .      susan made a grab for the creature .  it leapt away  still clutching the hammer  and grabbed a pillar .      i   m part of the arrangement  i am .     it yelled .   the boy clutched his head .      i feel awful     he said .     have you got any ice .      whereupon  because there are conventions stronger than mere physics  the building fell in .      the collapse of the castle of bones was stately and impressive and seemed to go on for a long time .  pillars fell in  the slabs of the roof slid down  the ice crackled and splintered .  the air above the tumbling wreckage filled with a haze of snow and ice crystals .   susan watched from the trees .  the boy  who she   d leaned against a handy trunk  opened his eyes .      that was amazing     he managed .      why  you mean the way it   s all turning back into snow .         the way you just picked me up and ran .  ouch .         oh  that .      the grinding of the ice continued .  the fallen pillars didn   t stop moving when they collapsed  but went on tearing themselves apart .   when the fog of ice settled there was nothing but drifted snow .      as though it was never there     said susan  aloud .  she turned to the groaning figure .      all right  what were you doing there .         i don   t know .  i just opened my .  eyes and there i was .         who are you .         i   think my name is bilious .  i   m the   i   m the oh god of hangovers .         there   s a god of hangovers .         an oh god     he corrected .     when people witness me  you see  they clutch their head and say     oh god       how many of you are standing here .         what .  there   s just me .         ah .  fine .  fine .         i   ve never heard of a god of hangovers           you   ve heard of bibulous  the god of wine .  ouch .         oh  yes .         big fat man  wears vine leaves round his head  always pictured with a glass in his hand   ow .  well  you know why he   s so cheerful .  him and his big face .  it   s because he knows he   s going to feel good in the morning .  it   s because it   s me that              gets the hangovers .     said susan .      i don   t even drink .  ow .  but who is it who ends up head down in the privy every morning .  arrgh .     he stopped and clutched at his head .     should your skull feel like it   s lined with dog hair .         i don   t think so .         ah .     bilious swayed .     you know when people say    i had fifteen lagers last night and when i woke up my head was clear as a bell    .         oh  yes .         bastards .  that   s because i was the one who woke up groaning in a pile of recycled chili .  just once  i mean just once  i   d like to open my eyes in the morning without my head sticking to something .     he paused .     are there any giraffes in this wood .         up here .  i shouldn   t think so .      he looked nervously past susan   s head .      not even indigo colored ones which are sort of stretched and keep flashing on and off .         very unlikely .         thank goodness for that .     he swayed back and forth .     excuse me  i think i   m about to throw up my breakfast .         it   s the middle of the evening .         is it .  in that case  i think i   m about to throw up my dinner .      he folded up gently in the snow behind the tree .      he   s a long streak of widdle  isn   t he .     said a voice from a branch .  it was the raven .     got a neck with a knee in it .      the oh god reappeared after a noisy interlude .      i know i must eat     he mumbled .     it   s just that the only time i remember seeing my food it   s always going the other way           what were you doing in there .     said susan .      ouch .  search me     said the oh god .     it   s only a mercy i wasn   t holding a traffic sign and wearing a       he winced and paused       having some kind of women   s underwear about my person .     he sighed .     someone somewhere has a lot of fun     he said wistfully .     i wish it was me .         get a drink inside you  that   s my advice     said the raven .     have a hair of the dog that bit someone else .         but why there .     susan insisted .   the oh god stopped trying to glare at the raven .     i don   t know  where was there exactly .      susan looked back at where the castle had been .  it was entirely gone .      there was a very important building there a moment ago     she said .   the oh god nodded carefully .      i often see things that weren   t there a moment ago     he said .     and they often aren   t there a moment later .  which is a blessing in most cases  let me tell you .  so i don   t usually take a lot of notice .      he folded up and landed in the snow again .   there   s just snow now  susan thought .  nothing but snow and the wind .  there   s not even a ruin .   the certainty stole over her again that the hogfather   s castle wasn   t simply not there any more .  no   it had never been there .  there was no ruin  no trace .   it had been an odd enough place .  it was where the hogfather lived  according to the legends .  which was odd  when you thought about it .  it didn   t look like the kind of place a cheery old toy maker would live in .   the wind soughed in the trees behind them .  snow slid off branches .  somewhere in the dark there was a flurry of hooves .   a spidery little figure leapt off a snowdrift and landed on the oh god   s head .  it turned a beady eye up toward susan .      all right by you  is it .     said the imp  producing its huge hammer .     some of us have a job to do  you know  even if we are of a metaphorical  nay  folkloric persuasion .         oh  go away .         if you think i   m bad  wait until you see the little pink elephants     said the imp .      i don   t believe you .         they come out of his ears and fly around his head making tweeting noises .         ah     said the raven  sagely .     that sounds more like robins .  i wouldn   t put anything past them .      the oh god grunted .   susan suddenly felt that she didn   t want to leave him .  he was human .  well  human shaped .  well  at least he had two arms and legs .  he   d freeze to death here .  of course  gods  or even oh gods  probably couldn   t  but humans didn   t think like that .  you couldn   t just leave someone .  she prided herself on this bit of normal thinking .   besides  he might have some answers  if she could make him stay awake enough to understand the questions .   from the edge of the frozen forest  animal eyes watched them go .      mr .  crumley sat on the damp stairs and sobbed .  he couldn   t get any nearer to the toy department .  every time he tried he got lifted off his feet by the mob and dumped at the edge of the crowd by the current of people .   someone said     top of the evenin     squire     and he looked up blearily at the small yet irregularly formed figure that had addressed him thusly .      are you one of the pixies .     he said  after mentally exhausting all the other possibilities .      no  sir .  i am not in fact a pixie  sir  i am in fact corporal nobbs of the watch .  and this is constable visit  sir .     the creature looked at a piece of paper in its paw .     you mr .  crummy .         crumley .         yeah  right .  you sent a runner to the watch house and we have hereby responded with commendable speed  sir     said corporal nobbs .     despite it being hogswatchnight and there being a lot of strange things happening and most importantly it being the occasion of our hogswatchly piss up  sir .  but this is all right because washpot  that   s constable visit here  he doesn   t drink  sir  it being against his religion  and although i do drink  sir  i volunteered to come because it is my civic duty  sir .     nobby tore off a salute  or what he liked to believe was a salute .  he did not add     and turning out for a rich bugger such as your good self is bound to put the officer concerned in the way of a seasonal bottle or two or some other tangible evidence of gratitude     because his entire stance said it for him .  even nobby   s ears could look suggestive .   unfortunately  mr .  crumley wasn   t in the right receptive frame of mind .  he stood up and waved a shaking finger toward the top of the stairs .      i want you to go up there     he said     and arrest him .         arrest who  sir .     said corporal nobbs .      the hogfather .         what for  sir .         because he   s sitting up there as bold as brass in his grotto  giving away presents .      corporal nobbs thought about this .      you haven   t been having a festive drink  have you  sir .     he said hopefully .      i do not drink .         very wise  sir     said constable visit .     alcohol is the tarnish of the soul .  ossory  book two  verse twenty four .         not quite up to speed here  sir     said corporal nobbs  looking perplexed .     i thought the hogfather is s   posed to give away stuff  isn   t he .      this time mr .  crumley had to stop and think .  up until now he hadn   t quite sorted things out in his head  other than recognizing their essential wrongness .      this one is an impostor .     he declared .     yes  that   s right .  he smashed his way into here .         y   know  i always thought that     said nobby .     i thought  every year  the hogfather spends a fortnight sitting in a wooden grotto in a shop in ankh morpork .  at his busy time  too .  hah .  not likely .  probably just some old man in a beard  i thought .         i meant   he   s not the hogfather we usually have     said crumley  struggling for firmer ground .     he just barged in here .         oh  a different impostor .  not the real impostor at all .         well   yes   no           and started giving stuff away .     said corporal nobbs .      that   s what i said .  that   s got to be a crime  hasn   t it .      corporal nobbs rubbed his nose .      well  nearly     he conceded  not wishing to totally relinquish the chance of any festive remuneration .  realization dawned .     he   s giving away your stuff  sir .         no .  no  he brought it in with him .         ah .  giving away your stuff  now  if he was doing that  yes  i could see the problem .  that   s a sure sign of crime  stuff going missing .  stuff turning up  weerlll  that   s a tricky one .  unless it   s stuff like arms and legs  o    course .  we   d be on safer ground if he was nicking stuff  sir  to tell you the truth .         this is a shop     said mr .  crumley  finally getting to the root of the problem .     we do not give merchandise away .  how can we expect people to buy things if some person is giving them away .  now please go and get him out of here .         arrest the hogfather  style of thing .         yes .         on hogswatchnight .         yes .         in your shop .         yes .         in front of all those kiddies .         y       mr .  crumley hesitated .  to his horror  he realized that corporal nobbs  against all expectation  had a point .     you think that will look bad .     he said .      hard to see how it could look good  sir .         could you not do it surreptitiously .     he said .      ah  well  surreptition  yes  we could give that a try     said corporal nobbs .  the sentence hung in the air with its hand out .      you won   t find me ungrateful     said mr .  crumley  at last .      just you leave it to us     said corporal nobbs  magnanimous in victory .     you just nip down to your office and treat yourself to a nice cup of tea and we   ll sort this out in no time .  you   ll be ever so grateful .      crumley gave him a look of a man in the grip of serious doubt  but staggered away nonetheless .  corporal nobbs rubbed his hands together .      you don   t have hogswatch back where you come from  do you  washpot .     he said  as they climbed the stairs to the first floor .     look at this carpet  you   d think a pig   d pissed on it           we call it the fast of st .  ossory     said visit  who was from omnia .     but it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism .  we simply get together in family groups for a prayer meeting and a fast .         what  turkey and chicken and that .         a fast  corporal nobbs .  we don   t eat anything .         oh  right .  well  each to his own  i s   pose .  and at least you don   t have to get up early in the morning and find that the nothing you   ve got is too big to fit in the oven .  no presents neither .      they stood aside hurriedly as two children scuttled down the stairs carrying a large toy boat between them .      it is sometimes appropriate to exchange new religious pamphlets  and of course there are usually copies of the book of ossory for the children     said constable visit .     sometimes with illustrations     he added  in the guarded way of a man hinting at licentious pleasures .   a small girl went past carrying a teddy bear larger than herself .  it was pink .      they always gives me bath salts     complained nobby .     and bath soap and bubble bath and herbal bath lumps and tons of bath stuff and i can   t think why     cos it   s not as if i hardly ever has a bath .  you   d think they   d take the hint  wouldn   t you .         abominable  i call it     said constable visit .   the first floor was a mob .      huh  look at them .  mr .  hogfather never brought me anything when i was a kid     said corporal nobbs  eyeing the children gloomily .     i used to hang up my stocking every hogswatch  regular .  all that ever happened was my dad was sick in it once .     he removed his helmet .   nobby was not by any measure a hero  but there was the sudden gleam in his eye of someone who   d seen altogether too many empty stockings plus one rather full and dripping one .  a scab had been knocked off some wound in the corrugated little organ of his soul .      i   m going in     he said .      in between the university   s great hall and its main door is a rather smaller circular hall or vestibule known as archchancellor bowell   s remembrance  although no one now knows why  or why an extant bequest pays for one small currant bun and one copper penny to be placed on a high stone shelf on one wall every second wednesday .   ridcully stood in the middle of the floor  looking upward .      tell me  senior wrangler  we never invited any women to the hogswatchnight feast  did we .         of course not  archchancellor     said the senior wrangler .  he looked up in the dust covered rafters  wondering what had caught ridcully   s eye .     good heavens  no .  they   d spoil everything .  i   ve always said so .         and all the maids have got the evening off until midnight .         a very generous custom  i   ve always said     said the senior wrangler  feeling his neck crick .      so why  every year  do we hang a damn great bunch of mistletoe up there .      the senior wrangler turned in a circle  still staring upward .      well  er   it   s   well  it   s   it   s symbolic  archchancellor .         ah .      the senior wrangler felt that something more was expected .  he groped around in the dusty attics of his education .      of   the leaves  d   y   see   they   re symbolic of   of green  d   y   see  whereas the berries  in fact  yes  the berries symbolize   symbolize white .  yes .  white and green .  very   symbolic .      he waited .  he was not  unfortunately  disappointed .      what of .      the senior wrangler coughed .      i   m not sure there has to be an of     he said .      ah .  so     said the archchancellor  thoughtfully     it could be said that the white and green symbolize a small parasitic plant .         yes  indeed     said the senior wrangler .      so mistletoe  in fact  symbolizes mistletoe .         exactly  archchancellor     said the senior wrangler  who was now just hanging on .      funny thing  that     said ridcully  in the same thoughtful tone of voice .     that statement is either so deep it would take a lifetime to fully comprehend every particle of its meaning  or it is a load of absolute tosh .  which is it  i wonder .         it could be both     said the senior wrangler desperately .      and that comment     said ridcully     is either very perceptive  or very trite .         it might be bo           don   t push it  senior wrangler .      there was a hammering on the outer door .      ah  that   ll be the wassailers     said the senior wrangler  happy for the distraction .     they call on us first every year .  i personally have always liked    the lilywhite boys     you know .      the archchancellor glanced up at the mistletoe  gave the beaming man a sharp look  and opened the little hatch in the door .      well  now  wassailing you fellows       he began .     oh .  well  i must say you might   ve picked a better time        a hooded figure stepped through the wood of the door  carrying a limp bundle over its shoulder .   the senior wrangler stepped backward quickly .      oh   no  not tonight        and then he noticed that what he had taken for a robe had lace around the bottom  and the hood  while quite definitely a hood  was nevertheless rather more stylish than the one he had first mistaken it for .      putting down or taking away .     said ridcully .   susan pushed back her hood .      i need your help  mr .  ridcully     she said .      you   re   aren   t you death   s granddaughter .     said ridcully .     didn   t i meet you a few           yes     sighed susan .      and   are you helping out .     said ridcully .  his waggling eyebrows indicated the slumbering figure over her shoulder .      i need you to wake him up     said susan .      some sort of miracle  you mean .     said the senior wrangler  who was a little behind .      he   s not dead     said susan .     he   s just resting .         that   s what they all say     the senior wrangler quavered .   ridcully  who was somewhat more practical  lifted the oh god   s head .  there was a groan .      looks a bit under the weather     he said .      he   s the god of hangovers     said susan .     the oh god of hangovers .         really .     said ridcully .     never had one of those myself .  funny thing  i can drink all night and feel as fresh as a daisy in the morning .      the oh god   s eyes opened .  then he soared toward ridcully and started beating him on the chest with both fists .      you utter  utter bastard .  i hate you hate you hate you hate you        his eyes shut  and he slid down to the floor .      what was all that about .     said ridcully .      i think it was some kind of nervous reaction     said susan diplomatically .     something nasty   s happening tonight .  i   m hoping he can tell me what it is .  but he   s got to be able to think straight first .         and you brought him here .     said ridcully .      ho .  ho .  ho .  yes indeed  hello  small child called verruca lumpy  what a lovely name  aged seven  i believe .  good .  yes  i know it did .  all over the nice clean floor  yes .  they do  you know .  that   s one of the things about real pigs .  here we are  don   t mention it .  happy hogswatch and be good .  i will know if you   re good or bad  you know .  ho .  ho .  ho .      well  you brought some magic into that little life     said albert  as the next child was hurried away .   it   s the expression on their little faces i like  said the hogfather .      you mean sort of fear and awe and not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants .      yes .  now that is what i call belief .      the oh god was carried into the great hall and laid out on a bench .  the senior wizards gathered round  ready to help those less fortunate than themselves remain that way .      i know what   s good for a hangover     said the dean  who was feeling in a party mood .   they looked at him expectantly .      drinking heavily the previous night .     he said .   he beamed at them .      that was a good word joke     he said  to break the silence .   the silence came back .      most amusing     said ridcully .  he turned back and stared thoughtfully at the oh god .      raw eggs are said to be good       he glared at the dean       i mean bad for a hangover     he said .     and fresh orange juice .         klatchian coffee     said the lecturer in recent runes  firmly .      but this fellow hasn   t just got his hangover  he   s got everyone   s hangover     said ridcully .      i   ve tried it     mumbled the oh god .     it just makes me feel suicidal and sick .         a mixture of mustard and horseradish .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     in cream  for preference .  with anchovies .         yogurt     said the bursar .   ridcully looked at him  surprised .      that sounded almost relevant     he said .     well done .  i should leave it at that if i were you  bursar .  hmm .  of course  my uncle always used to swear at wow wow sauce     he added .      you mean swear by  surely .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      possibly both     said ridcully .     i know he once drank a whole bottle of it as a hangover cure and it certainly seemed to cure him .  he looked very peaceful when they came to lay him out .         willow bark     said the bursar .      that   s a good idea     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s an analgesic .         really .  well  possibly  though it   s probably better to give it to him by mouth     said ridcully .     i say  are you feeling yourself  bursar .  you seem somewhat coherent .      the oh god opened his crusted eyes .      will all that stuff help .     he mumbled .      it   ll probably kill you     said susan .      oh .  good .         we could add englebert   s enhancer     said the dean .     remember when modo put some on his peas .  we could only manage one each .         can   t you do something more  well  magical .     said susan .     magic the alcohol out of him or something .         yes  but it   s not alcohol by this time  is it .     said ridcully .     it   ll have turned into a lot of nasty little poisons all dancin    round on his liver .         spold   s unstirring divisor would do it     said the lecturer in recent runes .     very simply  too .  you   d end up with a large beaker full of all the nastiness .  not difficult at all  if you don   t mind the side effects .         tell me about the side effects     said susan  who had met wizards before .      the main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker     said the lecturer in recent runes .      alive .      the lecturer in recent runes screwed up his face and waggled his hands .     broadly  yes     he said .     living tissue  certainly .  and definitely sober .         i think we had in mind something that would leave him the same shape and still breathing     said susan .      well  you might   ve said        then the dean repeated the mantra that has had such a marked effect on the progress of knowledge throughout the ages .      why don   t we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens .     he said .   and ridcully responded with the traditional response .      it   s got to be worth a try     he said .      the big glass beaker for the cure had been placed on a pedestal in the middle of the floor .  the wizards liked to make a ceremony of everything in any case  but felt instinctively that if they were going to cure the biggest hangover in the world it needed to be done with style .   susan and bilious watched as the ingredients were added .  round about halfway the mixture  which was an orange brown color  went gloop .      not a lot of improvement  i feel     said the lecturer in recent runes .   englebert   s enhancer was the penultimate ingredient .  the dean dropped in a greenish ball of light that sank under the surface .  the only apparent effect was that it caused purple bubbles to creep over the sides of the beaker and drip onto the floor .      that   s it .     said the oh god .      i think the yogurt probably wasn   t a good idea     said the dean .      i   m not drinking that     said bilious firmly  and then clutched at his head .      but gods are practically unkillable  aren   t they .     said the dean .      oh  good     muttered bilious .     why not stick my legs in a meat grinder  then .         well  if you think it might help           i anticipated a certain amount of resistance from the patient     said the archchancellor .  he removed his hat and fished out a small crystal ball from a pocket in the lining .     let   s see what the god of wine is up to at the moment  shall we .  shouldn   t be too difficult to locate a fun loving god like him on an evening like this        he blew on the glass and polished it .  then he brightened up .      why  here he is  the little rascal .  on dunmanifestin  i do believe .  yes   yes   reclining on his couch  surrounded by naked maenads .         what .  maniacs .     said the dean .      he means   excitable young women     said susan .  and it seemed to her that there was a general ripple of movement among the wizards  a sort of nonchalant drawing toward the glittering ball .      can   t quite see what he   s doing       said ridcully .      let me see if i can make it out     said the chair of indefinite studies hopefully .  ridcully half turned to keep the ball out of his reach .      ah  yes     he said .     it looks like he   s drinking   yes  could very well be lager and black currant  if i   m any judge           oh  me       moaned the oh god .      these young women  now       the lecturer in recent runes began .      i can see there   s some bottles on the table     ridcully continued .     that one  hmm  yes  could be scumble which  as you know  is made from apples           mainly apples     the dean volunteered .     now  about these poor mad girls        the oh god slumped to his knees .         and there   s   that drink  you know  there   s a worm in the bottle           oh  me              and   there   s an empty glass  a big one  can   t quite see what it contained  but there   s a paper umbrella in it .  and some cherries on a stick .  oh  and an amusing little monkey .            ooohhh              of course  there   s a lot of other bottles  too     said ridcully  cheerfully .     different colored drinks  mainly .  the sort made from melons and coconuts and chocolate and such like  don   tcherknow .  funny thing is  all the glasses on the table are pint mugs        bilious fell forward .      all right     he murmured .     i   ll drink the wretched stuff .         it   s not quite ready yet     said ridcully .     ah  thank you  modo .      modo tiptoed in  pushing a trolley .  there was a large metal bowl on it  in which a small bottle stood in the middle of a heap of crushed ice .      only just made this for hogswatch dinner     said ridcully .     hasn   t had much time to mature yet .      he put down the crystal and fished a pair of heavy gloves out of his hat .   the wizards spread like an opening flower .  one moment they were gathered around ridcully  the next they were standing close to various items of heavy furniture .   susan felt she was present at a ceremony and hadn   t been told the rules .      what   s that .     she said  as ridcully carefully lifted up the bottle .      wow wow sauce     said ridcully .     finest condiment known to man .  a happy accompaniment to meat  fish  fowl  eggs and many types of vegetable dishes .  it   s not safe to drink it when sweat   s still condensing on the bottle  though .     he peered at the bottle  and then rubbed at it  causing a glassy  squeaky noise .     on the other hand     he said brightly     if it   s a kill or cure remedy then we are  given that the patient is practically immortal  probably onto a winner .      he placed a thumb over the cork and shook the bottle vigorously .  there was a crash as the chair of indefinite studies and the senior wrangler tried to get under the same table .      and these fellows seem to have taken against it for some reason     he said  approaching the beaker .      i prefer a sauce that doesn   t mean you mustn   t make any jolting movements for half an hour after using it     muttered the dean .      and that can   t be used for breaking up small rocks     said the senior wrangler .      or getting rid of tree roots     said the chair of indefinite studies .      and which isn   t actually outlawed in three cities     said the lecturer in recent runes .   ridcully cautiously uncorked the bottle .  there was a brief hiss of indrawn air .   he allowed a few drops to splash into the beaker .  nothing happened .   a more generous helping was allowed to fall .  the mixture remained irredeemably inert .   ridcully sniffed suspiciously at the bottle .      i wonder if i added enough grated wahooni .     he said  and then upturned the sauce and let most of it slide into the mixture .   it merely went gloop .   the wizards began to stand up and brush themselves off  giving one another the rather embarrassed grins of people who know that they   ve just been part of a synchronized making a fool of yourself team .      i know we   ve had that asafoetida rather a long time     said ridcully .  he turned the bottle round  peering at it sadly .   finally he tipped it up for the last time and thumped it hard on the base .   a trickle of sauce arrived on the lip of the bottle and glistened there for a moment .  then it began to form a bead .   as if drawn by invisible strings  the heads of the wizards turned to look at it .   wizards wouldn   t be wizards if they couldn   t see a little way into the future .   as the bead swelled and started to go pear shaped they turned and  with a surprising turn of speed for men so wealthy in years and waistline  began to dive for the floor .   the drop fell .   it went gloop .   and that was all .   ridcully  who   d been standing like a statue  sagged in relief .      i don   t know     he said  turning away     i wish you fellows would show some backbone        the fireball lifted him off his feet .  then it rose to the ceiling  where it spread out widely and vanished with a pop  leaving a perfect chrysanthemum of scorched plaster .   pure white light filled the room .  and there was a sound .   tinkle .  tinkle .   fizz .   the wizards risked looking around .   the beaker gleamed .  it was filled with a liquid glow  which bubbled gently and sent out sparkles like a spinning diamond .      my word       breathed the lecturer in recent runes .   ridcully picked himself up off the floor .  wizards tended to roll well  or in any case are well padded enough to bounce .   slowly  the flickering brilliance casting their long shadows on the walls  the wizards gravitated toward the beaker .      well  what is it .     said the dean .      i remember my father tellin    me some very valuable advice about drinks     said ridcully .     he said     son  never drink any drink with a paper umbrella in it  never drink any drink with a humorous name  and never drink any drink that changes color when the last ingredient goes in .  and never  ever  do this           he dipped his finger into the beaker .   it came out with one glistening drop on the end .      careful  archchancellor     warned the dean .     what you have there might represent pure sobriety .      ridcully paused with the finger halfway to his lips .      good point     he said .     i don   t want to start being sober at my time of life .     he looked around .     how do we usually test stuff .         generally we ask for student volunteers     said the dean .      what happens if we don   t get any .         we give it to them anyway .         isn   t that a bit unethical .         not if we don   t tell them  archchancellor .         ah  good point .         i   ll try it     the oh god mumbled .      something these clo   gentlemen have cooked up .     said susan .     it might kill you .         you   ve never had a hangover  i expect     said the oh god .     otherwise you wouldn   t talk such rot .      he staggered up to the beaker  managed to grip it on the second go  and drank the lot .      there   ll be fireworks now     said the raven  from susan   s shoulder .     flames coming out of the mouth  screams  clutching at the throat  lying down under the cold tap  that sort of thing           death found  to his amazement  that dealing with the queue was very enjoyable .  hardly anyone had ever been pleased to see him before .   next .  and what   s your name  little   he hesitated  but rallied  and continued   person .      nobby nobbs  hogfather     said nobby .  was it him  or was this knee he was sitting on a lot bonier than it should be .  his buttocks argued with his brain  and were sat on .   and have you been a good bo   a good dwa   a good gno   a good individual .   and suddenly nobby found he had no control at all of his tongue .  of its own accord  gripped by a terrible compulsion  it said         s .      he struggled for self possession as the great voice went on  so i expect you   ll want a present for a good mon   a good hum   a good male .   aha  got you bang to rights  you   ll be coming along with me  my old chummy  i bet you don   t remember the cellar at the back of the shoelace maker   s in old cobblers  eh  all those hogswatch mornings with a little hole in my world  eh .   the words rose in nobby   s throat but were overridden by something ancient before they reached his voice box  and to his amazement were translated into         s .      something nice .         s .      there was hardly anything left of nobby   s conscious will now .  the world consisted of nothing but his naked soul and the hogfather  who filled the universe .   and you will of course be good for another year .   the tiny remnant of basic nobbyness wanted to say     er  how exactly do you define    good     mister .  like  suppose there was just some stuff that no one   d miss  say .  or  f   r instance  say a friend of mine was on patrol  sort of thing  and found a shopkeeper had left his door unlocked at night .  i mean  anyone could walk in  right  but suppose this friend took one or two things  sort of like  you know  a gratuity  and then called the shopkeeper out and got him to lock up  that counts as    good     does it .      good and bad were  to nobby   s way of thinking  entirely relative terms .  most of his relatives  for example  were criminals .  but  again  this invitation to philosophical debate was ambushed somewhere in his head by sheer dread of the big beard in the sky .         s     he squeaked .   now  i wonder what you would like .   nobby gave up  and sat mute .  whatever was going to happen next was going to happen  and there was not a thing he could do about it   right now  the light at the end of his mental tunnel showed only more tunnel .   ah  yes     the hogfather reached into his sack and pulled out an awkwardly shaped present wrapped in festive hogswatch paper which  owing to some slight confusion on the current hogfather   s part  had merry ravens on it .  corporal nobbs took it in nervous hands .   what do you say .         nk you .      off you go .   corporal nobbs slid down gratefully and barged his way through the crowds  stopping only when he was fielded by constable visit .      what happened .  what happened .  i couldn   t see .         i dunno     mumbled nobby .     he gave me this .         what is it .         i dunno        he clawed at the raven bedecked paper .      this is disgusting  this whole business     said constable visit .     it   s the worship of idols           it   s a genuine burleigh and stronginthearm double action triple cantilever crossbow with a polished walnut stock and engraved silver facings .            a crass commercialization of a date which is purely of astronomical significance     said visit  who seldom paid attention when he was in mid denounce .     if it is to be celebrated at all  then           i saw this in bows and ammo .  it got editor   s choice in the    what to buy when rich uncle sidney dies    category .  they had to break both the reviewer   s arms to get him to let go of it .            ought to be commemorated in a small service of           it must cost more   n a year   s salary .  they only make    em to order .  you have to wait ages .            religious significance .     it dawned on constable visit that something behind him was amiss .      aren   t we going to arrest this impostor  corporal .     he said .   corporal nobbs looked blearily at him through the mists of possessive pride .      you   re foreign  washpot     he said .     i can   t expect you to know the real meaning of hogswatch .         the oh god blinked .      ah     he said .     that   s better .  oh  yes .  that   s a lot better .  thank you .      the wizards  who shared the raven   s belief in the essential narrative conventions of life  watched him cautiously .      any minute now     said the lecturer in recent runes confidently     it   ll probably start with some kind of amusing yell           you know     said the oh god     i think i could just possibly eat a soft boiled egg .            or maybe the ears spinning round           and perhaps drink a glass of milk     said the oh god .   ridcully looked nonplussed .      you really feel better .     he said .      oh  yes     said the oh god .     i really think i could risk a smile without the top of my head falling off .         no  no  no     said the dean .     this can   t be right .  everyone knows that a good hangover cure has got to involve a lot of humorous shouting  ekcetra .         i could possibly tell you a joke     said the oh god carefully .      you don   t have this pressing urge to run outside and stick your head in a water butt .     said ridcully .      er   not really     said the oh god .     but i   d like some toast  if that helps .      the dean took off his hat and pulled a thaumameter out of the point .     something happened     he said .     there was a massive thaumic surge .         didn   t it even taste a bit   well  spicy .     said ridcully .      it didn   t taste of anything  really     said the oh god .      oh  look  it   s obvious     said susan .     when the god of wine drinks  bilious here gets the aftereffects  so when the god of hangovers drinks a hangover cure then the effects must jump back across the same link .         that could be right     said the dean .     he is  after all  basically a conduit .         i   ve always thought of myself as more of a tube     said the oh god .      no  no  she   s right     said ridcully .     when he drinks  this lad here gets the nasty result .  so  logically  when our friend here takes a hangover cure the side effects should head back the same way           someone mentioned a crystal ball just now     said the oh god in a voice suddenly clanging with vengeance .     i want to see this           it was a big drink .  a very big and a very long drink .  it was one of those special cocktails where each very sticky  very strong ingredient is poured in very slowly  so that they layer on top of one another .  drinks like this tend to get called traffic lights or rainbow   s revenge or  in places where truth is more highly valued  hello and good bye  mr .  brain cell .   in addition  this drink had some lettuce floating in it .  and a slice of lemon and a piece of pineapple hooked coquettishly on the side of the glass  which had sugar frosted round the rim .  there were two paper umbrellas  one pink and one blue  and they each had a cherry on the end .   and someone had taken the trouble to freeze ice cubes in the shape of little elephants .  after that  there   s no hope .  you might as well be drinking in a place called the cococobana .   the god of wine picked it up lovingly .  it was his kind of drink .   there was a rumba going on in the background .  there were also a couple of young ladies snuggling up to him .  it was going to be a good night .  it was always a good night .      happy hogswatch  everyone .     he said  and raised the glass .   and then     can anyone hear something .      someone blew a paper squeaker at him .      no  seriously   like a sort of descending note    .      since no one paid this any attention he shrugged  and nudged one of his fellow drinkers .      how about we have a couple more and go to this club i know .     he said .   and then        the wizards leaned back  and one or two of them grimaced .   only the oh god stayed glued to the glass  face contorted in a vicious smile .      we have eructation .     he shouted  and punched the air .     yes .  yes .  yes .  the worm is on the other boot now  eh .  hah .  how do you like them apples  huh .         well  mainly apples       said the dean .      looked like a lot of other things to me     said ridcully .     it seems we have reversed the cause effect flow           will it be permanent .     said the oh god hopefully .      i shouldn   t think so .  after all  you are the god of hangovers .  it   ll probably just reverse itself again when the potion wears off .         then i may not have much time .  bring me   let   s see   twenty pints of lager  some pepper vodka and a bottle of coffee liqueur .  with an umbrella in it .  let   s see how he enjoys that  mr .  you   ve got room for another one in there .      susan grabbed his hand and pulled him over to a bench .      i didn   t have you sobered up just so you could go on a binge .     she said .   he blinked at her .     you didn   t .         i want you to help me .         help you what .         you said you   d never been human before  didn   t you .         er       the oh god looked down at himself .     that   s right     he said .     never .         you   ve never incarnated .     said ridcully .      surely that   s a rather personal question  isn   t it .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      that   s   right     said the oh god .     odd  that .  i remember always having headaches   but never having a head .  that can   t be right  can it .         you existed in potentia .     said ridcully .      did i .         did he .     said susan .   ridcully paused .     oh dear     he said .     i think i did it  didn   t i .  i said something to young stibbons about drinking and hangovers  didn   t i    .         and you created him just like that .     said the dean .     i find that very hard to believe  mustrum .  hah .  out of thin air .  i suppose we can all do that  can we .  anyone care to think up some new pixie .         like the hair loss fairy .     said the lecturer in recent runes .  the other wizards laughed .      i am not losing my hair .     snapped the dean .     it is just very finely spaced .         half on your head and half on your hairbrush     said the lecturer in recent runes .      no sense in bein    bashful about goin    bald     said ridcully evenly .     anyway  you know what they say about bald men  dean .         yes  they say     look at him  he   s got no hair        said the lecturer in recent runes .  the dean had been annoying him lately .      for the last time     shouted the dean     i am not        he stopped .   there was a glingleglingleglingle noise .      i wish i knew where that was coming from     said ridcully .      er       the dean began .     is there   something on my head .      the other wizards stared .   something was moving under his hat .   very carefully  he reached up and removed it .   the very small gnome sitting on his head had a clump of the dean   s hair in each hand .  it blinked guiltily in the light .      is there a problem .     it said .      get it off me .     the dean yelled .   the wizards hesitated .  they were all vaguely aware of the theory that very small creatures could pass on diseases  and while the gnome was larger than such creatures were generally thought to be  no one wanted to catch expanding scalp sickness .   susan grabbed it .      are you the hair loss fairy .     she said .      apparently     said the gnome  wriggling in her grip .   the dean ran his hands desperately through his hair .      what have you been doing with my hair .     he demanded .      well  some of it i think i have to put on hairbrushes     said the gnome     but sometimes i think i weave it into little mats to block up the bath with .         what do you mean  you think .     said ridcully .      just a minute     said susan .  she turned to the oh god .     where exactly were you before i found you in the snow .         er   sort of   everywhere  i think     said the oh god .     anywhere where drink had been consumed in beastly quantities some time previously  you could say .         ah ha     said ridcully .     you were an immanent vital force  yes .         i suppose i could have been     the oh god conceded .      and when we joked about the hair loss fairy it suddenly focused on the dean   s head     said ridcully     where its operations have been noticeable to all of us in recent months although of course we have been far too polite to pass comment on the subject .         you   re calling things into being     said susan .      things like the give the dean a huge bag of money goblin .     said the dean  who could think very quickly at times .  he looked around hopefully .     anyone hear any fairy tinkling .         do you often get given huge bags of money  sir .     said susan .      not on what you   d call a daily basis  no     said the dean .     but if           then there probably isn   t any occult room for a huge bags of money goblin     said susan .      i personally have always wondered what happens to my socks     said the bursar cheerfully .     you know how there   s always one missing .  when i was a lad i always thought that something was taking them        the wizards gave this some thought .  then they all heard it   the little crinkly tinkling noise of magic taking place .   the archchancellor pointed dramatically skyward .      to the laundry .     he said .      it   s downstairs  ridcully     said the dean .      down to the laundry .         and you know mrs .  whitlow doesn   t like us going in there     said the chair of indefinite studies .      and who is archchancellor of this university  may i ask .     said ridcully .     is it mrs .  whitlow .  i don   t think so .  is it me .  why  how amazing  i do believe it is .         yes  but you know what she can be like     said the chair .      er  yes  that   s true       ridcully began .      i believe she   s gone to her sister   s for the holiday     said the bursar .      we certainly don   t have to take orders from any kind of housekeeper .     said the archchancellor .     to the laundry .      the wizards surged out excitedly  leaving susan  the oh god  the verruca gnome and the hair loss fairy .      tell me again who those people were     said the oh god .      some of the cleverest men in the world     said susan .      and i   m sober  am i .         clever isn   t the same as sensible     said susan     and they do say that if you wish to walk the path to wisdom then for your first step you must become as a small child .         do you think they   ve heard about the second step .      susan sighed .     probably not  but sometimes they fall over it while they   re running around shouting .         ah .     the oh god looked around .     do you think they have any soft drinks here .     he said .      the path to wisdom does  in fact  begin with a single step .   where people go wrong is in ignoring all the thousands of other steps that come after it .  they make the single step of deciding to become one with the universe  and for some reason forget to take the logical next step of living for seventy years on a mountain and a daily bowl of rice and yak butter tea that would give it any kind of meaning .  while evidence says that the road to hell is paved with good intentions  they   re probably all on first steps .   the dean was always at his best at times like this .  he led the way between the huge  ancient copper vats  prodding with his staff into dark corners and going    hut .  hut .     under his breath .      why would it turn up here .     whispered the lecturer in recent runes .      point of reality instability     said ridcully  standing on tiptoe to look into a bleaching cauldron .     every damn thing turns up here .  you should know that by now .         but why now .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      no talking .     hissed the dean  and leapt out into the next alleyway  staff held protectively in front of him .      hah .     he screamed  and then looked disappointed .      er  how big would this sock stealing thing be .     said the senior wrangler .      don   t know     said ridcully .  he peered behind a stack of washboards .     come to think of it  i must   ve lost a ton of socks over the years .         me too     said the lecturer in recent runes .      so   should we be looking in small places or very large places .     the senior wrangler went on  in the voice of one whose train of thought has just entered a long dark tunnel .      good point     said ridcully .     dean  why do you keep referring to sheds all the time .         it   s    hut     mustrum     said the dean .     it means   it means           small wooden building .     ridcully suggested .      well  sometimes  agreed  but other times   well  you just have to say    hut .            this sock creature   does it just steal them  or does it eat them .     said the senior wrangler .      valuable contribution  that man     said ridcully  giving up on the dean .     right  pass the word along  no one is to look like a sock  understand .         how can you       the dean began  and stopped .   they all heard it .      grnf  grnf  grnf     it was a busy sound  the sound of something with a serious appetite to satisfy .      the eater of socks     moaned the senior wrangler  with his eyes shut .      how many tentacles would you expect it to have .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     i mean  roughly speaking .         it   s a very large sort of noise  isn   t it .     said the bursar .      to the nearest dozen  say     said the lecturer in recent runes  edging backward .      grnf  grnf  grnf        it   d probably tear our socks off as soon as look at us       wailed the senior wrangler .      ah .  so at least five or six tentacles  then  would you say .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      seems to me it   s coming from one of the washing engines     said the dean .   the engines were each two stories high  and usually only used when the university   s population soared during term time .  a huge treadmill connected to a couple of big bleached wooden paddles in each vat  which were heated via the fireboxes underneath .  in full production the washing engines needed at least half a dozen people to manhandle the loads  maintain the fires and oil the scrubbing arms .  ridcully had seen them at work once  when it had looked like a picture of a very clean and hygienic hell  the kind of place soap might go to when it died .   the dean stopped by the door to the boiler area .      something   s in here     he whispered .     listen .         grnf        it   s stopped .  it knows we   re here .     he hissed .     all right .  ready .  hut .         no .     squeaked the lecturer in recent runes .      i   ll open the door and you be ready to stop it .  one   two   three .  oh            the sleigh soared into the snowy sky .   on the whole  i think that went very well  don   t you .      yes  master     said albert .   i was rather puzzled by the little boy in the chain mail  though .      i think that was a watchman  master .      really .  well  he went away happy  and that   s the main thing .      is it  master .     there was worry in albert   s voice .  death   s osmotic nature tended to pick up new ideas altogether too quickly .  of course  albert understood why they had to do all this  but the master   well  sometimes the master lacked the necessary mental equipment to work out what should be true and what shouldn   t     and i think i   ve got the laugh working really well now .  ho .  ho .  ho .      yeah  sir  very jolly     said albert .  he looked down at the list .     still  work goes on  eh .  the next one   s pretty close  master  so i should keep them down low if i was you .      jolly good .  ho .  ho .  ho .      sarah the little match girl  doorway of thimble   s pipe and tobacco shop  money trap lane  it says here .      and what does she want for hogswatch .  ho .  ho .  ho .      dunno .  never sent a letter .  by the way  just a tip  you don   t have to say    ho  ho  ho    all the time  master .  let   s see   it says here       albert   s lips moved as he read .   i expect a doll is always acceptable .  or a soft toy of some description .  the sack seems to know .  what   ve we got for her  albert .  ho .  ho .  ho .   something small was dropped into his hand .      this     said albert .   oh .   there was a moment of horrible silence as they both stared at the lifetimer .      you   re for life  not just for hogswatch     prompted albert .     life goes on  master .  in a manner of speaking .      but this is hogswatchnight .      very traditional time for this sort of thing  i understand     said albert .   i thought it was the season to be jolly  said death .      ah  well  yes  you see  one of the things that makes folks even more jolly is knowing there   re people who ain   t     said albert  in a matter of fact voice .     that   s how it goes  master .  master .      no .  death stood up .  this is how it shouldn   t go .      the university   s great hall had been set for the hogswatchnight feast .  the tables were already groaning under the weight of the cutlery  and it would be hours before any real food was put on them .  it was hard to see where there would be space for any among the drifts of ornamental fruit bowls and forests of wine glasses .   the oh god picked up a menu and turned to the fourth page .      course four  mollusks and crustaceans .  a medley of lobster  crab  king crab  prawn  shrimp  oyster  clam  giant mussel  green lipped mussel  thin lipped mussel and fighting tiger limpet .  with a herb and butter dipping sauce .  wine     three wizards    chardonnay  year of the talking frog .  beer  winkles    old peculiar .     he put it down .     that   s one course .     he said .      they   re big men in the food department     said susan .   he turned the menu over .  on the cover was the university   s coat of arms and  over it  three large letters in ancient script    .      .      is this some sort of magic word .         no .     susan sighed .     they put it on all their menus .  you might call it the unofficial motto of the university .         what   s it mean .         eta beta pi .      bilious gave her an expectant look .      yes    .         er   like  eat a better pie .     said susan .      that   s what you just said  yes     said the oh god .      um .  no .  you see  the letters are ephebian characters which just sound a bit like    eat a better pie .            ah .     bilious nodded wisely .     i can see that might cause confusion .      susan felt a bit helpless in the face of the look of helpful puzzlement .     no     she said     in fact they are supposed to cause a little bit of confusion  and then you laugh .  it   s called a pune or play on words .  eta beta pi .     she eyed him carefully .     you laugh     she said .     with your mouth .  only  in fact  you don   t laugh  because you   re not supposed to laugh at things like this .         perhaps i could find that glass of milk     said the oh god helplessly  peering at the huge array of jugs and bottles .  he   d clearly given up on sense of humor .      i gather the archchancellor won   t have milk in the university     said susan .     he says he knows where it comes from and it   s unhygienic .  and that   s a man who eats three eggs for breakfast every day  mark you .  how do you know about milk  by the way .         i   ve got   memories     said the oh god .     not exactly of anything  er  specific .  just  you know  memories .  like  i know trees usually grow green end up   that sort of thing .  i suppose gods just know things .         any special god like powers .         i might be able to turn water into an enervescent drink .     he pinched the bridge of his nose .     is that any help .  and it   s just possible i can give people a blinding headache .         i need to find out why my grandfather is   acting strange .         can   t you ask him .         he won   t tell me .         does he throw up a lot .         i shouldn   t think so .  he doesn   t often eat .  the occasional curry  once or twice a month .         he must be pretty thin .         you   ve no idea .         well  then   does he often stare at himself in the mirror and say    arrgh    .  or stick out his tongue and wonder why it   s gone yellow .  you see  it   s possible i might have some measure of influence over people who are hung over .  if he   s been drinking a lot  i might be able to find him .         i can   t see him doing any of those things .  i think i   d better tell you   my grandfather is death .         oh  i   m sorry to hear that .         i said death .         sorry .         death .  you know   death .         you mean the robes  the              scythe  white horse  bones   yes .  death .         i just want to make sure i   ve got this clear     said the oh god in a reasonable tone of voice .     you think your grandfather is death and you think he   s acting strange .         the eater of socks looked up at the wizards  cautiously .  then its jaws started to work again .      grnf  grnf        here  that   s one of mine .     said the chair of indefinite studies  making a grab .  the eater of socks backed away hurriedly .   it looked like a very small elephant with a very wide  flared trunk  up which one of the chair   s socks was disappearing .      funny lookin    little thing  ain   t it .     said ridcully  leaning his staff against the wall .      let go  you wretched creature .     said the chair  making a grab for the sock .     shoo .      the sock eater tried to get away while remaining where it was .  this should be impossible  but it is in fact a move attempted by many small animals when they are caught eating something forbidden .  the legs scrabble hurriedly but the neck and feverishly working jaws merely stretch and pivot around the food .  finally the last of the sock disappeared up the snout with a faint sucking noise and the creature lumbered off behind one of the boilers .  after a while it poked one suspicious eye around the corner to watch them .      they   re expensive  you know  with the flax reinforced heel     muttered the chair of indefinite studies .   ridcully pulled open a drawer in his hat and extracted his pipe and a pouch of herbal tobacco .  he struck a match on the side of the washing engine .  this was turning out to be a far more interesting evening than he had anticipated .      we   ve got to get this sorted out     he said  as the first few puffs filled the washing hall with the scent of autumn bonfires .     can   t have creatures just popping into existence because someone   s thought about them .  it   s unhygienic .         the sleigh slewed around at the end of money trap lane .   come on  albert .      you know you   re not supposed to do this sort of thing  master .  you know what happened last time .      the hogfather can do it  though .      but   little match girls dying in the snow is part of what the hogswatch spirit is all about  master     said albert desperately .     i mean  people hear about it and say     we may be poorer than a disabled banana and only have mud and old boots to eat  but at least we   re better off than the poor little match girl     master .  it makes them feel happy and grateful for what they   ve got  see .      i know what the spirit of hogswatch is  albert .      sorry  master .  but  look  it   s all right  anyway  because she wakes up and it   s all bright and shining and tinkling music and there   s angels  master .      death stopped .   ah .  they turn up at the last minute with warm clothes and a hot drink .   oh dear  thought albert .  the master   s really in one of his funny moods now .      er .  no .  not exactly at the last minute  master .  not as such .      well .      more sort of just after the last minute .     albert coughed nervously .   you mean after she   s        yes .  that   s how the story goes  master     s not my fault .      why not turn up before .  an angel has quite a large carrying capacity .      couldn   t say  master .  i suppose people think it   s more   satisfying the other way   albert hesitated  and then frowned .     you know  now that i come to tell someone        death looked down at the shape under the falling snow .  then he set the lifetimer on the air and touched it with a finger .  a spark flashed across .      you ain   t really allowed to do that     said albert  feeling wretched .   the hogfather can .  the hogfather gives presents .  there   s no better present than a future .      yeah  but        albert .      all right  master .      death scooped up the girl and strode to the end of the alley .   the snowflakes fell like angel   s feathers .  death stepped out into the street and accosted two figures who were tramping through the drifts .   take her somewhere warm and give her a good dinner  he commanded  pushing the bundle into the arms of one of them .  and i may well be checking up later .   then he turned and disappeared into the swirling snow .   constable visit looked down at the little girl in his arms  and then at corporal nobbs .      what   s all this about  corporal .      nobby pulled aside the blanket .      search me     he said .     looks like we   ve been chosen to do a bit of charity .         i don   t call it very charitable  just dumping someone on people like this .         come on  there   ll still be some grub left in the watch house     said nobby .  he   d got a very deep and certain feeling that this was expected of him .  he remembered a big man in a grotto  although he couldn   t quite remember the face .  and he couldn   t quite remember the face of the person who had handed over the girl  so that meant it must be the same one .   shortly afterward there was some tinkling music and a very bright light and two rather affronted angels appeared at the other end of the alley  but albert threw snowballs at them until they went away .      hex worried ponder stibbons .  he didn   t know how it worked  but everyone else assumed that he did .  oh  he had a good idea about some parts  and he was pretty certain that hex thought about things by turning them all into numbers and crunching them  a clothes wringer from the laundry  or cwl  had been plumbed in for this very purpose   but why did it need a lot of small religious pictures .  and there was the mouse .  it didn   t seem to do much  but whenever they forgot to give it its cheese hex stopped working .  there were all those ram skulls .  the ants wandered over to them occasionally but they didn   t seem to do anything .   what ponder was worried about was the fear that he was simply engaged in a cargo cult .  he   d read about them .  ignorant  and credulous    people  whose island might once have been visited by some itinerant merchant vessel that traded pearls and coconuts for such fruits of civilization as glass beads  mirrors  axes and sexual diseases  would later make big model ships out of bamboo in the hope of once again attracting this magical cargo .  of course  they were far too ignorant and credulous to know that just because you built the shape you didn   t get the substance     he   d built the shape of hex and  it occurred to him  he   d built it in a magical university where the border between the real and    not real    was stretched so thin you could almost see through it .  he got the horrible suspicion that  somehow  they were merely making solid a sketch that was hidden somewhere in the air .   hex knew what it ought to be .   all that business about the electricity  for example .  hex had raised the subject one night  not long after it   d asked for the mouse .   ponder prided himself that he knew pretty much all there was to know about electricity .  but they   d tried rubbing balloons and glass rods until they   d been able to stick adrian onto the ceiling  and it hadn   t had any effect on hex .  then they   d tried tying a lot of cats to a wheel which  when revolved against some beads of amber  caused any amount of electricity all over the place .  the wretched stuff hung around for days  but there didn   t seem any way of ladling it into hex and anyway no one could stand the noise .   so far the archchancellor had vetoed the lightning rod idea .   all this depressed ponder .  he was certain that the world ought to work in a more efficient way .   and now even the things that he thought were going right were going wrong .   he stared glumly at hex   s quill pen in its tangle of springs and wire .   the door was thrown open .  only one person could make a door bang on its hinges like that .  ponder didn   t even turn round .      hello again  archchancellor .         that thinking engine of yours working .     said ridcully .     only there   s an interesting little           it   s not working     said ponder .      it ain   t .  what   s this  a half holiday for hogswatch .         look     said ponder .   hex wrote      whoops .  here comes the cheese .      melon melon melon     error at address      treacle mine road  ankh morpork      .  .  .  .  .      oneoneoneoneoneone     redo from start         what   s going on .     said ridcully  as the others pushed in behind them .      i know it sounds stupid  archchancellor  but we think it might have caught something off the bursar .         daftness  you mean .         that   s ridiculous  boy .     said the dean .     idiocy is not a communicable disease .      ridcully puffed his pipe .      i used to think that  too     he said .     now i   m not so sure .  anyway  you can catch wisdom  can   t you .         no  you can   t     snapped the dean .     it   s not like the flu  ridcully .  wisdom is   well  instilled .         we bring students here and hope they catch wisdom off us  don   t we .     said ridcully .      well  metaphorically     said the dean .      and if you hang around with a bunch of idiots you   re bound to become pretty daft yourself     ridcully went on .      i suppose in a manner of speaking           and you   ve only got to talk to the poor old bursar for five minutes and you think you   re going a bit potty yourself  am i right .      the wizards nodded glumly .  the bursar   s company  although quite harmless  had a habit of making one   s brain squeak .      so hex here has caught daftness off the bursar     said ridcully .     simple .  real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time .     he banged his pipe on the side of hex   s listening tube and shouted     feeling all right  old chap .      hex wrote      hi mum is testing     melon melon melon     out of cheese error      .  .  .  .  .      mr .  jelly .  mr .  jelly .          hex seems perfectly able to work out anything purely to do with numbers  but when it tries anything else it does this     said ponder .      see .  bursar disease     said ridcully .     the bee   s knees when it comes to adding up  the pig   s ear at everything else .  try giving him dried frog pills .         sorry  sir  but that is a very uninformed suggestion     said ponder .     you can   t give medicine to machines .         don   t see why not     said ridcully .  he banged on the tube again and bellowed     soon have you back on your   your   yes  indeed  old chap .  where   s that board with all the letter and number buttons  mr .  stibbons .  ah  good .     he sat down and typed  with one finger  as slowly as a company chairman   d r y d f r o r g     p i l l s  hex   s pipes jangled .      that can   t possibly work  sir     said ponder .      it ought to     said ridcully .     if he can get the idea of being ill  he can get the idea of being cured .      he typed  l o t s o f d r y d f r o r g p     l l s     seems to me     he said     that this thing believes what it   s told  right .         well  it   s true that hex has  if you want to put it that way  no idea of an untruth .         right .  well  i   ve just told the thing it   s had a lot of dried frog pills .  it   s not going to call me a liar  is it .      there was some clickings and whirrings within the structure of hex .   then it wrote      good evening  archchancellor .  i am fully recovered and enthusiastic about my tasks         not mad  then .          i assure you i am as sane as the next man         bursar  just move away from the machine  will you .     said ridcully .     oh  well  i expect it   s the best we   re going to get .  right  let   s get all this sorted out .  we want to find out what   s going on .         anywhere specific or just everywhere .     said ponder  a shade sarcastically .   there was a scratching noise from hex   s pen .  ridcully glanced down at the paper .      says here    implied creation of anthropomorphic personification        he said .     what   s that mean .         er   i think hex has tried to work out the answer     said ponder .      has it  bigods .  i hadn   t even worked out what the question was yet           it heard you talking  sir .      ridcully raised his eyebrows .  then he leaned down toward the speaking tube .      can you hear me in there .      the pen scratched .       yes         lookin    after you all right  are they .         you don   t have to shout  archchancellor     said ponder .      what   s this implied creation  then .     said ridcully .      er  i think i   ve heard of it  archchancellor     said ponder .     it means the existence of some things automatically brings into existence other things .  if some things exist  certain other things have to exist as well .         like   crime and punishment  say .     said ridcully .     drinking and hangovers   of course           something like that  sir  yes .         so   if there   s a tooth fairy there has to be a verruca gnome .     ridcully stroked his beard .     makes a sort of sense  i suppose .  but why not a wisdom tooth goblin .  you know  bringing them extra ones .  some little devil with a bag of big teeth .      there was silence .  but in the depths of the silence there was a little tingly fairy bell sound .      er   do you think i might have       ridcully began .      sounds logical to me     said the senior wrangler .     i remember the agony i had when my wisdom teeth came through .         last week .     said the dean  and smirked .      ah     said ridcully .  he didn   t look embarrassed because people like ridcully are never  ever embarrassed about anything  although often people are embarrassed on their behalf .  he bent down to the ear trumpet again .      you still in there .      ponder stibbons rolled his eyes .      mind telling us what the reality is like round here .      the pen wrote      on a scale of one to ten   query         fine     ridcully shouted .       divide by cucumber error .  please reinstall universe and reboot         interestin        said ridcully .     anyone know what that means .         damn     said ponder .     it   s crashed again .      ridcully looked mystified .     has it .  i never even saw it take off .         i mean it   s   it   s sort of gone a little bit mad     said ponder .      ah     said ridcully .     well  we   re experts at that around here .      he thumped on the drum again .      want some more dried frog pills  old chap .     he shouted .      er  i should let us sort it out  archchancellor     said ponder  trying to steer him away .      what does    divide by cucumber    mean .     said ridcully .      oh  hex just says that if it comes up with an answer that it knows can   t possibly be real     said ponder .      and this    rebooting    business .  give it a good kicking  do you .         oh  no  of course  we   that is   well  yes  in fact     said ponder .     adrian goes round the back and   er   prods it with his foot .  but in a technical way     he added .      ah .  i think i   m getting the hang of this thinkin    engine business     said ridcully cheerfully .     so it reckons the universe needs a kicking  does it .      hex   s pen was scratching across the paper .  ponder glanced at the figures .      it must do .  these figures can   t be right .      ridcully grinned again .     you mean either the whole world has gone wrong or your machine is wrong .         yes .         then i   d imagine the answer   s pretty easy  wouldn   t you .     said ridcully .      yes .  it certainly is .  hex gets thoroughly tested every day     said ponder stibbons .      good point  that  man     said ridcully .  he banged on hex   s listening tube once more .      you down there           you really don   t need to shout  archchancellor     said ponder .         what   s this anthropomorphic personification  then .          humans have always ascribed random  seasonal  natural or inexplicable actions to human shaped entities .  such examples are jack frost  the hogfather  the tooth fairy and death         oh  them .  yes  but they exist     said ridcully .     met a couple of    em myself .          humans are not always wrong         all right  but i   m damn sure there   s never been an eater of socks or god of hangovers .          but there is no reason why there should not be         the thing   s right  you know     said the lecturer in recent runes .     a little man who carries verrucas around is no more ridiculous than someone who takes away children   s teeth for money  when you come to think about it .         yes  but what about the eater of socks .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     bursar just said he always thought something was eating his socks and  bingo  there it was .         but we all believed him  didn   t we .  i know i did .  seems like the best possible explanation for all the socks i   ve lost over the years .  i mean  if they   d just fallen down the back of the drawer or something there   d be a mountain of the things by now .         i know what you mean     said ponder .     it   s like pencils .  i must have bought hundreds of pencils over the years  but how many have i ever actually worn down to the stub .  even i   ve caught myself thinking that something   s creeping up and eating them        there was a faint glingleglingle noise .  he froze .      what was that .     he said .     should i look round .  will i see something horrible .         looks like a very puzzled bird     said ridcully .      with a very odd shaped beak     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i wish i knew who   s making that bloody tinkling noise     said the archchancellor .      the oh god listened attentively .  susan was amazed .  he didn   t seem to disbelieve anything .  she   d never been able to talk like this before  and said so .      i think that   s because i haven   t got any preconceived ideas     said the oh god .     it comes of not having been conceived  probably .         well  that   s how it is  anyway     said susan .     obviously i haven   t inherited   physical characteristics .  i suppose i just look at the world in a certain way .         what way .         it   doesn   t always present barriers .  like this  for example .      she closed her eyes .  she felt better if she didn   t see what she was doing .  part of her would keep on insisting it was impossible .   all she felt was a faintly cold  prickling sensation .      what did i just do .     she said  her eyes still shut .      er   you waved your hand through the table     said the oh god .      you see .         um   i assume that most humans can   t do that .         no .         you don   t have to shout .  i   m not very experienced about humans  am i .  apart from around the point the sun shines through the gap in the curtains .  and then they   re mainly wishing that the ground would open up and swallow them .  i mean the humans  not the curtains .      susan leaned back in her chair   and knew that a tiny part of her brain was saying  yes  there is a chair here  it   s a real thing  you can sit on it .      there   s other things     she said .     i can remember things .  things that haven   t happened yet .         isn   t that useful .         no .  because i never know what they   look  it   s like looking at the future through a keyhole .  you see bits of things but you never really know what they mean until you arrive where they are and see where the bit fits in .         that could be a problem     said the oh god politely .      believe me .  it   s the waiting that   s the worst part .  you keep watching out for one of the bits to go past .  i mean i don   t usually remember anything useful about the future  just twisted little clues that don   t make sense until it   s too late .  are you sure you don   t know why you turned up at the hogfather   s castle .         no .  i just remember being a   well  can you understand what i mean by a disembodied mind .         oh  yes .         good .  now can you understand what i mean by a disembodied headache .  and then  next moment  i was lying on a back i didn   t used to have in a lot of cold white stuff i   d never seen before .  but i suppose if you   re going to pop into existence  you   ve got to do it somewhere .         somewhere where someone else  who should have existed  didn   t     said susan  half to herself .      pardon .         the hogfather wasn   t there     said susan .     he shouldn   t have been there anyway  not tonight  but this time he wasn   t there not because he was somewhere else but because he wasn   t anywhere any more .  even his castle was vanishing .         i expect i shall get the hang of this incarnation business as i go along     said the oh god .      most people       susan began .  a shudder ran through her body .     oh  no .  what   s he doing .  what   s he doing .         a job well done  i fancy .   the sleigh thundered across the night .  frozen fields passed underneath .      hmph     said albert .  he sniffed .   what do you call that warm feeling you get inside .      heartburn .     albert snapped .   do i detect a note of unseasonal grumpiness .  said death .  no sugar piggywiggy for you  albert .      i don   t want any present  master .     albert sighed .     except maybe to wake up and find it   s all back to normal .  look  you know it always goes wrong when you start changing things        but the hogfather can change things .  little miracles all over the place  with many a merry ho  ho  ho .  teaching people the real meaning of hogswatch  albert .      what  you mean that the pigs and cattle have all been slaughtered and with any luck everyone   s got enough food for the winter .      well  when i say the real meaning        some wretched devil   s had his head chopped off in a wood somewhere    cos he found a bean in his dinner and now the summer   s going to come back .      not exactly that  but        oh  you mean that they   ve chased down some poor beast and shot arrows up into their apple trees and now the shadows are going to go away .      that is definitely a meaning  but i        ah  then you   re talking about the one where they light a bloody big bonfire to give the sun a hint and tell it to stop lurking under the horizon and do a proper day   s work .      death paused  while the hogs hurtled over a range of hills .   you   re not helping  albert .      well  they   re all the real meanings that i know .      i think you could work with me on this .      it   s all about the sun  master .  white snow and red blood and the sun .  always has been .      very well  then .  the hogfather can teach people the unreal meaning of hogswatch .   albert spat over the side of the sleigh .     hah .     wouldn   t it be nice if everyone was nice     eh .      there are worse battle cries .      oh dear  oh dear  oh dear        excuse me     death reached into his robe and pulled out an hourglass .   turn the sleigh around  albert .  duty calls .      which one .      a more positive attitude would assist at this point  thank you so very much .         fascinatin    .  anyone got another pencil .     said ridcully .      it   s had four already     said the lecturer in recent runes .     right down to the stub  archchancellor .  and you know we buy our own these days .      it was a sore point .  like most people with no grasp whatsoever of real economics  mustrum ridcully equated    proper financial control    with the counting of paper clips .  even senior wizards had to produce a pencil stub to him before they were allowed a new one out of the locked cupboard below his desk .  since of course hardly anyone retained a half used pencil  the wizards had been reduced to sneaking out and buying new ones with their own money .   the reason for the dearth of short pencils was perched in front of them  whirring away as it chewed an hb down to the eraser on the end  which it spat at the bursar .   ponder stibbons had been making notes .      i think it works like this     he said .     what we   re getting is the personification of forces  just like hex said .  but it only works if the thing is   well  logical .     he swallowed .  ponder was a great believer in logic  in the face of all the local evidence  and he hated having to use the word in this way .     i don   t mean it   s logical that there   s a creature that eats socks  but it   a   it makes a sort of sense   i mean it   s a working hypothesis .         bit like the hogfather     said ridcully .     when you   re a kiddie  he   s as good an explanation as any  right .         what   s not logical about there being a goblin that brings me huge bags of money .     said the dean sulkily .  ridcully fed the stealer of pencils another pencil .      well  sir   firstly  you   ve never mysteriously received huge bags of money and needed to find a hypothesis to explain them  and secondly  no one else would think it at all likely .         huh .         why   s it happening now .     said ridcully .     look  it   s hopped onto my finger .  anyone got another pencil .         well  these   forces have always been here     said ponder .     i mean  socks and pencils have always inexplicably gone missing  haven   t they .  but why they   re suddenly getting personified like this   i   m afraid i don   t know .         well  we   d better find out  hadn   t we .     said ridcully .     can   t have this sort of thing going on .  daft anti gods and miscellaneous whatnots being created just because people   ve thought about    em .  we could have anything turn up  anyway .  supposing some idiot says there must be a god of indigestion  eh .      glingleglingleglingle .      er   i think someone just did  sir     said ponder .         what   s the matter .  what   s the matter .     said the oh god .  he took susan by the shoulders .   they felt bony under his hands .      damn     said susan .  she pushed him away and steadied herself on the table  taking care that he didn   t see her face .   finally  with a measure of the self control she   d taught herself over the last few years  she managed to get her own voice back .      he   s slipping out of character     she muttered  to the hall in general .     i can feel him doing it .  and that drags me in .  what   s he doing it all for .         search me     said the oh god  who   d backed away hurriedly .     er   just then   before you turned your face away   it looked as though you were wearing very dark eye shadow   only you weren   t           look  it   s very simple     said susan  spinning round .  she could feel her hair restyling itself  which it always did when it was anxious .     you know how stuff runs in families .  blue eyes  buck teeth  that sort of thing .  well  death runs in my family .         er   in everybody   s family  doesn   t it .     said the oh god .      just shut up  please  don   t gabble     said susan .     i didn   t mean death  i meant death with a capital d .  i remember things that haven   t happened yet and i can talk that talk and stalk that stalk and   if he gets sidetracked  then i   ll have to do it .  and he does get sidetracked .  i don   t know what   s really happened to the real hogfather or why grandfather   s doing his job  but i know a bit about how he thinks and he   s got no   no mental shields like we have .  he doesn   t know how to forget things or ignore things .  he takes everything liter ally and logically and doesn   t understand why that doesn   t always work        she saw his bemused expression .      look   how would you make sure everyone in the world was well fed .     she demanded .      me .  oh  well  i       the oh god spluttered for a moment .     i suppose you   d have to think about the prevalent political systems  and the proper division and cultivation of arable land  and           yes  yes .  but he   d just give everyone a good meal     said susan .      oh  i see .  very impractical .  hah  it   s as silly as saying you could clothe the naked by  well  giving them some clothes .         yes .  i mean  no .  of course not .  i mean  obviously you   d give   oh  you know what i mean .         yes  i suppose so .         but he wouldn   t .      there was a crash beside them .   a burning wheel always rolls out of flaming wreckage .  two men carrying a large sheet of glass always cross the road in front of any comedy actor involved in a crazy car chase .  some narrative conventions are so strong that equivalents happen even on planets where the rocks boil at noon .  and when a fully laden table collapses  one miraculously unbroken plate always rolls across the floor and spins to a halt .   susan and the oh god watched it  and then turned their attention to the huge figure now lying in what remained of an enormous centerpiece made of fruit .      he just   came right out of the air     whispered the oh god .      really .  don   t just stand there .  give me a hand to help him up  will you .     said susan  pulling at a large melon .      er  that   s a bunch of grapes behind his ear           well .         i don   t like even to think about grapes           oh  come on .      together they managed to get the newcomer onto his feet .      toga  sandals   he looks a bit like you     said susan  as the fruit victim swayed heavily .      was i that green color .         close .         is   is there a privy nearby .     mumbled their burden  through clammy lips .      i believe it   s through that arch over there     said susan .     i   ve heard it   s not very pleasant  though .         that   s not a rumor  that   s a forecast     said the fat figure  and lurched off .     and then can i please have a glass of water and one charcoal biscuit        they watched him go .      friend of yours .     said susan .      god of indigestion  i think .  look   i   er   i think i do remember something     said the oh god .     just before i  um  incarnated .  but it sounds stupid           well .         teeth     said the oh god .   susan hesitated .      you don   t mean something attacking you  do you .     she said flatly .      no .  just   a sensation of toothiness .  probably doesn   t mean much .  as god of hangovers i see a lot worse  i can tell you .         just teeth .  lots of teeth .  but not horrible teeth .  just lots and lots of little teeth .  almost   sad .         yes .  how did you know .         oh  i   maybe i remember you telling me before you told me .  i don   t know .  how about a big shiny red globe .      the oh god looked thoughtful for a moment and then said     no  can   t help you there  i   m afraid .  it   s just teeth .  rows and rows of teeth .         i don   t remember rows     said susan .     i just felt   teeth were important .         nah  it   s amazing what you can do with a beak     said the raven  who   d been investigating the laden table and had succeeded in levering a lid off a jar .      what have you got there .     said susan wearily .      eyeballs     said the raven .     hah  wizards know how to live all right  eh .  they don   t want for nothing around here  i can tell you .         they   re olives     said susan .      tough luck     said the raven .     they   re mine now .         they   re a kind of fruit .  or a vegetable or something .         you sure .     the raven swiveled one doubtful eye on the jar and the other on her .      yes .      the eyes swiveled again .      so you   re an eyeball expert all of a sudden .         look  they   re green  you stupid bird .         they could be very old eyeballs     said the raven defiantly .     sometimes they go like that        squeak  said the death of rats  who was halfway through a cheese .      and not so much of the stupid     said the raven .     corvids are exceptionally bright with reasoning and  in the case of some forest species  tool using abilities .         oh  so you are an expert on ravens  are you .     said susan .      madam  i happen to be a        squeak  said the death of rats again .   they both turned .  it was pointing at its gray teeth .      the tooth fairy .     said susan .     what about her .      squeak .      rows of teeth     said the oh god again .     like   rows  you know .  what   s the tooth fairy .         oh  you see her around a lot these days     said susan .     or them  rather .  it   s a sort of franchise operation .  you get the ladder  the money belt and the pliers and you   re set up .         pliers .         if she can   t make change she has to take an extra tooth on account .  but  look  the tooth fairies are harmless enough .  i   ve met one or two of them .  they   re just working girls .  they don   t menace anyone .      squeak .      i just hope grandfather doesn   t take it into his head to do their job as well .  good grief  the thought of it           they collect teeth .         yes .  obviously .         why .         why .  it   s their job .         i meant why  where do they take the teeth after they collect them .         i don   t know .  they just   well  they just take the teeth and leave the money     said susan .     what sort of question is that      where do they take the teeth .            i just wondered  that   s all .  probably all humans know  i   m probably very silly for asking  it   s probably a well known fact .      susan looked thoughtfully at the death of rats .      actually   where do they take the teeth .      squeak .      he says search him     said the raven .     maybe they sell    em .     it pecked at another jar .     how about these  these look nice and wrinkl           pickled walnuts     said susan absently .     what do they do with the teeth .  what use is there for a lot of teeth .  but   what harm can a tooth fairy do .         have we got time to find one and ask her .     said the oh god .      time isn   t the problem     said susan .      there are those who believe knowledge is something that is acquired   a precious ore hacked  as it were  from the gray strata of ignorance .   there are those who believe that knowledge can only be recalled  that there was some golden age in the distant past when everything was known and the stones fitted together so you could hardly put a knife between them  you know  and it   s obvious they had flying machines  right  because of the way the earthworks can only be seen from above  yeah .  and there   s this museum i read about where they found a pocket calculator under the altar of this ancient temple  you know what i   m saying .  but the government hushed it up      mustrum ridcully believed that knowledge could be acquired by shouting at people  and was endeavoring to do so .  the wizards were sitting around the uncommon room table  which was piled high with books .      it is hogswatch  archchancellor     said the dean reproachfully  thumbing through an ancient volume .      not until midnight     said ridcully .     sortin    this out will give you fellows an appetite for your dinner .         i think i might have something  archchancellor     said the chair of indefinite studies .     this is woddeley   s basic gods .  there   s some stuff here about lares and penates that seems to fit the bill .         lares and penates .  what were they when they were at home .     said ridcully .      hahaha     said the chair .      what .     said ridcully .      i thought you were making a rather good joke  archchancellor     said the chair .      was i .  i didn   t mean to     said ridcully .      nothing new there     said the dean  under his breath .      what was that  dean .         nothing  archchancellor .         i thought you made the reference    at home    because they are  in fact  household gods .  or were  rather .  they seemed to have faded away long ago .  they were   little spirits of the house  like  for example        three of the other wizards  thinking quite fast for wizards  clapped their hands over his mouth .      careful .     said ridcully .     careless talk creates lives .  that   s why we   ve got a big fat god of indigestion being ill in the privy .  by the way  where   s the bursar .         he was in the privy  archchancellor     said the lecturer in recent runes .      what  when the    .         yes  archchancellor .         oh  well  i   m sure he   ll be all right     said ridcully  in the matter of fact voice of someone contemplating something nasty that was happening to someone else out of earshot .     but we don   t want any more of these   what   re they  chair .         lares and penates  archchancellor  but i wasn   t suggesting           seems clear to me .  something   s gone wrong and these little devils are coming back .  all we have to do is find out what   s gone wrong and put it right .         oh  well  i   m glad that   s all sorted out     said the dean .      household gods     said ridcully .     that   s what they are  chair .     he opened the drawer in his hat and took out his pipe .      yes  archchancellor .  it says here they used to be the   local spirits  i suppose .  they saw to it that the bread rose and the butter churned properly .         did they eat pencils .  what was their attitude in the socks department .         this was back in the time of the first empire     said the chair of indefinite studies .     sandals and togas and so on .         ah .  not noticeably socked .         not excessively so  no .  and it was nine hundred years before osric pencillium first discovered  in the graphite rich sands of the remote island of sumtri  the small bush which  by dint of careful cultivation  he induced to produce the long           yes  we can all see you   ve got the encyclopedia open under the table  chair     said ridcully .     but i daresay things have changed a bit .  moved with the times .  bound to have been a few developments .  once they looked after the bread rising  now we have things that eat pencils and socks and see to it that you can never find a clean towel when you want one        there was a distant tinkling .   he stopped .      i just said that  didn   t i .     he said .   the wizards nodded glumly .      and this is the first time anyone   s mentioned it .      the wizards nodded again .      well  dammit  it   s amazing  you can never find a clean towel when        there was a rising wheeee noise .  a towel went by at shoulder height .  there was a suggestion of many small wings .      that was mine     said the lecturer in recent runes reproachfully .  the towel disappeared in the direction of the great hall .      towel wasps     said the dean .     well done  archchancellor .         well  i mean  dammit  it   s human nature  isn   t it .     said ridcully hotly .     things go wrong  things get lost  it   s natural to invent little creatures that   all right  all right  i   ll be careful .  i   m just saying man is naturally a mythopoeic creature .         what   s that mean .     said the senior wrangler .      means we make things up as we go along     said the dean  not looking up .      um   excuse me  gentlemen     said ponder stibbons  who had been scribbling thoughtfully at the end of the table .     are we suggesting that things are coming back .  do we think that   s a viable hypothesis .      the wizards looked at one another around the table .      definitely viable .         viable  right enough .         yes  that   s the stuff to give the troops .         what is .  what   s the stuff to give the troops .         well   tinned rations .  decent weapons  good boots   that sort of thing .         what   s that got to do with anything .         don   t ask me .  he was the one who started talking about giving stuff to the troops .         will you lot shut up .  no one   s giving anything to the troops .         oh  shouldn   t they have something .  it   s hogswatch  after all .         look  it was just a figure of speech  all right .  i just meant i was fully in agreement .  it   s just colorful language .  good grief  you surely can   t think i   m actually suggesting giving stuff to the troops  at hogswatch or any other time .         you weren   t .         no .         that   s a bit mean  isn   t it .      ponder just let it happen .  it   s because their minds are so often involved with deep and problematic matters  he told himself  that their mouths are allowed to wander around making a nuisance of themselves .      i don   t hold with using that thinking machine     said the dean .     i   ve said this before .  it   s meddling with the cult .  the occult has always been good enough for me  thank you very much .         on the other hand it   s the only person round here who can think straight and it does what it   s told     said ridcully .      the sleigh roared through the snow  leaving rolling trails in the sky .      oh  what fun     muttered albert  hanging on tightly .   the runners hit a roof near the university and the pigs trotted to a halt .   death looked at the hourglass again .   odd  he said .      it   s a scythe job  then .     said albert .     you won   t be wanting the false beard and the jolly laugh .     he looked around  and puzzlement replaced sarcasm .     hey   how could anyone be dead up here .      someone was .  a corpse lay in the snow .   it was clear that the man had only just died .  albert squinted up at the sky .      there   s nowhere to fall from and there   s no footprints in the snow     he said  as death swung his scythe .     so where did he come from .  looks like someone   s personal guard .  been stabbed to death .  nasty knife wound there  see .         it   s not good     agreed the spirit of the man  looking down at himself .   then he stared from himself to albert to death and his phantom expression went from shock to concern .      they got the teeth .  all of them .  they just walked in   and   they   no  wait        he faded and was gone .      well  what was that all about .     said albert .   i have my suspicions .      see that badge on his shirt .  looks like a drawing of a tooth .      yes .  it does .      where   s that come from .      a place i cannot go .   albert looked down at the mysterious corpse and then back up at death   s impassive skull .      i keep thinking it was a funny thing  us bumping into your granddaughter like that     he said .   yes .   albert put his head on one side .     given the large number of chimneys and kids in the world  ekcetra .      indeed .      amazing coincidence  really .      it just goes to show .      hard to believe  you might say .      life certainly springs a few surprises .      not just life  i reckon     said albert .     and she got real worked up  didn   t she .  flew right off the ole handle .  wouldn   t be surprised if she started asking questions .      that   s people for you .      but rat is hanging around  ain   t he .  he   ll probably keep an eye socket on her .  guide her path  prob   ly .      he is a little scamp  isn   t he .   albert knew he couldn   t win .  death had the ultimate poker face .   i   m sure she   ll act sensibly .      oh  yeah     said albert  as they walked back to the sleigh .     it runs in the family  acting sensibly .         like many barmen  igor kept a club under the bar to deal with those little upsets that occurred around closing time  although in fact biers never closed and no one could ever remember not seeing igor behind the bar .  nevertheless  things sometimes got out of hand .  or paw .  or talon .   igor   s weapon of choice was a little different .  it was tipped with silver  for werewolves   hung with garlic  for vampires  and wrapped around with a strip of blanket  for bogeymen  .  for everyone else the fact that it was two feet of solid bog oak usually sufficed .   he   d been watching the window .  the frost was creeping across it .  for some reason the creeping fingers were forming into a pattern of three little dogs looking out of a boot .   then someone had tapped him on the shoulder .  he spun around  club already in his hand  and relaxed .      oh   it   s you  miss .  i didn   t hear the door .      there hadn   t been the door .  susan was in a hurry .      have you seen violet lately  igor .         the tooth girl .     igor   s one eyebrow writhed in concentration .     nah  haven   t seen her for a week or two .      the eyebrow furrowed into a v of annoyance as he spotted the raven  which tried to shuffle behind a half empty display card of beer nuts .      you can get that out of here  miss     he said .     you know the rule    bout pets and familiars .  if it can   t turn back into human on demand  it   s out .         yeah  well  some of us have more brain cells than fingers     muttered a voice from behind the beer nuts .      where does she live .         now  miss  you know i never answers questions like that           where does she live  igor .         shamlegger street  next to the picture framers     said igor automatically .  the eyebrow knotted in anger as he realized what he   d said .      now  miss  you know the rules .  i don   t get bitten  i don   t get me froat torn out and no one hides behind me door .  and you don   t try your granddad   s voice on me .  i could ban you for messin    me about like that .         sorry  it   s important     said susan .  out of the corner of her eye she could see that the raven had crept onto the shelves and was pecking the top off a jar .      yeah  well  suppose one of the vampires decides it   s important he   s missed his tea .     grumbled igor  putting the club away .   there was a plink from the direction of the pickled egg jar .  susan tried hard not to look .      can we go .     said the oh god .     all this alcohol makes me nervous .      susan nodded and hurried out .   igor grunted .  then he went back to watching the frost  because igor never demanded much out of life .  after a while he heard a muffled voice say      i    ot    un .  i    ot    un .      it was indistinct because the raven had speared a pickled egg with its beak .   igor sighed  and picked up his club .  and it would have gone very hard for the raven if the death of rats hadn   t chosen that moment to bite igor on the ear .      down there  said death .   the reins were hauled so sharply so quickly that the hogs ended up facing the other way .   albert fought his way out of a drift of teddy bears  where he   d been dozing .      what   s up .  what   s up .  did we hit something .     he said .   death pointed downward .  an endless white snow field lay below  only the occasional glow of a window candle or a half covered hut indicating the presence on this world of brief mortality .   albert squinted  and then saw what death had spotted .         s some old bugger trudging through the snow     he said .     been gathering wood  by the look of it .  a bad night to be out     he said .     and i   m out in it  too  come to that .  look  master  i   m sure you   ve done enough now to make sure        something   s happening down there .  ho .  ho .  ho .      look  he   s all right     said albert  hanging on as the sleigh tumbled downward .  there was a brief wedge of light below as the wood gatherer opened the door of a snow drifted hovel .     see  over there  there   s a couple of blokes catching him up  look  they   re weighed down with parcels and stuff  see .  he   s going to have a decent hogswatch after all  no problem there .  now can we go        death   s glowing eye sockets took in the scene in minute detail .   it   s wrong .      oh  no   here we go again .         the oh god hesitated .      what do you mean  you can   t walk through the door .     said susan .     you walked through the door in the bar .         that was different .  i have certain god like powers in the presence of alcohol .  anyway  we   ve knocked and she hasn   t answered and whatever happened to mr .  manners .      susan shrugged  and walked through the cheap woodwork .  she knew she probably shouldn   t .  every time she did something like this she used up a certain amount of  well  normal .  and sooner or later she   d forget what doorknobs were for  just like grandfather .   come to think of it  he   d never found out what doorknobs were for .   she opened the door from the inside .  the oh god stepped in and looked around .  this did not take long .  it was not a large room .  it had been subdivided from a room that itself hadn   t been all that big to start with .      this is where the tooth fairy lives .     bilious said .     it   s a bit   poky  isn   t it .  stuff all over the floor   what   re these things hanging from this line .         they   re   women   s clothes     said susan  rummaging through the paperwork on a small rickety table .      they   re not very big     said the oh god .     and a bit thin           tell me     said susan  without looking up .     these memories you arrived here with   they weren   t very complicated  were they    .  ah        he looked over her shoulder as she opened a small red notebook .      i   ve only talked to violet a few times     she said .     i think she delivers the teeth somewhere and gets a percentage of the money .  it   s not a highly paid line of work .  you know  they say you can earn     in your spare time but she says really she could earn more money waiting on tables   ah  this looks right           what   s that .         she said she gets given the names every week .         what  of the children who   re going to lose teeth .         yes .  names and addresses     said susan  flicking through the pages .      that doesn   t sound very likely .         pardon me  but are you the god of hangovers .  oh  look  here   s twyla   s tooth last month .     she smiled at the neat gray writing .     she practically hammered it out because she needed the half dollar .         do you like children .     said the oh god .   she gave him a look .     not raw     she said .     other people   s are okay .  hold on        she flicked some pages back and forth .      there   s just blank days     she said .     look  the last few days  all unticked .  no names .  but if you go back a week or two  look  they   re all properly marked off and the money added up at the bottom of the page  see .  and   this can   t be right  can it .      there were only five names entered on the first unticked night  for the previous week .  most children instinctively knew when to push their luck and only the greedy or dentally improvident called out the tooth fairy around hogswatch .      read the names     said susan .      william wittles  a . k . a .  willy  home   tosser  school    nd flr bck bdrm     kicklebury street      sophie langtree  a . k . a .  daddy   s princess  attic bdrm    the hippo      the hon .  jeffrey bibbleton  a . k . a .  trouble in trousers  home   foureyes  school    st flr bck  scrote manor  park lane        he stopped .     i say  this is a bit intrusive  isn   t it .         it   s a whole new world     said susan .     you haven   t got there yet .  keep going .         nuhakme icta  a . k . a .  little jewel  basement  the laughing falafel  klatchistan take away and all nite grocery  cnr .  soake and dimwell      reginald lilywhite  a . k . a .  banjo  the park lane bully  have you seen this man .  the goose gate grabber  the nap hill lurker  rm     ympa .         ympa .         it   s what we generally call the young men   s reformed cultists of the ichor god bel shamharoth association     said susan .     does that sound to you like someone who   d expect a visit from a tooth fairy .         no .         me neither .  he sounds like someone who   d expect a visit from the watch .      susan looked around .  it really was a crummy room  the sort rented by someone who probably took it never intending to stay long  the sort where walking across the floor in the middle of the night would be accompanied by the crack of cockroaches in a death flamenco .  it was amazing how many people spent their whole lives in places where they never intended to stay .   cheap  narrow bed  crumbling plaster  tiny window     she opened the window and fished around below the ledge  and felt satisfied when her questing fingers closed on a piece of string which was attached to an oilcloth bag .  she hauled it in .      what   s that .     said the oh god  as she opened it on the table .      oh  you see them a lot     said susan  taking out some packages wrapped in secondhand waxed paper .     you live alone  mice and roaches eat everything  there   s nowhere to store food   but outside the window it   s cold and safe .  more or less safe .  it   s an old trick .  now   look at this .  leathery bacon  a green loaf and a bit of cheese you could shave .  she hasn   t been back home for some time  believe me .         oh dear .  what now .         where would she take the teeth .     said susan  to the world in general but mainly to herself .     what the hell does the tooth fairy do with        there was a knock at the door .  susan opened it .   outside was a small bald man in a long brown coat .  he was holding a clipboard and blinked nervously at the sight of her .      er    he began .      can i help you .     said susan .      er  i saw the light  see .  i thought violet was in     said the little man .  he twiddled the pencil that was attached to his clipboard by a piece of string .     only she   s a bit behind with the teeth and there   s a bit of money owing and ernie   s cart ain   t come back and it   s got to go in my report and i come round in case   in case she was ill or something  it not being nice being alone and ill at hogswatch           she   s not here     said susan .   the man gave her a worried look and shook his head sadly .      there   s nearly thirteen dollars in pillow money  see .  i   ll have to report it .         who to .         it has to go higher up  see .  i just hope it   s not going to be like that business in quirm where the girl started robbing houses .  we never heard the end of that one           report to who .         and there   s the ladder and the pliers     the man went on  in a litany against a world that had no understanding of what it meant to have to fill in an af   report in triplicate .     how can i keep track of stocktaking if people go around taking stock .     he shook his head .     i dunno  they get the job  they think it   s all nice sunny nights  they get a bit of sharp weather and suddenly it   s good bye charlie i   m off to be a waitress in the warm .  and then there   s ernie .  i know him .  it   s a nip to keep out the cold  and then another one to keep it company  and then a third in case the other two get lost   it   s all going to have to go down in my report  you know  and who   s going to get the blame .  i   ll tell you           it   s going to be you  isn   t it .     said susan .  she was almost hypnotized .  the man even had a fringe of worried hair and a small  worried mustache .  and the voice suggested exactly that here was a man who  at the end of the world  would worry that it would be blamed on him .      that   s right     he said  but in a slightly grudging voice .  he was not about to allow a bit of understanding to lighten his day .     and the girls all go on about the job but i tell them they   ve got it easy  it   s just basic   ly ladder work  they don   t have to spend their evenings knee deep in paper and making shortfalls good out of their own money  i might add           you employ the tooth fairies .     said susan quickly .  the oh god was still vertical but his eyes had glazed over .   the little man preened slightly .     sort of     he said .     basic   ly i run bulk collection and dispatch           where to .      he stared at her .  sharp  direct questions weren   t his forte .      i just sees to it they gets on the cart     he mumbled .     when they   re on the cart and ernie   s signed the gv   for    em  that   s it done and finished  only like i said he ain   t turned up this week and           a whole cart for a handful of teeth .         well  there   s the food for the guards  and      ere  who are you  anyway .  what   re you doing here .      susan straightened up .     i don   t have to put up with this     she said sweetly  to no one in particular .  she leaned forward again .      what cart are we talking about here  charlie .     the oh god jolted away .  the man in the brown coat shot backward and splayed against the corridor wall as susan advanced .      comes tuesdays     he panted .        ere  what           and where does it go .         dunno .  like i said  when he   s           signed the gv   for them it   s you done and finished     said susan  in her normal voice .     yes .  you said .  what   s violet   s full name .  she never mentioned it .      the man hesitated .      i said           violet bottler .         thank you .         an    ernie   s gorn  too     said charlie  continuing more or less on autopilot .     i call that suspicious .  i mean  he   s got a wife and everything .  won   t be the first man to get his head turned by thirteen dollars and a pretty ankle and  o    course  no one thinks about muggins who has to carry the can  i mean  supposing we was all to get it in our heads to run off with young wimmin .      he gave susan the stern look of one who  if it was not for the fact that the world needed him  would even now be tiring of painting naked young ladies on some tropical island somewhere .      what happens to the teeth .     said susan .   he blinked at her .  a bully  thought susan .  a very small  weak  very dull bully  who doesn   t manage any real bullying because there   s hardly anyone smaller and weaker than him  so he just makes everyone   s lives just that little bit more difficult        what sort of question is that .     he managed  in the face of her stare .      you never wondered .     said susan  and added to herself  i didn   t .  did anyone .      well     s not my job  i just           oh  yes .  you said     said susan .     thank you .  you   ve been very helpful .  thank you very much .      the man stared at her  and then turned and ran down the stairs .      drat     said susan .      that   s a very unusual swearword     said the oh god nervously .      it   s so easy     said susan .     if i want to  i can find anybody .  it   s a family trait .         oh .  good .         no .  have you any idea how hard it is to be normal .  the things you have to remember .  how to go to sleep .  how to forget things .  what doorknobs are for .      why ask him  she thought  as she looked at his shocked face .  all that   s normal for him is remembering to throw up what someone else drank .      oh  come on     she said  and hurried toward the stairs .   it was so easy to slip into immortality  to ride the horse  to know everything .  and every time you did  it brought closer the day when you could never get off and never forget .   death was hereditary .   you got it from your ancestors .      where are we going now .     said the oh god .      down to the ympa     said susan .      the old man in the hovel looked uncertainly at the feast spread in front of him .  he sat on his stool as curled up on himself as a spider in a flame .      i   d got a bit of a mess of beans cooking     he mumbled  looking at his visitors through filmy eyes .      good heavens  you can   t eat beans at hogswatch     said the king  smiling hugely .     that   s terribly unlucky  eating beans at hogswatch .  my word  yes .         di   nt know that     the old man said  looking down desperately at his lap .      we   ve brought you this magnificent spread .  don   t you think so .         i bet you   re incredibly grateful for it  too     said the page  sharply .      yes  well  o    course  it   s very kind of you gennelmen     said the old man  in a voice the size of a mouse .  he blinked  uncertain of what to do next .      the turkey   s hardly been touched  still plenty of meat on it     said the king .     and do have some of this cracking good widgeon stuffed with swan   s liver .            only i   m partial to a bowl of beans and i   ve never been beholden to no one nor nobody     the old man said  still staring at his lap .      good heavens  man  you don   t need to worry about that     said the king heartily .     it   s hogswatch .  i was only just now looking out of the window and i saw you plodding through the snow and i said to young jermain here  i said     who   s that chappie .     and he said     oh  he   s some peasant fellow who lives up by the forest     and i said     well  i couldn   t eat another thing and it   s hogswatch  after all     and so we just bundled everything up and here we are .         and i expect you   re pathetically thankful     said the page .     i expect we   ve brought a ray of light into your dark tunnel of a life  hmm .            yes  well  o    course  only i   d been savin       em for weeks  see  and there   s some bakin    potatoes under the fire  i found    em in the cellar    n    the mice   d hardly touched    em .     the old man never raised his eyes from knee level .        n    our dad brought me up never to ask for           listen     said the king  raising his voice a little     i   ve walked miles tonight and i bet you   ve never seen food like this in your whole life  eh .      tears of humiliated embarrassment were rolling down the old man   s face .         well  i   m sure it   s very kind of you fine gennelmen but i ain   t sure i knows how to eat swans and such like  but if you want a bit o    my beans you   ve only got to say           let me make myself absolutely clear     said the king sharply .     this is some genuine hogswatch charity  d   you understand .  and we   re going to sit here and watch the smile on your grubby but honest face  is that understood .         and what do you say to the good king .     the page prompted .   the peasant hung his head .         nk you .         right     said the king  sitting back .     now  pick up your fork        the door burst open .  an indistinct figure strode into the room  snow swirling around it in a cloud .   what   s going on here .   the page started to stand up  drawing his sword .  he never worked out how the other figure could have got behind him  but there it was  pressing him gently down again .      hello  son  my name is albert     said a voice by his ear .     why don   t you put that sword back very slowly .  people might get hurt .      a finger prodded the king  who had been too shocked to move .   what do you think you are doing  sire .   the king tried to focus on the figure .  there was an impression of red and white  but black  too .   to albert   s secret amazement  the man managed to get to his feet and draw himself up as regally as he could .      what is going on here  whoever you are  is some fine old hogswatch charity .  and who        no  it   s not .      what .  how dare you        were you here last month .  will you be here next week .  no .  but tonight you wanted to feel all warm inside .  tonight you will want them to say  what a good king he is .      oh  no  he   s going too far again       muttered albert under his breath .  he pushed the page down again .     no  you stay still  sonny .  else you   ll just be a paragraph .         whatever it is  it   s more than he   s got .     snapped the king .     and all we   ve had from him is ingratitude        yes  that does spoil it  doesn   t it .  death leaned forward .  go away .   to the king   s own surprise his body took over and marched him out of the door .   albert patted the page on the shoulder .     and you can run along  too     he said .         i didn   t mean to go upsetting anyone  it   s just that i never asked no one for nothing       mumbled the old man  in a small humble world of his own  his hands tangling themselves together out of nervousness .      best if you leave this one to me  master  if you don   t mind     said albert .     i   ll be back in just a tick .     loose ends  he thought  that   s my job .  tying up loose ends .  the master never thinks things through .   he caught up with the king outside .      ah  there you are  your sire     he said .     just before you go  won   t keep you a minute  just a minor point       albert leaned close to the stunned monarch .     if anyone was thinking about making a mistake  you know  like maybe sending the guards down here tomorrow  tipping the old man out of his hovel  chuckin    him in prison  anything like that   werrlll   that   s the kind of mistake he ought to treasure on account of it being the last mistake he   ll ever make .  a word to the wise men  right .     he tapped the side of his nose conspiratorially .     happy hogswatch .      then he hurried back into the hovel .   the feast had vanished .  the old man was looking blearily at the bare table .   half eaten leavings  said death .  we could certainly do better than this .  he reached into the sack .   albert grabbed his arm before he could withdraw his hand .      mind taking a bit of advice  master .  i was brung up in a place like this .      does it bring tears to your eyes .      a box of matches to me hand  more like .  listen        the old man was only dimly aware of some whispering .  he sat hunched up  staring at nothing .   well  if you are sure        been there  done that  chewed the bones     said albert .     charity ain   t giving people what you wants to give  it   s giving people what they need to get .      very well .   death reached into the sack again .   happy hogswatch .  ho .  ho .  ho .   there was a string of sausages .  there was a side of bacon .  and a small tub of salt pork .  and a mass of chitterlings wrapped up in greased paper .  there was a black pudding .  there were several other tubs of disgusting yet savory pork adjacent items highly prized in any pig based economy .  and  laid on the table with a soft thump  there was        a pig   s head     breathed the old man .     a whole one .  ain   t had brawn in years .  and a basin of pig knuckles .  and a bowl of pork dripping .      ho .  ho .  ho .      amazing     said albert .     how did you get the head   s expression to look like the king .      i think that   s accidental .   albert patted the old man on the back .      have yourself a ball     he said .     in fact  have two .  now i think we ought to be going  master .      they left the old man staring at the laden board .   wasn   t that nice .  said death  as the hogs accelerated .      oh  yes     said albert  shaking his head .     poor old devil .  beans at hogswatch .  unlucky  that .  not a night for a man to find a bean in his bowl .      i feel i was cut out for this sort of thing  you know .      really  master .      it   s nice to do a job where people look forward to seeing you .      ah     said albert glumly .   they don   t normally look forward to seeing me .      yes  i expect so .      except in special and rather unfortunate circumstances .      right  right .      and they seldom leave a glass of sherry out .      i expect they don   t  no .      i could get into the habit of doing this  in fact .      but you won   t need to  will you  master .     said albert hurriedly  with the horrible prospect of being a permanent pixie albert looming in his mind again .     because we   ll get the hogfather back  right .  that   s what you said we were going to do  right .  and young susan   s probably bustling around        yes .  of course .      not that you asked her to  of course .      albert   s jittery ears didn   t detect any enthusiasm .   oh dear  he thought .   i have always chosen the path of duty .      right  master .      the sleigh sped on .   i am thoroughly in control and firm of purpose .      no problem there  then  master     said albert .   no need to worry at all .      pleased to hear it  master .      if i had a first name     duty    would be my middle name .      good .      nevertheless     albert strained his ears and thought he heard  just on the edge of hearing  a voice whisper sadly .   ho .  ho .  ho .      there was a party going on .  it seemed to occupy the entire building .      certainly very energetic young men     said the oh god carefully  stepping over a wet towel .     are women allowed in here .         no     said susan .  she stepped through a wall into the superintendent   s office .   a group of young men went past  manhandling a barrel of beer .      you   ll feel bad about it in the morning     said bilious .     strong drink is a mocker  you know .      they set it up on a table and knocked out the bung .      someone   s going to have to be sick after all that     he said  raising his voice above the hubbub .     i hope you realize that .  you think it   s clever  do you  reducing yourself to the level of the beasts of the field   er   or the level they   d sink to if they drank  i mean .      they moved away  leaving one mug of beer by the barrel .   the oh god glanced at it  and picked it up and sniffed at it .      ugh .      susan stepped out of the wall .      he hasn   t been back for   what   re you doing .         i thought i   d see what beer tastes like     said the oh god guiltily .      you don   t know what beer tastes like .         not on the way down  no .  it   s   quite different by the time it gets to me     he said sourly .  he took another sip  and then a longer one .     i can   t see what all the fuss is about     he added .   he tipped up the empty pot .      i suppose it comes out of this tap here     he said .     you know  for once in my existence i   d like to get drunk .         aren   t you always .     said susan  who wasn   t really paying attention .      no .  i   ve always been drunk .  i   m sure i explained .         he   s been gone a couple of days     said susan .     that   s odd .  and he didn   t say where he was going .  the last night he was here was the night he was on violet   s list .  but he paid for his room for the week  and i   ve got the number .         and the key .     said the oh god .      what a strange idea .      mr .  lilywhite   s room was small .  that wasn   t surprising .  what was surprising was how neat it was  how carefully the little bed had been made  how well the floor had been swept .  it was hard to imagine anyone living in it  but there were a few signs .  on the simple table by the bed was a small  rather crude portrait of a bulldog in a wig  although on closer inspection it might have been a woman .  this tentative hypothesis was borne out by the inscription    to a good boy  from his mother    on the back .   a book lay next to it .  susan wondered what kind of reading someone with mr .  banjo   s background would buy .   it turned out to be a book of six pages  one of those that were supposed to enthrall children with the magic of the printed word by pointing out that they could see spot run .   there were no more than ten words on each page and yet  carefully placed between pages four and five  was a bookmark .   she turned back to the cover .  the book was called happy tales .  there was a blue sky and trees and a couple of impossibly pink children playing with a jolly looking dog .   it looked as though it had been read frequently  if slowly .   and that was it .   a dead end .   no .  perhaps not     on the floor by the bed  as if it had been accidentally dropped  was a small  silvery half dollar piece .   susan picked it up and tossed it idly .  she looked the oh god up and down .  he was swilling a mouthful of beer from cheek to cheek and looking thoughtfully at the ceiling .   she wondered about his likelihood of survival incarnate in ankh morpork at hogswatch  especially if the cure wore off .  after all  the only purpose of his existence was to have a headache and throw up .  there were not a great many postgraduate jobs for which these were the main qualifications .      tell me     she said .     have you ever ridden a horse .         i don   t know .  what   s a horse .         in the depths of the library of death  a squeaking noise .   it was not loud  but it appeared louder than mere decibels would suggest in the furtive  scribbling hush of the books .   everyone  it is said  has a book inside them .  in this library  everyone was inside a book .   the squeaking got louder .  it had a rhythmical  circular quality .   book on book  shelf on shelf   and in every one  at the page of the ever moving now  a scribble of handwriting following the narrative of every life     the squeaking came round the corner .   it was issuing from what looked like a very rickety edifice  several stories high .  it looked rather like a siege tower  open at the sides .  at the base  between the wheels  was a pair of geared treadles which moved the whole thing .   susan clung to the railing of the topmost platform .      can   t you hurry up .     she said .     we   re only at the bi   s at the moment .         i   ve been pedaling for ages .     panted the oh god .      well  a is a very popular letter .      susan stared up at the shelves .  a was for anon  among other things .  all those people who  for one reason or another  never officially got a name .   they tended to be short books .      ah   bo   bod   bog   turn left        the library tower squeaked ponderously around the next corner .      ah  bo   blast  the bots are at least twenty shelves up .         oh  how nice     said the oh god grimly .   he heaved on the lever that moved the drive chain from one sprocket to another  and started to pedal again .   very ponderously  the creaking tower began to telescope upward .      right  we   re there     susan shouted down  after a few minutes of slow rise .     here   s   let   s see   aabana bottler           i expect violet will be a lot further     said the oh god  trying out irony .      onward .      swaying a little  the tower headed down the bs until      stop .      it rocked as the oh god kicked the brake block against a wheel .      i think this is her     said a voice from above .     okay  you can lower away .      a big wheel with ponderous lead weights on it spun slowly as the tower concertina   d back  creaking and grinding .  susan climbed down the last few feet .      everyone   s in here .     said the oh god  as susan thumbed through the pages .      yes .         even gods .         anything that   s alive and self aware     said susan  not looking up .     this is   odd .  it looks as though she   s in some sort of   prison .  who   d want to lock up a tooth fairy .         someone with very sensitive teeth .      susan flicked back a few pages .     it   s all   hoods over her head and people carrying her and so on .  but       she turned a page        it says the last job she did was on banjo and   yes  she got the tooth   and then she felt as though someone was behind her and   there   s a ride on a cart   and the hood   s come off   and there   s a causeway   and           all that   s in a book .         the autobiography .  everyone has one .  it writes down your life as you go along .         i   ve got one .         i expect so .         oh  dear .     got up  was sick  wanted to die .     not a gripping read  really .      susan turned the page .      a tower     she said .     she   s in a tower .  from what she saw  it was tall and white inside   but not outside .  it didn   t look real .  there were apple trees around it  but the trees  the trees didn   t look right .  and a river  but that wasn   t right either .  there were goldfish in it   but they were on top of the water .         ah .  pollution     said the oh god .      i don   t think so .  it says here she saw them swimming .         swimming on top of the water .         that   s how she thinks she saw it .         really .  you don   t think she   d been eating any of that moldy cheese  do you .         and there was blue sky but   she must have got this wrong   it says here there was only blue sky above           yep .  best place for the sky     said the oh god .     sky underneath you  that probably means trouble .      susan flicked a page back and forth .     she means   sky overhead but not around the edges  i think .  no sky on the horizon .         excuse me     said the oh god .     i   m not long in this world  i appreciate that  but i think you have to have sky on the horizon .  that   s how you can tell it   s the horizon .      a sense of familiarity was creeping up on susan  but surreptitiously  dodging behind things whenever she tried to concentrate on it .      i   ve seen this place     she said  tapping the page .     if only she   d looked harder at the trees   she says they   ve got brown trunks and green leaves and it says here she thought they were odd .  and       she concentrated on the next paragraph .     flowers .  growing in the grass .  with big round petals .      she stared unseeing at the oh god again .      this isn   t a proper landscape     she said .      it doesn   t sound too unreal to me     said the oh god .     sky .  trees .  flowers .  dead fish .         brown tree trunks .  really they   re mostly a sort of grayish mossy color .  you only ever see brown tree trunks in one place     said susan .     and it   s the same place where the sky is only ever overhead .  the blue never comes down to the ground .      she looked up .  at the far end of the corridor was one of the very tall  very thin windows .  it looked out onto the black gardens .  black bushes  black grass  black trees .  skeletal fish cruising in the black waters of a pool  under black water lilies .   there was color  in a sense  but it was the kind of color you   d get if you could shine a beam of black through a prism .  there were hints of tints  here and there a black you might persuade yourself was a very deep purple or a midnight blue .  but it was basically black  under a black sky  because this was the world belonging to death and that was all there was to it .   the shape of death was the shape people had created for him  over the centuries .  why bony .  because bones were associated with death .  he   d got a scythe because agricultural people could spot a decent metaphor .  and he lived in a somber land because the human imagination would be rather stretched to let him live somewhere nice with flowers .   people like death lived in the human imagination  and got their shape there  too .  he wasn   t the only one        but he didn   t like the script  did he .  he   d started to take an interest in people .  was that a thought  or just a memory of something that hadn   t happened yet .   the oh god followed her gaze .      can we go after her .     said the oh god .     i say we  i think i   ve just got drafted in because i was in the wrong place .         she   s alive .  that means she is mortal     said susan .     that means i can find her  too .     she turned and started to walk out of the library .      if she says the sky is just blue overhead  what   s between it and the horizon .     said the oh god  running to keep up .      you don   t have to come     said susan .     it   s not your problem .         yes  but given that my problem is that my whole purpose in life is to feel rotten  anything   s an improvement .         it could be dangerous .  i don   t think she   s there of her own free will .  would you be any good in a fight .         yes .  i could be sick on people .         it was a shack  somewhere out on the outskirts of the plains town of scrote .  scrote had a lot of outskirts  spread so widely   a busted cart here  a dead dog there   that often people went through it without even knowing it was there  and really it only appeared on the maps because cartographers get embarrassed about big empty spaces .   hogswatch came after the excitement of the cabbage harvest when it was pretty quiet in scrote and there was nothing much to look forward to until the fun of the sprout festival .   this shack had an iron stove  with a pipe that went up through the thick cabbage leaf thatch .   voices echoed faintly within the pipe .   this is really  really stupid .      i think the tradition got started when everyone had them big chimneys  master .     this voice sounded as though it was coming from someone standing on the roof and shouting down the pipe .   indeed .  it   s only a mercy it   s unlit .   there was some muffled scratching and banging  and then a thump from within the potbelly of the stove .   damn .      what   s up  master .      the door has no handle on the inside .  i call that inconsiderate .   there were some more bumps  and then a scrape as the stove lid was lifted up and pushed sideways .  an arm came out and felt around the front of the stove until it found the handle .   it played with it for a while  but it was obvious that the hand did not belong to a person used to opening things .   in short  death came out of the stove .  exactly how would be difficult to describe without folding the page .  time and space were  from death   s point of view  merely things that he   d heard described .  when it came to death  they ticked the box marked not applicable .  it might help to think of the universe as a rubber sheet  or perhaps not .      let us in  master     a pitiful voice echoed down from the roof .     it   s brass monkeys out here .      death went over to the door .  snow was blowing underneath it .  he peered nervously at the woodwork .  there was a thump outside and albert   s voice sounded a lot closer .      what   s up  master .      death stuck his head through the wood of the door .   there   s these metal things        bolts  master .  you slide them     said albert  sticking his hands under his armpits to keep them warm .   ah .   death   s head disappeared .  albert stamped his feet and watched his breath cloud in the air while he listened to the pathetic scrabbling on the other side of the door .   death   s head appeared again .   er        it   s the latch  master     said albert wearily .   right .  right .      you put your thumb on it and push it down .      right .   the head disappeared .  albert jumped up and down a bit  and waited .   the head appeared .   er   i was with you up to the thumb     albert sighed .     and then you press down and pull  master .      ah .  right .  got you .   the head disappeared .   oh dear  thought albert .  he just can   t get the hang of them  can he    .   the door jerked open .  death stood behind it  beaming proudly  as albert staggered in  snow blowing in with him .      blimey  it   s getting really parky     said albert .     any sherry .     he added hopefully .   it appears not .   death looked at the sock hooked onto the side of the stove .  it had a hole in it .   a letter  in erratic handwriting  was attached to it .  death picked it up .   the boy wants a pair of trousers that he doesn   t have to share  a huge meat pie  a sugar mouse     a lot of toys    and a puppy called scruff .      ah  sweet     said albert .     i shall wipe away a tear     cos what he   s gettin     see  is this little wooden toy and an apple .     he held them out .   but the letter clearly        yes  well  it   s socio economic factors again  right .     said albert .     the world   d be in a right mess if everyone got what they asked for  eh .      i gave them what they wanted in the store        yeah  and that   s gonna cause a lot of trouble  master .  all them    toy pigs that really work .     i didn   t say nothing    cos it was getting the job done but you can   t go on like that .  what good   s a god who gives you everything you want .      you have me there .      it   s the hope that   s important .  big part of belief  hope .  give people jam today and they   ll just sit and eat it .  jam tomorrow  now   that   ll keep them going forever .      and you mean that because of this the poor get poor things and the rich get rich things .         s right     said albert .     that   s the meaning of hogswatch .      death nearly wailed .   but i   m the hogfather .  he looked embarrassed .  at the moment  i mean .      makes no difference     said albert  shrugging .     i remember when i was a nipper  one hogswatch i had my heart set on this huge model horse they had in the shop       his face creased for a moment in a grim smile of recollection .     i remember i spent hours one day  cold as charity the weather was  i spent hours with my nose pressed up against the window   until they heard me callin     and unfroze me .  i saw them take it out of the window  someone was in there buying it  and  y   know  just for a second i thought it really was going to be for me   oh  i dreamed of that toy horse .  it were red and white with a real saddle and everything .  and rockers .  i   d   ve killed for that horse .     he shrugged again .     not a chance  of course     cos we didn   t have a pot to piss in and we even    ad to spit on the bread to make it soft enough to eat        please enlighten me .  what is so important about having a pot to piss in .      it   s   it   s more like a figure of speech  master .  it means you   re as poor as a church mouse .      are they poor .      well   yeah .      but surely not more poor than any other mouse .  and  after all  there tend to be lots of candles and things they could eat .      figure of speech again  master .  it doesn   t have to make sense .      oh .  i see .  do carry on .      o    course  i still hung up my stocking on hogswatch eve  and in the morning  you know  you know what .  our dad had put in this little horse he   d carved his very own self        ah  said death .  and that was worth more than all the expensive toy horses in the world  eh .   albert gave him a beady look .     no .     he said .     it weren   t .  all i could think of was it wasn   t the big horse in the window .      death looked shocked .   but how much better to have a toy carved with        no .  only grown ups think like that     said albert .     you   re a selfish little bugger when you   re seven .  anyway  dad got ratted after lunch and trod on it .      lunch .      all right  mebbe we had a bit of pork dripping for the bread        even so  the spirit of hogswatch     albert sighed .     if you like  master .  if you like .      death looked perturbed .   but supposing the hogfather had brought you the wonderful horse        oh  dad would   ve flogged it for a couple of bottles     said albert .   but we have been into houses where the children had many toys and brought them even more toys  and in houses like this the children get practically nothing .      huh  we   d have given anything to get practically nothing when i were a lad     said albert .   be happy with what you   ve got  is that the idea .      that   s about the size of it  master .  a good god line  that .  don   t give    em too much and tell    em to be happy with it .  jam tomorrow  see .      this is wrong .  death hesitated .  i mean   it   s right to be happy with what you   ve got .  but you   ve got to have something to be happy about having .  there   s no point in being happy about having nothing .   albert felt a bit out of his depth in this new tide of social philosophy .      dunno     he said .     i suppose people   d say they   ve got the moon and the stars and such like .      i   m sure they wouldn   t be able to produce the paperwork .      all i know is  if dad   d caught us with a big bag of pricey toys we   d just have got a ding round the ear hole for nicking    em .      it is   unfair .      that   s life  master .      but i   m not .      i meant  this is how it   s supposed to go  master     said albert .   no .  you mean this is how it goes .   albert leaned against the stove and rolled himself one of his horrible thin cigarettes .  it was best to let the master work his own way through these things .  he got over them eventually .  it was like that business with the violin .  for three days there was nothing but twangs and broken strings  and then he   d never touched the thing again .  that was the trouble  really .  everything the master did was a bit like that .  when things got into his head you just had to wait until they leaked out again .   he   d thought that hogswatch was all   plum pudding and brandy and ho ho ho  and he didn   t have the kind of mind that could ignore all the other stuff .  and so it hurt him .   it is hogswatch  said death  and people die on the streets .  people feast behind lighted windows and other people have no homes .  is this fair .      well  of course  that   s the big issue       albert began .   the peasant had a handful of beans and the king had so much he would not even notice that which he gave away .  is this fair .      yeah  but if you gave it all to the peasant then in a year or two he   d be just as snooty as the king       began albert  jaundiced observer of human nature .   naughty and nice .  said death .  but it   s easy to be nice if you   re rich .  is this fair .   albert wanted to argue .  he wanted to say  really .  in that case  how come so many of the rich buggers is bastards .  and being poor don   t mean being naughty  neither .  we was poor when i were a kid  but we was honest .  well  more stupid than honest  to tell the truth .  but basically honest .   he didn   t argue  though .  the master wasn   t in any mood for it .  he always did what needed to be done .      you did say we just had to do this so   s people   d believe       he began  and then stopped and started again .     when it comes to fair  master  you yourself        i am evenhanded to rich and poor alike  snapped death .  but this should not be a sad time .  this is supposed to be the season to be jolly .  he wrapped his red robe around him .  and other things ending in olly  he added .         there   s no blade     said the oh god .     it   s just a sword hilt .      susan stepped out of the light and her wrist moved .  a sparkling blue line flashed in the air  for a moment outlining an edge too thin to be seen .   the oh god backed away .      what   s that .         oh  it cuts tiny bits of the air in half .  it can cut the soul away from the body  so stand back  please .         oh  i will  i will .      susan fished the black scabbard out of the umbrella stand .   umbrella stand .  it never rained here  but death had an umbrella stand .  practically no one else susan knew had an umbrella stand .  in any list of useful furniture  the one found at the bottom would be the umbrella stand .   death lived in a black world  where nothing was alive and everything was dark and his great library only had dust and cobwebs because he   d created them for effect and there was never any sun in the sky and the air never moved and he had an umbrella stand .  and a pair of silver backed hairbrushes by his bed .  he wanted to be something more than just a bony apparition .  he tried to create these flashes of personality but somehow they betrayed themselves  they tried too hard  like an adolescent boy going out wearing an after shave called    rampant .      grandfather always got things wrong .  he saw life from outside and never quite understood .      that looks dangerous     said the oh god .   susan sheathed the sword .      i hope so     she said .      er   where are we going .  exactly .         somewhere under an overhead sky     said susan .     and   i   ve seen it before .  recently .  i know the place .      they walked out to the stable yard .  binky was waiting .      i said you don   t have to come     said susan  grasping the saddle .     i mean  you   re a   an innocent bystander .         but i   m a god of hangovers who   s been cured of hangovers     said the oh god .     i haven   t really got any function at all .      he looked so forlorn when he said this that she relented .      all right .  come on  then .      she pulled him up behind her .      just hang on     she said .  and then she said     hang on somewhere differently  i mean .         i   m sorry  was that a problem .     said the oh god  shifting his grip .      it might take too long to explain and you probably don   t know all the words .  around the waist  please .      susan took out violet   s hourglass and held it up .  there was a lot of sand left to run  but she couldn   t be certain that was a good sign .   all she could be certain of was that the horse of death could go anywhere .      the sound of hex   s quill as it scrabbled across the paper was like a frantic spider trapped in a matchbox .   despite his dislike of what was going on  there was a part of ponder stibbons that was very  very impressed .   in the past  when hex had been recalcitrant about its calculations  when it had got into a mechanical sulk and had started writing things like        out of cheese error        and        redo from start        ponder had tried to sort things out calmly and logically .   it had never  ever occurred to him to contemplate hitting hex with a mallet .  but this was  in fact  what ridcully was threatening to do .   what was impressive  and also more than a little worrying  was that hex seemed to understand the concept .      right     said ridcully  putting the mallet aside .     let   s have no more of this    insufficient dates    business  shall we .  there   s boxes of the damn things back in the great hall .  you can have the lot as far as i   m concerned           it   s data  not dates     said ponder helpfully .      what .  you mean like   more than dates .  extra sticky .         no  no  data is hex   s word for   well  facts     said ponder .      ridiculous way to behave     said ridcully brusquely .     if he   s stumped for an answer  why can   t he write    you   ve got me there    or    damned if i know    or    that   s a bit of a puzzler and no mistake    .  all this    insufficient data    business is just pure contrariness  to my mind .  it   s just swank .     he turned back to hex .     right  you .  hazard a guess .      the quill started to write        insuff    and then stopped .  after quivering for a moment it went down a line and started again .       this is just calculating aloud  you understand         fair enough     said ridcully .       the amount of belief in the world must be subject to an upper limit         what an odd question     said the dean .      sounds sensible     said ridcully .     i suppose people just   believe in stuff .  obviously there   s a limit to what you can believe in .  i   ve always said so .  so what .          creatures have appeared that were once believed in         yes .  yes  you could put it like that .          they disappeared because they were not believed in         seems reasonable     said ridcully .       people were believing in something else   query .       ridcully looked at the other wizards .  they shrugged .      could be     he said guardedly .     people can only believe in so many things .          it follows that if a major focus of belief is removed  there will be spare belief      ridcully stared at the words .      you mean   sloshing around .      the big wheel with the ram skulls on it began to turn ponderously .  the scurrying ants in the glass tubes took on a new urgency .      what   s happening .     said ridcully  in a loud whisper .      i think hex is looking up the word    sloshing        said ponder .     it may be in long term storage .      a large hourglass came down on the spring .      what   s that for .     said ridcully .      er   it shows hex is working things out .         oh .  and that buzzing noise .  seems to be coming from the other side of the wall .      ponder coughed .      that is the long term storage  archchancellor .         and how does that work .         er   well  if you think of memory as a series of little shelves or  or  or holes  archchancellor  in which you can put things  well  we found a way of making a sort of memory which  er  interfaces neatly with the ants  in fact  but more importantly can expand its size depending on how much we give it to remember and  er  is possibly a bit slow but           it   s a very loud buzzing     said the dean .     is it going wrong .         no  that shows it   s working     said ponder .     it   s  er  beehives .      he coughed .      different types of pollen  different thicknesses of honey  placement of the eggs   it   s actually amazing how much information you can store on one honeycomb .      he looked at their faces .     and it   s very secure because anyone trying to tamper with it will get stung to death and adrian believes that when we shut it down in the summer holidays we should get a nice lot of honey  too .     he coughed again .     for our   sand   wiches     he said .   he felt himself getting smaller and hotter under their gazes .   hex came to his rescue .  the hourglass bounced away and the quill pen was jerked in and out of its inkwell .       yes .  sloshing around .  accreting         that means forming around new centers  archchancellor     said ponder helpfully .      i know that     said ridcully .     blast .  remember when we had all that life force all over the place .  a man couldn   t call his trousers his own .  so   there   s spare belief sloshing around  thank you  and these little devils are taking advantage of it .  coming back .  household gods .          this is possible         all right  then  so what are people not believing in all of a sudden .          out of cheese error     melon melon melon     redo from start         thank you .  a simple    i don   t know    would have been sufficient     said ridcully  sitting back .      one of the major gods .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      hah  we   d soon know about it if one of those vanished .         it   s hogswatch     said the dean .     i suppose the hogfather is around  is he .         you believe in him .     said ridcully .      well  he   s for kids  isn   t he .     said the dean .     but i   m sure they all believe in him .  i certainly did .  it wouldn   t be hogswatch when i was a kid without a pillowcase hanging by the fire           a pillowcase .     said the senior wrangler  sharply .      well  you can   t get much in a stocking     said the dean .      yes  but a whole pillowcase .     the senior wrangler insisted .      yes .  what of it .         is it just me  or is that a rather greedy and selfish way to behave .  in my family we just hung up very small socks     said the senior wrangler .     a sugar pig  a toy soldier  a couple of oranges and that was it .  hah  turns out people with whole pillowcases were cornering the market  eh .         shut up and stop squabbling  both of you     said ridcully .     there must be a simple way to check up .  how can you tell if the hogfather exists .         someone   s drunk the sherry  there   s sooty footprints on the carpet  sleigh tracks on the roof and your pillowcase is full of presents     said the dean .      hah  pillowcase     said the senior wrangler darkly .     hah .  i expect your family were the stuck up sort that didn   t even open their presents until after hogswatch dinner  eh .  one of them with a big snooty hogswatch tree in the hall .         what if       ridcully began  but he was too late .      well .     said the dean .     of course we waited until after lunch           you know  it really used to wind me right up  people with big snooty hogswatch trees .  and i just bet you had one of those swanky fancy nutcrackers like a big thumbscrew     said the senior wrangler .     some people had to make do with the coal hammer out of the outhouse  of course .  and had dinner in the middle of the day instead of lah di dah posh dinner in the evening .         i can   t help it if my family had money     said the dean  and that might have defused things a bit had he not added     and standards .         and big pillowcases .     shouted the senior wrangler  bouncing up and down in rage .     and i bet you bought your holly  eh .      the dean raised his eyebrows .     of course .  we didn   t go creeping around the country pinching it out of other people   s hedges  like some people did     he snapped .      that   s traditional .  that   s part of the fun .         celebrating hogswatch with stolen greenery .      ridcully put his hand over his eyes .   the word for this  he had heard  was    cabin fever .     when people had been cooped up for too long in the dark days of the winter  they always tended to get on one another   s nerves  although there was probably a school of thought that would hold that spending your time in a university with more than five thousand known rooms  a huge library  the best kitchens in the city  its own brewery  dairy  extensive wine cellar  laundry  barber shop  cloisters and skittle alley was testing the definition of    cooped up    a little .  mind you  wizards could get on one another   s nerves in opposite corners of a very large field .      just shut up  will you .     he said .     it   s hogswatch .  that   s not the time for silly arguments  all right .         oh  yes it is     said the chair of indefinite studies glumly .     it   s exactly the time for silly arguments .  in our family we were lucky to get through dinner without a reprise of what a shame henry didn   t go into business with our ron .  or why hasn   t anyone taught those kids to use a knife .  that was another favorite .         and the sulks     said ponder stibbons .      oh  the sulks     said the chair of indefinite studies .     not a proper hogswatch without everyone sitting staring at different walls .         the games were worse     said ponder .      worse than the kids hitting one another with their toys  d   you think .  not a proper hogswatch afternoon without wheels and bits of broken dolly everywhere and everyone whining .  assault and battery included .         we had a game called hunt the slipper     said ponder .     someone hid a slipper .  and then we had to find it .  and then we had a row .         it   s not really bad     said the lecturer in recent runes .     i mean  not proper hogswatch bad  unless everyone   s wearing a paper hat .  there   s always that bit  isn   t there  when someone   s horrible great aunt puts on a paper hat and smirks at everyone because she   s being so bohemian .         i   d forgotten about the paper hats     said the chair of indefinite studies .     oh dear .         and then later on someone   ll suggest a board game     said ponder .      that   s right .  where no one exactly remembers all the rules .         which doesn   t stop someone suggesting that you play for pennies .         and five minutes later there   s two people not speaking to one another for the rest of their lives because of tuppence .         and some horrible little kid           i know  i know .  some little kid who   s been allowed to stay up wins everyone   s money by being a nasty little cut throat swot .         right .         er       said ponder  who rather suspected that he had been that child .      and don   t forget the presents     said the chair of indefinite studies  as if reading off some internal list of gloom .     how   how full of potential they seem in all that paper  how pregnant with possibilities   and then you open them and basically the wrapping paper was more interesting and you have to say    how thoughtful  that will come in handy .     it   s not better to give than to receive  in my opinion  it   s just less embarrassing .         i   ve worked out     said the senior wrangler     that over the years i have been a net exporter of hogswatch presents           oh  everyone is     said the chair .     you spend a fortune on other people and what you get when all the paper is cleared away is one slipper that   s the wrong color and a book about ear wax .      ridcully sat in horrified amazement .  he   d always enjoyed hogswatch  every bit of it .  he   d enjoyed seeing ancient relatives  he   d enjoyed the food  he   d been good at games like chase my neighbor up the passage and hooray jolly tinker .  he was always the first to don a paper hat .  he felt that paper hats lent a special festive air to the occasion .  and he always very carefully read the messages on hogswatch cards and found time for a few kind thoughts about the sender .   listening to his wizards was like watching someone kick apart a doll   s house .      at least the hogswatch cracker mottoes are fun    .     he ventured .   they all turned to look at him  and then turned away again .      if you have the sense of humor of a wire coat hanger     said the senior wrangler .      oh dear     said ridcully .     then perhaps there isn   t a hogfather if all you chaps are sitting around with long faces .  he   s not the sort to let people go around being miserable .         ridcully  he   s just some old winter god     said the senior wrangler wearily .     he   s not the cheerful fairy or anything .      the lecturer in recent runes raised his chin from his hands .     what cheerful fairy .         oh  it   s just something my granny used to go on about if it was a wet afternoon and we were getting on her nerves     said the senior wrangler .     she   d say    i   ll call the cheerful fairy if you   re          he stopped  looking guilty .   the archchancellor held a hand to his ear in a theatrical gesture denoting     hush .  what was that i heard .         someone tinkled     he said .     thank you  senior wrangler .         oh  no     the senior wrangler moaned .     no  no  no .      they listened for a moment .      we might have got away with it     said ponder .     i didn   t hear anything           yes  but you can just imagine her  can   t you .     said the dean .     the moment you said it  i had this picture in my mind .  she   s going to have a whole bag of word games  for one thing .  or she   ll suggest we go outdoors for our health .      the wizards shuddered .  they weren   t against the outdoors  it was simply their place in it they objected to .      cheerfulness has always got me down     said the dean .      well  if some wretched little ball of cheerfulness turns up i shan   t have it for one     said the senior wrangler  folding his arms .     i   ve put up with monsters and trolls and big green things with teeth  so i   m not sitting still for any kind of           hello .  .  hello .  .      the voice was the kind of voice that reads suitable stories to children .  every vowel was beautifully rounded .  and they could hear the extra exclamation marks  born of a sort of desperate despairing jollity  slot into place .  they turned .   the cheerful fairy was quite short and plump in a tweed skirt and shoes so sensible they could do their own tax returns  and was pretty much like the first teacher you get at school  the one who has special training in dealing with nervous incontinence and little boys whose contribution to the wonderful world of sharing consists largely of hitting a small girl repeatedly over the head with a wooden horse .  in fact  this picture was helped by the whistle on a string around her neck and a general impression that at any moment she would clap her hands .   the tiny gauzy wings just visible on her back were probably just for show  but the wizards kept on staring at her shoulder .      hello       she said again  but a lot more uncertainly .  she gave them a suspicious look .     you   re rather big boys     she said  as if they   d become so in order to spite her .  she blinked .     it   s my job to chase those blues away     she added  apparently following a memorized script .  then she seemed to rally a bit and went on .     so chins up  everyone  and let   s see a lot of bright shining faces .  .      her gaze met that of the senior wrangler  who had probably never had a bright shining face in his entire life .  he specialized in dull  sullen ones .  the one he was wearing now would have won prizes .      excuse me  madam     said ridcully .     but is that a chicken on your shoulder .         it   s  er  it   s  er  it   s the blue bird of happiness     said the cheerful fairy .  her voice now had the slightly shaking tone of someone who doesn   t quite believe what she has just said but is going to go on saying it anyway  just in case saying it will eventually make it true .      i beg your pardon  but it is a chicken .  a live chicken     said ridcully .     it just went cluck .         it is blue     she said hopelessly .      well  that at least is true     ridcully conceded  as kindly as he could manage .     left to myself  i expect i   d have imagined a slightly more streamlined blue bird of happiness  but i can   t actually fault you there .      the cheerful fairy coughed nervously and fiddled with the buttons on her sensible woolly jumper .      how about a nice game to get us all in the mood .     she said .     a guessing game  perhaps .  or a painting competition .  there may be a small prize for the winner .         madam  we   re wizards     said the senior wrangler .     we don   t do cheerful .         charades .     said the cheerful fairy .     or perhaps you   ve been playing them already .  how about a singsong .  who knows    row row row your boat    .      her bright little smile hit the group scowl of the assembled wizards .     we don   t want to be mr .  grumpy  do we .     she added hopefully .      yes     said the senior wrangler .   the cheerful fairy sagged  and then patted frantically at her shapeless sleeves until she tugged out a balled up handkerchief .  she dabbed at her eyes .      it   s all going wrong again  isn   t it .     she said  her chin trembling .     no one ever wants to be cheerful these days  and i really do try .  i   ve made a joke book and i   ve got three boxes of clothes for charades and   and   and whenever i try to cheer people up they all look embarrassed   and really i do make an effort        she blew her nose loudly .   even the senior wrangler had the grace to look embarrassed .      er       he began .      would it hurt anyone just occasionally to try to be a little bit cheerful .     said the cheerful fairy .      er   in what way .     said the senior wrangler  feeling wretched .      well  there   s so many nice things to be cheerful about     said the cheerful fairy  blowing her nose again .      er   raindrops and sunsets and that sort of thing .     said the senior wrangler  managing some sarcasm  but they could tell his heart wasn   t in it .     er  would you like to borrow my handkerchief .  it   s nearly fresh .         why don   t you get the lady a nice sherry .     said ridcully .     and some corn for her chicken           oh  i never drink alcohol     said the cheerful fairy  horrified .      really .     said ridcully .     we find it   s something to be cheerful about .  mr .  stibbons   would you be so kind as to step over here for a moment .      he beckoned him up close .      there   s got to be a lot of belief sloshing around to let her be created     he said .     she   s a good fourteen stone  if i   m any judge .  if we wanted to contact the hogfather  how would we go about it .  letter up chimney .         yes  but not tonight  sir     said ponder .     he   ll be out delivering .         no telling where he   ll be  then     said ridcully .     blast .         of course  he might not have come here yet     said ponder .      why should he come here .     said ridcully .      the librarian pulled the blankets over himself and curled up .   as an orangutan he hankered for the warmth of the rain forest .  the problem was that he   d never even seen a rain forest  having been turned into an orangutan when he was already a fully grown human .  something in his bones knew about it  though  and didn   t like the cold of winter at all .  but he was also a librarian in those same bones and he flatly refused to allow fires to be lit in the library .  as a result  pillows and blankets went missing everywhere else in the university and ended up in a sort of cocoon in the reference section  in which the ape lurked during the worst of the winter .   he turned over and wrapped himself in the bursar   s curtains .   there was a creaking outside his nest  and some whispering .      no  don   t light the lamp .         i wondered why i hadn   t seen him all evening .         oh  he goes to bed early on hogswatch eve  sir .  here we are        there was some rustling .      we   re in luck .  it hasn   t been filled     said ponder .     looks like he   s used one of the bursar   s .         he puts it up every year .         apparently .         but it   s not as though he   s a child .  a certain childlike simplicity  perhaps .         it might be different for orangutans  archchancellor .         do they do it in the jungle  d   you think .         i don   t imagine so  sir .  no chimneys  for one thing .         and quite short legs  of course .  extremely underfunded in the sock area  orangutans .  they   d be quids in if they could hang up gloves  of course .  hogfather   d be on double shifts if they could hang up their gloves .  on account of the length of their arms .         very good  archchancellor .         i say  what   s this on the   my word  a glass of sherry .  well  waste not  want not .     there was a damp glugging noise in the darkness .      i think that was supposed to be for the hogfather  sir .         and the banana .         i imagine that   s been left out for the pigs  sir .         pigs .         oh  you know  sir .  tusker and snouter and gouger and rooter .  i mean     ponder stopped  conscious that a grown man shouldn   t be able to remember this sort of thing     that   s what children believe .         bananas for pigs .  that   s not traditional  is it .  i   d have thought acorns  perhaps .  or apples or swedes .         yes  sir  but the librarian likes bananas  sir .         very nourishin    fruit  mr .  stibbons .         yes  sir .  although  funnily enough it   s not actually a fruit  sir .         really .         yes  sir .  botanically  it   s a type of fish  sir .  according to my theory it   s cladistically associated with the krullian pipefish  sir  which of course is also yellow and goes around in bunches or shoals .         and lives in trees .         well  not usually  sir .  the banana is obviously exploiting a new niche .         good heavens  really .  it   s a funny thing  but i   ve never much liked bananas and i   ve always been a bit suspicious of fish  too .  that   d explain it .         yes  sir .         do they attack swimmers .         not that i   ve heard  sir .  of course  they may be clever enough to only attack swimmers who   re far from land .         what  you mean sort of   high up .  in the trees  as it were .         possibly  sir .         cunning  eh .         yes  sir .         well  we might as well make ourselves comfortable  mr .  stibbons .         yes  sir .      a match flared in the darkness as ridcully lit his pipe .      the ankh morpork wassailers had practiced for weeks .   the custom was referred to by anaglypta huggs  organizer of the best and most select group of the city   s singers  as an occasion for fellowship and good cheer .   one should always be wary of people who talk unashamedly of    fellowship and good cheer    as if it were something that can be applied to life like a poultice .  turn your back for a moment and they may well organize a maypole dance and  frankly  there   s no option then but to try and make it to the tree line .   the singers were halfway down park lane now  and halfway through    the red rosy hen    in marvelous harmony .   their collecting tins were already full of donations for the poor of the city  or at least those sections of the poor who in mrs .  huggs   s opinion were suitably picturesque and not too smelly and could be relied upon to say thank you .  people had come to their doors to listen .  orange light spilled onto the snow .  candle lanterns glowed among the tumbling flakes .  if you could have taken the lid off the scene  there would have been chocolates inside .  or at least an interesting biscuit assortment .   mrs .  huggs had heard that wassailing was an ancient ritual  and you didn   t need anyone to tell you what that meant  but she felt she   d carefully removed all those elements that would affront the refined ear .   and it was only gradually that the singers became aware of the discord .   around the corner  slipping and sliding on the ice  came another band of singers .   some people march to a different drummer .  the drummer in question here must have been trained elsewhere  possibly by a different species on another planet .   in front of the group was a legless man on a small wheeled trolley  who was singing at the top of his voice and banging two saucepans together .  his name was arnold sideways .  pushing him along was coffin henry  whose croaking progress through an entirely different song was punctuated by bouts of off the beat coughing .  he was accompanied by a perfectly ordinary looking man in torn  dirty and yet expensive clothing  whose pleasant tenor voice was drowned out by the quacking of a duck on his head .  he answered to the name of duck man  although he never seemed to understand why  or why he was always surrounded by people who seemed to see ducks where no ducks could be .  and finally  being towed along by a small gray dog on a string  was foul ole ron  generally regarded in ankh morpork as the deranged beggars    deranged beggar .  he was probably incapable of singing  but at least he was attempting to swear in time to the beat  or beats .   the wassailers stopped and watched them in horror .   neither party noticed  as the beggars oozed and ambled up the street  that little smears of black and gray were spiraling out of drains and squeezing out from under tiles and buzzing off into the night .  people have always had the urge to sing and clang things at the dark stub of the year  when all sorts of psychic nastiness has taken advantage of the long gray days and the deep shadows to lurk and breed .  lately people had taken to singing harmoniously  which rather lost the effect .  those who really understood just clanged something and shouted .   the beggars were not in fact this well versed in folkloric practice .  they were just making a din in the well founded hope that people would give them money to stop .   it was just possible to make out a consensus song in there somewhere .          hogswatch is coming   the pig is getting fat   please put a dollar in the old man   s hat  if you ain   t got a dollar a penny will do               and if you ain   t got a penny     foul ole ron yodeled  solo     then   fghfgh yffg mfmfmf        the duck man had  with great presence of mind  clamped a hand over ron   s mouth .      so sorry about this     he said     but this time i   d like people not to slam their doors on us .  and it doesn   t scan  anyway .      the nearby doors slammed regardless .  the other wassailers fled hastily to a more salubrious location .  goodwill to all men was a phrase coined by someone who hadn   t met foul ole ron .   the beggars stopped singing  except for arnold sideways  who tended to live in his own small world .         nobody knows how good we can live  on boots three times a day        then the change in the air penetrated even his consciousness .   snow thumped off the trees as a contrary wind brushed them .  there was a whirl of flakes and it was just possible  since the beggars did not always have their mental compasses pointing due real  that they heard a brief snatch of conversation .      it just ain   t that simple  master  that   s all i   m saying        it is better to give than to receive  albert .      no  master  it   s just a lot more expensive .  you can   t just go around        things rained down on the snow .   the beggars looked at them .  arnold sideways carefully picked up a sugar pig and bit its nose off .  foul ole ron peered suspiciously into a cracker that had bounced off his hat  and then shook it against his ear .   the duck man opened a bag of sweets .      ah  humbugs .     he said .   coffin henry unlooped a string of sausages from around his neck .      buggrit .     said foul ole ron .      it   s a cracker     said the dog  scratching its ear .     you pull it .      ron waved the cracker aimlessly by one end .      oh  give it here     said the dog  and gripped the other end in its teeth .      my word     said the duck man  fishing in a snow drift .     here   s a whole roast pig .  and a big dish of roast potatoes  miraculously uncracked .  and   look   isn   t this caviar in the jar .  asparagus .  potted shrimp .  my goodness .  what were we going to have for hogswatch dinner  arnold .         old boots     said arnold .  he opened a fallen box of cigars and licked them .      just old boots .         oh  no .  stuffed with mud  and with roast mud .     s good mud  too .  i bin saving it up .         now we can have a merry feast of goose .         all right .  can we stuff it with old boots .      there was a pop from the direction of the cracker .  they heard foul ole ron   s thinking brain dog growl .      no  no  no  you put the hat on your head and you read the hum   rous mottar .         millennium hand and shrimp .     said ron  passing the scrap of paper to the duck man .  the duck man was regarded as the intellectual of the group .   he peered at the motto .      ah  yes  let   s see now   it says    help help help ive fallen in the crakker machine i cant keep runin on this roller please get me ou          he turned the paper over a few times .     that appears to be it  except for the stains .         always the same ole mottars     said the dog .     someone slap ron on the back  will you .  if he laughs any more he   ll   oh  he has .  oh  well  nothing new about that .      the beggars spent a few more minutes picking up hams  jars and bottles that had settled on the snow .  they packed them around arnold on his trolley and set off down the street .      how come we got all this .            s hogswatch  right .         yeah  but who hung up their stocking .         i don   t think we   ve got any  have we .         i hung up an old boot .         does that count .         dunno .  ron ate it .         i   m waiting for the hogfather  thought ponder stibbons .  i   m in the dark waiting for the hogfather .  me .  a believer in natural philosophy .  i can find the square root of    .   in my head .   i shouldn   t be doing this .   it   s not as if i   ve hung a stocking up .  there   d be some point if     he sat rigid for a moment  and then pulled off his pointy sandal and rolled down a sock .  it helped if you thought of it as the scientific testing of an interesting hypothesis .   from out of the darkness ridcully said     how long  do you think .         it   s generally believed that all deliveries are completed well before midnight     said ponder  and tugged hard .      are you all right  mr .  stibbons .         fine  sir .  fine .  er   do you happen to have a drawing pin about you .  or a small nail  perhaps .         i don   t believe so .         oh  it   s all right .  i   ve found a penknife .      after a while ridcully heard a faint scratching noise in the dark .      how do you spell    electricity     sir .      ridcully thought for a while .     you know  i don   t think i ever do .      there was silence again  and then a clang .  the librarian grunted in his sleep .      what are you doing .         i just knocked over the coal shovel .         why are you feeling around on the mantelpiece .         oh  just   you know  just   just looking .  a little   experiment .  after all  you never know .         you never know what .         just   never know  you know .         sometimes you know     said ridcully .     i think i know quite a lot that i didn   t used to know .  it   s amazing what you do end up knowing  i sometimes think .  i often wonder what new stuff i   ll know .         well  you never know .         that   s a fact .         high over the city albert turned to death  who seemed to be trying to avoid his gaze .      you didn   t get that stuff out of the sack .  not cigars and peaches in brandy and grub with fancy foreign names .      yes  it came out of the sack .   albert gave him a suspicious look .      but you put it in the sack in the first place  didn   t you .      no .      you did  didn   t you .     albert stated .   no .      you put all those things in the sack .      no .      you got them from somewhere and put them in the sack .      no .      you did put them in the sack  didn   t you .      no .      you put them in the sack .      yes .      i knew you put them in the sack .  where did you get them .      they were just lying around .      whole roast pig does not  in my experience  just lie around .      no one seemed to be using them  albert .      couple of chimneys ago we were over that big posh restaurant        really .  i don   t remember .      and it seemed to me you were down there a bit longer than usual  if you don   t mind me saying so .      really .      how exactly were they just quote lying around unquote comma .      just   lying around .  you know .  recumbent .      in a kitchen .      there was a certain culinariness about the place  i recall .   albert pointed a trembling finger .      you nicked someone   s hogswatch dinner  master .      it   s going to be eaten  said death defensively .  anyway  you thought it was a good idea when i showed that king the door .      yeah  well  that was a bit different     said albert  lowering his voice .     but  i mean  the hogfather doesn   t drop down the chimney and pinch people   s grub .      the beggars will enjoy it  albert .      well  yes  but        it wasn   t stealing .  it was just   redistribution .  it will be a good deed in a naughty world .      no  it won   t .      then it will be a naughty deed in a naughty world and will pass completely unnoticed .      yeah  but you might at least have thought about the people whose grub you pinched .      they have been provided for  of course .  i am not completely heartless .  in a metaphorical sense .  and now   onward and upward .      we   re heading down  master .      onward and downward  then .      there were   swirls .  binky galloped easily through them  except that he did not seem to move .  he might have been hanging in the air .      oh  me     said the oh god weakly .      what .     said susan .      try shutting your eyes        susan shut her eyes .  then she reached up to touch her face .      i   m still seeing           i thought it was just me .  it   s usually just me .      the swirls vanished .   there was greenery below .   and that was odd .  it was greenery .  susan had flown a few times over countryside  even swamps and jungles  and there had never been a green as green as this .  if green could be a primary color  this was it .   and that wiggly thing        that   s not a river .     she said .      isn   t it .         it   s blue .      the oh god risked a look down .      water   s blue     he said .      of course it   s not .         grass is green  water   s blue   i can remember that .  it   s some of the stuff i just know .         well  in a way       susan hesitated .  everyone knew grass was green and water was blue .  quite often it wasn   t true  but everyone knew it in the same way they knew the sky was blue  too .   she made the mistake of looking up as she thought that .   there was the sky .  it was  indeed  blue .  and down there was the land .  it was green .   and in between was nothing .  not white space .  not black night .  just   nothing  all round the edges of the world .  where the brain said there should be  well  sky and land  meeting neatly at the horizon  there was simply a void that sucked at the eyeball like a loose tooth .   and there was the sun .   it was under the sky  floating above the land .   and it was yellow .   buttercup yellow .   binky landed on the grass beside the river .  or at least on the green .  it felt more like sponge  or moss .  he nuzzled it .   susan slid off  trying to keep her gaze low .  that meant she was looking at the vivid blue of the water .   there were orange fish in it .  they didn   t look quite right  as if they   d been created by someone who really did think a fish was two curved lines and a dot and a triangular tail .  they reminded her of the skeletal fish in death   s quiet pool .  fish that were   appropriate to their surroundings .  and she could see them  even though the water was just a block of color which part of her insisted ought to be opaque     she knelt down and dipped her hand in .  it felt like water  but what poured through her fingers was liquid blue .   and now she knew where she was .  the last piece clicked into place and the knowledge bloomed inside her .  she knew if she saw a house just how its windows would be placed  and just how the smoke would come out of the chimney .   there would almost certainly be apples on the trees .  and they would be red  because everyone knew that apples were red .  and the sun was yellow .  and the sky was blue .  and the grass was green .   but there was another world  called the real world by the people who believed in it  where the sky could be anything from off white to sunset red to thunderstorm yellow .  and the trees would be anything from bare branches  mere scribbles against the sky  to red flames before the frost .  and the sun was white or yellow or orange .  and water was brown and gray and green     the colors here were springtime colors  and not the springtime of the world .  they were the colors of the springtime of the eye .      this is a child   s painting     she said .   the oh god slumped onto the green .      every time i look at the gap my eyes water     he mumbled .     i feel awful .         i said this is a child   s painting     said susan .      oh  me   i think the wizards    potion is wearing off           i   ve seen dozens of pictures of it     said susan  ignoring him .     you put the sky overhead because the sky   s above you and when you are a couple of feet high there   s not a lot of sideways to the sky in any case .  and everyone tells you grass is green and water is blue .  this is the landscape you paint .  twyla paints like that .  i painted like that .  grandfather saved some of        she stopped .      all children do it  anyway     she muttered .     come on  let   s find the house .         what house .     the oh god moaned .     and can you speak quieter  please .         there   ll be a house     said susan  standing up .     there   s always a house .  with four windows .  and the smoke coming out of the chimney all curly like a spring .  look  this is a place like gr   death   s country .  it   s not really geography .      the oh god walked over to the nearest tree and banged his head on it as if he hoped it was going to hurt .      feels like geo   fy     he muttered .      but have you ever seen a tree like that .  a big green blob on a brown stick .  it looks like a lollipop .     said susan  pulling him along .      dunno .  firs    time i ever saw a tree .  arrgh .  somethin    dropped on m   head .     he blinked owlishly at the ground .        s red .         it   s an apple     she said .  she sighed .     everyone knows apples are red .      there were no bushes .  but there were flowers  each with a couple of green leaves .  they grew individually  dotted around the rolling green .   and then they were out of the trees and there  by a bend in the river  was the house .   it didn   t look very big .  there were four windows and a door .  corkscrew smoke curled out of the chimney .      you know  it   s a funny thing     said susan  staring at it .     twyla draws houses like that .  and she practically lives in a mansion .  i drew houses like that .  and i was born in a palace .  why .         p   raps it   s all this house     muttered the oh god miserably .      what .  you really think so .  kids    paintings are all of this place .  it   s in our heads .         don   t ask me  i was just making conversation     said the oh god .   susan hesitated .  the words what now .  loomed .  should she just go and knock .   and she realized that was normal thinking        in the glittering  clattering  chattering atmosphere a head waiter was having a difficult time .  there were a lot of people in  and the staff should have been fully stretched  putting bicarbonate of soda in the white wine to make very expensive bubbles and cutting the vegetables very small to make them cost more .   instead they were standing in a dejected group in the kitchen .      where did it all go .     screamed the manager .     someone   s been through the cellar  too .         william said he felt a cold wind     said the waiter .  he   d been backed up against a hot plate  and now knew why it was called a hot plate in a way he hadn   t fully comprehended before .      i   ll give him a cold wind .  haven   t we got anything .         there   s odds and ends           you don   t mean odds and ends  you mean des curieux et des bouts     corrected the manager .      yeah  right  yeah .  and  er  and  er           there   s nothing else .         er   old boots .  muddy old boots .         old    .         boots .  lots of    em     said the waiter .  he felt he was beginning to singe .      how come we   ve got   vintage footwear .         dunno .  they just turned up  sir .  the oven   s full of old boots .  so   s the pantry .         there   s a hundred people booked in .  all the shops   ll be shut .  where   s chef .         william   s trying to get him to come out of the privy  sir .  he   s locked himself in and is having one of his moments .         something   s cooking .  what   s that i can smell .         me  sir .         old boots       muttered the manager .     old boots   old boots   leather  are they .  not clogs or rubber or anything .         looks like   just boots .  and lots of mud  sir .      the manager took off his jacket .     all right .  got any cream  have we .  onions .  garlic .  butter .  some old beef bones .  a bit of pastry .         er  yes        the manager rubbed his hands together .     right     he said  taking an apron off a hook .     you there  get some water boiling .  lots of water .  and find a really large hammer .  and you  chop some onions .  the rest of you  start sorting out the boots .  i want the tongues out and the soles off .  we   ll do them   let   s see   mousse de la boue dans une panier de la p  te de chaussures           where   re we going to get that from  sir .         mud mousse in a basket of shoe pastry .  get the idea .  it   s not our fault if even quirmians don   t understand restaurant quirmian .  it   s not like lying  after all .         well  it   s a bit like       the waiter began .  he   d been cursed with honesty at an early stage .      then there   s brodequin r  ti fa  on ombres       the manager sighed at the head waiter   s panicky expression .     soldier   s boot done in the shades fashion     he translated .      er   shades fashion .         in mud .  but if we cook the tongues separately we can put on languette brais  e  too .         there   s some ladies    shoes  sir     said an underchef .      right .  add to the menu   let   s see now   sole d   une bonne femme   and   yes   servis dans un coulis de terre en l   eau .  that   s mud  to you .         what about the laces  sir .     said another underchef .      good thinking .  dig out that recipe for spaghetti carbonara .         sir .     said the head waiter .      i started off as a chef     said the manager  picking up a knife .     how do you think i was able to afford this place .  i know how it   s done .  get the look and the sauce right and you   re three quarters there .         but it   s all going to be old boots .     said the waiter .      prime aged beef     the manager corrected him .     it   ll tenderize in no time .         anyway   anyway   we haven   t got any soup           mud .  and a lot of onions .         there   s the puddings           mud .  let   s see if we can get it to caramelize  you never know .         i can   t even find the coffee   still  they probably won   t last till the coffee           mud .  caf   de terre     said the manager firmly .     genuine ground coffee .         oh  they   ll spot that  sir .         they haven   t up till now     said the manager darkly .      we   ll never get away with it  sir .  never .         in the country of the sky on top  medium dave lilywhite hauled another bag of money down the stairs .      there must be thousands here     said chickenwire .      hundreds of thousands     said medium dave .      and what   s all this stuff .     said catseye  opening a box .        s just paper .     he tossed it aside .   medium dave sighed .  he was all for class solidarity  but sometimes catseye got on his nerves .      they   re title deeds     he said .     and they   re better than money .         paper   s better   n money .     said catseye .     hah  if you can burn it you can   t spend it  that   s what i say .         hang on     said chickenwire .     i know about them .  the tooth fairy owns property .         got to raise money somehow     said medium dave .     all those half dollars under the pillow .         if we steal them  do they become ours .         is that a trick question .     said catseye  smirking .      yeah  but   ten thousand each doesn   t sound such a lot  when you see all this .         he won   t miss a           gentlemen        they turned .  teatime was in the doorway .      we were just   we were just piling up the stuff     said chickenwire .      yes .  i know .  i told you to .         right .  that   s right .  you did     said chickenwire gratefully .      and there   s such a lot     said teatime .  he gave them a smile .  catseye coughed .         s got to be thousands     said medium dave .     and what about all these deeds and so on .  look  this one   s for that pipe shop in honey trap lane .  in ankh morpork .  i buy my tobacco there .  old thimble is always moaning about the rent  too .         ah .  so you opened the strongboxes     said teatime pleasantly .      well   yes           fine .  fine     said teatime .     i didn   t ask you to  but   fine  fine .  and how did you think the tooth fairy made her money .  little gnomes in some mine somewhere .  fairy gold .  but that turns to trash in the morning .      he laughed .  chickenwire laughed .  even medium dave laughed .  and then teatime was on him  pushing him irresistibly backward until he hit the wall .   there was a blur and he tried to blink and his left eyelid was suddenly a rose of pain .   teatime   s good eye was close to him  if you could call it good .  the pupil was a dot .  medium dave could just make out his hand  right by medium dave   s face .   it was holding a knife .  the point of the blade could only be the merest fraction of an inch from medium dave   s right eye .      i know people say i   d kill them as soon as look at them     whispered teatime .     and in fact i   d much rather kill you than look at you  mr .  lilywhite .  you stand in a castle of gold and plot to steal pennies .  oh  dear .  what am i to do with you .      he relaxed a little  but his hand still held the knife to medium dave   s unblinking eye .      you   re thinking that banjo is going to help you     he said .     that   s how it   s always been  isn   t it .  but banjo likes me .  he really does .  banjo is my friend .      medium dave managed to focus beyond teatime   s ear .  his brother was just standing there  with the blank face he had while he waited for another order or a new thought to turn up .      if i thought you were feeling bad thoughts about me i would be so downcast     said teatime .     i do not have many friends left  mr .  medium dave .      he stood back and smiled happily .     all friends now .     he said  as medium dave slumped down .     help him  banjo .      on cue  banjo lumbered forward .      banjo has the heart of a little child     said teatime  the knife disappearing somewhere about his clothing .     i believe i have  too .      the others were frozen in place .  they hadn   t moved since the attack .  medium dave was a heavyset man and teatime was a matchstick model  but he   d lifted medium dave off his feet like a feather .      as far as the money goes  in fact  i really have no use for it     said teatime  sitting down on a sack of silver .     it is small change .  you may share it out amongst yourselves  and no doubt you   ll squabble and double cross one another more tiresomely .  oh dear .  it is so awful when friends fall out .      he kicked the sack .  it split .  silver and copper fell in an expensive trickle .      and you   ll swagger and spend it on drink and women     he said  as they watched the coins roll into every corner of the room .     the thought of investment will never cross your scarred little minds        there was a rumble from banjo .  even teatime waited patiently until the huge man had assembled a sentence .  the result was      i gotta piggy bank .         and what would you do with a million dollars  banjo .     said teatime .   another rumble .  banjo   s face twisted up .      buy   a   bigger piggy bank .         well done .     the assassin stood up .     let   s go and see how our wizard is getting on  shall we .      he walked out of the room without looking back .  after a moment banjo followed .   the others tried not to look at one another   s faces .  then chickenwire said     was he saying we could take the money and go .         don   t be bloody stupid  we wouldn   t get ten yards     said medium dave  still clutching his face .     ugh  this hurts .  i think he cut the eyelid   he cut the damn eyelid           then let   s just leave the stuff and go .  i never joined up to ride on tigers .         and what   ll you do when he comes after you .         why   d he bother with the likes of us .         he   s got time for his friends     said medium dave bitterly .     for gods    sakes  someone get me a clean rag or something           okay  but   but he can   t look everywhere .      medium dave shook his head .  he   d been through ankh morpork   s very own university of the streets and had graduated with his life and an intelligence made all the keener by constant friction .  you only had to look into teatime   s mismatched eyes to know one thing  which was this  that if teatime wanted to find you he would not look everywhere .  he   d look in only one place  which would be the place where you were hiding .      how come your brother likes him so much .      medium dave grimaced .  banjo had always done what he was told  simply because medium dave had told him .  up to now  anyway .   it must have been that punch in the bar .  medium dave didn   t like to think about it .  he   d always promised their mother that he   d look after banjo   and banjo had gone back like a falling tree .  and when medium dave had risen from his seat to punch teatime   s unbalanced lights out he   d suddenly found the assassin already behind him  holding a knife .  in front of everyone .  it was humiliating  that   s what it was     and then banjo had sat up  looking puzzled  and spat out a tooth        if it wasn   t for banjo going around with him all the time we could gang up on him     said catseye .   medium dave looked up  one hand clamping a handkerchief to his eye .      gang up on him .     he said .      yeah  it   s all your fault     chickenwire went on .      oh  yeah .  so it wasn   t you who said  wow  ten thousand dollars  count me in .      chickenwire backed away .     i didn   t know there was going to be all this creepy stuff .  i want to go home .      medium dave hesitated  despite his pain and rage .  this wasn   t normal talk for chickenwire  for all that he whined and grumbled .  this was a strange place  no lie about that  and all that business with the teeth had been very   odd  but he   d been out with chickenwire when jobs had gone wrong and both the watch and the thieves    guild had been after them and he   d been as cool as anyone .  and if the guild had been the ones to catch them they   d have nailed their ears to their ankles and thrown them in the river .  in medium dave   s book  which was a simple book and largely written in mental crayon  things didn   t get creepier than that .      what   s up with you .     he said .     all of you   you   re acting like little kids .            would he deliver to apes earlier than humans .         interesting point  sir .  possibly you   re referring to my theory that humans may have in fact descended from apes  of course     said ponder .     a bold hypothesis which ought to sweep away the ignorance of centuries if the grants committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat and sail around to the islands of           i just thought he might deliver alphabetically     said ridcully .   there was a patter of soot in the cold fireplace .      that   s presumably him now  do you think .     ridcully went on .     oh  well  i thought we should check        something landed in the ashes .  the two wizards stood quietly in the darkness while the figure picked itself up .  there was a rustle of paper .   let me see now     there was a click as ridcully   s pipe fell out of his mouth .      who the hell are you .     he said .     mr .  stibbons  light a candle .      death backed away .   i   m the hogfather  of course .  er .  ho .  ho .  ho .  who would you expect to come down a chimney on a night like this  may i ask .      no  you   re not .      i am .  look  i   ve got the beard and the pillow and everything .      you look extremely thin in the face .      i   m   i   i   m not well .  it   s all   yes  it   s all this sherry .  and rushing around .  i am a bit ill .      terminally  i should say .     ridcully grabbed the beard .  there was a twang as the string gave way .      it   s a false beard .      no  it   s not  said death desperately .      here   s the hooks for the ears  which must have given you a bit of trouble  i must say .      ridcully flourished the incriminating evidence .      what were you doing coming down the chimney .     he continued .     not in marvelous taste  i think .      death waved a small grubby scrap of paper defensively .   official letter to the hogfather .  says here   he began  and then looked at the paper again .  well  quite a lot  in fact .  it   s a long list .  library stamps  reference books  pencils  bananas        the librarian asked the hogfather for those things .     said ridcully .     why .      i don   t know  said death .  this was a diplomatic answer .  he kept his finger over a reference to the archchancellor .  the orangutan for    duck   s bottom    was quite an interesting squiggle .      i   ve got plenty in my desk drawer     mused ridcully .     i   m quite happy to give them out to any chap provided he can prove he   s used up the old one .      they must show you an absence of pencil .      of course .  if he needed essential materials he need only have come to me .  no man can tell you i   m an unreasonable chap .      death checked the list carefully .   that is precisely correct  he confirmed  with anthropological exactitude .      except for the bananas  of course .  i wouldn   t keep fish in my desk .      death looked down at the list and then back up at ridcully .   good .  he said  in the hope that this was the right response .   wizards know when they are going to die .   ridcully had no such premonitions  and to ponder   s horror prodded death in the cushion .      why you .     he said .     what   s happened to the other fellow .      i suppose i must tell you .      in the house of death  a whisper of shifting sand and the faintest chink of moving glass  somewhere in the darkness of the floor     and  in the dry shadows  the sharp smell of snow and a thud of hooves .      sideney almost swallowed his tongue when teatime appeared beside him .      are we making progress .         gnk           i   m sorry .     said teatime .   sideney recovered himself .     er   some     he said .     we think we   ve worked out   er   one lock .      light gleamed off teatime   s eye .      i believe there are seven of them .     said the assassin .      yes  but   they   re half magic and half real and half not there   i mean   there   s parts of them that don   t exist all the time        mr .  brown  who had been working at one of the locks  laid down his pick .         t   s no good  mister     he said .     can   t even get a purchase with a crowbar .  maybe if i went back to the city and got a couple of dragons we could do something .  you can melt through steel with them if you twist their necks right and feed    em carbon .         i was told you were the best locksmith in the city     said teatime .   behind him  banjo shifted position .   mr .  brown looked annoyed        well  yes     he said .     but locks don   t generally alter    emselves while you   re working on    em  that   s what i   m saying .         and i thought you could open any lock anyone ever made     said teatime .      made by humans     said mr .  brown sharply .     and most dwarfs .  i dunno what made these .  you never said anything about magic .         that   s a shame     said teatime .     then really i have no more need of your services .  you may as well go back home .         i won   t be sorry .     mr .  brown started putting things back into his tool bag .     what about my money .         do i owe you any .         i came along with you .  i don   t see it   s my fault that this is all magic business .  i should get something .         ah  yes  i see your point     said teatime .     of course  you should get what you deserve .  banjo .      banjo lumbered forward  and then stopped .   mr .  brown   s hand had come out of the bag holding a crowbar .      you must think i was born yesterday  you slimy little bugger     he said .     i know your type .  you think it   s all some kind of game .  you make little jokes to yourself and you think no one else notices and you think you   re so smart .  well  mr .  teacup  i   m leaving  right .  right now .  with what   s coming to me .  and you ain   t stopping me .  and banjo certainly ain   t .  i knew old ma lilywhite back in the good old days .  you think you   re nasty .  you think you   re mean .  ma lilywhite   d tear your ears off and spit    em in your eye  you cocky little devil .  and i worked with her  so you don   t scare me and nor does little banjo  poor sod that he is .      mr .  brown glared at each of them in turn  flourishing the crowbar .  sideney cowered in front of the doors .   he saw teatime nod gracefully  as if the man had made a small speech of thanks .      i appreciate your point of view     said teatime .     and  i have to repeat  it   s teh ah tim eh .  now  please  banjo .      banjo loomed over mr .  brown  reached down and lifted him up by the crowbar so sharply that his feet came out of his boots .      here  you know me  banjo .     the locksmith croaked  struggling in midair .     i remembers you when you was little  i used to sit you on my knee  i often used to work for your ma           d   you like apples .     banjo rumbled .   brown struggled .      you got to say yes     banjo said .      yes .         d   you like pears .  you got to say yes .         all right  yes .         d   you like falling down the stairs .         medium dave held up his hands for quiet .   he glared at the gang .      this place is getting to you  right .  but we   ve all been in bad places before  right .         not this bad     said chickenwire .     i   ve never been anywhere where it hurts to look at the sky .  it give me the creeps .         chick   s a little baby  nyer nyer nyer     sang catseye .   they looked at him .  he coughed nervously .      sorry   don   t know why i said that           if we stick together we   ll be fine           eeeny meeny miney mo       mumbled catseye .      what .  what are you talking about .         sorry   it just sort of slipped out           what i   m trying to say     said medium dave     is that if           peachy keeps making faces at me .         i didn   t .         liar  liar  pants on fire .      two things happened at this point .  medium dave lost his temper  and peachy screamed .   a small wisp of smoke was rising from his trousers .   he hopped around  beating desperately at himself .      who did that .  who did that .     demanded medium dave .      i didn   t see anyone     said chickenwire .     i mean  no one was near him .  catseye said    pants on fire    and next minute           now he   s sucking his thumb .     catseye jeered .     nyer nyer nyer .  crying for mummy .  you know what happens to kids who suck their thumbs  there   s this big monster with scissors all           will you stop talking like that .     shouted medium dave .     blimey  it is like dealing with a bunch of        someone screamed  high above .  it went on for a while and seemed to be getting nearer  but then it stopped and was replaced by a rush of thumping and an occasional sound like a coconut being bounced on a stone floor .   medium dave got to the door just in time to see the body of mr .  brown the locksmith tumble past  moving quite fast and not at all neatly .  a moment later his bag somersaulted around the curve of the stairs .  it split as it bounced and there was a jangle as tools and lock picks bounced out and followed their late owner .   he   d been moving quite fast .  he   d probably roll all the way to the bottom .   medium dave looked up .  two turns above him  on the opposite side of the huge shaft  banjo was watching him .   banjo didn   t know right from wrong .  he   d always left that sort of thing to his brother .      er   poor guy must   ve slipped     medium dave mumbled .      oh  yeah   slipped     said peachy .   he looked up  too .   it was funny .  he hadn   t noticed them before .  the white tower had seemed to glow from within .  but now there were shadows  moving across the stone .  in the stone .      what was that .     he said .     that sound           what sound .         it sounded   like knives scraping     said peachy .     really close .         there   s only us here .     said medium dave .     what   re you afraid of .  attack by daisies .  come on   let   s go and help him           she couldn   t walk through the door .  it simply resisted any such effort .  she ended up merely bruised .  so susan turned the doorknob instead .   she heard the oh god gasp .  but she was used to the idea of buildings that were bigger on the inside .  her grandfather had never been able to get a handle on dimensions .   the second thing the eye was drawn to were the staircases .  they started opposite one another in what was now a big round tower  its ceiling lost in the haze .  the spirals circled into infinity .   susan   s eyes went back to the first thing .   it was a large conical heap in the middle of the floor .   it was white .  it glistened in the cool light that shone down from the mists .      it   s teeth     she said .      i think i   m going to throw up     said the oh god miserably .      there   s nothing that scary about teeth     said susan .  she didn   t mean it .  the heap was very horrible indeed .      did i say i was scared .  i   m just hung over again   oh  me        susan advanced on the heap  moving warily .   they were small teeth .  children   s teeth .  whoever had piled them up hadn   t been very careful about it  either .  a few had been scattered across the floor .  she knew because she trod on one  and the slippery little crunching sound made her desperate not to tread on any more .   whoever had piled them up had presumably been the one who   d drawn the chalk marks around the obscene heap .      there   re so many     whispered bilious .      at least twenty million  given the size of the average milk tooth     said susan .  she was shocked to find that it came almost automatically .      how can you possibly know that .         volume of a cone     said susan .     pi times the square of the radius times the height divided by three .  i bet miss butts never thought it   d come in handy in a place like this .         that   s amazing .  you did it in your head .         this isn   t right     said susan quietly .     i don   t think this is what the tooth fairy is all about .  all that effort to get the teeth  and then just to dump them like this .  no .  anyway  there   s a cigarette end on the floor .  i don   t see the tooth fairy as someone who rolls her own .      she stared down at the chalk marks .   voices high above her made her look up .  she thought she saw a head look over the stair rail  and then draw back again .  she didn   t see much of the face  but what she saw didn   t look fairylike .   she glanced back at the circle of chalk around the teeth .  someone had wanted all the teeth in one place and had drawn a circle to show people where they had to go .   there were a few symbols scrawled around the circle .   she had a good memory for small details .  it was another family trait .  and a small detail stirred in her memory like a sleepy bee .      oh  no     she breathed .     surely no one would try to        someone shouted  someone up in the whiteness .   a body rolled down the stairs nearest her .  it had been a skinny  middle aged man .  technically it still was  but the long spiral staircase had not been kind .   it tumbled across the white marble and slid to a boneless halt .   then  as she hurried toward the body  it faded away  leaving nothing behind but a smear of blood .   a jingle noise made her look back up the stairs .  spinning over and over  making salmon leaps in the air  a crowbar bounded over the last dozen steps and landed point first on a flagstone  staying upright and vibrating .      chickenwire reached the top of the stairs  panting .      there   s people down there  mister teatime .     he wheezed .     dave and the others   ve gone down to catch them  mister teatime .         teh ah tim eh     said teatime  without taking his eyes off the wizard .      that   s right  sir .         well .     said teatime .     just   do away with them .         er   one of them   s a girl  sir .      teatime still didn   t look round .  he waved a hand vaguely .      then do away with them politely .         yes  mister   yes  right       chickenwire coughed .     don   t you want to find out why they   re here  sir .         good heavens  no .  why should i want to do that .  now go away .      chickenwire stood there for a moment  and then hurried off .   as he scurried down the stairs he thought he heard a creak  as of an ancient wooden door .   he went pale .   it was just a door  said the sensible bit in front of his brain .  there were hundreds of them in this place  although  come to think of it  none of them had creaked .   the other bit  the bit that hung around in dark places nearly at the top of his spinal column  said  but it   s not one of them  and you know it  because you know which door it really is     he hadn   t heard that creak for thirty years .   he gave a little yelp and started to take the stairs four at a time .   in the hollows and corners  the shadows grew darker .      susan ran up a flight of stairs  dragging the oh god behind her .      do you know what they   ve been doing .     she said .     you know why they   ve got all those teeth in a circle .  the power   oh  my              i   m not going to     said the head waiter  firmly .      look  i   ll buy you a better pair after hogswatch           there   s two more shoe pastry  one for pur  e de la terre and three more tourte    la boue     said a waiter  hurrying in .      mud pies .     moaned the waiter .     i can   t believe we   re selling mud pies .  and now you want my boots .         with cream and sugar  mind you .  a real taste of ankh morpork .  and we can get at least four helpings off those boots .  fair   s fair .  we   re all in our socks           table seven says the steaks were lovely but a bit tough     said a waiter  rushing past .      right .  use a larger hammer next time and boil them for longer .     the manager turned back to the suffering head waiter .     look  bill     he said  taking him by the shoulder .     this isn   t food .  no one expects it to be food .  if people wanted food they   d stay at home  isn   t that so .  they come here for ambiance .  for the experience .  this isn   t cookery  bill .  this is cuisine .  see .  and they   re coming back for more .         yeah  but old boots           dwarfs eat rats     said the manager .     and trolls eat rocks .  there   s folks in howondaland that eat insects and folks on the counterweight continent eat soup made out of bird spit .  at least the boots have been on a cow .         and mud .     said the head waiter  gloomily .      isn   t there an old proverb that says a man must eat a bushel of dirt before he dies .         yes  but not all at once .         bill .     said the manager  kindly  picking up a spatula .      yes  boss .         get those damn boots off right now  will you .         when chickenwire reached the bottom of the tower he was trembling  and not just from the effort .  he headed straight for the door until medium dave grabbed him .      let me out .  it   s after me .         look at his face     said catseye .     looks like he   s seen a ghost .         yeah  well  it ain   t a ghost     muttered chickenwire .     it   s worse   n a ghost        medium dave slapped him across the face .      pull yourself together .  look around .  nothing   s chasing you .  anyway  it   s not as though we couldn   t put up a fight  right .      terror had had time to drain away a little .  chickenwire looked back up the stairs .  there was nothing there .      good     said medium dave  watching his face .     now   what happened .      chickenwire looked at his feet .      i thought it was the wardrobe     he muttered .     go on  laugh        they didn   t laugh .      what wardrobe .     said catseye .      oh  when i was a kid       chickenwire waved his arms vaguely .     we had this big ole wardrobe  if you must know .  oak .  it had this   this   on the door there was this   sort of   face .     he looked at their faces  which were equally wooden .     i mean  not an actual face  there was   all this   decoration round the keyhole  sort of flowers and leaves and stuff  but if you looked at it in the   right way   it was a face and they put it in my room    cos it was so big and in the night   in the night   in the night        they were grown men or at least had lived for several decades  which in some societies is considered the same thing .  but you had to stare at a man so creased up with dread .      yes .     said catseye hoarsely .         it whispered things     said chickenwire  in a quiet little voice  like a vole in a dungeon .   they looked at one another .      what things .     said medium dave .      i don   t know .  i always had my head under the pillow .  anyway  it   s just something from when i was a kid  all right .  our dad got rid of it in the finish .  burned it .  and i watched .      they mentally shook themselves  as people do when their minds emerge back into the light .      it   s like me and the dark     said catseye .      oh  don   t you start     said medium dave .     anyway  you ain   t afraid of the dark .  you   re famed for it .  i been working with you in all kinds of cellars and stuff .  i mean  that   s how you got your name .  catseye .  sees like a cat .         yeah  well   you try an    make up for it  don   t you .     said catseye .        cos when you   re grown you know it   s just shadows and stuff .  besides  it ain   t like the dark we used to have in the cellar .         oh  they had a special kind of a dark when you was a lad  did they .     said medium dave .     not like the kind of dark you get these days  eh .      sarcasm didn   t work .      no     said catseye  simply .     it wasn   t .  in our cellar  it wasn   t .         our mam used to wallop us if we went down to the cellar     said medium dave .     she had her still down there .         yeah .     said catseye  from somewhere far off .     well  our dad used to wallop us if we tried to get out .  now shut up talking about it .      they reached the bottom of the stairs .   there was an absence of anybody .  and any body .      he couldn   t have survived that  could he .     said medium dave .      i saw him as he went past     said catseye .     necks aren   t supposed to bend that way        he squinted upward .      who   s that moving up there .         how are their necks moving .     quavered chickenwire .      split up .     said medium dave .     and this time all take a stairway .  then they can   t come back down .         who   re they .  why   re they here .         why   re we here .     said peachy .  he started  and looked behind him .      taking our money .  after us putting up with him .         yeah       said peachy distantly  trailing after the others .      er   did you hear that noise just then .         what noise .         a sort of clipping  snipping    .         no .         no .         no .  you must have imagined it .      peachy nodded miserably .   as he walked up the stairs  little shadows raced through the stone and followed his feet .      susan darted off the stairs and dragged the oh god along a corridor lined with white doors .      i think they saw us     she said .     and if they   re tooth fairies there   s been a really stupid equal opportunities policy        she pushed open a door .   there were no windows to the room  but it was lit perfectly well by the walls themselves .  down the middle of the room was something like a display case  its lid gaping open .  bits of card littered the floor .   she reached down and picked one up and read     thomas ague  aged   and nearly three quarters    castle view  sto lat .     the writing was in a meticulous rounded script .   she crossed the passage to another room  where there was the same scene of devastation .      so now we know where the teeth were     she said .     they must   ve taken them out of everywhere and carried them downstairs .         what for .      she sighed .     it   s such old magic it isn   t even magic any more     she said .     if you   ve got a piece of someone   s hair  or a nail clipping  or a tooth   you can control them .      the oh god tried to focus .      that heap   s controlling millions of children .         yes .  adults  too  by now .         and you   you could make them think things and do things .      she nodded .     yes .         you could get them to open dad   s wallet and post the contents to some address .         well  i hadn   t thought of that  but yes  i suppose you could           or go downstairs and smash all the bottles in the drinks cabinet and promise never to take a drink when they grow up .     said the oh god hopefully .      what are you talking about .         it   s all right for you .  you don   t wake up every morning and see your whole life flush before your eyes .         medium dave and catseye ran down the passage and stopped where it forked .      you go that way  i   ll           why don   t we stick together .     said catseye .      what   s got into everyone .  i saw you bite the throats out of a coupla guard dogs when we did that job in quirm .  want me to hold your hand .  you check the doors down there  i   ll check them along here .      he walked off .   catseye peered down the other passage .   there weren   t many doors down there .  it wasn   t very long .  and  as teatime had said  there was nothing dangerous here that they hadn   t brought with them .   he heard voices coming from a doorway and sagged with relief .   he could deal with humans .   as he approached  a sound made him look round .   shadows were racing down the passage behind him .  they cascaded down the walls and flowed over the ceiling .   where shadows met they became darker .  and darker .   and rose .  and leapt .         what was that .     said susan .      sounded like the start of a scream     said bilious .   susan threw open the door .   there was no one outside .   there was movement  though .  she saw a patch of darkness in the corner of a wall shrink and fade  and another shadow slid around the bend of the corridor .   and there was a pair of boots in the center of the corridor .   she hadn   t remembered any boots there before .   she sniffed .  the air tasted of rats  and damp  and mold .      let   s get out of here     she said .      how   re we going to find this violet in all these rooms .         i don   t know .  i should be able to   sense her  but i can   t .     susan peered around the end of the corridor .  she could hear men shouting  some way off .   they slipped out onto the stairs again and managed another flight .  there were more rooms here  and in each one a cabinet that had been broken open .   shadows moved in the corners .  the effect was as though some invisible light source was gently shifting .      this reminds me a lot of your   um   of your grandfather   s place     said the oh god .      i know     said susan .     there aren   t any rules except the ones he makes up as he goes along .  i can   t see him being very happy if someone got in and started pulling the library apart        she stopped .  when she spoke again her voice had a different tone .      this is a children   s place     she said .     the rules are what children believe .         well  that   s a relief .         you think so .  things aren   t going to be right .  in the soul cake duck   s country ducks can lay chocolate eggs  in the same way that death   s country is black and somber because that   s what people believe .  he   s very conventional about that sort of thing .  skull and bone decorations all over the place .  and this place           pretty flowers and an odd sky .         i think it   s going to be a lot worse than that .  and very odd  too .         more odd than it is now .         i don   t think it   s possible to die here .         that man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead to me .         oh  you die .  but not here .  you   let   s see   yes   you go somewhere else .  away .  you   re just not seen any more .  that   s about all you understand when you   re three .  grandfather said it wasn   t like that fifty years ago .  he said you often couldn   t see the bed for everyone having a good cry .  now they just tell the child that grandma   s gone .  for three weeks twyla thought her uncle   d been buried in the sad patch behind the garden shed along with buster and meepo and all three bulgies .         three bulgies .         gerbils .  they tend to die a lot     said susan .     the trick is to replace them when she   s not looking .  you really don   t know anything  do you .         er   hello .      the voice came from the corridor .   they worked their way round to the next room .   there  sitting on the floor and tied to the leg of a white display case  was violet .  she looked up in apprehension  and then in bewilderment  and finally in growing recognition .      aren   t you    .         yes  yes  we see each other sometimes in biers  and when you came for twyla   s last tooth you were so shocked that i could see you i had to give you a drink to get your nerves back     said susan  fumbling with the ropes .     i don   t think we   ve got a lot of time .         and who   s he .      the oh god tried to push his lank hair into place .      oh  he   s just a god     said susan .     his name   s bilious .         do you drink at all .     said the oh god .      what sort of quest           he needs to know before he decides whether he hates you or not     said susan .     it   s a god thing .         no  i don   t     said violet .     what an idea .  i   ve got the blue ribbon .      the oh god raised his eyebrows at susan .      that means she   s a member of offler   s league of temperance     said susan .     they sign a pledge not to touch alcohol .  i can   t think why .  of course  offler   s a crocodile .  they don   t go in bars much .  they   re into water .         not touch alcohol at all .     said the oh god .      never .     said violet .     my dad   s very strict about that sort of thing .      after a moment susan felt forced to wave a hand across their locked gaze .      can we get on .     she said .     good .  who brought you here  violet .         i don   t know .  i was doing the collection as usual  and then i thought i heard someone following me  and then it all went dark  and when i came to we were   have you seen what it   s like outside .         yes .         well  we were there .  the big one was carrying me .  the one they call banjo .  he   s not bad  just a bit   odd .  sort of   slow .  he just watches me .  the others are thugs .  watch out for the one with the glass eye .  they   re all afraid of him .  except banjo .         glass eye .         he   s dressed like an assassin .  he   s called teatime .  i think they   re trying to steal something   they spent ages carting the teeth out .  little teeth everywhere   it was horrible .  thank you     she added to the oh god  who had helped her onto her feet .      they   ve piled them up in a magic circle downstairs     said susan .   violet   s eyes and mouth formed three os .  it was like looking at a pink bowling ball .      what for .         i think they   re using them to control the children .  by magic .      violet   s mouth opened wider .      that   s horrid .      horrible  thought susan .  the word is    horrible .        horrid    is a childish word selected to impress nearby males with one   s fragility  if i   m any judge .  she knew it was unkind and counter productive of her to think like that .  she also knew it was probably an accurate observation  which only made it worse .      yes     she said .      there was a wizard .  he   s got a pointy hat .         i think we should get her out of here     said the oh god  in a tone of voice that susan considered was altogether too dramatic .      good idea     she conceded .     let   s go .         catseye   s boots had snapped their laces .  it was as if he   d been pulled upward so fast they simply couldn   t keep up .   that worried medium dave .  so did the smell .  there was no smell at all in the rest of the tower  but just here there was a lingering odor of mushrooms .   his forehead wrinkled .  medium dave was a thief and a murderer and therefore had a highly developed moral sense .  he preferred not to steal from poor people  and not only because they never had anything worth stealing .  if it was necessary to hurt anyone  he tried to leave wounds that would heal .  and when in the course of his activities he had to kill people  then he made some effort to see that they did not suffer much or at least made as few noises as possible .   this whole business was getting on his nerves .  usually  he didn   t even notice that he had any .  there was a wrongness to everything that grated on his bones .   and a pair of boots was all that remained of old catseye .   he drew his sword .   above him  the creeping shadows moved and flowed away .      susan edged up to the entrance to the stairways and peered around into the point of a crossbow .      now  all of you step out where i can see you     said peachy conversationally .     and don   t touch that sword  lady .  you   ll probably hurt yourself .      susan tried to make herself unseen  and failed .  usually it was so easy to do that that it happened automatically  usually with embarrassing results .  she could be idly reading a book while people searched the room for her .  but here  despite every effort  she seemed to remain obstinately visible .      you don   t own this place     she said  stepping back .      no  but you see this crossbow .  i own this crossbow .  so you just walk ahead of me  right  and we   ll all go and see mister teatime .         excuse me  i just want to check something     said bilious .  to susan   s amazement he leaned over and touched the point of the arrow .      here .  what did you do that for .     said peachy  stepping back .      i felt it  but of course a certain amount of pain sensation would be part of normal sensory response     said the oh god .     i warn you  there   s a very good chance that i might be immortal .         yes  but we probably aren   t     said susan .      immortal  eh .     said peachy .     so if i was to shoot you inna head  you wouldn   t die .         i suppose when you put it like that   i do know i feel pain           right .  you just keep moving  then .         when something happens     said susan  out of the corner of her mouth     you two try to get downstairs and out  all right .  if the worst comes to the worst  the horse will take you out of here .         if something happens     whispered the oh god .      when     said susan .   behind them  peachy looked around .  he knew he   d feel a lot better when any of the others turned up .  it was almost a relief to have prisoners .   out of the corner of her eye susan saw something move on the stairs on the opposite side of the shaft .  for a moment she thought she saw several flashes like metal blades catching the light .   she heard a gasp behind her .   the man with the crossbow was standing very still and staring at the opposite stairs .      oh  noooo     he said  under his breath .      what is it .     said susan .   he stared at her .     you can see it  too .         the thing like a lot of blades clicking together .     said susan .      oh  noooo           it was only there for a moment     said susan .     it   s gone now     she said .     somewhere else     she added .      it   s the scissor man           who   s he .     said the oh god .      no one .     snapped peachy  trying to pull himself together .     there   s no such thing as the scissor man  all right .         ah   yes .  when you were little  did you suck your thumb .     said susan .     because the only scissor man i know is the one people used to frighten children with .  they said he   d turn up and           shutupshutupshutup .     said peachy  prodding her with the crossbow .     kids believe all kinds of crap .  but i   m grown up now  right  and i can open beer bottles with other people   s teeth an   oh  gods        susan heard the snip  snip .  it sounded very close now .   peachy had his eyes shut .      is there anything behind me .     he quavered .   susan pushed the others aside and waved frantically toward the bottom of the stairs .      no     she said  as they hurried away .      is there anything standing on the stairs at all .         no .         right .  if you see that one eyed bastard you tell him he can keep the money .      he turned and ran .   when susan turned to go up the stairs the scissor man was there .   it wasn   t man shaped .  it was something like an ostrich  and something like a lizard on its hind legs  but almost entirely like something made out of blades .  every time it moved a thousand blades went snip  snip .   its long silver neck curved and a head made of shears stared down at her .      you   re not looking for me     she said .     you   re not my nightmare .      the blades tilted this way and that .  the scissor man was trying to think .      i remember you came for twyla     said susan  stepping forward .     that damn governess had told her what happens to little girls who suck their thumbs  remember .  remember the poker .  i bet you needed a hell of a lot of sharpening afterward        the creature lowered its head  stepped carefully around her in as polite a way as it could manage  and clanked on down the stairs after peachy .   susan ran on toward the top of the tower .      sideney put a green filter over his lantern and pressed down with a small silver rod that had an emerald set on its tip .  a piece of the lock moved .  there was a whirring from inside the door and something went click .   he sagged with relief .  it is said that the prospect of hanging concentrates the mind wonderfully  but it was valium compared to being watched by mister teatime .      i  er  think that   s the third lock     he said .     green light is what opens it .  i remember the fabulous lock of the hall of murgle  which could only be opened by the hubward wind  although that was           i commend your expertise     said teatime .     and the other four .      sideney looked up nervously at the silent bulk of banjo  and licked his lips .      well  of course  if i   m right  and the locks depend on certain conditions  well  we could be here for years       he ventured .     supposing they can only be opened by  say  a small blond child holding a mouse .  on a tuesday .  in the rain .         you can find out what the nature of the spell is .     said teatime .      yes  yes  of course  yes .     sideney waved his hands urgently .     that   s how i worked out this one .  reverse thaumaturgy  yes  certainly .  er .  in time .         we have lots of time     said teatime .      perhaps a little more time than that     sideney quavered .     the processes are very  very  very   difficult .         oh dear .  if it   s too much for you  you   ve only got to say     said teatime .      no .     sideney yipped  and then managed to get some self control .     no .  no .  no  i can   i   m sure i shall work them out soon           jolly good     said teatime .   the student wizard looked down .  a wisp of vapor oozed from the crack between the doors .      do you know what   s in here  mister teatime .         no .         ah .  right .     sideney stared mournfully at the fourth lock .  it was amazing how much you remembered when someone like teatime was around .   he gave him a nervous look .     there   s not going to be any more violent deaths  are there .     he said .     i just can   t stand the sight of violent deaths .      teatime put a comforting arm around his shoulders .     don   t worry     he said .     i   m on your side .  a violent death is the last thing that   ll happen to you .         mister teatime .      he turned .  medium dave stepped onto the landing .      someone else is in the tower     he said .     they   ve got catseye .  i don   t know how .  i   ve got peachy watching the stairs and i ain   t sure where chickenwire is .      teatime looked back to sideney  who started prodding at the fourth lock again in a feverish attempt not to die .      why are you telling me .  i thought i was paying you big strong men a lot of money to deal with this sort of thing .      medium dave   s lips framed some words  but when he spoke he said     all right  but what are we up against here .  eh .  old man trouble or the bogeyman or what .      teatime sighed .      some of the tooth fairy   s employees  i assume     he said .      not if they   re like the ones that were here     said medium dave .     they were just civilians .  it looks like the ground opened and swallowed catseye up .     he thought about this .     i mean the ceiling     he corrected himself .  a horrible image had just passed across his under used imagination .   teatime walked across to the stairwell and looked down .  far below  the pile of teeth looked like a white circle .      and the girl   s gone     said medium dave .      really .  i thought i said she should be killed .      medium dave hesitated .  the boys had been brought up by ma lilywhite to be respectful to women as delicate and fragile creatures  and were soundly thrashed if disrespectful tendencies were perceived by ma   s incredibly sensitive radar .  and it was truly incredibly sensitive .  ma could hear what you were doing three rooms away  a terrible thing for a growing lad .   that sort of thing leaves a mark .  ma lilywhite certainly could .  as for the others  they had no objections in practice to the disposal of anyone who got between them and large sums of money  but there was a general unspoken resentment at being told by teatime to kill someone just because he had no further use for them .  it wasn   t that it was unprofessional .  only assassins thought like that .  it was just that there were things you did do  and things you didn   t do .  and this was one of the things you didn   t do .      we thought   well  you never know           she wasn   t necessary     said teatime .     few people are .      sideney thumbed hurriedly through his notebooks .      anyway  the place is a maze       medium dave said .      sadly  this is so     said teatime .     but i am sure they will be able to find us .  it   s probably too much to hope that they intend something heroic .         violet and the oh god hurried down the stairs .      do you know how to get back .     said violet .      don   t you .         i think there   s a   a kind of soft place .  if you walk at it knowing it   s there you go through .         you know where it is .         no .  i   ve never been here before .  they had a bag on my head when we came .  all i ever did was take the teeth from under the pillows .     violet started to sob .     you just get this list and about five minutes    training and they even dock you ten pence a week for the ladder and i know i made that mistake with little william rubin but they should of said  you   re supposed to take any teeth you           er   mistake .     said bilious  trying to get her to hurry .      just because he slept with his head under the pillow but they give you the pliers anyway and no one told me that you shouldn   t        she certainly did have a pleasant voice  bilious told himself .  it was just that in a funny way it grated  too .  it was like listening to a talking flute .      i think we   d just better get outside     he said .     in case they hear us     he hinted .      what sort of godding do you do .     said violet .      er   oh  i   this and that   i   er       bilious tried to think through the pounding headache .  and then he had one of those ideas  the kind that only sound good after a lot of alcohol .  someone else may have drunk the drinks  but he managed to snag the idea .      i   m actually self employed     he said  as brightly as he could manage .      how can you be a self employed god .         ah  well  you see  if any other god wants  perhaps  you know  a holiday or something  i cover for them .  yes .  that   s what i do .      unwisely  in the circumstances  he let his inventiveness impress him .      oh  yes .  i   m very busy .  rushed off my feet .  they   re always employing me .  you   ve no idea .  they don   t think twice about pushing off for a month as a big white bull or a swan or something and it   s always     oh  bilious  old chap  just take care of things while i   m away  will you .  answer the prayers and so on .     i hardly get a minute to myself but of course you can   t turn down work these days .      violet was round eyed with fascination .      and are you covering for anyone right now .     she asked .      um  yes   the god of hangovers  actually           a god of hangovers .  how awful .      bilious looked down at his stained and wretched toga .      i suppose it is       he mumbled .      you   re not very good at it .         you don   t have to tell me .         you   re more cut out to be one of the important gods     said violet  admiringly .     i can just see you as io or fate or one of those .      bilious stared at her with his mouth open .      i could tell at once you weren   t right     she went on .     not for some horrible little god .  you could even be offler with calves like yours .         could i .  i mean   oh  yes .  sometimes .  of course  i have to wear fangs        and then someone was holding a sword to his throat .      what   s this .     said chickenwire .     lover   s lane .         you leave him alone  you .     shouted violet .     he   s a god .  you   ll be really sorry .      bilious swallowed  but very gently .  it was a sharp sword .      a god  eh .     said chickenwire .     what of .      bilious tried to swallow again .      oh  bit o    this  bit o    that     he mumbled .      cor     said chickenwire .     well  i   m impressed .  i can see i   m going to have to be dead careful here  eh .  don   t want you smiting me with thunderbolts  do i .  puts a crimp in the day  that sort of thing        bilious didn   t dare move his head .  but out of the corner of his eye he was sure he could see shadows moving very fast across the walls .      dear me  out of thunderbolts  are we .     chickenwire sneered .     well  y   know  i   ve never        there was a creak .   chickenwire   s face was a few inches from bilious .  the oh god saw his expression change .   the man   s eyes rolled .  his lips said       nur        bilious risked stepping back .  chickenwire   s sword didn   t move .  he stood there  trembling slightly  like a man who wants to turn round to see what   s behind him but doesn   t dare to in case he does .   as far as bilious was concerned  it had just been a creak .   he looked up at the thing on the landing above .      who put that there .     said violet .   it was just a wardrobe .  dark oak  a bit of fancy woodwork glued on in an effort to disguise the undisguisable fact that it was just an upright box .  it was a wardrobe .      you didn   t  you know  try to cast a thunderbolt and go on a few letters too many .     she went on .      huh .     said bilious  looking from the stricken man to the wardrobe .  it was so ordinary it was   odd .      i mean  thunderbolts begin with t and wardrobes        violet   s lips moved silently .  part of bilious thought  i   m attracted to a girl who actually has to shut down all other brain functions in order to think about the order of the letters of the alphabet .  on the other hand  she   s attracted to someone who   s wearing a toga that looks as though a family of weasels have had a party in it  so maybe i   ll stop this thought right here .   but the major part of his brain thought  why   s this man making little bubbling noises .  it   s just a wardrobe  for my sake .      no  no     mumbled chickenwire .     i don   t wanna .      the sword clanged on the floor .   he took a step backward up the stairs  but very slowly  as if he was doing it despite every effort his muscles could muster .      don   t want to what .     said violet .   chickenwire spun round .  bilious had never seen that happen before .  people turned round quickly  yes  but chickenwire just revolved as if some giant hand had been placed on his head and twisted a hundred and eighty degrees .      no .  no .  no     chickenwire whined .     no .      he tottered up the steps .      you got to help me     he whispered .      what   s the matter .     said bilious .     it   s just a wardrobe  isn   t it .  it   s for putting all your old clothes in so that there   s no room for your new clothes .      the doors of the wardrobe swung open .   chickenwire managed to thrust out his arms and grab the sides and  for a moment  he stood quite still .   then he was pulled into the wardrobe in one sudden movement and the doors slammed shut .   the little brass key turned in the lock with a click .      we ought to get him out     said the oh god  running up the steps .      why .     violet demanded .     they are not very nice people .  i know that one .  when he brought me food he made   suggestive comments .         yes  but       bilious hadn   t ever seen a face like that  outside of a mirror .  chickenwire had looked very  very sick .   he turned the key and opened the doors .      oh dear           i don   t want to see .  i don   t want to see .     said violet  looking over his shoulder .   bilious reached down and picked up a pair of boots that stood neatly in the middle of the wardrobe   s floor .   then he put them back carefully and walked around the wardrobe .  it was plywood .  the words    dratley and sons  phedre road  ankh morpork    were stamped in one corner in faded ink .      is it magic .     said violet nervously .      i don   t know if something magic has the maker   s name on it     said bilious .      there are magic wardrobes     said violet nervously .     if you go into them  you come out in a magic land .      bilious looked at the boots again .      um   yes     he said .      i think i must tell you something  said death .      yes  i think you should     said ridcully .     i   ve got little devils running round the place eating socks and pencils  earlier tonight we sobered up someone who thinks he   s a god of hangovers and half my wizards are trying to cheer up the cheerful fairy .  we thought something must   ve happened to the hogfather .  we were right  right .         hex was right  archchancellor     ponder corrected him .   hex .  what is hex .      er   hex thinks   that is  calculates   that there   s been a big change in the nature of belief today     said ponder .  he felt  he did not know why  that death was probably not in favor of unliving things that thought .   mr .  hex was remarkably astute .  the hogfather has been   death paused .  there is no sensible human word .  dead  in a way  but not exactly   a god cannot be killed .  never completely killed .  he has been  shall we say  severely reduced .      ye gods .     said ridcully .     who   d want to kill off the old boy .      he has enemies .      what did he do .  miss a chimney .      every living thing has enemies .      what  everything .      yes .  everything .  powerful enemies .  but they have gone too far this time .  now they are using people .      who are .      those who think the universe should be a lot of rocks moving in curves .  have you ever heard of the auditors .      i suppose the bursar may have done        not auditors of money .  auditors of reality .  they think of life as a stain on the universe .  a pestilence .  messy .  getting in the way .      in the way of what .      the efficient running of the universe .      i thought it was run for us   well  for the professor of applied anthropics  actually  but we   re allowed to tag along     said ridcully .  he scratched his chin .     and i could certainly run a marvelous university here if only we didn   t have to have these damn students underfoot all the time .      quite so .      they want to get rid of us .      they want you to be   less   damn  i   ve forgotten the word .  untruthful .  the hogfather is a symbol of this   death snapped his fingers  causing echoes to bounce off the walls  and added  wistful lying .      untruthful .     said ridcully .     me .  i   m as honest as the day is long .  yes  what is it this time .      ponder had tugged at his robe and now he whispered something in his ear .  ridcully cleared his throat .      i am reminded that this is in fact the shortest day of the year     he said .     however  this does not undermine the point that i just made  although i thank my colleague for his invaluable support and constant readiness to correct minor if not downright trivial errors .  i am a remarkably truthful man  sir .  things said at university council meetings don   t count .      i mean humanity in general .  er   the act of telling the universe it is other than it is .      you   ve got me there     said ridcully .     anyway  why   re you doing the job .      someone must .  it is vitally important .  they must be seen  and believed .  before dawn  there must be enough belief in the hogfather .      why .     said ridcully .   so that the sun will come up .   the two wizards gawped at him .   i seldom joke  said death .   at which point there was a scream of horror .      that sounded like the bursar     said ridcully .     and he   s been doing so well up to now .         the reason for the bursar   s scream lay on the floor of his bedroom .   it was a man .  he was dead .  no one alive had that kind of expression .   some of the other wizards had got there first .  ridcully pushed his way through the crowd .      ye gods     he said .     what a face .  he looks as though he died of fright .  what happened .         well     said the dean     as far as i can tell  the bursar opened his wardrobe and found the man inside .         really .  i wouldn   t have said the poor old bursar was all that frightening .         no  archchancellor .  the corpse fell out on him .      the bursar was standing in the corner  wearing his old familiar expression of good humored concussion .      you all right  old fellow .     said ridcully .     what   s eleven percent of       .         one hundred and forty point three six     said the bursar promptly .      ah  right as rain     said ridcully cheerfully .      i don   t see why     said the chair of indefinite studies .     just because he can do things with numbers doesn   t mean everything else is fine .         doesn   t need to be     said ridcully .     numbers is what he has to do .  the poor chap might be slightly yo yo  but i   ve been reading about it .  he   s one of these idiot servants .         savants     said the dean patiently .     the word is savants  ridcully .         whatever .  those chaps who can tell you what day of the week the first of grune was a hundred years ago              tuesday       said the bursar .         but can   t tie their boot laces     said ridcully .     what was a corpse doing in his wardrobe .  and no one is to say    not a lot     or anythin    tasteless like that .  haven   t had a corpse in a wardrobe since that business with archchancellor buckleby .         we all warned buckleby that the lock was too stiff     said the dean .      just out of interest  why was the bursar fiddling with his wardrobe at this time of night .     said ridcully .   the wizards looked sheepish .      we were   playing sardines  archchancellor     said the dean .      what   s that .         it   s like hide and seek  but when you find someone you have to squeeze in with them     said the dean .      i just want to be clear about this     said ridcully .     my senior wizards have spent the evening playing hide and seek .         oh  not the whole evening     said the chair of indefinite studies .     we played grandmother   s footsteps and i spy for quite a while until the senior wrangler made a scene just because we wouldn   t let him spell chandelier with an s .         party games .  you fellows .      the dean sidled closer .      it   s miss smith     he mumbled .     when we don   t join in she bursts into tears .         who   s miss smith .         the cheerful fairy     said the lecturer in recent runes glumly .     if you don   t say yes to everything her lip wobbles like a plate of jelly .  it   s unbearable .         we just joined in to stop her weeping     said the dean .     it   s amazing how one woman can be so soggy .         if we   re not cheerful she bursts into tears     said the chair of indefinite studies .     the senior wrangler   s doing some juggling for her at the moment .         but he can   t juggle .         i think that   s cheering her up a bit .         what you   re tellin    me  then  is that my wizards are prancing around playin    children   s games just to cheer up some dejected fairy .         er   yes .         i thought you had to clap your hands and say you believed in    em     said ridcully .     correct me if i   m wrong .         that   s just for the little shiny ones     said the lecturer in recent runes .     not for the ones in saggy cardigans with half a dozen hankies stuffed up their sleeves .      ridcully looked at the corpse again .      anyone know who he is .  looks a bit of a ruffian to me .  and where   s his boots  may i ask .      the dean took a small glass cube from his pocket and ran it over the corpse .      quite a large thaumic reading  gentlemen     he said .     i think he got here by magic .      he rummaged in the man   s pockets and pulled out a handful of small white things .      ugh     he said .      teeth .     said ridcully .     who goes around with a pocket full of teeth .         a very bad fighter .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     i   ll go and get modo to take the poor fellow away  shall i .         if we can get a reading off the thaumameter  perhaps hex       ridcully began .      now  ridcully     said the dean     i really think there must be some problems that can be resolved without having to deal with that damn thinking mill .         death looked up at hex .   a machine for thinking .      er   yes  sir     said ponder stibbons .     you see  when you said   well  you see  hex believes everything   but  look  the sun really will come up  won   t it .  that   s its job .      leave us .   ponder backed away  and then scurried out of the room .   the ants flowed along their tubes .  cogwheels spun .  the big wheel with the sheep skulls on it creaked around slowly .  a mouse squeaked  somewhere in the works .   well .  said death .   after a while  the pen began to write .       big red lever time     query      no .  they say you are a thinker .  extend logically the result of the human race ceasing to believe in the hogfather .  will the sun come up .  answer .   it took several minutes .  the wheels spun .  the ants ran .  the mouse squeaked .  an egg timer came down on a spring .  it bounced aimlessly for a while  and then jerked back up again .   hex wrote      the sun will not come up      correct .  how may this be prevented .  answer .       regular and consistent belief      good .  i have a task for you  thinking engine .       yes .  i am preparing an area of write only memory      what is that .       you would say  to know in your bones      good .  here is your instruction .  believe in the hogfather .       yes      do you believe .  answer .       yes      do   you   believe .  answer .       yes      there was a change in the ill assembled heap of pipes and tubes that was hex .  the big wheel creaked into a new position .  from the other side of the wall came the hum of busy bees .   good .   death turned to leave the room  but stopped when hex began to write furiously .  he went back and looked at the emerging paper .       dear hogfather  for hogswatch i want     oh  no .  you can   t write lett   death paused  and then said  you can  can   t you .       yes .  i am entitled      death waited until the pen had stopped  and picked up the paper .   but you are a machine .  things have no desires .  a doorknob wants nothing  even though it is a complex machine .       all things strive      you have a point  said death .  he thought of tiny red petals in the black depths  and read to the end of the list .   i don   t know what most of these things are .  i don   t think the sack will  either .       i regret this      but we will do the best we can  said death .  frankly  i shall be glad when tonight   s over .  it   s much harder to give than to receive .  he rummaged in his sack .  let me see   how old are you .      susan crept up the stairs  one hand on the hilt of the sword .   ponder stibbons had been worried to find himself  as a wizard  awaiting the arrival of the hogfather .  it   s amazing how people define roles for themselves and put handcuffs on their experience and are constantly surprised by the things a roulette universe spins at them .  here am i  they say  a mere wholesale fish monger  at the controls of a giant airliner because as it turns out all the crew had the coronation chicken .  who   d have thought it .  here am i  a housewife who merely went out this morning to bank the proceeds of the playgroup association   s car boot sale  on the run with one million in stolen cash and a rather handsome man from the battery chickens    liberation organization .  amazing .  here am i  a perfectly ordinary hockey player  suddenly realizing i   m the son of god with five hundred devoted followers in a nice little commune in empowerment  southern california .  who   d have thought it .   here am i  thought susan  a very practically minded governess who can add up faster upside down than most people can the right way up  climbing up a tooth shaped tower belonging to the tooth fairy and armed with a sword belonging to death     again .  i wish one month  just one damn month  could go by without something like this happening to me .   she could hear voices above her .  someone said something about a lock .   she peered over the edge of the stairwell .   it looked as though people had been camping out up here .  there were boxes and sleeping rolls strewn around .  a couple of men were sitting on boxes watching a third man who was working on a door in one curved wall .  one of the men was the biggest susan had ever seen  one of those huge fat men who contrive to indicate that a lot of the fat under their shapeless clothes is muscle .  the other        hello     said a cheerful voice by her ear .     what   s your name .      she made herself turn her head slowly .   first she saw the gray  glinting eye .  then the yellow white one with the tiny dot of a pupil came into view .   around them was a friendly pink and white face topped by curly hair .  it was actually quite pretty  in a boyish sort of way  except that those mismatched eyes staring out of it suggested that it had been stolen from someone else .   she started to move her hand but the boy was there first  dragging the sword scabbard out of her belt .      ah  ah .     he chided  turning and fending her off as she tried to grab it .     well  well  well .  my word .  white bone handle  rather tasteless skull and bone decoration   death himself   s second favorite weapon  am i right .  oh  my .  this must be hogswatch .  and this must mean that you are susan sto helit .  nobility .  i   d bow     he added  dancing back     but i   m afraid you   d do something dreadful        there was a click  and a little gasp of excitement from the wizard working on the door .      yes .  yes .  left handed using a wooden pick .  that   s simple .      he saw that even susan was looking at him  and coughed nervously .      er  i   ve got the fifth lock open  mister teatime .  not a problem .  they   re just based on woddeley   s occult sequence .  any fool could do it if they knew that .         i know it     said teatime  without taking his eyes off susan .      ah        it was not technically audible  but nevertheless susan could almost hear the wizard   s mind back pedaling .  up ahead was the conclusion that teatime had no time for people he didn   t need .         with   inter   est   ing subtleties     he said slowly .     yes .  very tricky .  i   ll  er  just have a look at number six           how do you know who i am .     said susan .      oh  easy     said teatime .     twurp   s peerage .  family motto non temetis messor .  we have to read it  you know  in class .  hah  old mericet calls it the guide to the turf .  no one laughs except him  of course .  oh  yes  i know about you .  quite a lot .  your father was well known .  went a long way very fast .  as for your grandfather   honestly  that motto .  is that good taste .  of course  you don   t need to fear him  do you .  or do you .      susan tried to fade .  it didn   t work .  she could feel herself staying embarrassingly solid .      i don   t know what you   re talking about     she said .     who are you  anyway .         i beg your pardon .  my name is teatime  jonathan teatime .  at your service .      susan lined up the syllables in her head .      you mean   like around four o   clock in the afternoon .     she said .      no .  i did say teh ah tim eh     said teatime .     i spoke very clearly .  please don   t try to break my concentration by annoying me .  i only get annoyed at important things .  how are you getting on  mr .  sideney .  if it   s just according to woddeley   s sequence  number six should be copper and blue green light .  unless  of course  there are any subtleties           er  doing it right now  mister teatime           do you think your grandfather will try to rescue you .  do you think he will .  but now i have his sword  you see .  i wonder        there was another click .      sixth lock  mister teatime .         really .         er   don   t you want me to start on the seventh .         oh  well  if you like .  pure white light will be the key     said teatime  still not looking away from susan .     but it may not be all important now .  thank you  anyway .  you   ve been most helpful .         er           yes  you may go .      susan noticed that sideney didn   t even bother to pick up his books and tools  but hurried down the stairs as if he expected to be called back and was trying to run faster than the sound .      is that all you   re here for .     she said .     a robbery .     he was dressed like an assassin  after all  and there was always one way to annoy an assassin .     like a thief .      teatime danced excitedly .     a thief .  me .  i   m not a thief  madam .  but if i were  i would be the kind that steals fire from the gods .         we   ve already got fire .         there must be an upgrade by now .  no  these gentlemen are thieves .  common robbers .  decent types  although you wouldn   t necessarily want to watch them eat  for example .  that   s medium dave and exhibit b is banjo .  he can talk .      medium dave nodded at susan .  she saw the look in his eyes .  maybe there was something she could use     she   d need something .  even her hair was a mess .  she couldn   t step behind time  she couldn   t fade into the background  and now even her hair had let her down .   she was normal .  here  she was what she   d always wanted to be .   bloody  bloody damn .      sideney prayed as he ran down the stairs .  he didn   t believe in any gods  since most wizards seldom like to encourage them  but he prayed anyway the fervent prayers of an atheist who hopes to be wrong .   but no one called him back .  and no one ran after him .   so  being of a serious turn of mind under his normal state of sub critical fear  he slowed down in case he lost his footing .   it was then that he noticed that the steps underfoot weren   t the smooth whiteness they had been everywhere else but were very large  pitted flagstones .  and the light had changed  and then they weren   t stairs any more and he staggered as he encountered flat ground where steps should have been .   his outstretched hand brushed against a crumbling brick .   and the ghosts of the past poured in  and he knew where he was .  he was in the yard of gammer wimblestone   s dame school .  his mother wanted him to learn his letters and be a wizard  but she also thought that long curls on a five year old boy looked very smart .   this was the hunting ground of ronnie jenks .   adult memory and understanding said that ronnie was just an unintelligent bullet headed seven year old bully with muscles where his brain should have been .  the eye of childhood  rather more accurately  dreaded him as a force like a personalized earthquake with one nostril bunged up with bogies  both knees scabbed  both fists balled and all five brain cells concentrated in a kind of cerebral grunt .   oh  gods .  there was the tree ronnie used to hide behind .  it looked as big and menacing as he remembered it .   but   if somehow he   d ended up back there  gods knew how  well  he might be a bit on the skinny side but he was a damn sight bigger than ronnie jenks now .  gods  yes  he   d kick those evil little trousers all the     and then  as a shadow blotted out the sun  he realized he was wearing curls .      teatime looked thoughtfully at the door .      i suppose i should open it     he said     after coming all this way           you   re controlling children by their teeth     said susan .      it does sound odd  doesn   t it  when you put it like that     said teatime .     but that   s sympathetic magic for you .  is your grandfather going to try to rescue you  do you think .  but no   i don   t think he can .  not here  i think .  i don   t think that he can come here .  so he sent you  did he .         certainly not .  he       susan stopped .  oh  he had  she told herself  feeling even more of a fool .  he certainly had .  he was learning about humans  all right .  for a walking skeleton  he could be quite clever     but   how clever was teatime .  just a bit too excited at his cleverness to realize that if death   she tried to stamp on the thought  just in case teatime could read it in her eyes .      i don   t think he   ll try     she said .     he   s not as clever as you  mister teatime .         teh ah tim eh     said teatime  automatically .     that   s a shame .         do you think you   re going to get away with this .         oh dear .  do people really say that .     and suddenly teatime was much closer .     i   ve got away with it .  no more hogfather .  and that   s only the start .  we   ll keep the teeth coming in  of course .  the possibilities        there was a rumble like an avalanche  a long way off .  the dormant banjo had awakened  causing tremors on his lower slopes .  his enormous hands  which had been resting on his knees  started to bunch .      what   s dis .     he said .   teatime stopped and  for a moment  looked puzzled .      what   s this what .         you said no more hogfather     said banjo .  he stood up  like a mountain range rising gently in the squeeze between colliding continents .  his hands still stayed in the vicinity of his knees .   teatime stared at him and then glanced at medium dave .      he does know what we   ve been doing  does he .     he said .     you did tell him .      medium dave shrugged .      dere   s got to be a hogfather     said banjo .     dere   s always a hogfather .      susan looked down .  gray blotches were speeding across the white marble .  she was standing in a pool of gray .  so was banjo .  and around teatime the dots bounced and recoiled like wasps around a pot of jam .   looking for something  she thought .      you don   t believe in the hogfather  do you .     said teatime .     a big boy like you .         yeah     said banjo .     so what   s dis    no more hogfather    .      teatime pointed at susan .      she did it     he said .     she killed him .      the sheer playground effrontery of it shocked susan .      no i didn   t     she said .     he           did .         didn   t .         did .      banjo   s big bald head turned toward her .      what   s dis about the hogfather .     he said .      i don   t think he   s dead     said susan .     but teatime has made him very ill           who cares .     said teatime  dancing away .     when this is over  banjo  you   ll have as many presents as you want .  trust me .         dere   s got to be a hogfather     banjo rumbled .     else dere   s no hogswatch .         it   s just another solar festival     said teatime .     it        medium dave stood up .  he had his hand on his sword .      we   re going  teatime     he said .     me and banjo are going .  i don   t like any of this .  i don   t mind robbing  i don   t mind thieving  but this isn   t honest .  banjo .  you come with me right now .         what   s dis about no more hogfather .     said banjo .   teatime pointed to susan .      you grab her  banjo .  it   s all her fault .      banjo lumbered a few steps in susan   s direction  and then stopped .      our mam said no hittin    girls     he rumbled .     no pullin    dere hair        teatime rolled his one good eye .  around his feet the grayness seemed to be boiling in the stone  following his feet as they moved .  and it was around banjo  too .   searching  susan thought .  it   s looking for a way in .      i think i know you  teatime     she said  as sweetly as she could for banjo   s sake .     you   re the mad kid they   re all scared of  right .         banjo .     snapped teatime .     i said grab her           our mam said           the giggling excitable one even the bullies never touched because if they did he went insane and kicked and bit     said susan .     the kid who didn   t know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat and setting it on fire .      to her delight he glared at her .      shut up     he said .      i bet no one wanted to play with you     said susan .     not the kid with no friends .  kids know about a mind like yours even if they don   t know the right words for it           i said shut up .  get her  banjo .      that was it .  she could hear it in teatime   s voice .  there was a touch of vibrato that hadn   t been there before .      the kind of little boy     she said  watching his face     who looks up dolls    dresses           i didn   t .      banjo looked worried .      our mam said           oh  to blazes with your mam .     snapped teatime .   there was a whisper of steel as medium dave drew his sword .      what   d you say about our mam .     he whispered .   now he   s having to concentrate on three people  susan thought .      i bet no one ever played with you     she said .     i bet there were things people had to hush up  eh .         banjo .  you do what i tell you .     teatime screamed .   the monstrous man was beside her now .  she could see his face twisted in an agony of indecision .  his enormous fists clenched and unclenched and his lips moved as some kind of horrible debate raged in his head .      our   our mam   our mam said        the gray marks flowed across the floor and formed a pool of shadow which grew darker and higher with astonishing speed .  it towered over the three men  and grew a shape .      have you been a bad boy  you little perisher .      the huge woman towered over all three men .  in one meaty hand it was holding a bundle of birch twigs as thick as a man   s arm .   the thing growled .   medium dave looked up into the enormous face of ma lilywhite .  every pore was a pothole .  every brown tooth was a tombstone .      you been letting him get into trouble  our davey .  you have  ain   t you .      he backed away .     no  mum   no  mum           you need a good hiding  banjo .  you been playing with girls again .      banjo sagged on to his knees  tears of misery rolling down his face .      sorry mum sorry sorry mum noooohhh mum sorry mum sorry sorry        then the figure turned to medium dave again .   the sword dropped out of his hand .  his face seemed to melt .   medium dave started to cry .      no mum no mum no mum nooooh mum        he gave a gurgle and collapsed  clutching his chest .  and vanished .   teatime started to laugh .   susan tapped him on the shoulder and  as he looked round  hit him as hard as she could across the face .   that was the plan  at least .  his hand moved faster and caught her wrist .  it was like striking an iron bar .      oh  no     he said .     i don   t think so .      out of the corner of her eye susan saw banjo crawling across the floor to where his brother had been .  ma lilywhite had vanished .      this place gets into your head  doesn   t it .     teatime said .     it pokes around to find out how to deal with you .  well  i   m in touch with my inner child .      he reached out with his other hand and grabbed her hair  pulling her head down .   susan screamed .      and it   s much more fun     he whispered .   susan felt his grip lessen .  there was a wet thump like a piece of steak hitting a slab and teatime went past her  on his back .      no pullin    girls    hair     rumbled banjo .     that   s bad .      teatime bounced up like an acrobat and steadied himself on the railing of the stairwell .   then he drew the sword .   the blade was invisible in the bright light of the tower .      it   s true what the stories say  then     he said .     so thin you can   t see it .  i   m going to have such fun with it .     he waved it at them .     so light .         you wouldn   t dare use it .  my grandfather will come after you     said susan  walking toward him .   she saw one eye twitch .      he comes after everyone .  but i   ll be ready for him     said teatime .      he   s very single minded     said susan  closer now .      ah  a man after my own heart .         could be  mister teatime .      he brought the sword around .  she didn   t even have time to duck .   and she didn   t even try to when he swung the sword back again .      it doesn   t work here     she said  as he stared at it in astonishment .     the blade doesn   t exist here .  there   s no death here .      she slapped him across the face .      hi .     she said brightly .     i   m the inner baby sitter .      she didn   t punch .  she just thrust out an arm  palm first  catching him under the chin and lifting him backward over the rail .   he somersaulted .  she never knew how .  he somehow managed to gain purchase on clear air .   his free arm grabbed at hers  her feet came off the ground  and she was over the rail .  she caught it with her other hand   although later she wondered if the rail hadn   t managed to catch her instead .   teatime swung from her arm  staring upward with a thoughtful expression .  she saw him grip the sword hilt in his teeth and reach down to his belt     the question    is this person mad enough to try to kill someone holding him .     was asked and answered very  very fast   she kicked down and hit him on the ear .   the cloth of her sleeve began to tear .  teatime tried to get another grip .  she kicked again and the dress ripped .  for an instant he held onto nothing and then  still wearing the expression of someone trying to solve a complex problem  he fell away  spinning  getting smaller     he hit the pile of teeth  sending them splashing across the marble .  he jerked for a moment     and vanished .   a hand like a bunch of bananas pulled susan back over the rail .      you can get into trouble  hittin    girls     said banjo .     no playin    with girls .      there was a click behind them .   the doors had swung open .  cold white mist rolled out across the floor .      our mam       said banjo  trying to work things out .     our mam was here           yes     said susan .      but it weren   t our mam     cos they buried our mam           yes .         we watched    em fill in the grave and everything .         yes     said susan  and added to herself  i bet you did .      and where   s our davey gone .         er   somewhere else  banjo .         somewhere nice .     said the huge man hesitantly .   susan grasped with relief the opportunity to tell the truth  or at least not definitely lie .      it could be     she said .      better   n here .         you never know .  some people would say the odds are in favor .      banjo turned his pink piggy eyes on her .  for a moment a thirty five year old man looked out through the pink clouds of a five year old face .      that   s good     he said .     he   ll be able to see our mam again .      this much conversation seemed to exhaust him .  he sagged .      i wanna go home     he said .   she stared at his big  stained face  shrugged hopelessly  pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket and held it up to his mouth .      spit     she commanded .  he obeyed .   she dabbed the handkerchief over the worst parts and then tucked it into his hand .      have a good blow     she suggested  and then carefully leaned out of range until the echoes of the blast had died away .      you can keep the hanky .  please     she added  meaning it wholeheartedly .     now tuck your shirt in .         yes  miss .         now  go downstairs and sweep all the teeth out of the circle .  can you do that .      banjo nodded .      what can you do .     susan prompted .   banjo concentrated .     sweep all the teeth out of the circle  miss .         good .  off you go .      susan watched him plod off  and then looked at the white doorway .  she was sure the wizard had only got as far as the sixth lock .   the room beyond the door was entirely white  and the mist that swirled at knee level deadened even the sound of her footsteps .   all there was was a bed .  it was a large four poster  old and dusty .   she thought it was unoccupied and then she saw the figure  lying among the mounds of pillows .  it looked very much like a frail old lady in a mobcap .   the old woman turned her head and smiled at susan .      hello  my dear .      susan couldn   t remember a grandmother .  her father   s mother had died when she was young  and the other side of the family   well  she   d never had a grandmother .  but this was the sort she   d have wanted .   the kind  the nasty realistic side of her mind said  that hardly ever existed .   susan thought she heard a child laugh .  and another one .  somewhere almost out of hearing  children were at play .  it was always a pleasant  lulling sound .   always provided  of course  you couldn   t hear the actual words .      no     said susan .      sorry  dear .     said the old lady .      you   re not the tooth fairy .     oh  no   there was even a damn patchwork quilt        oh  i am  dear .         oh  grandma  what big teeth you have   good grief  you   ve even got a shawl  oh dear .         i don   t understand  lovey           you forgot the rocking chair     said susan .     i always thought there   d be a rocking chair        there was a pop behind her  and then a dying creak creak .  she didn   t even turn round .      if you   ve included a kitten playing with a ball of wool it   ll go very hard with you     she said sternly  and picked up the candlestick by the bed .  it seemed heavy enough .      i don   t think you   re real     she said levelly .     there   s not a little old woman in a shawl running this place .  you   re out of my head .  that   s how you defend yourself   you poke around in people   s heads and find the things that work        she swung the candlestick .  it passed through the figure in the bed .      see .     she said .     you   re not even real .         oh  i am real  dear     said the old woman  as her outline changed .     the candlestick wasn   t .      susan looked down at the new shape .      nope     she said .     it   s horrible  but it doesn   t frighten me .  no  nor does that .     it changed again  and again .     no  nor does my father .  good grief  you   re scraping the bottom of the barrel  aren   t you .  i like spiders .  snakes don   t worry me .  dogs .  no .  rats are fine  i like rats .  sorry  is anyone frightened of that .      she grabbed at the thing and this time the shape stayed .  it looked like a small  wizened monkey  but with big deep eyes under a brow overhanging like a balcony .  its hair was gray and lank .  it struggled weakly in her grasp  and wheezed .      i don   t frighten easily     said susan     but you   d be amazed at how angry i can become .      the creature hung limp .      i   i       it muttered .   she let it down again .      you   re a bogeyman  aren   t you .     she said .   it collapsed in a heap when she took her hand way .         not a   the       it said .      what do you mean  the .     said susan .      the bogeyman     said the bogeyman .  and she saw how rangy it was  how white and gray streaked its hair  how the skin was stretched over the bones        the first bogeyman .         i   there were   i do remember when the land was different .  ice .  many times of   ice .  and the   what do you call them .     the creature wheezed .        the lands  the big lands   all different        susan sat down on the bed .      you mean continents .            all different .     the black sunken eyes glinted at her and suddenly the thing reared up  bony arms waving .     i was the dark in the cave .  i was the shadow in the trees .  you   ve heard about   the primal scream .  that was   at me .  i was       it folded up and started coughing .     and when   that thing  you know  that thing   all light and bright   lightning you could carry  hot  little sunshine  and then there was no more dark  just shadows  and then you made axes  axes in the forest  and then   and then        susan sat down on the bed .     there   s still plenty of bogeymen     she said .      hiding under beds .  lurking in cupboards .  but     it fought for breath     if you had seen me   in the old days   when they came down into the deep caves to draw their hunting pictures   i could roar in their heads   so that their stomachs dropped out of their bottoms           all the old skills are dying out     said susan gravely .         oh  others came later   they never knew that first fine terror .  all they knew     even whispering  the bogeyman managed to get a sneer in its voice     was dark corners .  i had been the dark .  i was the   first .  and now i was no better than them   frightening maids  curdling cream   hiding in shadows at the stub of the year   and then one night  i thought   why .      susan nodded .  bogeymen weren   t bright .  the moment of existential uncertainty probably took a lot longer in heads where the brain cells bounced so very slowly from one side of the skull to the other .  but   granddad had thought like that .  you hung around with humans long enough and you stopped being what they imagined you to be and wanted to become something of your own .  umbrellas and silver hairbrushes        you thought  what was the point of it all .     she said .         frightening children   lurking   and then i started to watch them .  didn   t really used to be children back in the ice times   just big humans  little humans  not children   and   and there was a different world in their heads   in their heads  that   s where the old days were now .  the old days .  when it was all young .         you came out from under the bed           i watched over them   kept    em safe        susan tried not to shudder .      and the teeth .         i   oh  you can   t leave teeth around  anyone might get them  do terrible things .  i liked them  i didn   t want anyone to hurt them       it bubbled .     i never wanted to hurt them  i just used to watch  i kept the teeth all safe   and  and  and sometimes i just sit here listening to them        it mumbled on .  susan listened in embarrassed amazement  not knowing whether to take pity on the thing or  and this was a developing option  to tread on it .         and the teeth   they remember        it started to shake .      the money .     susan prompted .     i don   t see many rich bogeymen around .            money everywhere   buried in holes   old treasure   back of sofas   it adds up   investments   money for the tooth  very important  part of the magic  makes it safe  makes it proper  otherwise it   s thieving   and i labeled    em all  and kept    em safe  and   and then i was old  but i found people       the tooth fairy sniggered  and for a moment susan felt sorry for the men in the ancient caves .     they don   t ask questions  do they .     it bubbled .        you give    em money and they all do their jobs and they don   t ask questions           it   s more than their job   s worth     said susan .         and then they came   stealing        susan gave in .  old gods do new jobs .      you look terrible .            thank you very much           i mean ill .            very old   all those men  too much effort        the bogeyman groaned .         you   don   t die here     it panted .     just get old  listening to the laughter        susan nodded .  it was in the air .  she couldn   t hear words  just a distant chatter  as if it was at the other end of a long corridor .         and this place   it grew up round me           the trees     said susan .     and the sky .  out of their heads              dying   the little children   you   ve got to        the figure faded .   susan sat for a while  listening to the distant chatter .   worlds of belief  she thought .  just like oysters .  a little piece of shit gets in and then a pearl grows up around it .   she got up and went downstairs .   banjo had found a broom and mop somewhere .  the circle was empty and  with surprising initiative  the man was carefully washing the chalk away .      banjo .         yes  miss .         you like it here .         there   s trees  miss .      that probably counts as a    yes     susan decided .      the sky doesn   t worry you .      he looked at her in puzzlement .      no  miss .         can you count  banjo .      he looked smug .      yes  miss .  on m   fingers  miss .         so you can count up to    .     susan prompted .      thirteen  miss     said banjo proudly .   she looked at his big hands .      good grief .      well  she thought  and why not .  he   s big and trustworthy and what other kind of life has he got .      i think it would be a good idea if you did the tooth fairy   s job  banjo .         will that be all right  miss .  won   t the tooth fairy mind .         you   do it until she comes back .         all right  miss .         i   ll   er   get people to keep an eye on you  until you get settled in .  i think food comes in on the cart .  you   re not to let people cheat you .     she looked at his hands and then up and up the lower slopes until she saw the peak of mount banjo  and added     not that i think they   ll try  mind you .         yes  miss .  i will keep things tidy  miss .  er        the big pink face looked at her .      yes  banjo .         can i have a puppy  miss .  i had a kitten once  miss  but our mam drowned it    cos it was dirty .      susan   s memory threw up a name .      a puppy called spot .         yes  miss .  spot  miss .         i think it   ll turn up quite soon  banjo .      he seemed to take this entirely on trust .      thank you  miss .         and now i   ve got to go .         right  miss .      she looked back up the tower .  death   s land might be dark  but when you were there you never thought anything bad was going to happen to you .  you were beyond the places where it could .  but here     when you were grown up you only feared  well  logical things .  poverty .  illness .  being found out .  at least you weren   t mad with terror because of something under the stairs .  the world wasn   t full of arbitrary light and shade .  the wonderful world of childhood .  well  it wasn   t a cutdown version of the adult one  that was certain .  it was more like the adult one written in big heavy letters .  everything was   more .  more everything .   she left banjo to his sweeping and stepped out into the perpetually sunlit world .   bilious and violet hurried toward her .  bilious was waving a branch like a club .      you don   t need that     said susan .  she wanted some sleep .      we talked about it and we thought we ought to come back and help     said bilious .      ah .  democratic courage     said susan .     well  they   re all gone .  to wherever they go .      bilious lowered the branch thankfully .      it wasn   t that       he began .      look  you two can make yourselves useful     said susan .     there   s a mess in there .  go and help banjo .         banjo .         he   s   more or less running the place now .      violet laughed .      but he   s           he   s in charge     said susan wearily .      all right     said bilious .     anyway  i   m sure we can tell him what to do           no .  too many people have told him what to do .  he knows what to do .  just help him get started  all right .  but           if the hogfather comes back now  you   ll vanish  won   t you .     she didn   t know how to phrase the question .      i   m  er  giving up my old job     said bilious .     er   i   m going to go on working as a holiday relief for the other gods .     he gave her a pleading look .      really .     susan looked at violet .  oh  well  maybe if she believes in him  at least   it might work .  you never know .      good     she said .     have fun .  now i   m going home .  this is a hell of a way to spend hogswatch .      she found binky waiting by the stream .      the auditors fluttered anxiously .  and  as always happens in their species when something goes radically wrong and needs fixing instantly  they settled down to try to work out who to blame .   one said  it was     and then it stopped .  the auditors lived by consensus  which made picking scapegoats a little problematical .  it brightened up .  after all  if everyone was to blame  then it was no one   s actual fault .  that   s what collective responsibility meant  after all .  it was more like bad luck  or something .   another said  unfortunately  people might get the wrong idea .  we may be asked questions .   one said  what about death .  he interfered  after all .   one said  er   not exactly .   one said  oh  come on .  he got the girl involved .   one said  er   no .  she got herself involved .   one said  yes  but he told her     one said  no .  he didn   t .  in fact he specifically did not tell     it paused  and then said  damn .   one said  on the other hand     the robes turned toward it .   yes .   one said  there   s no actual evidence .  nothing written down .  some humans got excited and decided to attack the tooth fairy   s country .  this is unfortunate  but nothing to do with us .  we are shocked  of course .   one said  there   s still the hogfather .  things are going to be noticed .  questions may be asked .   they hovered for a while  unspeaking .   eventually one said  we may have to take     it paused  loath even to think the word  but managed to continue   a risk .      bed  thought susan  as the mists rolled past her .  and in the morning  decent human things like coffee and porridge .  and bed .  real things     binky stopped .  she stared at his ears for a moment  and then urged him forward .  he whinnied  and didn   t budge .   a skeletal hand had grabbed his bridle .  death materialized .   it is not over .  more must be done .  they torment him still .   susan sagged .     what is .  who are .      move forward .  i will steer .  death climbed into the saddle and reached around her for the reins .      look  i went       susan began .   yes .  i know .  the control of belief  said death  as the horse moved forward again .  only a very simple mind could think of that .  magic so old it   s hardly magic .  what a simple way to make millions of children cease to believe in the hogfather .      and what were you doing .     susan demanded .   i too have done what i set out to do .  i have kept a space .  a million carpets with sooty boot marks  millions of filled stockings  all those roofs with runner marks on them   disbelief will find it hard going in the face of that .  albert says he never wants to drink another sherry for days .  the hogfather will have something to come back to  at least .      what have i got to do now .      you must bring the hogfather back .      oh  must i .  for peace and goodwill and the tinkling of fairy bells .  who cares .  he   s just some fat old clown who makes people feel smug at hogswatch .  i   ve been through all this for some old man who prowls around kids    bedrooms .      no .  so that the sun will rise .      what has astronomy got to do with the hogfather .      old gods do new jobs .      the senior wrangler wasn   t attending the feast .  he got one of the maids to bring a tray up to his rooms  where he was entertaining and doing all those things a man does when he finds himself unexpectedly t  te    t  te with the opposite sex  like trying to shine his boots on his trousers and clean his fingernails with his other fingernails .      a little more wine  gwendoline .  it   s hardly alcoholic     he said  leaning over her .      i don   t mind if i do  mr .  wrangler .         oh  call me horace  please .  and perhaps a little something for your chicken .         i   m afraid she seems to have wandered off somewhere     said the cheerful fairy .     i   m afraid i   m  i   m  i   m rather dull company       she blew her nose noisily .      oh  i certainly wouldn   t say that     said the senior wrangler .  he wished he   d had time to tidy up his rooms a bit  or at least get some of the more embarrassing bits of laundry off the stuffed rhinoceros .      everyone   s been so kind     said the cheerful fairy  dabbing at her streaming eyes .     who was the skinny one that kept making the funny faces for me .         that was the bursar .  why don   t you           he seemed very cheerful  anyway .         it   s the dried frog pills  he eats them by the handful     said the senior wrangler dismissively .     i say  why don   t           oh dear .  i hope they   re not addictive .         i   m sure he wouldn   t keep on eating them if they were addictive     said the senior wrangler .     now  why don   t you have another glass of wine  and then   and then       a happy thought struck him       and then   and then perhaps i could show you archchancellor bowell   s remembrance .  it   s got a a a a very interesting ceiling .  my word  yes .         that would be very nice     said the cheerful fairy .     would it cheer me up  do you think .         oh  it would  it would     said the senior wrangler .     definitely .  good .  so i   ll  er  i   ll just go and   just go and   i   ll       he pointed vaguely in the direction of his dressing room  while hopping from one foot to the other .     i   ll just go and  er   go   just        he fled into the dressing room and slammed the door behind him .  his wild eyes scanned the shelves and hangers .      clean robe     he mumbled .     comb face  wash socks  fresh hair  where   s that insteadofshave lotion        from the other side of the door came the adorable sound of the cheerful fairy blowing her nose .  from this side came the sound of the senior wrangler   s muffled scream as  made careless by haste and a very poor sense of smell  he mistakenly splashed his face with the turpentine he used for treating his feet .   somewhere overhead a very small plump child with a bow and arrow and ridiculously unaerodynamic wings buzzed ineffectually against a shut window on which the frost was tracing the outline of a rather handsome auriental lady .  the other window already had an icy picture of a vase of sunflowers .      in the great hall one of the tables had already collapsed .  it was one of the customs of the feast that although there were many courses each wizard went at his own speed  a tradition instituted to prevent the slow ones holding everyone else up .  and they could also have seconds if they wished  so that if a wizard was particularly attracted to soup he could go round and round for an hour before starting on the preliminary stages of the fish courses .      how   re you feeling now  old chap .     said the dean  who was sitting next to the bursar .     back on the dried frog pills .         i  er  i  er  no  i   m not too bad     said the bursar .     it was  of course  rather a  rather a shock when           that   s a shame  because here   s your hogswatch present     said the dean  passing over a small box .  it rattled .     you can open it now if you like .         oh  well  how nice           it   s from me     said the dean .      what a lovely           i bought it with my own money  you know     said the dean  waving a turkey leg airily .      the wrapping paper is a very nice           more than a dollar  i might add .         my goodness        the bursar pulled off the last of the wrapping paper .      it   s a box for keeping dried frog pills in .  see .  it   s got    dried frog pills    on it  see .      the bursar shook it .     oh  how nice     he said weakly .     it   s got some pills in it already .  how thoughtful .  they will come in handy .         yes     said the dean .     i took them off your dressing table .  after all  i was down a dollar as it was .      the bursar nodded gratefully and put the little box neatly beside his plate .  they   d actually allowed him knives this evening .  they   d actually allowed him to eat other things than those things that could only be scraped up with a wooden spoon .   he eyed the nearest roast pig with nervous anticipation  and tucked his napkin firmly under his chin .      er  excuse me  mr .  stibbons     he quavered .     would you be so good as to pass me the apple sauce tankard        there was a sound like coarse fabric ripping  somewhere in the air in front of the bursar  and a crash as something landed on top of the roast pig .  roast potatoes and gravy filled the air .  the apple that had been in the pig   s mouth was violently expelled and hit the bursar on the forehead .   he blinked  looked down  and found he was about to plunge his fork into a human head .      ahaha     he murmured  as his eyes started to glaze .   the wizards heaved aside the overturned dishes and smashed crockery .      he just fell out of the air .         is he an assassin .  not one of their student pranks  is it .         why   s he holding a sword without a sharp bit .         is he dead .         i think so .         i didn   t even have any of that salmon mousse .  will you look at it .  his foot   s in it .  it   s all over the place .  do you want yours .      ponder stibbons fought his way through the throng .  he knew his more senior fellows when they were feeling helpful .  they were like a glass of water to a drowning man .      give him air .     he protested .      how do we know if he needs any .     said the dean .   ponder put his ear to the fallen youth   s chest .      he   s not breathing .         breathing spell  breathing spell     muttered the chair of indefinite studies .     er   spolt   s forthright respirator  perhaps .  i think i   ve got it written down somewhere        ridcully reached through the wizards and pulled out the black clad man by a leg .  he held him upside down in his big hand and thumped him heavily on the back .   he met their astonished gaze .     used to do this on the farm     he said .     works a treat on baby goats .         oh  now  really     said the dean     i don   t        the corpse made a noise somewhere between a choke and a cough .      make some space  you fellows .     the archchancellor bellowed  clearing an area of table with one sweep of his spare arm .      hey  i hadn   t had any of that prawn escoff   .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i didn   t even know we had any     said the chair of indefinite studies .     someone  and i name no names  dean  shoved it behind the soft shelled crabs so they could keep it for themselves .  i call that cheap .      teatime opened his eyes .  it said a lot for his constitution that it survived a very close up view of ridcully   s nose  which filled the immediate universe like a big pink planet .      excuse me  excuse me     said ponder  leaning over with his notebook open     but this is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy .  did you see any bright lights .  was there a shining tunnel .  did any deceased relatives attempt to speak to you .  what word most describes the        ridcully pulled him away .      what   s all this  mr .  stibbons .         i really should talk to him  sir .  he   s had a near death experience .         we all have .  it   s called    living        said the archchancellor shortly .     pour the poor lad a glass of spirits and put that damn pencil away .         uh   this must be unseen university .     said teatime .     and you are all wizards .         now  just you lie still     said ridcully .  but teatime had already risen on his elbows .      there was a sword     he muttered .      oh  it   s fallen on the floor     said the dean  reaching down .     but it looks as though it   s   did i do that .      the wizards looked at the large curved slice of table falling away .  something had cut through everything   wood  cloth  plates  cutlery  food .  the dean swore that a candle flame that had been in the path of the unseen blade was only half a flame for a moment  until the wick realized that this was no way to behave .   the dean raised his hand .  the other wizards scattered .      looks like a thin blue line in the air     he said  wonderingly .      excuse me  sir     said teatime  taking it from him .     i really must be off .      he ran from the hall .      he won   t get far     said the lecturer in recent runes .     the main doors are locked in accordance with archchancellor spode   s rules .         won   t get far while holding a sword that appears to be able to cut through anything     said ridcully  to the sound of falling wood .      i wonder what all that was about .     said the chair of indefinite studies  and then turned his attention to the remains of the feast .     anyway  at least this joint   s been nicely carved           bu bu bu        they all turned .  the bursar was holding his hand in front of him .  the cut surface of a fork gleamed at the wizards .      nice to know his new present will come in handy     said the dean .     it   s the thought that counts .      under the table the blue hen of happiness relieved itself on the bursar   s foot .      there are   enemies  said death  as binky galloped through icy mountains .      they   re all dead        other enemies .  you may as well know this .  down in the deepest kingdoms of the sea  where there is no light  there lives a type of creature with no brain and no eyes and no mouth .  it does nothing but live and put forth petals of perfect crimson where none are there to see .  it is nothing except a tiny yes in the night .  and yet   and yet   it has enemies that bear on it a vicious  unbending malice  who wish not only for its tiny life to be over but also that it had never existed .  are you with me so far .      well  yes  but        good .  now  imagine what they think of humanity .   susan was shocked .  she had never heard her grandfather speak in anything other than calm tones .  now there was a cutting edge in his words .      what are they .     she said .   we must hurry .  there is not much time .      i thought you always had time .  i mean   whatever it is you want to stop  you can go back in time and        and meddle .      you   ve done it before        this time it is others who are doing it .  and they have no right .      what others .      they have no name .  call them the auditors .  they run the universe .  they see to it that gravity works and the atoms spin  or whatever it is atoms do .  and they hate life .      why .      it is   irregular .  it was never supposed to happen .  they like stones  moving in curves .  and they hate humans most of all .  death sighed .  in many ways  they lack a sense of humor .      why the hog        it is the things you believe which make you human .  good things and bad things  it   s all the same .   the mists parted .  sharp peaks were around them  lit by the glow off the snow .      these look like the mountains where the castle of bones was     she said .   they are  said death .  in a sense .  he has gone back to a place he knows .  an early place     binky cantered low over the snow .      and what are we looking for .     said susan .   you will know when you see it .      snow .  trees .  i mean  could i have a clue .  what are we here for .      i told you .  to ensure that the sun comes up .      of course the sun will come up .      no .      there   s no magic that   ll stop the sun coming up .      i wish i was as clever as you .   susan stared down out of sheer annoyance  and saw something below .   small dark shapes moved across the whiteness  running as if they were in pursuit of something .      there   s   some sort of chase       she conceded .     i can see some sort of animals but i can   t see what they   re after        then she saw movement in the snow  a blurred  dark shape dodging and skidding and never clear .  binky dropped until his hooves grazed the tops of the pine trees  which bent in his wake .  a rumble followed him across the forest  dragging broken branches and a smoke of snow behind it .   now they were lower she could see the hunters clearly .  they were large dogs .  their quarry was indistinct  dodging among snowdrifts  keeping to the cover of snow laden bushes     a drift exploded .  something big and long and blue black rose through the flying snow like a sounding whale .      it   s a pig .      a boar .  they drive it toward the cliff .  they   re desperate now .   she could hear the panting of the creature .  the dogs made no sound at all .   blood streamed onto the snow from the wounds they had already managed to inflict .      this   boar     said susan .        it   s        yes .      they want to kill the hogf        not kill .  he knows how to die .  oh  yes   in this shape  he knows how to die .  he   s had a lot of experience .  no  they want to take away his real life  take away his soul  take away everything .  they must not be allowed to bring him down .      well  stop them .      you must .  this is a human thing .   the dogs moved oddly .  they weren   t running but flowing  crossing the snow faster than the mere movement of their legs would suggest .      they don   t look like real dogs        no .      what can i do .      death nodded his head toward the boar .  binky was keeping level with it now  barely a few feet away .   realization dawned .      i can   t ride that .     said susan .   why not .  you have had an education .      enough to know that pigs don   t let people ride them .      mere accumulation of observational evidence is not proof .   susan glanced ahead .  the snow field had a cut off look .   you must  said her grandfather   s voice in her head .  when he reaches the edge there he will stand at bay .  he must not .  understand .  these are not real dogs .  if they catch him he won   t just die  he will   never be     susan leapt .  for a moment she floated through the air  dress streaming behind her  arms outstretched     landing on the animal   s back was like hitting a very  very firm chair .  it stumbled for a moment and then righted itself .   susan   s arms clung to its neck and her face was buried in its sharp bristles .  she could feel the heat under her .  it was like riding a furnace .  and it stank of sweat  and blood  and pig .  a lot of pig .   there was a lack of landscape in front of her .   the boar plowed into the snow on the edge of the drop  almost flinging her off  and turned to face the hounds .   there were a lot of them .  susan was familiar with dogs .  they   d had them at home like other houses had rugs .  and these weren   t that big floppy sort .   she rammed her heels in and grabbed a pig   s ear in each hand .  it was like holding a pair of hairy shovels .      turn left .     she screamed  and hauled .   she put everything into the command .  it promised tears before bedtime if disobeyed .   to her amazement the boar grunted  pranced on the lip of the precipice and scrambled away  the hounds floundering as they turned to follow .   this was a plateau .  from here it seemed to be all edge  with no way down except the very simple and terminal one .   the dogs were flying at the boar   s heels again .   susan looked around in the gray  lightless air .  there had to be somewhere  some way     there was .   it was a shoulder of rock  a giant knife edge connecting this plain to the hills beyond .  it was sharp and narrow  a thin line of snow with chilly depths on either side .   it was better than nothing .  it was nothing with snow on it .   the boar reached the edge and hesitated .  susan put her head down and dug her heels in again .   snout down  legs moving like pistons  the beast plunged out onto the ridge .  snow sprayed up as its trotters sought for purchase .  it made up for lack of grace by sheer manic effort  legs moving like a tap dancer climbing a moving staircase that was heading down .      that   s right  that   s right  that   s        a trotter slipped .  for a moment the boar seemed to stand on two  the others scrabbling at icy rock .  susan flung herself the other way  clinging to the neck  and felt the dragging abyss under her feet .   there was nothing there .   she told herself  he   ll catch me if i fall  he   ll catch me if i fall  he   ll catch me if i fall     powdered ice made her eyes sting .  a flailing trotter almost slammed against her head .   an older voice said  no  he won   t .  if i fall now i don   t deserve to be caught .   the creature   s eye was inches away .  and then she knew        out of the depths of eyes of all but the most unusual of animals comes an echo .  out of the dark eye in front of her  someone looked back     a foot caught the rock and she concentrated her whole being on it  kicking herself upward in one last effort .  pig and woman rocked for a moment and then a trotter caught a footing and the boar plunged forward along the ridge .   susan risked a look behind .   the dogs still moved oddly .  there was a slight jerkiness about their movements  as if they flowed from position to position rather than moved by ordinary muscles .   not dogs  she thought .  dog shapes .   there was another shock underfoot .  snow flew up .  the world tilted .  she felt the shape of the boar change when its muscles bunched and sent it soaring as a slab of ice and rock came away and began the long slide into darkness .   susan was thrown off when the creature landed  and tumbled into deep snow .  she flailed around madly  expecting at any minute to begin sliding .   instead her hand found a snow encrusted branch .  a few feet away the boar lay on its side  steaming and panting .   she pulled herself upright .  the spur here had widened out into a hill  with a few frosted trees on it .   the dogs had reached the gap and were milling round  struggling to prevent themselves slipping .   they could easily clear the distance  she could see .  even the boar had managed it with her on its back .  she put both hands around the branch and heaved  it came away with a crack  like a broken icicle  and she waved it like a club .      come on     she said .     jump .  just you try it .  come on .      one did .  the branch caught it as it landed  and then susan spun and brought the branch back on the upswing  lifting the dazed animal off its feet and out over the edge .   for a moment the shape wavered and then  howling  it dropped out of sight .   she danced a few steps of rage and triumph .      yes .  yes .  who wants some .  anyone else .      the other dogs looked her in the eye  decided that no one did  and that there wasn   t .  finally  after one or two nervous attempts  they managed to turn  still sliding  and tried to make it back to the plateau .   a figure barred their way .   it hadn   t been there a moment ago but it looked permanent now .  it seemed to have been made of snow  three balls of snow piled on one another .  it had black dots for eyes .  a semicircle of more dots formed the semblance of a mouth .  there was a carrot for the nose .   and  for the arms  two twigs .   at this distance  anyway .   one of them was holding a curved stick .   a raven wearing a damp piece of red paper landed on one arm .      bob bob bob .     it suggested .     merry solstice .  tweetie tweet .  what are you waiting for .  hogswatch .      the dogs backed away .   the snow broke off the snowman in chunks  revealing a gaunt figure in a flapping black robe .   death spat out the carrot .   ho .  ho .  ho .   the gray bodies smeared and rippled as the hounds sought desperately to change their shape .   you couldn   t resist it .  in the end .  a mistake  i fancy .   he touched the scythe .  there was a click as the blade flashed into life .   it gets under your skin  life  said death  stepping forward .  speaking metaphorically  of course .  it   s a habit that   s hard to give up .  one puff of breath is never enough .  you   ll find you want to take another .   a dog started to slip on the snow and scrabbled desperately to save itself from the long  cold drop .   and  you see  the more you struggle for every moment  the more alive you stay   which is where i come in  as a matter of fact .   the leading dog managed  for a moment  to become a gray cowled figure before being dragged back into shape .   fear  too  is an anchor  said death .  all those senses  wide open to every fragment of the world .  that beating heart .  that rush of blood .  can you not feel it  dragging you back .   once again the auditor managed to retain a shape for a few seconds  and managed to say  you cannot do this  there are rules .   yes .  there are rules .  but you broke them .  how dare you .  how dare you .   the scythe blade was a thin blue outline in the gray light .   death raised a thin finger to where his lips might have been  and suddenly looked thoughtful .   and now there remains only one final question  he said .   he raised his hands  and seemed to grow .  light flared in his eye sockets .  when he spoke next  avalanches fell in the mountains .   have you been naughty   or nice .   ho .  ho .  ho .   susan heard the wails die away .   the boar lay in white snow that was now red with blood .  she knelt down and tried to lift its head .   it was dead .  one eye stared at nothing .  the tongue lolled .   sobs welled up inside her .  the tiny part of susan that watched  the inner baby sitter  said it was just exhaustion and excitement and the backwash of adrenaline .  she couldn   t be crying over a dead pig .   the rest of her drummed on its flank with both fists .      no  you can   t .  we saved you .  dying isn   t how it   s supposed to go .      a breeze blew up .   something stirred in the landscape  something under the snow .  the branches on the ancient trees shook gently  dislodging little needles of ice .   the sun rose .   the light streamed over susan like a silent gale .  it was dazzling .  she crouched back  raising her forearm to cover her eyes .  the great red ball turned frost to fire along the winter branches .   gold light slammed into the mountain peaks  making every one a blinding  silent volcano .  it rolled onward  gushing into the valleys and thundering up the slopes  unstoppable     there was a groan .   a man lay in the snow where the boar had been .   he was naked except for an animal skin loincloth .  his hair was long and had been woven into a thick plait down his back  so matted with blood and grease that it looked like felt .  and he was bleeding everywhere the hounds had caught him .   susan watched for a moment  and then  thinking with something other than her head  methodically tore some strips from her petticoat to bandage the more unpleasant wounds .   capability  said the small part of her mind .  a rational head in emergencies .   rational something  anyway .   it   s probably some kind of character flaw .   the man was tattooed .  blue whorls and spirals haunted his skin  under the blood .   he opened his eyes and stared at the sky .      can you get up .      his gaze flicked to her .  he tried moving and then fell back .   eventually she managed to pull the man up into a sitting position .  he swayed as she put one of his arms across her shoulders and then heaved him to his feet .  she did her best to ignore the stink  which had an almost physical force .   downhill seemed the best option .  even if his brain wasn   t working yet  his feet seemed to get the idea .   they lurched down through the freezing woods  the snow glowing orange in the risen sun .  cold blue gloom lurked in hollows like little cups of winter .   beside her  the tattooed man made a gurgling sound .  he slipped out of her grasp and landed on his knees in the snow  clutching at his throat and choking .  his breath sounded like a saw .      what now .  what   s the matter .  what   s the matter .      he rolled his eyes at her and pawed at his throat again .      something stuck .     she slapped him as hard as she could on the back  but now he was on his hands and knees  fighting for breath .   she put her hands under his shoulders and pulled him upright  and put her arms around his waist .  oh  gods  how was it supposed to go  she   d gone to classes about it  now  didn   t you have to bunch up one fist and then put the other hand around it and then pull up and in like this     the man coughed and something bounced off a tree and landed in the snow .   she knelt down to have a look .   it was a small black bean .   a bird trilled  high on a branch .  she looked up .  a wren bobbed at her and fluttered to another twig .   when she looked back  the man was different .  he had clothes now  heavy furs  with a fur hood and fur boots .  he was supporting himself on a stone tipped spear  and looked a lot stronger .   something hurried through the wood  barely visible except by its shadow .  for a moment she glimpsed a white hare before it sprang away on a new path .   she looked back .  now the furs had gone and the man looked older  although he had the same eyes .  he was wearing thick white robes  and looked very much like a priest .   when a bird called again she didn   t look away .  and she realized that she   d been mistaken in thinking that the man changed like the turning of pages .  all the images were there at once  and many others  too .  what you saw depended on how you looked .   yes .  it   s a good job i   m cool and totally used to this sort of thing  she thought .  otherwise i   d be rather worried     now they were at the edge of the forest .   a little way off  four huge boars stood and steamed  in front of a sleigh that looked as if it had been put together out of crudely trimmed trees .  there were faces in the blackened wood  possibly carved by stone  possibly carved by rain and wind .   the hogfather climbed aboard and sat down .  he   d put on weight in the last few yards and now it was almost impossible to see anything other than the huge  red robed man  ice crystals settling here and there on the cloth .  only in the occasional sparkle of frost was there a hint of hair or tusk .   he shifted on the seat and then reached down to extricate a false beard  which he held up questioningly .   sorry  said a voice behind susan .  that was mine .   the hogfather nodded at death  as one craftsman to another  and then at susan .  she wasn   t sure if she was being thanked   it was more a gesture of recognition  of acknowledgment that something that needed doing had indeed been done .  but it felt like thanks .   then he shook the reins and clicked his teeth and the sleigh slid away .   they watched it go .      i remember hearing     said susan distantly     that the idea of the hogfather wearing a red and white outfit was invented quite recently .      no .  it was remembered .   now the hogfather was a red dot on the other side of the valley .      well  that about wraps it up for this dress     said susan .     i   d just like to ask  just out of academic interest   you were sure i was going to survive  were you .      i was quite confident .      oh  good .      i will give you a lift back  said death  after a while .      thank you .  now   tell me        what would have happened if you hadn   t saved him .      yes .  the sun would have risen just the same  yes .      no .      oh  come on .  you can   t expect me to believe that .  it   s an astronomical fact .      the sun would not have risen .   she turned on him .      it   s been a long night  grandfather .  i   m tired and i need a bath .  i don   t need silliness .      the sun would not have risen .      really .  then what would have happened  pray .      a mere ball of flaming gas would have illuminated the world .   they walked in silence for a moment .      ah     said susan dully .     trickery with words .  i would have thought you   d have been more literal minded than that .      i am nothing if not literal minded .  trickery with words is where humans live .      all right     said susan .     i   m not stupid .  you   re saying humans need   fantasies to make life bearable .      really .  as if it was some kind of pink pill .  no .  humans need fantasy to be human .  to be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape .      tooth fairies .  hogfathers .  little        yes .  as practice .  you have to start out learning to believe the little lies .      so we can believe the big ones .      yes .  justice .  mercy .  duty .  that sort of thing .      they   re not the same at all .      you think so .  then take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice  one molecule of mercy .  and yet   death waved a hand .  and yet you act as if there is some ideal order in the world  as if there is some   some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged .      yes  but people have got to believe that  or what   s the point        my point exactly .   she tried to assemble her thoughts .   there is a place where two galaxies have been colliding for a million years  said death  apropos of nothing .  don   t try to tell me that   s right .      yes  but people don   t think about that     said susan .     somewhere there was a bed        correct .  stars explode  worlds collide  there   s hardly anywhere in the universe where humans can live without being frozen or fried  and yet you believe that a   a bed is a normal thing .  it is the most amazing talent .      talent .      oh  yes .  a very special kind of stupidity .  you think the whole universe is inside your heads .      you make us sound mad     said susan .  a nice warm bed     no .  you need to believe in things that aren   t true .  how else can they become .  said death  helping her up onto binky .      these mountains     said susan  as the horse rose .     are they real mountains  or some sort of shadows .      yes .   susan knew that was all she was going to get .      er   i lost the sword .  it   s somewhere in the tooth fairy   s country .      death shrugged .  i can make another .      can you .      oh  yes .  it will give me something to do .  don   t worry about it .      the senior wrangler hummed cheerfully to himself as he ran a comb through his beard for the second time and liberally sprinkled it with what would turn out to be a preparation of weasel extract for demon removal rather than  as he had assumed  a pleasant masculine scent .   then he stepped out into his study .      sorry for the delay  but       he began .   there was no one there .  only  very far off  the sound of someone blowing their nose mingling with the glingleglingleglingle of fading magic .      the light was already gilding the top of the tower of art when binky trotted to a standstill on the air beside the nursery balcony .  susan climbed down onto the fresh snow and stood uncertainly for a moment .  when someone has gone out of their way to drop you home it   s only courteous to ask them in .  on the other hand     would you like to visit for hogswatch dinner .  said death .  he sounded hopeful .  albert is frying a pudding .      frying a pudding .      albert understands frying .  and i believe he   s making jam .  he certainly kept talking about it .      i   er   they   re really expecting me here     said susan .     the gaiters do a lot of entertaining .  his business friends .  probably the whole day will be   i   ll more or less have to look after the children        someone should .      er   would you like a drink before you go .     said susan  giving in .   a cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances .      right .  there   s biscuits in the tin on the mantelpiece .      susan headed with relief into the tiny kitchen .   death sat down in the creaking wicker chair  buried his feet in the rug and looked around with interest .  he heard the clatter of cups  and then a sound like indrawn breath  and then silence .   death helped himself to a biscuit from the tin .  there were two full stockings hanging from the mantelpiece .  he prodded them with professional satisfaction  and then sat down again and observed the nursery wallpaper .  it seemed to be pictures of rabbits in waistcoats  among other fauna .  he was not surprised .  death occasionally turned up in person even for rabbits  simply to see that the whole process was working properly .  he   d never seen one wearing a waistcoat .  he wouldn   t have expected waistcoats .  at least  he wouldn   t have expected waistcoats if he hadn   t had some experience of the way humans portrayed the universe .  as it was  it was only a blessing they hadn   t been given gold watches and top hats as well .   humans liked dancing pigs  too .  and lambs in hats .  as far as death was aware  the sole reason for any human association with pigs and lambs was as a prelude to chops and sausages .  quite why they should dress up for children   s wallpaper as well was a mystery .  hello  little folk  this is what you   re going to eat   he felt that if only he could find the key to it  he   d know a lot more about human beings .   his gaze traveled to the door .  susan   s governess coat and hat were hanging on it .  the coat was gray  and so was the hat .  gray and round and dull .  death didn   t know many things about the human psyche  but he did know protective coloration when he saw it .   dullness .  only humans could have invented it .  what imaginations they had .   the door opened .   to his horror  death saw a small child of unidentifiable sex come out of the bedroom  amble sleepily across the floor and unhook the stockings from the mantelpiece .  it was halfway back before it noticed him and then it simply stopped and regarded him thoughtfully .   he knew that young children could see him because they hadn   t yet developed that convenient and selective blindness that comes with the intimation of personal mortality .  he felt a little embarrassed .      susan   s gotta poker  you know     it said  as if anxious to be helpful .   well  well .  indeed .  my goodness me .      i fort   thought all of you knew that now .  larst   last week she picked a bogey up by its nose .      death tried to imagine this .  he felt sure he   d heard the sentence wrong  but it didn   t sound a whole lot better however he rearranged the words .      i   ll give gawain his stocking and then i   ll come an    watch     said the child .  it padded out .   er   susan .  death said  calling in reinforcements .   susan backed out of the kitchen  a black kettle in her hand .   there was a figure behind her .  in the half light the sword gleamed blue along its blade .  its glitter reflected off one glass eye .      well  well     said teatime  quietly  glancing at death .     now this is unexpected .  a family affair .      the sword hummed back and forth .      i wonder     said teatime     is it possible to kill death .  this must be a very special sword and it certainly works here       he raised a hand to his mouth for a moment and gave a little chuckle .     and of course it might well not be regarded as murder .  possibly it is a civic act .  it would be  as they say  the big one .  stand up  sir .  you may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability but i   m pretty certain that susan here would quite definitely die  so i   d rather you didn   t try any last minute stuff .      i am last minute stuff  said death  standing up .   teatime circled around carefully  the sword   s tip making little curves in the air .   from the next room came the sound of someone trying to blow a whistle quietly .   susan glanced at her grandfather .      i don   t remember them asking for anything that made a noise     she said .   oh  there has to be something in the stocking that makes a noise  said death .  otherwise what is      a . m .  for .      there are children .     said teatime .     oh  yes  of course .  call them .         certainly not .         it will be instructive     said teatime .     educational .  and when your adversary is death  you cannot help but be the good guy .      he pointed the sword at susan .      i said call them .      susan glanced hopefully at her grandfather .  he nodded .  for a moment she thought she saw the glow in one eye socket flicker off and on  death   s equivalent of a wink .  he   s got a plan .  he can stop time .  he can do anything .  he   s got a plan .      gawain .  twyla .      the muffled noises stopped in the next room .  there was a padding of feet and two solemn faces appeared round the door .      ah  come in  come in  curly haired tots     said teatime genially .   gawain gave him a steely stare .   his next mistake  thought susan .  if he   d called them little bastards he   d have them bang on his side .  but they know when you   re sending them up .      i   ve caught this bogeyman     said teatime .     what shall we do with him  eh .      the two faces turned to death .  twyla put her thumb in her mouth .      it   s only a skeleton     said gawain critically .   susan opened her mouth  and the sword swung toward her .  she shut it again .      yes  a nasty  creepy  horrible skeleton     said teatime .     scary  eh .      there was a very faint pop as twyla took her thumb out of her mouth .      he   s eating a bittit     she said .      biscuit     susan corrected automatically .  she started to swing the kettle in an absentminded way .      a creepy bony man in a black robe .     said teatime  aware that things weren   t going in quite the right direction .   he spun round to face susan .     you   re fidgeting with that kettle     he said .     so i expect you   re thinking of doing something creative .  put it down  please .  slowly .      susan knelt down gently and put the kettle on the hearth .      huh  that   s not very creepy  it   s just bones     said gawain dismissively .     and anyway willie the groom down at the stables has promised me a real horse skull .  and anyway i   m going to make a hat out of it like general tacticus had when he wanted to frighten people .  and anyway it   s just standing there .  it   s not even making woo woo noises .  and anyway you   re creepy .  your eye   s weird .         really .  then let   s see how creepy i can be     said teatime .  blue fire crackled along the sword as he raised it .   susan closed her hand over the poker .   teatime saw her start to turn .  he stepped behind death  sword raised     susan threw the poker overarm .  it made a ripping noise as it shot through the air  and trailed sparks .   it hit death   s robe and vanished .   he blinked .   teatime smiled at susan .   he turned and peered dreamily at the sword in his hand .   it fell out of his fingers .   death turned and caught it by the handle as it tumbled  and turned its fall into an upward curve .   teatime looked down at the poker in his chest as he folded up .      oh  no     he said .     it couldn   t have gone through you .  there are so many ribs and things .      there was another pop as twyla extracted her thumb and said     it only kills monsters .         stop time now     commanded susan .   death snapped his fingers .  the room took on the grayish purple of stationary time .  the clock paused its ticking .      you winked at me .  i thought you had a plan .      indeed .  oh  yes .  i planned to see what you would do .      just that .      you are very resourceful .  and of course you have had an education .      what .      i did add the sparkly stars and the noise  though .  i thought they would be appropriate .      and if i hadn   t done anything .      i daresay i would have thought of something .  at the last minute .      that was the last minute .      there is always time for another last minute .      the children had to watch that .      educational .  the world will teach them about monsters soon enough .  let them remember there   s always the poker .      but they saw he   s human        i think they had a very good idea of what he was .   death prodded the fallen teatime with his foot .   stop playing dead  mister teh ah tim eh .   the ghost of the assassin sprang up like a jack in the box  all slightly crazed smiles .      you got it right .      of course .   teatime began to fade .   i   ll take the body  said death .  that will prevent inconvenient questions .      what did he do it all for .     said susan .     i mean  why .  money .  power .      some people will do anything for the sheer fascination of doing it  said death .  or for fame .  or because they shouldn   t .   death picked up the corpse and slung it over his shoulder .  there was a sound of something bouncing on the hearth .  he turned  and hesitated .   er   you did know the poker would go through me .   susan realized she was shaking .      of course .  in this room it   s pretty powerful .      you were never in any doubt .   susan hesitated  and then smiled .      i was quite confident     she said .   ah .  her grandfather stared at her for a moment and she thought she detected just the tiniest flicker of uncertainty .  of course .  of course .  tell me  are you likely to take up teaching on a larger scale .      i hadn   t planned to .      death turned toward the balcony  and then seemed to remember something else .  he fumbled inside his robe .   i have made this for you .   she reached out and took a square of damp cardboard .  water dripped off the bottom .  somewhere in the middle  a few brown feathers seemed to have been glued on .      thank you .  er   what is it .      albert said there ought to be snow on it  but it appears to have melted  said death .  it is  of course  a hogswatch card .      oh        there should have been a robin on it as well  but i had considerable difficulty in getting it to stay on .      ah        it was not at all co operative .      really    .      it did not seem to get into the hogswatch spirit at all .      oh .  er .  good .  granddad .      yes .      why .  i mean  why did you do all this .      he stood quite still for a moment  as if he was trying out sentences in his mind .   i think it   s something to do with harvests  he said at last .  yes .  that   s right .  and because humans are so interesting that they have even invented dullness .  quite astonishing .      oh .      well then   happy hogswatch .      yes .  happy hogswatch .      death paused again  at the window .   and good night  children   everywhere .      the raven fluttered down onto a log covered in snow .  its prosthetic red breast had been torn and fluttered uselessly behind it .      not so much as a lift home     it muttered .     look at this  willya .  snow and frozen wastes  everywhere .  i couldn   t fly another damn inch .  i could starve to death here  you know .  hah .  people   re going on about recycling the whole time  but you just try a bit of practical ecology and they just   don   t   want   to   know .  hah .  i bet a robin   d have a lift home .  oh  yes .      squeak  said the death of rats sympathetically  and sniffed .   the raven watched the small hooded figure scrabble at the snow .      so i   ll just freeze to death here  shall i .     it said gloomily .     a pathetic bundle of feathers with my little feet curled up with the cold .  it   s not even as if i   m gonna make anyone a good meal  and let me tell you it   s a disgrace to die thin in my spec        it became aware that under the snow was a rather grubbier whiteness .  further scraping by the rat exposed something that could very possibly have been an ear .   the raven stared .     it   s a sheep .     it said .   the death of rats nodded .      a whole sheep .       squeak .      oh  wow .     said the raven  hopping forward with its eyes spinning .     hey  it   s barely cool .      the death of rats patted it happily on a wing .   squeak eek .  eek squeak        why  thanks .  and the same to you           far  far away and a long  long time ago  a shop door opened .  the little toy maker bustled in from the workshop in the rear  and then stopped  with amazing foresight  dead .   you have a big wooden rocking horse in the window  said the new customer .      ah  yes  yes  yes .     the shopkeeper fiddled nervously with his square rimmed spectacles .  he hadn   t heard the bell  and this was worrying him .     but i   m afraid that   s just for show  that is a special order for lord        no .  i will buy it .      no  because  you see        there are other toys .      yes  indeed  but        then i will take the horse .  how much would this lordship have paid you .      er  we   d agreed twelve dollars but        i will give you fifty  said the customer .   the little shopkeeper stopped in mid remonstrate and started up in mid greed .  there were other toys  he told himself quickly .  and this customer  he thought with considerable prescience  looked like someone who did not take no for an answer and seldom even bothered to ask the question .  lord selachii would be angry  but lord selachii wasn   t here .  the stranger  on the other hand  was here .  incredibly here .      er   well  in the circumstances   er   shall i wrap it up for you .      no .  i will take it as it is .  thank you .  i will leave via the back way  if it   s all the same to you .      er   how did you get in .     said the shopkeeper  pulling the horse out of the window .   through the wall .  so much more convenient than chimneys  don   t you think .   the apparition dropped a small clinking bag on the counter and lifted the horse easily .  the shopkeeper wasn   t in a position to hold onto anything .  even yesterday   s dinner was threatening to leave him .   the figure looked at the other shelves .   you make good toys .      er   thank you .      incidentally  said the customer  as he left  there is a small boy out there with his nose frozen to the window .  some warm water should do the trick .   death walked out to where binky was waiting in the snow and tied the toy horse behind the saddle .   albert will be very pleased .  i can   t wait to see his face .  ho .  ho .  ho .      as the light of hogswatch slid down the towers of unseen university  the librarian slipped into the great hall with some sheet music clenched firmly in his feet .   as the light of hogswatch lit the towers of unseen university  the archchancellor sat down with a sigh in his study and pulled off his boots .   it had been a damn long night  no doubt about it .  lots of strange things .  first time he   d ever seen the senior wrangler burst into tears  for one thing .   ridcully glanced at the door to the new bathroom .  well  he   d sorted out the teething troubles  and a nice warm shower would be very refreshing .  and then he could go along to the organ recital all nice and clean .   he removed his hat  and someone fell out of it with a tinkling sound .  a small gnome rolled across the floor .      oh  another one .  i thought we   d got rid of you fellows     said ridcully .     and what are you .      the gnome looked at him nervously .      er   you know whenever there was another magical appearance you heard the sound of  er  bells .     it said .  its expression suggested it was owning up to something it just knew was going to get it a smack .      yes .      the gnome held up some rather small hand bells and waved them nervously .  they went glingleglingleglingle  in a very sad way .      good  eh .  that was me .  i   m the glingleglingleglingle fairy .         get out .         i also do sparkly fairy dust effects that go twing too  if you like           go away .         how about    the bells of st .  ungulant   s    .     said the gnome desperately .     very seasonal .  very nice .  why not join in .  it goes     the bells  clong  of st .   clang            ridcully scored a direct hit with the rubber duck  and the gnome escaped through the bath overflow .  cursing and spontaneous hand bell ringing echoed away down the pipes .   in perfect peace at last  the archchancellor pulled off his robe .   the organ   s storage tanks were wheezing at the rivets by the time the librarian had finished pumping .  satisfied  he knuckled his way up to the seat and paused to survey  with great satisfaction  the keyboards in front of him .   bloody stupid johnson   s approach to music was similar to his approach in every field that was caressed by his genius in the same way that a potato field is touched by a late frost .  make it loud  he said .  make it wide .  make it all embracing .  and thus the great organ of unseen university was the only one in the world where you could play an entire symphony scored for thunderstorm and squashed toad noises .   warm water cascaded off mustrum ridcully   s pointy bathing cap .   mr .  johnson had  surely not on purpose  designed a perfect bathroom   at least  perfect for singing in .  echoes and resonating pipeways smoothed out all those little imperfections and gave even the weediest singer a rolling  dark brown voice .   and so ridcully sang .         as i walked out one dadadadada for to something or other and to take the dadada  i did espy a fair pretty may ay den i think it was  and i        the organ pipes hummed with pent up energy .  the librarian cracked his knuckles .  this took some time .  then he pulled the pressure release valve .   the hum became an urgent thrumming .   very carefully  he let in the clutch .   ridcully stopped singing as the tones of the organ came through the wall .   bath time music  eh .  he thought .  just the job .   it was a shame it was muffled by all the bathroom fixtures  though .   it was at this point he espied a small lever marked    musical pipes .      ridcully  never being a man to wonder what any kind of switch did when it was so much easier and quicker to find out by pulling it  did so .  but instead of the music he was expecting he was rewarded simply with several large panels sliding silently aside  revealing row upon row of brass nozzles .   the librarian was lost now  dreaming on the wings of music .  his hands and feet danced over the keyboards  picking their way toward the crescendo which ended the first movement of bubbla   s catastrophe suite .   one foot kicked the    afterburner    lever and the other spun the valve of the nitrous oxide cylinder .   ridcully tapped the nozzles .   nothing happened .  he looked at the controls again  and realized that he   d never pulled the little brass lever marked    organ interlock .      he did so .  this did not cause a torrent of pleasant bath time accompaniment  however .  there was merely a thud and a distant gurgling  which grew in volume .   he gave up  and went back to soaping his chest .         running of the deer  the playing of   huh .  what        later that day he had the bathroom nailed up again and a notice placed on the door  on which was written      not to be used in any circumstances .  this is important .      however  when modo nailed the door up he didn   t hammer the nails in all the way but left just a bit sticking up so that his pliers would grip later on  when he was told to remove them .  he never presumed and he never complained  he just had a good working knowledge of the wizardly mind .   they never did find the soap .      ponder and his fellow students watched hex carefully .      it can   t just  you know  stop     said adrian    mad drongo    turnipseed .      the ants are just standing still     said ponder .  he sighed .     all right  put the wretched thing back .      adrian carefully replaced the small fluffy teddy bear above hex   s keyboard .  things immediately began to whir .  the ants started to trot again .  the mouse squeaked .   they   d tried this three times .   ponder looked again at the single sentence hex had written .       mine .  waaaah .          i don   t actually think     he said  gloomily     that i want to tell the archchancellor that this machine stops working if we take its fluffy teddy bear away .  i just don   t think i want to live in that kind of world .         er     said mad drongo     you could always  you know  sort of say it needs to work with the ftb enabled    .         you think that   s better .     said ponder  reluctantly .  it wasn   t as if it was even a very realistic interpretation of a bear .      you mean  better than    fluffy teddy bear    .      ponder nodded .     it   s better     he said .      of all the presents he got from the hogfather  gawain told susan  the best of all was the marble .   and she   d said  what marble .   and he   d said  the glass marble i found in the fireplace .  it wins all the games .  it seems to move in a different way .      the beggars walked their erratic and occasionally backward walk along the city streets  while fresh morning snow began to fall .   occasionally one of them belched happily .  they all wore paper hats  except for foul ole ron  who   d eaten his .   a tin can was passed from hand to hand .  it contained a mixture of fine wines and spirits and something in a can that arnold sideways had stolen from behind a paint factory in phedre road .      the goose was good     said the duck man  picking his teeth .      i   m surprised you et it  what with that duck on your head     said coffin henry  picking his nose .      what duck .     said the duck man .      what were that greasy stuff .     said arnold sideways .      that  my dear fellow  was p  t   de foie gras .  all the way from genua  i   ll wager .  and very good  too .         dun   arf make you fart  don   t it .         ah  the world of haute cuisine     said the duck man happily .   they reached  by fits and starts  the back door of their favorite restaurant .  the duck man looked at it dreamily  eyes filmy with recollection .      i used to dine here almost every night     he said .      why   d you stop .     said coffin henry .      i   i don   t really know     said the duck man .     it   s   rather a blur  i   m afraid .  back in the days when i   think i was someone else .  but still     he said  patting arnold   s head     as they say     better a meal of old boots where friendship is  than a stalled ox and hatred therewith .     forward  please  ron .      they positioned foul ole ron in front of the back door and then knocked on it .  when a waiter opened it foul ole ron grinned at him  exposing what remained of his teeth and his famous halitosis  which was still all there .      millennium hand and shrimp .     he said  touching his forelock .      compliments of the season     the duck man translated .   the man went to shut the door but arnold sideways was ready for him and had wedged his boot in the crack .       we thought you might like us to come round at lunchtime and sing a merry hogswatch glee for your customers     said the duck man .  beside him  coffin henry began one of his volcanic bouts of coughing  which even sounded green .     no charge  of course .         it being hogswatch     said arnold .   the beggars  despite being too disreputable even to belong to the beggars    guild  lived quite well by their own low standards .  this was generally by careful application of the certainty principle .  people would give them all sorts of things if they were certain to go away .   a few minutes later they wandered off again  pushing a happy arnold who was surrounded by hastily wrapped packages .      people can be so kind     said the duck man .      millennium hand and shrimp .      arnold started to investigate the charitable donations as they maneuvered his trolley through the slush and drifts .      tastes   sort of familiar     he said .      familiar like what .         like mud and old boots .         garn .  that   s posh grub  that is .         yeah  yeah       arnold chewed for a while .     you don   t think we   ve become posh all of a sudden .         dunno .  you posh  ron .         buggrit .         yep .  sounds posh to me .      the snow began to settle gently on the river ankh .      still   happy new year  arnold .         happy new year  duck man .  and your duck .         what duck .         happy new year  henry .         happy new year  ron .         buggrem .         and god bless us  every one     said arnold sideways .   the curtain of snow hid them from view .      which god .         dunno .  what   ve you got .         duck man .         yes  henry .         you know that stalled ox you mentioned .         yes  henry .         how come it   d stalled .  run out of grass  or something .         ah   it was more a figure of speech  henry .         not an ox .         not exactly .  what i meant was        and then there was only the snow .   after a while  it began to melt in the sun .       about the author   terry pratchett   s novels have sold more than thirty million  give or take a few million

deserve to shed blood .  or possibly not .  you never quite know with some kids .       this exchange contains almost all you need to know about human civilization .  at least  those bits of it that are now under the sea  fenced off or still smoking .       it   s a sad and terrible thing that high born folk really have thought that the servants would be totally fooled if spirits were put into decanters that were cunningly labeled backward .  and also throughout history the more politically conscious butler has taken it on trust  and with rather more justification  that his employers will not notice if the whiskey is topped up with eniru .       peachy was not someone you generally asked questions of  except the sort that go like     if if if if i give you all my money could you possibly not break the other leg  thank you so much .          chickenwire had got his name from his own individual contribution to the science of this very specialized    concrete overshoe    form of waste disposal .  an unfortunate drawback of the process was the tendency for bits of the client to eventually detach and float to the surface  causing much comment in the general population .  enough chicken wire  he   d pointed out  would solve that  while also allowing the ingress of crabs and fish going about their vital recycling activities .         ankh morpork   s underworld  which was so big that the over world floated around on top of it like a very small hen trying to mother a nest of ostrich chicks  already had big dave  fat dave  mad dave  wee davey  and lanky dai .  everyone had to find their niche .       this is very similar to the suggestion put forward by the quirmian philosopher ventre  who said     possibly the gods exist  and possibly they do not .  so why not believe in them in any case .  if it   s all true you   ll go to a lovely place when you die  and if it isn   t then you   ve lost nothing  right .     when he died he woke up in a circle of gods holding nasty looking sticks and one of them said     we   re going to show you what we think of mr .  clever dick in these parts            he   d done his best .  but black and purple and vomit yellow weren   t a good color combination for paper chains  and no hogswatch fairy doll should be nailed up by its head .       such as the electric drill chuck key fairy .       who was  according to sideney   s mother  a bit of a catch since her father owned a half share in an eel pie shop in gleam street  you must know her  got all her own teeth and a wooden leg you   d hardly notice  got a sister called continence  lovely girl  why didn   t she invite her along for tea next time he was over  not that she hardly saw her son the big wizard at all these days  but you never knew and if the magic thing didn   t work out then a quarter share in a thriving eel pie business was not to be sneezed at         not  that is  things that he wanted to do  or wanted done to him .  just things that he dreamed of  in the armpit of a bad night .      in fact  when she was eight she   d found a collection of animal skulls in an attic  relict of some former duke of an inquiring turn of mind .  her father had been a bit preoccupied with affairs of state and she   d made twenty seven dollars before being found out .  the hippopotamus molar had  with hindsight  been a mistake .   skulls never frightened her  even then .       the ceh was always ready to fight for the rights of the differently tall  and was not put off by the fact that most pixies and gnomes weren   t the least interested in dressing up in little pointy hats with bells on when there were other far more interesting things to do .  all that tinkly wee stuff was for the old folks back home in the forest   when a tiny man hit ankh morpork he preferred to get drunk  kick some serious ankle and search for tiny women .  in fact the ceh now had to spend so much time explaining to people that they hadn   t got enough rights that they barely had any time left to fight for them .       often they lived to a time scale to suit themselves .  many of the senior ones  of course  lived entirely in the past  but several were like the professor of anthropics  who had invented an entire temporal system based on the belief that all the other ones were a mere illusion .  many people are aware of the weak and strong anthropic principles .  the weak one says  basically  that it was jolly amazing of the universe to be constructed in such a way that humans could evolve to a point where they make a living in  for example  universities  while the strong one says that  on the contrary  the whole point of the universe was that humans should not only work in universities but also write for huge sums books with words like    cosmic    and    chaos    in the titles .    the uu professor of anthropics had developed the special and inevitable anthropic principle  which was that the entire reason for the existence of the universe was the eventual evolution of the uu professor of anthropics .  but this was only a formal statement of the theory which absolutely everyone  with only some minor details of a    fill in name here    nature  secretly believes to be true .         and they are correct .  the universe clearly operates for the benefit of humanity .  this can be readily seen from the convenient way the sun comes up in the morning  when people are ready to start the day .      the ceremony still carries on  of course .  if you left off traditions because you didn   t know why they started you   d be no better than a foreigner .       ignorant  a state of not knowing what a pronoun is  or how to find the square root of    .    and merely knowing childish and useless things like which of the seventy almost identical looking species of the purple sea snake are the deadly ones  how to treat the poisonous pith of the sago sago tree to make a nourishing gruel  how to foretell the weather by the movements of the tree climbing burglar crab  how to navigate across a thousand miles of featureless ocean by means of a piece of string and a small clay model of your grandfather  how to get essential vitamins from the liver of the ferocious ice bear  and other such trivial matters .  it   s a strange thing that when everyone becomes educated  everyone knows about the pronoun but no one knows about the sago sago .          credulous  having views about the world  the universe and humanity   s place in it that are shared only by very unsophisticated people and the most intelligent and advanced mathematicians and physicists .      it   s amazing how good governments are  given their track record in almost every other field  at hushing up things like alien encounters .   one reason may be that the aliens themselves are too embarrassed to talk about it .   it   s not known why most of the space going races of the universe want to undertake rummaging in earthling underwear as a prelude to formal contact .  but representatives of several hundred races have taken to hanging out  unsuspected by one another  in rural corners of the planet and  as a result of this  keep on abducting other would be abductees .  some have been in fact abducted while waiting to carry out an abduction on a couple of other aliens trying to abduct the aliens who were  as a result of misunderstood instructions  trying to form cattle into circles and mutilate crops .   the planet earth is now banned to all alien races until they can compare notes and find out how many  if any  real humans they have actually got .  it is gloomily suspected that there is only one   who is big  hairy and has very large feet .   the truth may be out there  but lies are inside your head .         the red rosy hen greets the dawn of the day .     in fact the hen is not the bird traditionally associated with heralding a new sunrise  but mrs .  huggs  while collecting many old folk songs for posterity  has taken care to rewrite them where necessary to avoid  as she put it     offending those of a refined disposition with unwarranted coarseness .     much to her surprise  people often couldn   t spot the unwarranted coarseness until it had been pointed out to them .   sometimes a chicken is nothing but a bird .       he   d have to admit that the answer would be    five and a bit     but at least he could come up with it .      it had been ma lilywhite   s dying wish  although she hadn   t known it at the time .  her last words to her son were    you try and get to the horses  i   ll try to hold    em off on the stairs  and if anything happens to me  take care of the dummy .         they generally know in time to have their best robe cleaned  do some serious damage to the wine cellar and have a really good last meal .  it   s a nicer version of death row  with the bonus of no lawyers .      it was  in fact  a pleasant masculine scent .  but only to female weasels .       which had died in its sleep .  of natural causes .  at a great age .  after a long and happy life  insofar as a sheep can be happy .  and would probably be quite pleased to know that it could help somebody as it passed away .      arnold had no legs but  since there were many occasions when a boot was handy on the streets  coffin henry had affixed one to the end of a pole for him .  he was deadly with it  and any muggers hard pressed enough to try to rob the beggars often found themselves kicked on the top of the head by a man three feet high .
