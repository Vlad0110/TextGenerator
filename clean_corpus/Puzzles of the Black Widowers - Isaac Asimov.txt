is he .   the old purse  the quiet place  the four leaf clover  the envelope  the alibi  the recipe  introduction  my first black widower story   the acquisitive chuckle   was written in      and was published in the january      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .  i had intended it as a one shot  but frederic dannay  one of two authors who were ellery queen  had the idea that it would make a good series .  so i kept on going and  as of now  i have written no fewer than sixty of these stories  and have put them into collections     twelve stories in each .  this one  therefore  puzzles of the black widowers  is the fifth collection .   between the first story and the sixtieth  however  seventeen years have passed  and that means there have been changes .  for instance  i think i am at least three or four years older than i was seventeen years ago  though that may just be my innate pessimism showing through .  a much more serious change is that fred dannay died in       to the loss of everyone in the field of mystery writing .   other changes have involved the club on which this series is based .  i have explained in earlier collections that there is a real life organization called the trap door spiders which has been in existence for over forty years  and which is very like the black widowers .  indeed  i have modeled the latter  quite unashamedly  on the former .   i used six of the spiders as models for my black widowers  choosing them more or less at random and making sure they didn t mind .  i used them only as models for the physical appearance of my characters and for some of the conversational characteristics  such as emmanuel rubin s opinionativeness  thomas trumbull s short temper  geoffrey avalon s occasional  but lovable  pedantry  and so on .   for the record  here are the real people behind my black widowers   lester del rey     emmanuel rubin  l .  sprague de camp     geoffrey avalon  don bensen     roger halsted  lin carter     mario gonzalo  gilbert cant     thomas trumbull  john d .  clark     james drake  the trap door spiders still exist after seventeen years and the club is going strong  but naturally  there have been changes in membership .  some old members have passed away and new members have been elected .   as it happens  and to my grief  three of those whom i saddled with black widowers alter egos have passed on to the perpetual banquet in the sky .  they are gilbert cant  who died in       and lin carter and john d .  clark  who each died in      .   nevertheless  their alter egos remain black widowers and will continue to remain so as long as i myself continue to occupy my aging body .  nor will anyone grow older  or get sick  or become infirm .  within the black widower stories  time will not exist  and the puzzles will continue indefinitely .   i might add once again that henry is not modeled on anybody but is my own creation  though more than one person has wondered whether i had p .  g .  wodehouse s  jeeves  in mind  and since i am a pgw idolator  who knows  i may have .   henry also will not age  and  never fear  he will never be stumped  but will continue to solve each puzzle as it comes up  for as long as i live .   the fourth homonym   homonyms .   said nicholas brant .  he was thomas trumbull s guest at the monthly banquet of the black widowers .  he was rather tall  and had surprisingly prominent bags under his eyes  despite the comparative youthfulness of his appearance otherwise .  his face was thin and smooth shaven  and his brown hair showed  as yet  no signs of gray .   homonyms   he said .    what .   said mario gonzalo blankly .    the words you call  sound alikes .   the proper name for them is  homonyms .       that so .   said gonzalo .   how do you spell it .    brant spelled it .   emmanuel rubin looked at brant owlishly through the thick lenses of his glasses .  he said   you ll have to excuse mario  mr .  brant .  he is a stranger to our language .    gonzalo brushed some specks of dust from his jacket sleeve and said   manny is corroded with envy because i ve invented a word game .  he knows the words but he lacks any spark of inventiveness  and that kills him .     surely mr .  rubin does not lack inventiveness   said brant  soothingly .   i ve read some of his books .     i rest my case   said gonzalo .   anyway  i m willing to call my game  homonyms  instead of  sound alikes .   the thing is to make up some short situation which can be described by two words that are sound alikes     that are homonyms .  i ll give you an example  if the sky is perfectly clear  it is easy to decide to go on a picnic in the open .  if it is raining cats and dogs  it is easy to decide not to go on a picnic .  but what if it is cloudy  and the forecast is for possible showers  but there seem to be patches of blue here and there  so you can t make up your mind about the picnic .  what would you call that .     a stupid story   said trumbull tartly  passing his hand over his crisply waved white hair .    come on   said gonzalo   play the game .  the answer is two words that sound alike .    there was a general silence and gonzalo said   the answer is  whether weather .   it s the kind of weather where you wonder whether to go on a picnic or not .   whether weather   don t you get it .    james drake stubbed out his cigarette and said   we get it .  the question is  how do we get rid of it .    roger halsted said  in his soft voice   pay no attention  mario .  it s a reasonable parlor game  except that there don t seem to be many combinations you can use .    geoffrey avalon looked down austerely from his seventy four inch height and said   more than you might think .  suppose you owned a castrated ram that was frisky on clear days and miserable on rainy days .  if it were merely cloudy  however  you might wonder whether that ram would be frisky or miserable .  that would be  whether wether weather .      there came a chorus of outraged what .  s .   avalon said  ponderously .   the first word is w h e t h e r  meaning if .  the last word is w e a t h e r  which refers to atmospheric conditions .  the middle word is w e t h e r  meaning a castrated ram .  look it up if you don t believe me .     don t bother   said rubin .   he s right .     i repeat   growled trumbull   this is a stupid game .     it doesn t have to be a game   said brant .   lawyers are but too aware of the ambiguities built into the language  and homonyms can cause trouble .    the gentle voice of henry  that waiter for all seasons  made itself heard over the hubbub by some alchemy that worked only for him .    gentlemen   he said .   i regret the necessity of interrupting a warm discussion  but dinner is being served .     here s another one   said gonzalo over the smoked trout .   someone has written down all the digits and on all of them but one he has drawn a very clever face .  a child watching this is delighted  but dissatisfied with the incompleteness of the project .  what does he say .    halsted  who was spreading the horseradish sauce daintily over his trout  said   the child says   do that to two  too .      gonzalo said in an aggrieved manner   have you heard that somewhere before .     no   said halsted   but it s a mathematical instance of the game .  what s the use of teaching mathematics at junior high school  if i can t solve problems involving the number two .    gonzalo frowned .   you re trying to be funny  aren t you  roger .     who .  me .    trumbull said   as host of the evening  i would like to recommend that we change the subject .    no one gave any sign of hearing .  avalon said   homonyms are usually the result of the accidents of language history .  for instance   night   by which i mean the opposite of day  is cognate to the german nacht  while  knight   by which i mean a warrior of the table round  is cognate with the german knecht .  in english  the vowels changed and the k is invariably silent in an initial kn  so you end up with two words pronounced in identical fashion .     the initial kn does not invariably have a silent k   said rubin .   there are some words not yet sufficiently anglicized .  i have a jewish friend who married a young lady of the gentile persuasion .  anxious to please her new husband  she bought some ethnic delicacies for him  which she displayed proudly .  listing her purchases  she said  finally   and i also bought you this nish   and was quite puzzled when he broke into hysterical laughter .    drake said   i don t get it .    rubin said with a touch of impatience   the word is  knish      with the k heavily pronounced .  it is a ball of dough in whose interior one places spiced mashed potatoes  or possibly some other filling  with the whole then being fried or baked .  any new yorker should know that .    trumbull sighed and said   well  if you can t lick them  join them .  can anyone give me a group of four homonyms  four words all pronounced alike  with spelling and meaning different in each case .  i ll give you five minutes in which i expect blessed silence .    the five minutes passed pleasantly enough  with only the sound of cracking lobster shells impinging upon the eardrums  and then trumbull said   i ll give you one of the words   right   meaning the opposite of left .  what are the other three .    halsted said  his mouth fairly full of lobster claw   there s  write   meaning to inscribe words  and  rite   meaning a fixed religious procedure  but i don t think there s a fourth .    avalon said   yes  there is .  it s  wright   w r i g h t  meaning a mechanic .     that s archaic   protested gonzalo .    not entirely   said avalon   we still speak of a  playwright   who would be someone who constructs plays .    brant said   my friend tom mentioned  right   defining it as the opposite of left .  what about  right  meaning the opposite of wrong  and  right  meaning perpendicular .  would that be a fifth and sixth homonym .     no   said gonzalo   the spelling has to be different for the words to be homonyms  at least as this game of mine is played .    avalon said   not always  mario .  two words can be spelled the same but have different meanings and have different etymological origins  they would count as homonyms .  for instance   bear  meaning the animal  and  bear  meaning to carry  have the same spelling and pronunciation but have different origins  so i would call them homonyms  along with  bare  meaning unclothed  of course .  the different uses of  right   however  as in  right hand    right answer   and  right angle   all stem from the same root with the same meaning  so they would not be homonyms .    there were fifteen additional minutes before trumbull felt justified in rattling his spoon against the water glass and bringing the conversation to a halt .    i have never been so glad   he said   at any of the banquets of the black widowers to put an end to a conversation .  if i had absolute power as a host  i would fine mario five dollars for starting it .     you took part in it  tom   said gonzalo .    in self defense     and shut up   said trumbull .   i would like to present my guest  nicholas brant  and jeff  you seem civilized even if you were more homonymized than anyone else  so would you do the honors and begin the grilling .    avalon s formidable eyebrows lifted  and he said   i scarcely think that  homonymized  is english  tom .   then  turning to the guest  he said   mr .  brant  how do you justify your existence .    brant smiled ruefully .   as a lawyer  i don t think i can .  you know the old joke  perhaps  of the time god threatened to sue satan  and satan answered   how can you .  i ve got all the lawyers .   in my defense  however  i m not the kind of lawyer who plays tricks in front of a judge and jury .  mostly i sit in my office and try to write documents that actually mean what they are supposed to mean .    avalon said   i m a patent lawyer myself  so i ask the following question without evil intent .  do you ever try to write them so that they don t mean what they re supposed to mean .  do you try to build in loopholes .    brant said   naturally  i try to draw up a document that leaves my client as much freedom of action as possible  and the other side as little freedom of action as possible .  however  the other side has a lawyer  too  who is working hard for the reverse  and the usual result is that the contract ends up reasonably ironbound in both directions .    avalon paused  then said   in the earlier discussion on homonyms  you said  if i remember correctly  that homonyms are ambiguities that could cause trouble .  does that mean you ran into a homonym professionally  in your preparation of contracts  that brought about unexpected complications .    brant raised both hands .   no  no  nothing like that .  what i had in mind when i made that statement was completely irrelevant to the subject now under discussion .    avalon ran his finger around the rim of his water glass .   you must understand  mr .  brant  that this is not a legal cross examination .  there is no particular subject under discussion  and nothing is irrelevant .  i repeat my question .    brant remained silent for a moment  then he said   it s something that took place a little over twenty years ago  and that i have thought about only very occasionally since then .  mr .  gonzalo s game of homonyms brought it to mind  but it s     nothing .  it doesn t involve any legal problems or any complications whatever .  it s just a     puzzle .  it s an insoluble matter that isn t worth discussing .     is it confidential .   put in gonzalo .   because if it is        nothing confidential about it   said brant .   nothing secret  nothing sensitive     and therefore nothing interesting .    gonzalo said   anything that s insoluble is interesting .  don t you agree  henry .    henry  who was filling the brandy glasses  said   i find it so when there is at least room for speculation  mr .  gonzalo .    gonzalo began   well  then  if       avalon said   mario  let me continue  please .      mr .  brant  i wonder if you could give us the details of this insoluble puzzle of yours .  we would greatly appreciate hearing it .     you ll be very disappointed .     that s a chance we will take .     well  then   said brant   if you ll just give me a chance to think back       he rested his face in one hand  thinking  while the six black widowers watched him expectantly  and henry took his usual place by the sideboard .   brant said   let me begin with alfred hunzinger .  he was a poor boy of an immigrant family  and he had no education worth mentioning .  i m pretty sure he never went to high school .  by the time he was fourteen  he was working .  those were the decades before world war i and education was by no means considered one s birthright  or even particularly desirable for what used to be called workingmen .    hunzinger wasn t your usual workingman  however .  he was incredibly industrious and incredibly intelligent .  intelligence and education don t necessarily go hand in hand  you know .    rubin said forcefully   indeed  they don t .  i ve known some very thoroughly educated jackasses .     hunzinger was the reverse   said brant .   he was a very thoroughly uneducated business genius .  he had a green thumb  but it was the green of dollar bills .  whatever he touched prospered  and he built a formidable business before he died .    nor was this enough for him .  he always felt keenly his lack of education  and he embarked in a program of home study .  it wasn t continuous  for his business was his first preoccupation and there were periods when he had little time .  and it was spotty  for he read promiscuously and without outside guidance .  conversation with him was an exposure to a curious mixture of pedantry and na  vet   .    avalon said   you knew him personally  i take it .    brant said   not really .  not intimately .  i did some work for him .  mainly  i prepared his will .  this  when properly done  and when there are complex business matters to consider  takes a long time and produces a long document .  periodically  it must be updated or revised  and the wording considered carefully in the light of continually changing tax laws .  believe me  it was virtually a career in itself and i was forced to spend many hours in conference with him and to engage in extensive correspondence  too .  however  it was a very limited and specialized relationship .  i got to know the nature of his finances rather thoroughly  but to know him as a person only superficially .     did he have children .   asked halsted .    yes  he did   said brant .   he married late in life  at the age of forty two  if i remember correctly .  his wife was considerably younger .  the marriage  while not idyllically happy  was a successful one .  there was no divorce  nor any prospect of one at any time  and mrs .  hunzinger died only about five years ago .  they had four children  three boys and a girl .  the girl married well  she s still alive  still married  has children of her own  and is  and has been  very comfortably off .  she scarcely figured in the will .  some investments were turned over to her during hunzinger s lifetime  and that was it .    the business was left on an equal basis  one third each  to the three sons  whose names were frank  mark  and luke .     in that order of age .   asked drake .    yes .  the oldest is  to use his legal signature  b .  franklin hunzinger .  the middle son is mark david hunzinger .  the youngest son is luke lynn hunzinger .  naturally  i pointed out to hunzinger that to leave his business in equal shares to his three sons was asking for trouble .  the income might be divided equally  but the directing power  the decision making power  had to be placed in the hands of one .    he was very stubbornly resistant to that  however .  he said he had brought up his sons in accordance with the ideals of the old roman republic  that they were all faithful to him  the paterfamilias     he actually used the term  to my intense surprise     and to each other .  there would be no trouble at all  he said .    i took the liberty of pointing out that they might well be ideal sons while he was alive and with his forceful personality directing affairs .  after he was gone  however  hidden rivalries might show up .  never  he insisted  never .  i thought him blind  and wondered how anyone so alive to any hint of chicanery in business affairs  so realistic in matters of the world  could be so foolishly romantic where his own family was concerned .    drake said   what was the daughter s name .     claudia jane   said brant .   i don t remember her married name at the moment .  why do you ask .     just curious .  she might have had ambitions  too  mightn t she .     i don t think so .  at least not with respect to the business .  she made it quite clear she neither expected nor wanted any share in it .  her husband was rich     old money     social position     that sort of thing .  the last thing she wanted was to be identified with what was     in a manner of speaking     a giant hardware store .     well  i see that   said drake .    i must admit that the family seemed entirely harmonious   said brant .   i met the sons at one time or another  singly and together  and they seemed fine young men  much at ease with one another  and obviously fond of their father .  what with one thing and another  i reached the stage where it seemed to them appropriate to invite me to the festivities celebrating the old man s eightieth birthday .  it was on that occasion that hunzinger had the heart attack that carried him off .  it was not entirely unexpected .  he d had a heart condition for years  but it was totally unfortunate for it to happen on his birthday .    the party broke up  of course .  he was laid  gently  on the nearest couch and doctors were called in .  there was a kind of hushed pandemonium .  the confusion was sufficient for me to be able to stay on .  it may sound ghoulish  but i conceived myself to have a job to do .  he had not yet assigned any son to be the head of the firm .  it was too late to have anything in writing  but if he would say something  it might have some force .    the sons  i suppose  did not know what i had in mind .  they were there  of course .  their mother  half in shock  had been led away .  no one seemed to notice i was present .  i leaned across to the old man s ear and said   which of your sons is to be the head of the firm  mr .  hunzinger .     it was too late .  his eyes were closed  his breathing was stertorous .  i wondered if he had heard me .  a doctor approached and i knew he would stop me  so i tried again quickly .  this time  the dying man s eyelids fluttered  and his lips moved as though he were trying to speak .  however  only one sound came out .  it seemed to be the word  to .   i heard nothing else .  he lingered on for another hour but never said another word  and died  without regaining consciousness  on the couch on which he had been laid .      and that s it .    gonzalo said   what happened to the business .     nothing   said brant  with what seemed the residuum of a vast surprise .   the old man was right .  the three sons get along famously .  it s a sort of triumvirate .  when a decision must be made  they get together and come to one quickly .  it s really an amazing thing and if that sort of thing should become infectious  lawyers would all starve to death .     then it doesn t matter what the old man said  does it .   said gonzalo .    not in the least  except that for a while it roused my curiosity .  what was he trying to say .  you see the difficulty  i suppose .     of course   said drake  fingering his small gray mustache .   you can t do much with the word  to .       it s worse than that   said brant .   which homonym .  was it t o  or t o o  or t w o .  there are three to s in the english language .  incidentally  how do you write that last sentence .  i ve often wondered .  you can say  three to s   since all three are pronounced alike  but how do you write it  since each one of the homonyms is spelled differently .    avalon said   i would say   there are three words pronounced t o o .   the double o is the most unambiguous way of indicating the pronunciation that all three share  and you spell it out .     well  in any case  even if i knew which t o o it was  it wouldn t help me .    trumbull said   might it not have been a word  nick .  suppose he was saying a longer word such as  constitution .   that s four syllables  and he managed to sound only the third .  all you d have would be t o o .     maybe   said brant .   i can t prove that that s not so .  just the same  at the time  i got the impression that it was a word  one of the three t o o s  however you want to spell it .  i suppose i was desperately trying to read his lips and he might have said  headship to so and so  and all i got was the  to .   which leaves me with nothing .  of course  as i said  it doesn t matter .  the sons are doing well .  still       brant shook his head .   i m a lawyer .  it bothers me that i came so close to having it done right .  even if he was refusing to choose anyone .  even if he was saying  not to anyone   he would have been expressing his last wish and that would have been better than just falling into a situation by default .  so for a while i kept wondering  and now you ve put it back in my head  and i ll keep on wondering for another while .      and getting nowhere because there s nowhere to be gotten .    a heavy silence descended about the table  one which was finally broken by gonzalo  who said   at least it s an interesting version of the game of homonyms .  which of the sound alikes was it .    trumbull said   what s the difference .  not one of the three would help us make sense of what the old man was trying to say .     i told you   said brant glumly .   it s an insoluble problem .  there just isn t enough information .     we don t have to solve it   said halsted   since there s no crisis that has to be eased  or criminal on whom we must visit retribution .  all we have to do is point out a reasonable possibility to ease your mind .  for instance  suppose he was saying t w o .     well  suppose he was   said avalon .    then it may be that he was saying something like   give it to son number two .      brant shook his head and said   the impression i got was that the t o i heard was in the middle of the message .  his lips moved before and after i heard the t o .    rubin said   i m not sure you can go by that .  his lips were scarcely under control .  some of what appeared to be movement might have been only trembling .     which makes it all the worse   said brant .    now wait awhile   said halsted .   my idea works even with the word in the middle of the message .  it could have been something like  give it to number two son   or  number two son gets it .      trumbull growled   charlie chan might say it  but was hunzinger likely to do so .      al  did you ever hear this man refer to his children by number .     no   said brant .   i don t think i ever did .     well  then   said trumbull   why on earth should he start doing so on his deathbed .     i wonder   said rubin .   consider this .  his second son is named mark  which is also the name of the writer of the second gospel .  his third son is named luke  which is the name of the writer of the third gospel .  i ll bet that if he had had a fourth son  that son s name would have been john .     what s the good of a bet like that .   said gonzalo .   we can t ever settle it and decide on a winner .     why wasn t the first son s name matthew  then .   asked avalon .   rubin said   maybe old hunzinger didn t think of it till after the first son was born .  maybe he simply didn t like  matthew .   anyway  it strikes me that if the word was t w o  it would have a double meaning .  it would refer to the second son and the second gospel  and it would mean mark in either case .    trumbull said   there could be a million reasons why the number two might point to mark  but put them all together and they wouldn t be any more likely to get him to refer to  my number two son  than just one reason would .  why wouldn t he just say  mark   if he meant mark .    brant said   well  he might have said  to mark  at that  and all i heard was  to .      avalon said   mr .  brant  i wonder if you at any time noted that old mr .  hunzinger trusted one of his sons more than another  valued more highly the business acumen of a particular son  loved one more .    brant bent his head in thought .  then he shook it .   i can t say i did .  i have no recollection of anything of the sort .  of course  as i said  my relationship with the family was not a matter of warm personal friendship .  it was business  entirely .  the old man never confided family matters beyond anything that was relevant to the will .    gonzalo said   we keep talking about the sons .  how do you know the old man didn t give some thought to his daughter .  suppose he left the business to his three sons  in thirds  but wanted his daughter to make crucial decisions .  he might have thought she had the best business sense and should run the show even though she wouldn t want to be connected with the business in any open way .     what gives you that idea  mario .   asked avalon .    suppose the word was t o o .  he might have been saying   my daughter  too  should be involved .   something like that .     i don t think so   said brant .   mr .  hunzinger never mentioned his daughter in connection with the business .  remember  too  that his prejudices are pre world war i  when women couldn t even vote .  in no way was he a feminist .  his wife was strictly a homebody  and that s the way he liked it .  he took care to have his daughter marry a rich man  and as far as he was concerned  that was the limit of his responsibility toward her .  at least  i am forced to that conclusion as i think of our various discussions of the will .    again there fell a silence around the table  and finally avalon said  with a rather theatrical sigh   it doesn t matter what hypotheses we set forward .  no matter how clever and ingenious they might be  there s no way in which we can show that they are true .  i m afraid that this once we have to decide that our guest is correct and that the problem  by its very nature  is insoluble .    gonzalo said   not until we ask henry .     henry .   said brant in surprise .  his voice dropped to a whisper .   do you mean the waiter .    trumbull said   no need to whisper  nick .  he s a member of the club .     so i ll ask him   said gonzalo .   henry  do you have any ideas about this .    from his place at the sideboard  henry smiled very slightly and said   i must admit  mr .  gonzalo  that i ve been wondering what the first name of the eldest son might be .    gonzalo said   frank .  don t you remember .     i beg your pardon  mr .  gonzalo  but i seem to recall the oldest son is b .  franklin hunzinger .  i wondered what the b stood for .    all eyes turned to brant  who shrugged and said   he s identified as b .  franklin even in his father s will .  that s the legal form of his signature .  i always assumed  however  that the b stood for benjamin .     it s a natural assumption   said henry .   any american named b .  franklin  it would seem  would be bound to be a benjamin .  but did you ever hear any member of the family     or anyone  for that matter     address him as benjamin or ben .    slowly  brant shook his head .   i don t recall any such incident  but it was over twenty years ago and i was not really part of the family circle .     or since the death of the elder hunzinger .     oh  well  i ve rarely had any contact with them at all since then  not even with respect to legal matters .    trumbull said   what s all this about  henry .     why  it occurred to me that there are  in a manner of speaking  four homonyms with the sound t o o .    avalon said in an astonished voice   four .  you mean that one of the homonyms has two meanings of unrelated derivation  as in the case of b e a r .     no  mr .  avalon .  i am referring to four homonyms with four different spellings .    avalon thought briefly .   impossible  henry .  manny  can you think of a fourth homonym beyond t o  t o o  and t w o .     no   said rubin flatly   there is no fourth homonym .    henry said   i said  in a manner of speaking .   it all depends on the first name of b .  franklin .    drake said   henry  you re being mysterious and you ve got us all confused .  now explain .     yes  dr .  drake .  mr .  brant had said that the elder hunzinger was self educated  and he had indicated that he was particularly interested in roman history .  he raised his children in what he thought was the roman tradition .  he used terms such as  paterfamilias   and so on .  and he gave his children traditional roman names .  his daughter he named claudia  one son is mark  from the roman marcus  another is luke from the roman lucius .    it is possible  in fact  that the original names were indeed marcus and lucius  and that the youngsters found mark and luke more palatable to their peers .  now what if the eldest had a roman name also  which had no common anglicized form .  he might not have used it at all  but stayed with franklin  which becomes the very common and acceptable frank .    one common roman name beginning with b is brutus  and that has no anglicized form that is likely to be acceptable .     aha   said rubin .    yes  mr .  rubin   said henry .   if the elder mr .  hunzinger had picked up scraps of latin  undoubtedly julius caesar s last words  one of the most famous of all latin phrases  would be known to him .  it contains the word  tu   which is latin for the familiar form of  you   and is so well known among educated english speaking people     if only from this phrase     that it might almost rank as a fourth homonym .    asked about which of his sons should head the firm  the dying man thought of the oldest  remembered the name he had given him as a child  and may have said something like  all my sons share  and you  brutus  will lead .   the phrase  and you  brutus  becomes the muttered caesarian exclamation of  et tu  brute   and only the  tu  was loud enough to hear .     good god   muttered brant   who could possibly think of something like that .     but it s most ingenious   said avalon .   i hope you re right  henry .  i d hate to see that reasoning wasted .  i suppose we could call hunzinger and try to persuade him to give us his first name .    gonzalo said excitedly   wait  jeff  wouldn t it be in who s who in america .  they usually include business men .    avalon said   they might well have only the legal version of his name     b .  franklin hunzinger .  of course  they sometimes include the name beyond the period in parentheses to indicate it exists but is not to be used .     let s see   said gonzalo .  he took down the first volume of the tome and for a few moments there was the sound of flipping pages .  then it stopped and gonzalo cried out in triumph   brutus franklin hunzinger  the r u t u s in parentheses .    brant buried his head in his hands .   twenty years  on and off  this has bothered me  and if i had looked him up in who s who     but why would it occur to me to look him up .   he shook his head .   i must tell them .  they will have to know .    henry said   i don t think that would be wise  mr .  brant .  they get along well as it is  but if they find out that their father had chosen one of them to head the firm     which even as it is we can t be certain of     bad feelings might break out .  surely one shouldn t attempt to fix what isn t broken .    afterword  a number of my black widowers puzzles depend on the vagaries of the english language .  i can t help this because i have a great interest in and admiration for the language .   i must admit  though  that i am uneasily aware that whenever too much depends on english  i throw barriers in the way of translators and may diminish my chances of getting foreign editions .  it s not just that foreign editions bring in money  it is well known that my character is entirely too refined and noble for me to be interested in money   but that they introduce my work to audiences that would otherwise be unable to read me .  and being widely read does interest me .   however  i must admit that when a point of language strikes me as being a useful gimmick  as in the story you have just read  i can never resist .   the story first appeared in the march      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   unique is where you find it  emmanuel rubin would have fought to the death rather than admit that the smile on his face was a fatuous one .  it was  though .  try as he might  he could not conceal the pride in his voice or the pleased gleam in his eye .    fellow widowers   he said   now that even tom trumbull is here  let me introduce my guest of the evening .  this is my nephew  horace rubin  eldest son of my younger brother and the shining light of the new generation .    horace smiled weakly at this .  he was a full head taller than his uncle and a bit thinner .  he had dark  crisply curled hair  a prominent  well beaked nose  and a wide mouth .  he was definitely not handsome and mario gonzalo  the artist of the black widowers  was fighting hard not to exaggerate the features .  photographic accuracy was caricature enough .  what didn t get into the drawing  of course  was the unmistakable light of quick intelligence in the young man s eyes .    my nephew   said rubin   is working toward his ph . d .  at columbia .  in chemistry .  and he s doing it now  jim  not in      as you did .    james drake  the only black widower with a legitimate doctorate  although all were entitled to be addressed as  doctor  by the club rules   said   good for him     and my own degree was earned just before the war  world war ii  that is .   he smiled reminiscently through the thin column of smoke curling upward from his cigarette .   thomas trumbull  who had  as usual  arrived at the preprandial cocktail hour late  scowled over his drink and said   am i dreaming  manny  or is it customary to elicit these details during the grilling session after dinner .  why are you jumping the gun .   he waved his hand petulantly at the cigarette smoke  and stepped away from drake in a marked manner .    just laying the foundation   said rubin indignantly .   what i expect you to grill horace about is the subject of his coming dissertation .  there s no reason the black widowers can t gain a little education .    gonzalo said   are you going to make us laugh  manny  by telling us you understand what your nephew is doing in his laboratory .    rubin s scanty beard bristled .   i understand a lot more about chemistry than you think .     you re bound to  because i think you understand zero .   gonzalo turned to roger halsted and said   i happen to know that manny majored in babylonian pottery at some correspondence college .     not true   said rubin   but still a step above your major in beer and pretzels .    geoffrey avalon  who listened with disdain to this exchange  detached his attention  and said to the young student   how old are you  mr .  rubin .     you d better call me horace   said the young man  in an unexpected baritone   or uncle manny will answer and i ll never get a word in edgewise .    avalon smiled grimly .   he is indeed our conversational monopolist when we allow him to be .  but how old are you  horace .     twenty two  sir .     isn t that rather on the young side for a doctoral candidate  or are you just beginning .     no .  i should be starting my dissertation about now and i expect to be through in half a year .  i m rather young  but not unusually so .  robert woodward got his ph . d .  in chemistry when he was twenty .  of course  he nearly got kicked out of school at seventeen .     twenty two isn t bad  though .     i ll be twenty three next month .  i ll be getting it at that age     or never .   he shrugged and looked despondent .   the soft voice of henry  the perennial and irreplaceable waiter at all the black widower banquets  made itself heard .   gentlemen  dinner is served .  we are going to have curried lamb and our chef  i m afraid  believes that curry was made to be tasted  so if any of you would prefer something rather on the blander side  tell me now and i will see to it that you are obliged .    halsted said   if any faint heart would rather have scrambled eggs  henry  just bring me his helping of curried lamb in addition to my own .  we must not waste it .     nor must we contribute to your overweight problem  roger   growled trumbull .   we ll all have the curry  henry  and bring in the accompanying condiments  especially the chutney and coconut .  i intend to be heavy handed myself .     and keep the bicarbonate handy  too  henry   said gonzalo .   tom s eyes are more optimistic than his stomach lining is .    henry was serving the brandy when rubin clattered his spoon against the water glass and said   to business  gentlemen  to business .  my nephew  i have observed  has wreaked havoc on the comestibles and it is time that he be made to pay for that in the grilling session .      jim  you d be the natural grill master  since you re a chemist of sorts yourself  but i don t want you and horace to get into a private discussion of chemical minutiae .  roger  you re a mere mathematician  which puts you sufficiently off the mark .  would you do the honors .     gladly   said halsted  sipping gently at his cura  ao .   young rubin     or horace  if you prefer     how do you justify your existence .    horace said   once i get my degree and find myself a position on a decent faculty  i m sure that the work i do will be ample justification .  otherwise      he shrugged .    you seem doubtful  young man .  do you expect to have trouble finding a job .     it s not something one can be certain about  sir  but i ve been interviewed here and there  and  if all goes well  it seems to me that something desirable should solidify .     if all goes well  you say .  is there some hitch in your research .     no  not at all .  i had enough good sense to pick a fail safe problem .  yes  no  or maybe     any of the three possible answers     would earn me a degree .  as it happens  the answer is yes  which is the best of the alternatives  and i consider myself set .    drake said suddenly   whom are you working for  horace .     dr .  kendall  sir .     the kinetics man .     yes  sir .  i m working on the kinetics of dna replication .  it s not something to which physical chemical techniques have hitherto been rigorously applied  and i am now able to build computerized graphics of the process  which       halsted interrupted .   we ll get to that  horace .  later .  for now  i m still trying to find out what s bugging you .  you have the prospect of a job .  your research has gone well .  what about your coursework .     never any problem there .  except       halsted endured the pause for a moment  then said   except what .     i wasn t that good in my lab courses .  especially organic lab .  i m not     deft .  i m a theoretician .     did you fail .     no  of course not .  i just didn t cover myself with glory .     well  then  what is bugging you .  during dinner i overheard you tell jeff that you d be getting your ph . d .  when you re twenty three     or never .  why never .  where does that possibility come in .   the young man hesitated .   it s not the sort of thing       rubin  clearly flustered  frowned and said   horace  you ve never told me you were having problems .    horace looked about as though searching for some hole through which he could crawl .   well  uncle manny  you ve got your troubles and you don t come to me with them .  i ll fight this out on my own     or not .     fight what out .   said rubin  his voice growing louder .    it s not the sort of thing      began horace again .    number one   said rubin vigorously   anything you say here is completely  totally confidential .  number two  i told you that at the grilling session you would be expected to answer all questions .  number three  if you don t stop playing games  i ll kick your behind into raspberry gelatin .    horace sighed .   yes  uncle manny .      i just want to say   he looked about the table   that he s threatened me like this since i was two and he s never laid a hand on me .  my mother would take him apart if he did .     there s always a first time  and i m not afraid of your mother .  i can handle her   said rubin .    yes  uncle manny .      all right  then .  my problem is professor richard youngerlea .     uh oh   said drake softly .    do you know him  dr .  drake .     well  yes .     is he a friend of yours .     well  no .  he s a good chemist but  as a matter of fact  i despise him .    horace s homely face broke into a wide smile  and he said   then i can speak freely .     you could anyway   said drake .    here it is   said horace .   i m sure youngerlea is going to be on my examining board .  he wouldn t miss the chance and he swings enough weight to get on if he wants to .    avalon said in his deep voice   i take it  horace  that you dislike him .     very much   said horace in a heartfelt voice .    and i imagine he dislikes you .     i m afraid so .  i had my organic lab under him and  as i said  i didn t shine .    avalon said   i imagine a certain number of students don t shine .  does he dislike them all .     well  he doesn t like them .     i gather you suspect that he wants to be on your examining board in order to cut you down .  is that the way he reacts to every student who doesn t shine in his laboratory .     well  he does seem to think that lab work is motherhood and apple pandowdy and everything that s good and noble  but no  it s not just that i didn t shine .     well  then   said halsted  taking over the grilling again   we re getting to it .  i teach in a junior high school and i know all about obnoxious students .  i am sure that the professor found you obnoxious .      in what way .    horace frowned .   i am not obnoxious .  youngerlea is .  look  he s a bully .  there are always some teachers who take advantage of the fact that they are in an unassailable position .  they excoriate students  they brutalize them verbally  they hold them up to ridicule .  they do this although they know full well that the students are reluctant to defend themselves for fear of getting a poor mark .  who s to argue with youngerlea if he hands out a c  or  for that matter  an f .  who s to argue with him if he expresses his very influential opinion at a faculty conference that such and such a student doesn t have what it takes to make a good chemist .     did he hold you up to ridicule .   asked halsted .    he held everybody up to ridicule .  there was one poor guy who was british  and when he referred to aluminum chloride  which is used as a catalyst in the friedel crafts reaction  he referred to it as  aluminium  chloride  with the accent on the third syllable and the first u as  yoo  instead of  oo .   it was just the british pronunciation  after all  but youngerlea chewed him out .  he denounced all this crap     his expression     of having an unnecessary extra syllable  five instead of four  and so on  and the stupidity of making any chemical name longer than necessary  and so on .  it was nothing and yet he humiliated the poor man  who didn t dare say a word in his own defense .  and all the damned sycophants in the class laughed .     so what makes you worse than the rest .    horace flushed  but there was a note of pride in his voice as he replied .   i answer back .  when he starts on me  i don t just sit there and take it .  in fact  i interrupted him in this aluminum aluminium business .  i said in a good  loud voice   the name of an element is a human convention  professor  and not a law of nature .   that stopped him  but he did say in his sneering way   ah  rubin  been dropping any beakers lately .       and the class laughed  i suppose .   said halsted .    sure they did  the pimple heads .  i dropped one beaker all course .  one .  and that was only because someone jostled me .      and then  once  i came across youngerlea in the chem library looking up some compound in beilstein       gonzalo asked   what s beilstein .     it s a reference book of about seventy five volumes  listing many thousands of organic compounds  with references to the work done on each  all of them listed in order according to some logical but very complicated system .  youngerlea had a couple of volumes on his desk and was leafing through first one  then the other .  i was curious  and asked him what compound he was searching for .  he told me and i was overcome with ecstasy when i realized he was looking in the wrong volumes altogether .  i moved quietly to the beilstein shelves  took down a volume  found the compound youngerlea wanted     it took me thirty seconds     came back to his table  and put the volume in front of him  open to the correct page .     i suppose he didn t thank you   said drake .    no  he didn t   said horace   but at that  he might have if i didn t have the world s biggest grin on my face .  at the moment  though  i would rather have had my revenge than my ph . d .      and that may be the way it will work out .    rubin said   i ve never considered you the most tactful person in the world  horace .     no  uncle manny   said horace sadly   my mother says i take after you     but she only says that when she s really annoyed with me .    even avalon laughed at that  and rubin muttered something under his breath .   gonzalo said   well  what can he do to you .  if your marks are all right  and your research is all right  and you do all right on the exam  they ve got to pass you .     it s not that easy  sir   said horace .   in the first place  it s an oral exam and the pressures are intense .  a guy like youngerlea is a past master at intensifying the pressure  and he can just possibly reduce me to incoherence  or get me into a furious slanging match with him .  either way he can maintain i don t have the emotional stability to make a good chemist .  he s a powerful figure in the department and he might swing the committee .  even if i pass and get my degree  he has enough influence in chemical circles to blackball me in some very important places .    there was silence around the table .   drake said   what are you going to do .     well     i tried to make peace with the old bastard .  i thought about it and thought about it  and finally asked for an appointment so that i could eat a little crow .  i said i knew we had not gotten along  but that i hoped he didn t think i would make a bad chemist     that really  chemistry was my life     well  you know what i mean .    drake nodded .   what did he say .     he enjoyed himself .  he had me where he wanted me .  he did his best to make me crawl  told me i was a wise guy with an ungovernable temper  and a few other things designed to make me go out of control .  i held on  though  and said   but  granted i ve got my peculiarities  would you say that necessarily makes me a bad chemist .     and he said   well  let s see if you re a good chemist .  i m thinking of the name of a unique chemical element .  you tell me what the element is  and why it s unique  and why i should think of it  and i ll admit you re a good chemist .     i said   but what would that have to do with my being a good chemist .   he said   the fact that you don t see that is a point against you .  you ought to be able to reason it out  and reasoning is the prime tool of a chemist  or of any scientist .  a person like you who talks about being a theoretical scientist and who therefore scorns little things like manual dexterity should have no trouble agreeing with this .  well  use your reason and tell me which element i am thinking of .  you have one week from this moment  say  five p . m .  next monday  and you only have one chance .  if your choice of element is wrong  there s no second guess .     i said   professor youngerlea  there are over a hundred elements .  are you going to give me any hints .       i already have   he said .   i told you it s unique  and that s all you re going to get .   and he gave me the same kind of grin i gave him at the time of the beilstein incident .    avalon said   well  young man  what happened the next monday .  did you work out the problem .     it isn t next monday yet  sir .  that s coming three days from now  and i m stuck .  there s no possible way of answering .  one element out of over a hundred  and the only hint is that it s unique .    trumbull said   is the man honest .  granted that he is a bully and a rotter  do you suppose he is really thinking of an element and that he ll accept a right answer from you .  he wouldn t declare you wrong no matter what you say  would he  and then use that as a weapon against you .    horace made a face .   well  i can t read his mind  but as a scientist  he s the real thing .  he s actually a great chemist and  as far as i know  he s completely ethical in his profession .  what s more  his papers are marvelously well written     concise  clear .  he uses no jargon  never a long word when a shorter one will do  never a complicated sentence when a simpler one will do .  you have to admire him for that .  so if he asks a scientific question  i think he will be honest about it .     and you re really stuck .   asked halsted .   nothing comes to you .     on the contrary  a great deal comes to me  but too much is as bad as nothing .  for instance  the first thought i had was that the element had to be hydrogen .  it s the simplest atom  the lightest atom  atom number one .  it s the only atom that has a nucleus made of a single particle     just a proton .  it s the only atom with a nucleus that contains no neutrons  and that certainly makes it unique .    drake said   you re talking about hydrogen   .     that s right   said horace .   hydrogen is found in nature in three varieties  or isotopes  hydrogen    hydrogen    and hydrogen   .  the nucleus of hydrogen   is just a proton  but hydrogen   has a nucleus composed of a proton and a neutron  and hydrogen   has one composed of a proton and two neutrons .  of course  almost all hydrogen atoms are hydrogen    but youngerlea asked for an element  not an isotope  and if i say that the element hydrogen is the only one with a nucleus containing no neutrons  i d be wrong .  just wrong .    drake said   it s still the lightest and simplest element .     sure  but that s so obvious .  and there are other possibilities .  helium  which is element number two  is the most inert of all the elements .  it has the lowest boiling point and doesn t freeze solid even at absolute zero .  at very low temperatures  it becomes helium ii  which has properties like no other substance in the universe .     does it come in different varieties .   asked gonzalo .    two isotopes occur in nature  helium   and helium    but all those unique properties apply to both .     don t forget   said drake   that helium is the only element to be discovered in space before being discovered on earth .     i know  sir .  it was discovered in the sun .  helium can be considered unique in a number of different ways  but it s so obvious too .  i don t think youngerlea would have anything obvious in mind .    drake said  after blowing a smoke ring and regarding it with some satisfaction   i suppose if you re ingenious enough  you can think up something unique about each element .     absolutely   said horace   and i think i ve just about done it .  for instance  lithium  which is element number three  is the least dense of all the metals .  cesium  element number fifty five  is the most active of all the stable metals .  fluorine  element number nine  is the most active of all the nonmetals .  carbon  element number six  is the basis of all organic molecules  including those that make up living tissue .  it is probably the only atom capable of playing such a role  so that it is the unique element of life .     it seems to me   said avalon   that an element that is uniquely related to life is unique enough        no   said horace violently   it s the answer least likely to be true .  youngerlea is an organic chemist  which means he deals with carbon compounds only .  it would be impossibly obvious for him .  then there s mercury  element number eighty       gonzalo said   do you know all the elements by number .     i didn t before last monday .  since then  i ve been poring over the list of elements .  see .   he pulled a sheet of paper from his inside jacket pocket .   this is the periodic table of elements .  i ve just about memorized it .    trumbull said   but it doesn t help  i gather .     not so far .  as i was saying  mercury  element number eighty  has the lowest melting point of any metal  so that it is the only metal that is a liquid at ordinary temperatures .  that s certainly unique .    rubin said   gold is the most beautiful element  if you want to get into aesthetics  and is the most valued .     gold is element number seventy nine   said horace .   it s possible to argue  though  that it s neither the most beautiful nor the most valued .  many people would say a properly cut diamond is more beautiful than gold  and  weight for weight  it would certainly be worth more money     and a diamond is pure carbon .    the densest metal is osmium  element number seventy six  and the least active metal is iridium  element number seventy seven .  the highest melting metal is tungsten  element number seventy four  and the most magnetic metal is iron  element number twenty six .  technetium  element number forty three  is the lightest element that has no stable isotopes .  it is radioactive in all its varieties  and it is the first element to be produced in the laboratory .  uranium  element number ninety two  is the most complicated atom to occur in substantial quantities in the earth s crust .  iodine  element number fifty three  is the most complicated of those elements essential to human life  while bismuth  element number eighty three  is the most complicated element that has at least one isotope that is stable and not radioactive .    you can go on and on and on and  as dr .  drake said  if you re ingenious enough  you can tag each and every element with a unique characteristic .  the trouble is that there s nothing to say which one youngerlea is thinking of  which uniqueness is his uniqueness  and if i don t come up with the right something  he s going to say that that proves i don t have the capacity to think clearly .    drake said   if we put our minds together right now       trumbull interrupted   would that be legitimate .  if the young man gets the answer from others        what are the rules of the game  horace .   avalon said .   did professor youngerlea tell you that you could not consult anyone else .    horace shook his head emphatically .   nothing was said about that .  i ve been using this periodic table .  i ve been using reference books .  i see no reason why i can t ask other human beings .  books are just the words of human beings  words that have been frozen into print .  besides  whatever you may suggest  it s i who will have to decide whether the suggestion is good or bad  and take the risk on the basis of that decision of mine .      but will you be able to help me .     we might   said drake .   if youngerlea is an honest scientist  he wouldn t give you a problem that contains within it no possibility of reaching a solution .  there must be some way of reasoning out an answer .  after all  if you can t solve the problem  you could challenge him to give you the right answer .  if he can t do that  or if he makes use of an obviously ridiculous path of reasoning  you could complain loudly to everyone in the school .  i would .     i m willing to try  then .  is there anyone here  besides dr .  drake  who is a chemist .    rubin said   you don t have to be a professional chemist at the ph . d .  level to know something about the elements .     all right  uncle manny   said horace .   what s the answer  then .    rubin said   personally  i m stuck on carbon .  it s the chemical of life and  in the form of diamond  it has another type of uniqueness .  is there any other element that  in its pure form  has an unusual aspect        allotrope it s called  uncle .     don t fling your jargon at me  pip squeak .  is there any other element that has an allotrope as unusual as diamond .     no .  and aside from human judgments concerning its beauty and value  the diamond happens to be the hardest substance in existence  under normal conditions .     well  then .     i ve already said that it s too obvious for an organic chemist to set up carbon as a solution to the problem .     sure   said rubin .   he chose the obvious because he thinks you ll dismiss it because it s obvious .     there speaks the mystery writer   grumbled trumbull .    just the same  i reject that solution   said horace .   you can advise me  any of you  but i m the one to make the decision to accept or reject .  any other ideas .    there was complete silence about the table .    in that case   said horace   i d better tell you one of my thoughts .  i m getting desperate  you see .  youngerlea said   i m thinking of the name of a unique chemical element .   he didn t say he was thinking of the element  but of the name of the element .     are you sure you remember that correctly .   said avalon .   you didn t tape the conversation  and memory can be a tricky thing .     no  no .  i remember it clearly .  i m not the least uncertain .  not the least .      so yesterday i got to thinking that it s not the physical or chemical properties of the element that count .  that s just a red herring .  it s the name that counts .     have you got a unique name .   asked halsted .    unfortunately   said horace   the names give you as much oversupply as the properties of the elements do .  if you consider an alphabetical listing of the elements  actinium  element number eighty nine  is first on the list  and zirconium  element number forty  is the last on the list .  dysprosium  which is element number sixty six  is the only element with a name that begins with a d .  krypton  element number thirty six  is the only one with a name that begins with a k .  uranium  vanadium  and xenon  which are elements numbers ninety two  twenty three  and fifty four  respectively  are the only elements to begin with a u  v  or x .  how do i choose among these five .  u is the only vowel  but that seems weak .    gonzalo said   is there any letter that doesn t start the name of any element at all .     three .  there is no element that starts with j  q or w     but what good is that .  you can t claim an element is unique just because it doesn t exist .  you can argue that there are an infinite number of elements that don t exist .    drake said   mercury has  as an alternative name   quicksilver   that starts with a q .     i know  but that s feeble   said horace .   in german  i and j are not distinguished in print .  the chemical symbol of iodine is i  but i ve seen german papers in latin print  in which the symbol of the element is given as j  but that s even feebler .    speaking of the chemical symbols  there are thirteen elements with symbols that are single letters .  almost always that letter is the initial of the name of the element .  thus  carbon has the symbol c  oxygen  o  nitrogen  n  phosphorus  p  sulfur  s  and so on .  however  the element potassium has the symbol k .     why .   asked gonzalo .    because that s the initial of the german name  kalium .  if potassium were the only case  i might consider it  but tungsten has the symbol w  for the german name  wolfram  so neither is unique .  strontium has a name that starts with three consonants  but so do chlorine and chromium .  iodine has a name that starts with two vowels  but so do einsteinium and europium .  i m stopped at every turn .    gonzalo said   is there anything about the spelling of the element names that is the same in almost all of them .     almost all of them end in ium .     really .   said gonzalo  snapping his fingers in an agony of thought .   how about the element the british pronounce differently .  they call it  aluminium  with the ium ending  but we say  aluminum  so that it has only a um ending  and the professor made a fuss about it .  maybe it s aluminum that s unique  then .     a good thought   said horace   but there s lanthanum  molybdenum  and platinum  each with a um ending .  there are also endings of ine  en  and  on   but always more than one of each .  nothing unique .  nothing unique .    avalon said   and yet there must be something .     then tell me what it is .  rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered in nature  promethium is the only radioactive rare earth metal  gadolinium is the only stable element to be named after a human being .  nothing works .  nothing is convincing .    horace shook his head dolefully .   well  it s not the end of the world .  i ll go to youngerlea with my best guess and  if that s wrong  let him do his worst .  if i write a crackerjack dissertation  it may be so good they couldn t possibly flunk me  and if youngerlea keeps me from getting a place at cal tech or m . i . t .   i ll get in somewhere else and work my way up .  i m not going to let him stop me .    drake nodded .   that s the right attitude  son .    henry said softly   mr .  rubin .    rubin said   yes  henry .     i beg your pardon  sir .  i was addressing your nephew  the younger mr .  rubin .    horace looked up .   yes  waiter .  is there something else to order .     no  sir .  i wonder if i might discuss the matter of the unique element .    horace frowned  then said   are you a chemist  waiter .    gonzalo said   he s not a chemist  but he s henry and you had better listen to him .  he s brighter than anyone in the room .     mr .  gonzalo   said henry  in soft deprecation .    it s so  henry   insisted gonzalo .   go ahead .  what do you have to say .     only that in weighing a question that seems to have no answer  it might help to consider the person asking the question .  perhaps professor youngerlea has some quirk that would lead him to attach some importance to a particular uniqueness  which  to others  might be barely noticed .     you mean   said halsted   uniqueness is where you find it .     exactly   said henry   as is almost everything that allows for an element of human judgment .  if we consider professor youngerlea  we know this about him .  he uses the english language carefully and concisely .  he does not use a complicated sentence when a simpler one will do  or a long word where a shorter word will do .  what s more  he was furious with a student for using a perfectly acceptable name for aluminum  but a name which added a letter and a syllable .  am i correct in all this  mr .  rubin .     yes   said horace   i ve said all that .     well  then  on the club s reference shelf  there is the world almanac  which lists all the elements  and we have the unabridged  of course  which gives the pronunciations .  i ve taken the liberty of studying the material during the course of the discussion that has been taking place .     and .     it occurs to me that the element praseodymium  which is number fifty nine  is uniquely designed to rouse professor youngerlea s ire .  praseodymium is the only name with six syllables .  all other names have five syllables or less .  surely  to professor youngerlea  praseodymium is bound to seem unbearably long and unwieldy  the most irritating name in all the list  and unique in that respect .  if he had to use that element in his work  he would probably complain loudly and at length  and there would be no mistake in the matter .  perhaps  though  he does not use the element .    horace s eyes were gleaming .   no  it s a rare earth element and i doubt that youngerlea  as an organic chemist  has ever had to refer to it .  that would be the only reason we haven t heard him on the subject .  but you re right  henry .  its mere existence would be a constant irritant to him .  i accept that suggestion  and i ll go to him with it on monday .  if it s wrong  it s wrong .  but      and he was suddenly jubilant      i ll bet it s right .  i ll bet anything it s right .     if it should be wrong   said henry   i trust you will keep your resolve to work your way through in any case .     don t worry  i will  but praseodymium is the answer .  i know it is .      however  i wish i had gotten it on my own  henry .  you got it .     that s a small item  sir   said henry  smiling paternally .   you were considering names and  in a very short time  i m sure the oddity of praseodymium would have struck you .  i got to it first only because your labors had already eliminated so many false trails .    afterword   unique is where you find it  and the following story   the lucky piece   were both written  by request  for a magazine that was to be devoted to mystery short stories .  both stories were paid for generously  and then  as sometimes happens in publishing  something went wrong and the magazine never appeared .   i therefore placed  unique is where you find it  in a collection containing both my science fiction and my science essays in alternation  thus encouraging readers to read both and  if they were only acquainted with me in one of my incarnations  to rush out and buy the other with mad abandon  .   unique is where you find it  represented the only brand new item in the book  which is entitled the edge of tomorrow and was published by tor books in      .   this is one of the not so rare cases where something in the story is based on an actual event in my life .  when i was in graduate school  i had a professor much like youngerlea  and my own reaction to him was very much like horace rubin s .  the beilstein incident  described in the story  really happened exactly as described and i really seized the opportunity to humiliate the professor even at the risk of damage to my grades and considered the opportunity well worth the risk .   the lucky piece   mr .  silverstein   said thomas trumbull   how do you justify your existence .    albert silverstein was the guest of james drake at that month s banquet of the black widowers .  he was a rather shriveled looking gentleman  small of body  with a good natured  gnomelike face  a tanned complexion to the bald dome of his head  and an easy smile .   he was smiling now as he said   i suppose you might say that i add to the feeling of security of many people .     indeed .   said trumbull  creasing his own tanned forehead into a washboard effect .   and how do you do that .     well   said silverstein   i own a chain of novelty stores     perfectly innocent novelties  you understand  though some tend to be in questionable taste       mario gonzalo straightened his delicately striped jacket and said  with a touch of sarcasm   like the clay representations of dog excrement that you carefully place on your host s living room carpet when you ve brought your hound with you on a visit .    silverstein laughed .   no  we ve never handled that .  however  one popular item in my father s time was the upset ink bottle and the apparently spreading ink stain in hard rubber that you put on your friend s best tablecloth .  of course  the coming of the ballpoint pen wiped out ink bottles and that particular novelty .  our industry has to keep up with technological change .     where does the feeling of security come in .   asked trumbull doggedly .    the point there is that one of our biggest perennials is the sale of lucky pieces     like this one .   he reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew a small plastic square .  embedded in it was a four leaf clover .   one of our steady sellers   he said .   we sell thousands each year .    geoffrey avalon  who sat next to silverstein  took the object from him and stared at it with a mixture of puzzlement and contempt on his stiffly aristocratic face .  he said disapprovingly   do you really mean that thousands of people believe that a clover mutation will affect the universe in their favor  and are willing to pay money for something like this .     of course   said silverstein cheerfully .   thousands every year  year in and year out .  these days  of course  they hesitate to admit their superstition .  they buy it for their children  supposedly  or as a gift  or as a curio  but they buy it and hang it up in their car or keep it on their key ring .  that thing sells for up to five dollars .     that s revolting   said trumbull .   you make money out of their folly .    silverstein s smile vanished .   not at all   he said seriously .   it is not that object i sell  but a feeling of security  as i said  and that is a very valuable commodity which i sell for far less than it is worth .  for as long as someone owns that four leaf clover  a weight of fear is lifted from his or her mind and soul .  there is less fear of crossing the street  of encountering a mugger  of hearing bad news .  there is less concern if it should happen that a black cat ran across one s path  or if one should carelessly walk beneath a ladder .     but the sense of security they get is a false one .     it is not  sir .  the sense of security they experience is very real .  the cause may be unreal  but it brings the desired result .  consider  too  that most fears that people have are unreal in the sense that they do not tend to happen .  you do not get mugged every time you take a walk .  you do not get bad news every time you pick up a letter .  you do not break a leg every time you fall .  misadventures are  in fact  quite rare .  if my lucky pieces remove  or at least lessen  these unnecessary fears  and lighten the load of apprehension each of us carries about  then i perform a useful service .  the price of that four leaf clover  which will soothe you for as long as you own it  would buy you only five minutes or less of a psychiatrist s time .    roger halsted was now regarding the lucky piece .  as he passed it to emmanuel rubin  he said   where do you find thousands of four leaf clovers every year .  do you pay an army of assistants to comb the clover patches of the world .     of course not   said silverstein .   that thing would cost a couple of thousand dollars if i had to pay an army  and i doubt that anyone would be superstitious enough to submit to that kind of financial sacrifice .  what those are      he paused  and said   jim drake told me that everything said at these meetings was strictly under the rose .     absolutely  al   said drake in his softly hoarse cigarette voice .   silverstein s eyes drifted to the waiter and halsted intervened quickly .   our waiter  henry  is a member of the black widowers  sir  and as quiet about anything he hears as a mummy would be .     in that case   said silverstein   four three leaf clovers  which are almost as common as sand grains  make three four leaf clovers .  what you re holding is a three leaf clover with an added leaf held in place by the plastic .  you ll see the join point under a magnifying glass  but no one has ever returned it on that account .     what if someone did .   asked gonzalo .    we d explain that sometimes a leaf breaks off in the plastic embedding process  and give him his money back .     but this is fraud   said trumbull violently .   you re not really selling them lucky pieces .    silverstein said   think of what you re saying  mr .  trumbull .  there are no lucky pieces outside the mind of the owner .  a four leaf clover does not really bring luck  and a three leaf clover  with a fourth leaf added  can do no worse .  if the owner believes it to be a lucky piece  that is all that counts .    we can argue similarly   he went on   for the aluminum horseshoes we sell  and the cat s fur rabbit s feet  and the cheap rings with lover s knots twined around them  which are said to insure the fidelity of a loved one .  we never guarantee anything  or say that anything will do something .  nothing can stop us  however  from saying that something is said to do something  because that s true .    one big item in my grandfather s day was a cheap brass coin with a swastika on it and the words  good luck  on the other side .  the swastika was a good luck symbol since ancient times  you know .  my grandfather stopped selling them in       however  for obvious reasons .  the industry has to keep up with social change  too  and i suppose the swastika will never again be used as a good luck symbol .    for a moment there was silence in the room and silverstein s generally sunny expression turned solemn and unhappy .      but then he shrugged and said   well  we can only hope that nothing like that ever happens again .      and meanwhile  i am reminded of a peculiar example of the force of a good luck piece .  i m not referring to its force as a bringer of good luck  but it s force in inspiring belief .  however  i mustn t forget that this is a grilling  and a long winded story might not fit in with the occasion .     wait   said gonzalo in sudden urgency .   how peculiar was the peculiar example .     in my opinion  very peculiar .     in that case  would you tell us about it .     oh  for the love of mike   said trumbull  grimacing .   i want to find out about additional aspects of the novelty business .     no   said gonzalo  managing a frown worthy of trumbull himself .   mine is a legitimate question .  am i a black widower or am i not .      jim .    drake stared thoughtfully through the smoke of his cigarette and  as host  made the decision .   mario has put the question and deserves a response .  tell us about it  al .  i m curious  too .    silverstein said   gladly .  it was     let s see     nine years ago .  the wife and i were at a small summer resort and she had gone off to see some summer stock performance in which i was totally uninterested .  fortunately  she didn t mind going alone  so i was spared .    i spent the evening in the living room of the place  with about a dozen others who were likewise not caught up in the stampede to see a third rate play just because  like mount everest  it was there .  besides me  there was a man  his wife  and their son  who figured in what was about to happen .  the man was a rather stiff  unsociable fellow  his wife was passive and quiet  and his son was about twelve years old  well behaved  and clearly very bright .  their name was winters .    then there was a woman who my wife and i referred to  in private  as  the tongue .   her name  if i remember correctly  was mrs .  freed .  she seemed a good natured woman and had a rather lively mind  but what was most noticeable about her was her perpetual stream of talk .  she never seemed to stop except when someone else managed to insert a remark by main force .  hers wasn t an unpleasant voice  it wasn t rasping  or shrill  or hectoring .  it might even have been considered a pleasant voice  if there had been less of it .    her husband walked with a slight stoop  i remember  as though he were forever breasting the wind of that unceasing vocal current .  needless to say  he rarely spoke .    there were six other people  if i remember correctly  two couples and two spare men who were either single or  like me  with their wives at the play .  i don t remember which .    the tongue was knitting skillfully  and i sat watching her fingers as they kept time with her words  and between the two i was hypnotized into a semi coma that was not at all unpleasant .  periodically  as she pulled at her yarn  her large ball of wool rolled to the floor  and each time she scrambled after it .  one time it rolled in the direction of the winterses  and the young boy leapt for it and returned it to her .  she thanked him effusively and patted him and smiled .  it occurred to me at the time that she had no children of her own and that her heart yearned when she saw those of others .    then at one point she reached into her purse for a mint     i suspect she needed a steady supply to keep her tongue lubricated     and the zipper on the purse opened with a rasp .  there were  in fact  several rasps  for it was a multicompartment purse and  of course  she had to find which compartment contained the mints .    one of the other women managed to insert a statement of marvel at what an unusual purse it was .  it was  too  for it was quite thick .  the tongue said  as near as i can get across her way of speaking   unusual indeed i bought it in a little store in new orleans and now the store is gone and the company that made it is out of business and really whenever i find something i like they stop making it at once you see this purse has seven zippers and seven compartments three of the zippers are inside a bit and i can have a different compartment for my lipsticks and my money and my papers and my letters i have to mail and so on they re all lined with slick material so i can empty any or all the compartments when i have to and nothing ever stays behind when i change purses though heaven knows i never want to change this one i ll show you  let s see        that s the way she spoke  you understand  making no use of punctuation .  then  in her effort to show how her purse worked  she started rasping the zippers again  looking for a compartment she could empty without creating too much trouble for herself  i suppose .    when she finally decided  she turned the purse upside down  gave it a shake  and out came flying a small shower of coins and costume jewelry .      nothing left behind   she said triumphantly  spreading the opening apart and showing it to the woman who had asked .  she then put everything back  and again there was the rasp of zippers as she tried to decide on another compartment to empty  but apparently thought the better of it .  she put the purse down and continued talking .    i remember this incident well and repeated it to show you that in the novelty business  we have to keep our ears and eyes open .  listening to her talk about her purse gave me an idea for a novelty i called  the bottomless purse .   it was a real purse  with three zippers above and a hidden zipper below .  two zippers above were straightforward and opened into two compartments  but they were unobtrusive .  the middle zipper above had a very noticeable handle in colored glass and was usually the only one the victim saw .    the owner of the purse would fill it with unimportant objects and would then give it to some innocent and easily embarrassed man or woman at a party .   would you hold this for me for a moment .   then  a while later  she would say   would you reach into my purse for my compact .  it s right on top .   the victim would  of course  pull the noticeable zipper and that would activate the hidden zipper below .  with both compartments open  everything would drop out all over the floor  to the utter confusion and horror of the victim .    avalon said disapprovingly   and another old friendship would come to an end .     not at all   said silverstein .   once the joke became obvious  the victim usually laughed harder than anyone  especially since he or she had the pleasure of sitting back while the perpetrator had to go through the trouble of collecting everything that had fallen .    we had it on the market the next spring and it did pretty well .  it wasn t a world beater but it did pretty well .  it was a woman s item  of course  but it s a mistake to think women are not interested in novelties .  you have to       trumbull interrupted .   was that the peculiar event .  emptying the purse .    silverstein seemed to have been brought up with a jerk .  he flushed  then laughed in an embarrassed way .   well  no .  actually  i haven t come to that part yet .      i m afraid i have a little of the tongue in me  especially when it comes to a discussion of my profession .    it was some time after the purse incident that the winters boy caught my eye .  he had been watching and listening to everything with a look of deep interest  but now he suddenly seemed concerned .  he seemed to hesitate a moment and then turned to his father and spoke rapidly in a very low voice .  as he listened  the father stiffened and his face went a dead white .  he muttered something to his wife  and then all three began to peer about the floor  to move their chairs and look beneath .  they looked very anxious  the father particularly so .    i did what anyone would do .  i said   have you folks lost something .     the father looked up  seemed for a moment to be lost in thought  then  as though he had come to a difficult decision  rose to his feet and said in a stiff and pedantic way   i m afraid that my son has lost a lucky piece that he greatly valued  though of course it has no intrinsic worth .  it looks like a rather large coin with good luck symbols of various kinds on each side .  it may have rolled somewhere .  if anyone sees it        we were all moved by the same kindly impulse or  if you wish to be cynical about it  each of us thought it would be fun to look for something that was lost when we were in no personal agony at the loss .  either way  the room was at once put under an unsystematic  but thorough search .  two men moved the couch  searched amid the dust beneath  then put it back in place .  the material in the unused fireplace was looked through .  the carpet was lifted all around the edges .  it was all to no avail .    i felt rather guilty .  the lucky piece  as described  was certainly not one of ours  but i felt somehow responsible .  i said to the boy softly   you know  son  these lucky pieces don t really bring good luck .  if it doesn t show up  that doesn t mean you re in for trouble .     the boy looked at me in his quick  intelligent way and said   i know that .  i just hate to lose anything .     but he looked very troubled just the same and it s an axiom in my business that to deny superstition doesn t mean a thing .  the deniers are quite as likely to believe as the admitters are .    we were all taking our seats again .  someone said to the boy   maybe you lost it before you came into the room  sonny .     mr .  winters turned to the son .   is that possible  maurice .     maurice looked more frightened than ever  but his high pitched voice was firm .  he said   no  father  i had the lucky piece when i entered this room  i m sure of that .     winters clearly accepted his son s word as putting the matter beyond dispute .  he cleared his throat and looked  somehow  both embarrassed and determined .  he said   ladies and gentlemen  it may be that one of you has picked up this valueless object a little while ago and put it away without thinking and that you are now reluctant to admit it .  please don t let embarrassment stand in the way .  this means a great deal to my little maurice .     no one said a word .  each one looked from neighbor to neighbor as though expecting someone to produce the lucky piece and curious to see who would .  winters  face red with mortification  allowed his eyes to rest for a moment on the tongue s thick purse .  as they did so  i couldn t help remembering the coins that had rolled out of it when she demonstrated how it might be emptied .    the tongue had participated in the search and had been unusually quiet since .  she caught the look and had no trouble interpreting it .  her lips tightened a bit  but she showed no open sign of offense .  she said   well i don t suppose it would be convincing if i told you i didn t have the thing in my purse you would really want to see for yourself so let s just empty the whole thing on the table .     it was really quite an impressive and convincing performance .  she put the purse on the table before her and said  slowly   one     two     three     four     five     six     seven .   with each count  there was the sound of a zipper being rasped open .  she then turned the purse upside down and a cascade of items tumbled out upon the table .  you wouldn t believe one woman could have so many items of so many different kinds in one purse .  some items rolled off the table  but she didn t try to stop them .  she shook the purse to show nothing else was falling out and then tossed it to one side .    she said kindly  and with no trace of ill temper   sonny  you know what your lucky piece looks like so just rummage through everything on the table and look at whatever rolled on the floor .  go ahead  you can look through my wallet  and any envelope you see .  i know you won t take anything but what is yours .     the boy took her at her word and looked through and at everything thoroughly  while his father remained at his side  watching the process sharply .  finally  the boy said   father  it isn t here .     winters nodded gloomily and the tongue began putting the objects back into her purse  carefully choosing which of the seven compartments was the correct one for each item  and carrying on a running commentary as she did so .  the boy picked up the items on the floor for her .    after that  of course  the other two ladies had to follow suit and empty their purses  but with less good grace than the tongue had .  i was the first man to turn out my pockets and then the other men did the same .    the good luck piece was nowhere to be found     not in any purse  not in any pocket .  and still winters stood there  clearly unwilling to give up but uncertain as to the next step .    i still felt a bit of responsibility  but i also felt irritated  so i said   if it will make you feel any better  mr .  winter  you and i can step into the library  lock the door  and pull down the blinds .  i ll take off my clothes and you can search them for hidden pockets and lucky pieces .  you can also see if i have it glued to my skin .     i didn t think for one moment that he d take me up on it  but damned if he didn t .  i had a most embarrassed and uncomfortable five minutes as i stood there totally bare while he went over my clothes and studied me narrowly front  side  and back .    i was beginning to worry that he d suggest inspecting my various apertures  but the lucky piece was undoubtedly too large to make them reasonable hiding places .    one by one  the other men followed my lead .  one made as though he were going to refuse  but when every eye turned on him with clear suspicion  he gave in .  but he left in a fury as soon as the search was completed .  perhaps he was wearing dirty underwear .    when that was done  the tongue rose to her feet and said   well if mrs .  winters will do the honors i ll stand still to be searched after all i might have slipped it into my bra there d be plenty of room there and it wouldn t show through this dress the way i drape my shawl over it .     off she marched and  eventually  back she came  and the other two women had to agree to be searched as well .    silverstein paused in his tale to sip at his neglected brandy  and halsted said   i take it the lucky piece wasn t found on anyone .     that s right   said silverstein   it wasn t .  apparently  though  winters didn t give up easily .  he got in touch with the manager of the hotel and persuaded him to detail two employees to help winters look through the room even more carefully  to say nothing of the passages adjoining  the grounds outside the windows  and so on .  at least  that s the story that went round the next day .     and did they find it .   asked halsted .    no   said silverstein .   winters looked like death warmed over the next day .  in the evening  he took what i was sure was an early departure  and i myself heard the manager feverishly assuring him that the search would continue and that as soon as the lucky piece was found it would be forwarded to him .     and was it found thereafter .     no  it wasn t .  at least  no word reached us to that effect up to the time my wife and i left a week later .      but you see the peculiar angle  don t you .    gonzalo said   sure .  the thing disappeared into nothingness .     of course not   said avalon sharply .   what evidence do we have that the lucky piece existed in the first place .  the whole thing may have been a charade .     to what end .   said drake  making a face .   avalon said   to demonstrate that it was gone  of course .     but why .   said drake again .   if it were something intrinsically valuable  i can see that winters might be laying the groundwork for an insurance claim     but a lucky piece worth  what .  seventy five cents .     i don t know the motive   said avalon in exasperation   but i can only suppose that winters had one .  i d certainly sooner believe in the existence of an unknown motive than in the total disappearance of a material object .    silverstein shook his head .   i don t think it was a charade  mr .  avalon .  if winters was playing an elaborate game  it was one in which his wife and son were part .  about the wife i can t say for certain  but that boy  maurice  was not acting .  i cannot doubt for a moment that he was really scared .    then  too  if it were really all play acting  why would mr .  winters feel it necessary to go to such extremes .  a much simpler search would have been sufficient to establish that the lucky piece was missing  if that were all he wanted to do .  that was the peculiar thing to me .  why should winters have searched with such extreme assiduity  and why should young maurice have look frightened rather than merely unhappy .  don t you see the explanation .  it seems obvious to me .    there was silence among the black widowers for a few moments and then rubin said   suppose you tell us your explanation  mr .  silverstein  and i ll then tell you if it is correct or not .    silverstein smiled .   oh  you ll agree with me .  once the matter is explained  it will seem as obvious to you as it does to me .      that was not the boy s lucky piece  it was his father s .  winters had allowed his son to have it for a while and the boy had lost it .  i m sure the boy knew how intensely his father valued the lucky piece  so he looked scared  very scared  and i don t blame him .  and it is only by realizing that winters was looking for his own lucky piece that you can rationalize the nature of his search .    halsted said   he insisted it was his son s lucky piece .     of course .  people are quite apt to deny their superstitions  as i told you earlier     especially if they are intelligent and educated and in the presence of other educated people     and most especially if the grip of the superstition is pathologically strong .  they are intelligent enough to be bitterly ashamed of their madness and yet still be helpless in its grip .  i m a professional in such matters and i tell you it s so .  of course  he would pretend the lucky piece was his son s and i believed that  at first .  however  as i watched winters i eventually recognized his emotions to be those of someone terrorized in the belief that his luck had vanished forever .  he was as much a victim of an irresistible craving for that vanished security as a drug addict would be for the heroin he lacked .    trumbull said   and yet you sell this druglike thing to people .    silverstein shook his head .   a vanishingly small percentage are affected so extremely .  is a manufacture of penicillin to be blamed for the death of a few who develop a fatal sensitivity to it .      well  mr .  rubin  am i right or wrong .   he smiled confidently .   rubin said   wrong  i m afraid .  you re having winters behave in two irreconcilable ways .  if he is so in the grip of the lucky piece mania that he would carry on a psychotically intense search for it  then  surely  he would never have given it to his boy to play with .  no  i find it impossible to believe in the lucky piece story either for the son or the father .    silverstein said  in the offended tone of one whose clever idea  triumphantly produced  is cavalierly dismissed   i would like to hear an alternate explanation that makes any sense .     no problem   said rubin .   i would suggest that the so called lucky piece was  in actual fact  a very valuable item .     do you mean it was actually a piece of gold  or contained real jewels  or was a work of art .   said silverstein  with what was almost a sneer .   if so  the objection you raised still stands .  why give it to the boy to play with .  and  for that matter  why call it a lucky piece .  if winters had mentioned its value  we d have looked harder and submitted to a search with better grace .     it might be   said rubin   that the value rested in something unmentionable .  suppose it was a device of some sort  or carried a message     a coded carving  or microfilm in a tiny inner compartment       silverstein frowned .   do you mean winters was a spy .     consider it as a hypothesis   said rubin .   winters  having reason to feel there were others on his track and that an effort would be made to relieve him of the object he carried  had his son carry it instead  feeling that boy would go unsuspected .    avalon harrumphed disapprovingly .   a rather heartless thing for a father to do .     not at all   said rubin .   winters himself would still be the one liable to be attacked  if there were danger of that sort of thing .  but then they wouldn t find the object upon him .  if they failed to suspect the boy of being the carrier  the youngster would not be in danger at any time .  at least  that must have been his hope .  and if there was danger for the boy  it might be that he was the sort of patriot who felt that his country and his task came first .    when the object turned out to be missing  winters  first thought must have been that it had been accidentally dropped  but when it was not found at once  winters would have come to the frightening conclusion that it had been stolen by an enemy .  he then carried through a major search in the hope that his adversary  whoever it might prove to be  would be uncovered at the same time the object was found .  naturally  he had to pretend it was something trivial he was searching for .  but since it wasn t found  he was forced to leave  his mission destroyed  his own cover blown  his enemy secure .  i don t envy him his situation .  and i don t wonder his son was frightened  if he was intelligent enough to have an inkling of what was going on .    the black widowers showed no particular enthusiasm over this .  drake shook his head solemnly .   rubin said indignantly   what do you think  tom .  this is your kind of baby .    trumbull shrugged .   i don t know everything that goes on .  this happened nine years ago  you say  silverstein .     yes  sir .     it may be that there was something  then  that involved south africa and its attempts to develop a nuclear bomb     the american government was not involved in that  though  in any way .     it didn t have to be   said rubin   from anything we heard .  but i take it  tom  that my interpretation is possible .     possible  sure  but i don t commit myself to more than that .    gonzalo said   you re all missing the point .  you re talking about motivations  and why a kid should look frightened  and why a guy should search madly .  no one seems to be the least interested in the real puzzle .  what s the difference whether it s a lucky piece or a key to a nuclear bomb .  what happened to it .  where did it go .    avalon said heavily   i see no mystery there .  the only way the object could disappear into nothingness was for it not to have been brought into the place to begin with .  despite the young man s denial  he must have lost it before he ever entered the room and was afraid to admit it     assuming it existed in the first place .  after all  intelligent or not  he was twelve years old .  he couldn t resist playing with it and he may have dropped it somewhere irretrievable  perhaps .  he would then have been afraid to say anything about it  for he knows it is important to his father .  in the room  later  his father asks him if it is safe  and he has to admit it s gone  but can t possibly say he lost it some time before and dared not own up to it .     no .   said silverstein violently .   he just wasn t that kind of youngster .  you could see he had been brought up to meet rigid grown up standards .  the father didn t ask him for the lucky piece .  the boy went up to him to volunteer the information that it was gone .  if he had lost it earlier  he would have reported it earlier .  i m sure of that .    drake said   suppose the loss were accidental .  he might have pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket an hour earlier somewhere else and the object might have come out and fallen in the grass  let us say .  he may never have noted the loss till he was in the room .     no .   said silverstein again .   the boy said he had it when he came into the room and his father believed him and didn t question the matter .  he knew his son .    avalon said   well  mr .  silverstein  if you insist the object really existed and was really lost in the room  do you have any idea where it went to .    silverstein shrugged .   i don t know .  maybe it fell through a crack into the cellar .  maybe it was in some perfectly ordinary place and for some reason everyone overlooked it .  many a time i ve scoured my apartment for something that seemed to have vanished  and then  when i found it  it proved to be in plain sight all along .     yes  after you found it   said avalon .   one always finds it  even without a search as prolonged and intense as winters  search .    a momentary silence fell and then trumbull said   we seem to be at an impasse .  the puzzle is an interesting one  but i don t see that it s anything that can be solved .  we just don t have enough information .    gonzalo said   well  wait .  we haven t heard from henry .    trumbull said   don t wish it on henry .  if a puzzle is inherently insoluble  it is insoluble even for henry .    gonzalo said   is that a fact .  well  i want to hear henry say that .      henry .    henry  who from the sideboard had listened carefully to all the proceedings  smiled a small smile in an avuncular fashion  and said   as a matter of fact  mr .  gonzalo  i can t help but think that a solution may be suggested .  the object need not be considered to have vanished mysteriously .    trumbull s eyebrows climbed .   really  henry .  what do you suggest .     well  sir  consider mr .  silverstein s comment to the effect that he had designed a trick purse through the inspiration of the one belonging to mrs .  freed  the woman who talked a great deal .    silverstein stared .   do you mean the tongue had a trick purse .     no  sir .  but it did occur to me that tricks could be done with even a legitimate purse if it had seven zippers and seven compartments .     you had better explain  henry   said drake .   henry said   this is all supposition  gentlemen  but suppose mrs .  freed talked endlessly for a purpose .  one who earns the sobriquet  tongue  is bound to seem silly to anyone less penetrating than mr .  silverstein  and is sure to be underestimated     which is an advantage for a spy .    suppose she had learned of the existence of the object and  for some reason  suspected it was in the possession of the boy  maurice .  her ball of yarn fell to the floor several times  and at least once  according to mr .  silverstein  it rolled in the direction of maurice .  he sprang to help her  she petted him and  in this way  distracted him by touching him     an old pickpocket s trick .  a moment later  the object was not in the boy s pocket but in mrs .  freed s hand .    next she reached for a mint .  in doing so  the object was dropped into a compartment that was already open and contained nothing .  she had to fiddle with the zippers  searching for the mints  and when she was done  all the compartments were closed  including the one with the object .    she then displayed how easily and surely the purse might be emptied by opening one compartment and turning the purse upside down .  having made that demonstration  intended to impress everyone  she fiddled with the zippers again  according to mr .  silverstein  as though she were searching for another compartment with which to demonstrate  but apparently deciding against it .  when she was done fiddling  however  all the compartments were closed  except the one with the object .  that was open .  she had then only to wait .  if the object was not noticed to have been lost  fine .  if the loss were noticed  she was ready .    the loss was noticed and winters  eye fell on her purse .  she at once volunteered to empty it  and pulled every zipper  counting ostentatiously from one to seven as she did so .  when she was done  the six compartments which had been closed were open  and the one compartment  with the object and nothing else inside  which had been open  was closed .    she then upended the purse and out of it dropped every last thing it contained but the object .  and because she had worked very hard to seem nothing but a chatterbox  because she had laid such a careful background  and because she had complied cheerfully with the search  no one gave any thought to investigating the apparently empty purse .  in the end  therefore  the object seemed to have vanished into thin air .    mr .  silverstein  whose mouth had dropped open as henry had talked  closed it with what seemed to be an effort  then said   it might have happened exactly like that .  it seems to fit perfectly what i saw  and i ve told the story so many times in the past nine years  there is no question of my having forgotten what i saw .  still  i don t suppose we can ever know for sure .     no   said trumbull   but i ll bet on henry  and from now on  i think my people will be on the watch for harmless chatterboxes with intricate purses .     only if they are zippered  sir   said henry .   purses with catches and clasps open quietly  but close with a loud snap  whereas the sounds of a zipper opening and of a zipper closing are indistinguishable .    afterword  as explained in the previous afterword   the lucky piece  was bought and paid for  but the magazine that was to publish it never appeared .  the story therefore makes its first appearance in this book .  that doesn t bother me .  in each of my black widowers collections  i have managed to include some stories that have not appeared elsewhere .  i consider it a bonus to those who are generous enough to buy these books .   incidentally  it is necessary for me occasionally to include some graphic details of some facet of the human experience as part of the background to these stories .  in  the lucky piece   for instance  i discuss the novelty business to some extent .  you may have admired the neatness of my research into the matter  but please don t .  i am far too lazy  and far too busy writing a million other things  to waste time on research .  when i need details on the novelty business  i just make them up out of my ever fevered imagination .  consequently  if you run a novelty business yourself and feel i have made a mistake  write and enlighten me .   triple devil  it was not surprising that at this particular banquet of the black widowers  the conversation turned on the subject of self made men .   after all  mario gonzalo  host of the evening  was bringing as his guest the well known retired owner of a chain of bookstores  benjamin manfred .  it was also well known that manfred had delivered newspapers as a young lad  more than half a century before  and was the son of poor but honest parents     very honest  and very  very poor .   and now here he was  not exactly a getty or an onassis  but very comfortably situated .  and with four children and a number of grandchildren all engaged in dealing with one portion or another of the chain  he was even the founder of a dynasty .   since manfred had phoned to say  with many regrets  that he would be a little delayed  but would certainly be there before the actual banquet was begun  it meant that the cocktail hour was taking place in his absence and the conversation could continue freely without the inhibition produced by the very presence of one of those who was the subject of discussion .   nor was it surprising that the loudest of the pontificators was emmanuel rubin .    there is no such thing as a self made man     or woman  for that matter     anymore   said rubin with passion  and when he spoke with passion  there was no choice but to listen .  if his sixty four inches made him the shortest of the black widowers  his voice was undoubtedly the loudest .  add to that the bristling of his sparse gray beard  and the flashing of his eyes through the thick lenses that served to magnify them almost frighteningly  and he was not to be ignored .    ben manfred is a self made man   said gonzalo defensively .    maybe he is   said rubin  reluctant to make any exceptions to any generalization he had launched   but he self made himself in the     s and     s .  i m talking about now     post world war two america  which is prosperous and welfare minded .  you can always find help making your way through school  tiding yourself over unemployment  getting grants of some sort to help you get started .  sure you can make it  but not by yourself  never by yourself .  there s a whole set of government apparatuses helping you .     perhaps there is something in what you say  manny   said geoffrey avalon  looking down with a somewhat distant amusement .  his seventy four inches made him the tallest of the black widowers .   nevertheless  wouldn t you consider yourself a self made man .  i never heard that you inherited or married wealth  and i don t see you  somehow  accepting government handouts .     well  i haven t gotten anything the easy way   said rubin   but you can t be a self made man until you re made .  if i didn t have a rich father  and don t have a rich wife  neither am i exactly rich myself .  i can afford some of the niceties of life  but i m not rich .  what we have to do is define the self made man .  it s not enough that he s not starving .  it s not enough that he s better off than he used to be .  a self made man is someone who starts off poor  without any money above the subsistence level .  then  without getting large slabs of money from the outside  he manages  through hard work and shrewd business acumen  or through enormous talent  to become a millionaire .     how about luck .   growled thomas trumbull .   suppose someone enters a sweepstakes and wins a million dollars  or suppose he consistently backs winners at a racetrack .    rubin said   you know that doesn t count .  you re just a luck made man then .  that goes if you pull an old man from under a hackney coach and he calls down heaven s blessing on you and gives you a million dollars .  and i m not counting those people who get rich by illegal activity .  al capone  from a standing start  was making sixty million dollars a year before he was thirty  at a time when the dollar was worth a dollar and not twenty two cents .  he paid no taxes on it  either .  you can call him self made  but not by my definition .     the trouble with you  manny   said roger halsted   is that you want to restrict the term to people you approve of morally .  andrew carnegie was a self made man and he was a great philanthropist after he had made his millions  and  as far as i know  he was never put in jail .  still  on his way up  i ll bet he engaged in questionable business activities and that he managed to grind the faces of the poor when that was necessary .    rubin said   within the law is all i ask for .  i don t expect people to be saints .    gonzalo said  with a totally unconvincing air of innocence   what about your friend  isaac asimov  manny       and  of course  rubin rose to the bait at once .   my friend .  just because i lend him a few bucks now and then to help him pay the rent  money that i don t ever expect to see again  he goes around telling everyone he s my friend .     come on  manny .  no one s going to believe that libel .  he s well heeled .  and according to his autobiography  he started with nothing .  he worked in his father s candy store  and he delivered newspapers  too .  he s a self made man .     is that so .   said rubin .   well  if he s a self made man  all i can say is that he certainly worships his creator .    there was no telling how long rubin would have gone on to improvise variations on this theme  but it was at this moment that benjamin manfred arrived  and conversation stopped at once while gonzalo made the introductions .   manfred was of average height  quite thin  with a lined but good natured face .  his hair was sparse and white  his clothing neat and old fashioned .  he wore a vest  for instance  and one was surprised that the chain of a pocket watch was not looped from one side to the other .  he wore a wristwatch instead  but it was so old fashioned that it had a stem winder .   he acknowledged the introductions with a pleasant smile  and when he shook hands with rubin  said   i m so pleased to meet you  mr .  rubin .  i read your mysteries with such pleasure .     thank you  sir   said rubin  trying manfully to be modest .    in my stores  i can always count on good sales for your books .  you almost match asimov .    and he turned away to greet james drake  while rubin slowly turned a furious magenta  and the five other black widowers suffered substantial internal pain in their desperate efforts not to laugh .   henry  the perennial waiter of the black widowers  having seen to it that the old man was supplied with a generous dry martini  announced that dinner was served .   drake stubbed out his cigarette and looked at the small mound of caviar on his plate with pleasure .  he helped himself to the condiments being passed around by henry  hesitating at the chopped onion and then firmly taking two helpings .   he whispered to gonzalo   how come you can afford caviar  mario .    mario whispered back   old man manfred is paying me very nicely for a portrait he s sitting for .  that s how i know him  and i might as well show him a bit of a good time with his money .     it s nice to know people still want their portraits painted .     some people still have good taste   said gonzalo .   drake grinned .   would you care to repeat that loudly enough for manny to hear it .     no  thanks   said gonzalo .   i m host and i m responsible for the decorum of the table .    the table  as it happened  was perfectly decorous .  rubin seemed subdued and let pass a dozen opportunities to tell manfred what was wrong with the bookselling business and how it contributed to the impoverishment of worthy young authors .   if the black widowers were quieter for rubin s withdrawal from the fray  they were happy enough  and loud in their praise of the courses as they passed     the turtle soup  the roast goose with the potato pancakes and red cabbage  the baked alaska     and perhaps just a trifle less than tactful in their clear surprise that a dinner hosted by gonzalo should have such lucullan overtones .   gonzalo bore it with good humor and  when it was time to tinkle the water glass melodiously with his spoon  he even made a noble attempt to mollify rubin .   he said   manny  you re the book person here and  as we all agree  the best in your class  bar none .  would you please do the honors in grilling mr .  manfred .    rubin snorted loudly  and said with only his normal supply of grumpiness   i might as well .  i doubt that any of the rest of you are literate enough .    he turned to manfred and said   mr .  manfred  how do you justify your existence .    manfred did not seem surprised at the question .  he said   if there s one person who shouldn t have trouble justifying his existence  it is someone whose business it is to purvey books .  books  gentlemen  hold within them the gathered wisdom of humanity  the collected knowledge of the world s thinkers  the amusement and excitement built up by the imaginations of brilliant people .  books contain humor  beauty  wit  emotion  thought  and  indeed  all of life .  life without books is empty .    halsted muttered   these days there s movies and tv .    manfred heard .  he said  with a smile   i watch television also .  sometimes i will see a movie .  just because i appreciate a meal such as the one we have just had doesn t mean that i may not eat a hot dog now and then .  but i don t confuse the two .  no matter how splendid movies and television may seem  they are junk food for the mind  amusement for the illiterate  a bit of diversion for those who are momentarily in the mood for nothing more .     unfortunately   said avalon  looking solemn   hollywood is where the money is .     of course   said manfred   but what does that mean .  undoubtedly  a chain of hamburger joints will make more money than a four star restaurant  but that doesn t convert hamburger to peking duck .     still   said rubin   since we are discussing money  may i ask if you consider yourself a self made man .    manfred s eyebrows lifted .   that is rather an old fashioned phrase  is it not .     right   said rubin  with a stir of enthusiasm .   i maintained exactly that over the cocktails it is my opinion that nowadays it is impossible for anyone to be a truly self made man .  there is too much routine government help .    manfred shook with silent laughter .   before the new deal  that was not so .  the government in those days was a highly moral and neutral referee .  if a large corporation had an argument with a small employee  the government s job was to see that both sides had only the help they could afford .  what could be fairer than that .  of course the rich always won  but that was just a coincidence  and if the poor man didn t see that  the government sent in the national guard to explain things to him .  those were great days .     nevertheless  the point is that you were poor when you were young  were you not .     very poor .  my parents arrived in the united states from germany in      and brought me with them .  i was three at the time .  my father was employed at a tailor shop and made five dollars a week to begin with .  i was the only child then  but you can imagine how it improved his economic position when he later had three daughters one after the other .  he was a socialist  and a vocal one  and as soon as he became a citizen he voted for eugene v .  debs .  this made some people  whose views on freedom of speech were strictly limited to freedom of their speech  feel he ought to be deported .    my mother helped out by part time work in between babies .  from the age of nine  i delivered papers in the morning before school and had odd jobs after school .  somehow my father managed to accumulate enough money to make a down payment on a small tailor shop of his own  and i worked with him after school .  once i turned sixteen  i didn t have to stay in school anymore  so i quit at once to work in the shop full time .  i never finished high school .    rubin said   you don t sound like an uneducated man .     it depends on how you define education .  if you are willing to allow the kind of education you pick up for yourself in books  then i m educated  thanks to old mr .  lineweaver .     this mr .  lineweaver gave you books .     only one  actually .  but he got me interested in books .  in fact  i owe nearly everything to him .  i couldn t have gotten my start without him  so that maybe i m not a self made man .  and yet  he didn t give me anything .  i had to work it out for myself  so maybe i am a self made man .  you know  i m honestly not sure .    drake said   you ve got me confused  mr .  manfred .  what was it you had to work out for yourself .  a puzzle of some sort .     in a way .     is it a well known episode in your life .    manfred said   there was some mention in newspapers at the time  but it was a long time ago and it has been forgotten .  sometimes  though  i wonder how fair the whole thing was .  did i take advantage .  i was accused of undue influence and who knows what  but i won out .    rubin said   i m afraid  mr .  manfred  i must ask you to tell us the story in detail .  whatever you say will be held completely confidential .    manfred said   so mr .  gonzalo told me  sir  and i accept that .   but  for a moment  manfred s eyes rested on henry  who stood  with his usual air of respectful attention  at the sideboard .   trumbull caught the glance and said   our waiter  whose name is henry  is a member of the club .     in that case   said manfred   i will tell you the story .  and if you find it dull  you have only yourselves to blame .     but wait   interjected gonzalo eagerly   if there s some kind of puzzle or mystery involved  i figure you solved it .  right .     oh  yes .  there is no mystery waiting to be solved .   he waved his hands  as though in erasure .   no puzzle .     in that case   said gonzalo   when you tell the story about mr .  lineweaver  don t tell us the answer to the puzzle .  let us guess .    manfred chuckled .   you won t guess .  not correctly .     good   said rubin   please continue with the story  and we will try not to interrupt .    manfred said   the story starts when i was not quite fifteen  just after the end of the war     the first one  world war i .  it was saturday  no school  but i still had papers to deliver  and the last stop on the route was an old mansion .  i left the paper in a little hook on the side of the door  and once a week  i rang the bell and a servant came out and gave me the money for the papers and would hand me a quarter as a tip .  the general payment was a dime  so i was always grateful to this particular place .    saturday was collection day  so i rang the bell  and this time  for the first time i could remember  out came old mr .  lineweaver himself .  maybe he just happened to be near the door when i rang the bell .  he was about seventy and i thought he was just another servant     i had never seen him before .    it was a bitterly cold day in january           it was     and i was inadequately dressed .  i wore the only coat i had and it was rather thin .  my hands and face were blue and i was shivering .  i wasn t particularly sorry for myself  because i had delivered papers on many cold days and that was the way it was  that s all .  what could i do about it .    mr .  lineweaver was perturbed  however .  he said   come inside  boy .  i ll pay you where it s warm .   his air of authority made me realize he was the owner of the house  and that scared me .    then  when he paid me  he gave me a dollar as a tip .  i had never heard of a dollar tip .  next he brought me into his library     a large room  with bookshelves from floor to ceiling on every wall  and a balcony with additional books .  he had a servant bring me hot cocoa  and he kept me there for almost an hour  asking me questions .    i tried to be very polite  but i finally told him i had to go home or my parents would think i was run over .  i couldn t call to reassure them  for  in       very few people had telephones .    when i came home  my parents were very impressed  especially with the dollar tip  which my father took and put away .  it wasn t cruelty on his part  it was merely that there was a common coffer for the earnings of the entire family  and none of us could hold out any of it for themselves .  my allowance for the week was exactly zero .    the next saturday  old mr .  lineweaver was waiting for me .  it wasn t nearly as cold as the week before  but he invited me in for hot cocoa again .  when he offered me another dollar  i followed my father s instructions and told him that it was too much  and that a quarter would be enough .  my father  i m afraid  had learned from life to distrust unexplained generosity .  mr .  lineweaver laughed and said he had nothing smaller and that i must take it .    i suspect he noticed the curious looks i was giving the books  for he asked if i had any books at home .  i said my father had a couple  but they were in german .  he asked if i went to school and  of course  i said yes  but that as soon as i was sixteen i would have to quit .  he asked if i went to the public library  and i said that i did sometimes  but what with the newspaper delivery and the tailor shop  i didn t really have much chance to do so .      would you like to look at these books .   he asked  waving his hands toward the walls .      i might get them dirty  mr .  lineweaver   i said diffidently  looking at my hands  which were black with newspaper ink  of course .    he said   i tell you what .  on sundays  when you have no school and the tailor shop is closed  you come here after you ve delivered your papers and you can wash your hands and stay in the library as long as you want and read some of those books .  would you like that .       oh  yes   i said .      good   he said .   then you tell your parents you ll be spending the time here .     i did and  for ten years  i was there faithfully every sunday except when i was sick or he was away .  eventually  when i grew older  i came by on saturday afternoons  and even on a few weekday evenings .    he had a wonderfully wide variety of books for me to choose from  and was strong on british fiction .  i read thackeray and trollope and puzzled over tristram shandy .  i remember being fascinated by warren s ten thousand a year .  it was a mixture of humor and incredibly reactionary politics .  the antihero was tittlebat titmouse and there was a very effective villain named oily gammon .  i eventually learned  from my reading  that  gammon  was a slang term equivalent to our present slang term of  boloney .     i read pope  byron  shelley  keats  tennyson  coleridge     didn t like wordsworth or browning  for some reason .  there was lots of shakespeare  naturally .  i wasn t strong on nonfiction  but i remember trying to read darwin s origin of species and not getting very far .  there was a new book  outline of history by h .  g .  wells  that fascinated me .  i read some american writers  too .  mark twain and hawthorne  but i couldn t stay with moby dick .  i read some of walter scott .  all this was spread out over years  to be sure .    trumbull  at this point  stirred in his seat and said   mr .  manfred  i take it this lineweaver was a wealthy man .     quite well to do  yes .     did he have children .     two grown sons .  a grown daughter .     grandchildren .     several .     why did he make a surrogate son of you  then .    manfred considered .   i don t know .  the house was empty except for servants .  he was a widower .  his children and grandchildren rarely came to visit .  he was lonely  i suppose  and liked having a youngster in the house  now and then .  i m under the impression he thought i was bright and he certainly enjoyed my pleasure in the books .  he would occasionally sit and talk to me about them  ask me what i thought of this book or that  and suggest new ones i might read .     did he ever give you any money .   asked trumbull .    only that dollar a week  which he handed me without fail each saturday .  eventually  i dropped the paper route  but he didn t know that .  i kept on delivering his paper every day .  i d buy it myself and deliver it .     did he feed you .     the hot cocoa .  when i stayed through lunch  a servant would bring me a ham sandwich and milk  or the equivalent .     did he give you books .    manfred shook his head slowly .   not while he was alive .  never .  he wouldn t give me one  or let me borrow one .  i could read whatever i liked  but only as long as i sat in the library .  i had to wash my hands before i walked into the library and i had to put each book back on the shelf in the place where i had got it before taking another .    avalon said   i should think mr .  lineweaver s children would resent you .     i think they did   said manfred   but i never saw them while the old man was alive .  once he said to me  with a little chuckle   one of my sons said i must keep an eye on you  or you ll take some of my books .   i must have looked horrified at the insult to my parents .  would that be the kind of son they would bring up .  he laughed and tousled my hair and said   i told him he didn t know what he was talking about .      rubin said   were his books valuable .     at the time  it never occurred to me that they might be .  i had no idea what books cost  or that some might be worth more than others .  i found out  eventually  though .  he was proud of them  you see .  he told me he had bought every one of them himself .  i said that some of them looked so old he must have bought them when he was a little boy .    he laughed  and said   no  i bought many of them in secondhand bookstores .  they were old when i got them  you see .  if you do that  sometimes you can pick up some very valuable books for almost nothing .  triple devil   he said .   triple devil .     i thought he was referring to himself and how clever he was to find these valuable books .  of course  i didn t know which ones might be the valuable ones .    as the years passed  i developed an ambition .  what i wanted was to own a bookstore someday .  i wanted to be surrounded by books and sell them till i had made enough money to build a library of my own  a collection of books i wouldn t have to sell and that i could read to my heart s content .    i told this to mr .  lineweaver once  when he questioned me .  i said i was going to work in the tailor shop and save every cent till i had enough to buy a bookstore     or maybe an empty store and then buy the books .    lineweaver shook his head .   that will take a long time  bennie .  the trouble is i ve got children of my own to take care of  even though they re a selfish lot .  still  there s no reason i can t help you out in some sneaky way that they won t be able to do anything about .  just remember i own a very valuable book .     i said   i hope it s hidden away  mr .  lineweaver .       in the best place in the world   he said .   do you remember your chesterton .  what s the best place to hide a pebble .     i grinned .  the father brown stories were new then  and i loved them .   on the beach   i said   and the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest .       exactly right   said mr .  lineweaver   and my book is hidden in my library .     i looked about curiously .   which one .   i asked  and was instantly sorry  for he might have thought i would want to take it .    he shook his head .   i won t tell you .  triple devil .  triple devil .   again  i felt he was referring to his own slyness in not revealing his secret .    in early       ten years almost to the day after i had first met him  he died  and i received a call from the lawyers to attend a reading of the will .  that astonished me  but my mother was in seventh heaven .  she felt i would inherit a great deal of money .  my father frowned and worried that the money belonged to the family  and that i would be a thief to take it from them .  he was that kind of person .    i attended  dressed in my best clothes  and felt incredibly ill at ease and out of place .  i was surrounded by the family  the children and grandchildren i had never before seen  and their looks at me were the reverse of loving .  i think they  too  thought i would get a great deal of money .    but they didn t have to worry .  i was left one book     one     from his library .  any book i wished .  it was to be my free choice .  i knew he wanted me to have the valuable one  but he had never told me which one that was .    the bequest did not satisfy the family .  you would think they could spare one book out of perhaps ten thousand  but they apparently resented my even being mentioned in the will .  the lawyer told me i could make my choice as soon as the will was probated .    i asked if i might go into the library and study the books in order to make that choice .  the lawyer seemed to think that was reasonable  but this was objected to at once by the family  who pointed out that the will said nothing about my going into the library .      you have been in the library often enough and long enough   said the older son .   just make your choice and you can have it when the will is probated .     the lawyer wasn t exactly pleased by that and he said that he would seal the library till probation  and no one could go in .  that made me feel better  because i thought that perhaps the family knew which book was valuable and would remove it themselves .    it took time for the will to be probated  so i refused to make the choice immediately .  the family grumbled at that  but the lawyer held his ground there .  i spent the time thinking .  had old mr .  lineweaver ever said anything to me that was puzzling and that might have been intended as a hint .  i could think of nothing but the  triple devil  he used to call himself when he wanted to praise his own slyness .      but he only said that when he discussed the valuable book .  could the phrase refer to the book  and not to himself .    i was twenty four now  and far from the innocent child i had been ten years before .  i had a vast miscellany of information at my fingertips  thanks to my reading  and when the time came for me to make my choice  i did not have to walk into the library .  i named the book i wanted and explained exactly where it would be on the shelves  for i had read it  of course  though i had never dreamed it was valuable .    the lawyer himself went in and got it for me  and it was the right book .  as a book dealer  i now know why it was valuable  but never mind that .  the point is that i had the lawyer     a good man     arrange to have it appraised  and then to have it sold at a public auction .  it brought in seventy thousand dollars  a true fortune in those days .  if it were offered for sale now it would bring in a quarter of a million  but i needed the money then .    the family was furious  of course  but there was nothing they could do .  they brought suit  but the fact they had not let me enter the library and study the books lost them a great deal of sympathy .  in any case  after the legal hassle was over  i bought a bookstore  made it pay through the depression  when books were one form of relatively cheap amusement  and built things up to where they now are .      so am i a self made man .    rubin said   in my opinion  this doesn t come under the heading of luck .  you had to pick one book out of ten thousand on the basis of a small and obscure hint  and you did .  that s ingenuity  and  therefore  you earned the money .  just out of curiosity  what was the book .     hey   said gonzalo angrily .   manfred said   mr .  gonzalo asked me not to give you the solution .  he said you might want to work on it yourselves .    the smoke from drake s cigarette curled up toward the ceiling .  he said  in his softly hoarse voice   one out of ten thousand on the basis of  triple devil .   we never saw the library and you did .  you knew what books were present and we don t .  it s scarcely a fair test .     i admit that   said manfred   so i ll tell you if you wish .     no   said gonzalo .   we ve got to have a chance .  the book must have had  devil  in the title .  it might have been  the devil and daniel webster   for instance .     that s a short story by stephen vincent ben  t   said manfred   and wasn t published till      .    halsted said   the usual image of the devil  with horns  hooves and a tail  is drawn  actually  from the greek nature god  pan .  was it a book about pan  or with the word  pan  in the title .     actually   said manfred   i can t think of one .    avalon said   the witch goddess  hecate  is often thought of as triple     maid  matron  and crone     because she was a moon goddess  too  and those were the phases     first quarter  full  and last quarter .  as a witch goddess  she might be looked at as a triple devil .  memoirs of hecate county was published too late to be the solution  but is there something earlier with hecate in the title .     not that i know of   said manfred .   there was a silence about the table  and rubin said   we just don t have enough information .  i think the story was interesting in itself  and that mr .  manfred can now tell us the solution .    gonzalo said   henry hasn t had his chance .  henry     have you any idea what the book might be .    henry smiled .   i have a small notion .    manfred smiled  too .   i don t think you will be correct .    henry said   perhaps not .  in any case  people are often afraid to mention the devil by name  lest they call him up in the process  so they use numerous nicknames or euphemisms for him .  very frequently  they use the diminutive of some common masculine name as a kind of friendly gesture that might serve to placate him .   old nick  springs to mind .    manfred half rose from his seat  but henry paid no attention .    once one thinks of that  it is simple to go on to think of nicholas nickleby which  so to speak  is old nick twice  and is therefore  double devil .       but we want  triple devil   henry   said gonzalo .    the diminutive of richard gives us  dickens   a very well known euphemism for  devil   as in  what the dickens .   and the author of nicholas nickleby is  of course  charles dickens  and there is the  triple devil .   am i right  mr .  manfred .    manfred said   you re completely right  henry .  i m afraid i wasn t as ingenious as i ve thought these past fifty five years .  you did it in far less time than i did  and without even seeing the library .    henry said   no  mr .  manfred .  i deserve far less credit than you .  you see  you gave the solution away in your account of events .     when .   said manfred  frowning .   i was careful not to say anything at all that would give you a hint .     exactly  sir .  you mentioned so many authors and never once mentioned the outstanding english novelist of the nineteenth century  or probably any other century  or even  perhaps  any other language .  your failure to mention him made me think at once there was particular significance to the name charles dickens  and  triple devil  then had no mystery to me .    afterword  you may have noticed that in this story  isaac asimov is mentioned as a friend of emmanuel rubin  who instantly seizes the opportunity to revile and libel poor asimov .   i do that about once every ten stories or so because i enjoy doing it  but  of course  it is poor rubin i am being unfair to and not myself .   rubin in his real life incarnation is lester del rey  who is a good friend of mine and has been for nearly fifty years .  we squabble lovingly in public  which is what gave me the idea of having rubin act as he does  but  in actual fact  we are each ready to give the other the shirt off our backs  if necessary .  lester is  in fact  one of the straight arrows i have been fortunate enough to know  absolutely honest and absolutely reliable     but idiosyncratic  as i am .   lester consistently denies there is any resemblance between himself and rubin  even though i assure him that strangers often stop me in the street and say   hey  that guy rubin in your stories     he s an awful lot like lester del rey .    this story first appeared in the august      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   sunset on the water  it didn t take much to make emmanuel rubin indignant so that his beard  what there was of it  bristled .  it didn t take much more to make him furious and have his eyes flash behind his thick lensed spectacles .   he was somewhere between indignation and rage now  and the upstairs room at the milano  where the black widowers met for their monthly banquets  rang with his voice .    i get this fan letter from california   he said   and after the usual bosh about how good my books are        bosh is right   said mario gonzalo  staring complacently at the sketch he was making of the banquet guest  a sketch that seemed all eyebrows .   rubin went right on with his sentence  not bothering to stop to demolish the other     unusual for him and indicative of the concentrated nature of his anger .        he writes to me that if i m ever on the coast  i should drop in and he ll put me up .     kindly meant  i m sure   said roger halsted  nibbling at a sausage roll     one of the hot appetizers that the inestimable henry had put out this time as an accompaniment to the drinks .    no one can be kind and stupid at the same time   said rubin  inventing a cosmic law on the spot .   i wrote back and said   i am already on the coast  thank you .       good lord   said thomas trumbull  who had arrived three minutes before and had accepted a scotch and soda from henry with his usual affectation of having just returned from death valley and being in the last extremity of thirst .   is that what you re furious about .  so what if californians talk about their coast as though it were the only one in the world .  it s just a way of speaking .     as a matter of fact   said james drake  who was born in alaska   the west coasters  if you ll excuse that expression  are not the only offenders .  as soon as an east coaster has been in california for five minutes  he begins saying   here on the coast      in the same way  you can get a guy from ohio who has called his native land  the united states  all his life  put him in europe for five minutes  and he begins to talk about the  states .    geoffrey avalon  host of the banquet on this occasion  and noted for his annoying ability to see both sides of a question  said   provincialism is not the monopoly of anyone .  there is the story of the two boston dowagers who found themselves in los angeles early in october  with the temperature at one hundred and five degrees .  said one   my goodness  prudence  it is certainly hot here .   said the other   what do you expect  hepzibah .  we are  after all  nearly three thousand miles from the ocean .    avalon then took a sip of his drink in his usual grave way and said   tom  you haven t had a chance to meet my guest  chester dunhill .  chester  this is tom trumbull  who has some sort of sensitive job with the government .  he s never specific about it .    trumbull said   glad to meet you  mr .  dunhill .  if our doings here puzzle you  i must explain that it is customary for the black widowers to debate furiously over trifles .    dunhill was a tall man with a thick head of white hair and eyebrows of a startling and bushy black .  he said  in a booming bass voice   we can survive catastrophes .  it s the trifles that kill us .    gonzalo looked startled and seemed about to say something  but henry announced  with quiet finality   gentlemen  dinner is served .    rubin did well with the ham and pea soup  and wreaked havoc on the broiled sole  and on the rather plain salad .  he drew up short  however  at the individual pies handed out in all the pride of their crisp  golden crust .    henry   said rubin in a slow rumble   what exists under this crust .    henry said   i fear  mr .  rubin  that mr .  avalon  in a british mood  has asked that we serve steak and kidney pie .     kidney .  kidney .   rubin looked outraged .   that s liver squared .  jeff  i wouldn t have thought you capable of such a lapse in taste .    avalon looked pained .  he said   steak and kidney pie  properly prepared  is a great delicacy        for whom .  vultures .     for every one of us at this table .  why don t you try it  manny .    rubin said intransigently .   kidney tastes like urine .   gonzalo said   so does your favorite brand of beer  manny  but you guzzle it down .     for god s sake   said trumbull   what kind of dinner conversation is this .  manny  if you can t eat what s set before you  then i m sure henry can get you scrambled eggs .    rubin sneered and said   i ll eat the steak   and sat sulkily through the main course  the treacle tart  the sardine on toast savory  and the strong tea .  it made for a quiet dinner and  as gonzalo pointed out in dumb show  rubin did manage to eat the entire pie  kidney included .   eventually  avalon rang his spoon against the water glass and said   gentlemen  i call on mario to grill our honored guest  my good friend  chester dunhill .  i ve explained the rules of the game to him and he is quite prepared to answer truthfully and completely .    gonzalo said   mr .  dunhill  how do you justify your existence .    dunhill blinked  then said   well  i try to keep the past alive for the general public .  considering that we can t possibly order the present intelligently unless we learn the lessons of the past  i think i earn my place on earth .    gonzalo said   how do you keep the past alive .     by writing about it .  i suppose i could call myself a historian for the layman .     can you make a living from that .   asked gonzalo .   halsted put in at once   will durant did  and barbara tuchman still does .    dunhill smiled  with an air of diffidence that did not sit comfortably upon him .   i don t exactly put myself in their class .  still  i do make a living .    avalon cleared his throat with vehemence .   may i interrupt .  my friend  charles  is being needlessly modest .  in addition to his histories  he also writes historical novels for teenagers  mostly set in the greece of the peloponnesian war and the rome of the second punic war .  these are both critical and popular successes .    gonzalo said   why those periods in particular  mr .  dunhill .    dunhill said   both were periods of epic conflict between two nearly equally matched powers  athens and sparta in one case  rome and carthage in the other .  both wars are well documented  both were filled with great battles  with dramatic triumphs and disasters  with generals and politicians  some brilliant and some idiotic .  both periods  in short  are dead ringers for the period we re living in now .  we can understand  sympathize  and see the lessons i try to make plain .  what s more  we can t even draw an overall conclusion  because in one case the adversary we admire won out over the other  rome defeating carthage .  in the other  the adversary we admire lost  athens succumbing to sparta .  of course  i ve always had a personal soft spot in my heart for the carthaginian general  hannibal .  he s one of three great generals in history who ended a loser without that in the least tarnishing his reputation .    rubin said   napoleon was a second .  who was the third .     robert e .  lee  of course   said dunhill  his voice booming again .   rubin looked discomfited but recovered and said   i thought you were going to say charles xii of sweden  and that would have been wrong .     that s right   said dunhill   it would have been wrong .  charles xii lacked prudence .     how about generals who never lost .   asked drake .    there are quite a few of them   said dunhill .   genghis khan  cromwell  alexander the great  julius caesar  the duke of marlborough  and so on .  their reputations depend on the manner of their victories and the quality of their adversaries .  at least two generals i can think of almost always lost but remained great considering what they did with what they had .  there s george washington  of course  and general giap of north vietnam .    gonzalo said   i suppose that in your history books and novels  you deal with the catastrophes that people survive .  what are the trifles that can kill you .    everyone turned to look at gonzalo  who grew restive under the communal stare .   what s wrong with the question .  mr .  dunhill said that catastrophes could be survived  but trifles kill you .     did i .   said dunhill  frowning .    yes  you did .  you said it to tom trumbull .   he turned to trumbull  who was nursing his brandy .   tom  didn t he say that .    trumbull nodded .   you said that  mr .  dunhill .     well  then   said gonzalo .   what trifles did you have in mind .     actually   put in avalon   every defeat suffered by a competent general might be blamed on some trifle .  in fact  in war and peace tolstoy argued  in what i found to be tedious detail  the thesis that no general controls a battle  but that trivialities decide it all .    gonzalo said   come on  jeff  you re trying to get your guest off the hook  and that s unethical .  i don t think mr .  dunhill was thinking about big battles .  i think he had something personal in mind .  that s the way it sounded to me and that s what i want to know about .    dunhill shook his head .   it was just a remark .  we all make remarks .    gonzalo said   remarks aren t made out of nothing .  you must have had something in your mind .    dunhill shook his head again .   trumbull sighed and said   it seemed to me  too  mr .  dunhill  that when you made that remark something was tearing at you .  jeff said he explained the game to you .  you ve agreed to answer all questions and we agree  in return  to hold everything you say absolutely confidential .  if you re willing to state flatly that the statement had no personal meaning to you then and that you spoke idly  we will have to accept that  but please don t say that unless it is the truth .    avalon said  in a tone of deep discomfort   i did tell you that this would all be confidential  chet .    dunhill said  with a touch of anger in his voice   there s nothing involved here but a deep personal disappointment that i can hardly bear to think of  let alone discuss .  the trouble is that it is a matter of no moment to anyone but me  and others will only laugh at the whole thing .  it involves a ridiculous trifle that places all the blame squarely on me .  that s the unbearable part .  if i could blame it on the government  on fate  on the universe  it wouldn t be so      he stopped  broodingly .    may we hear about it .   said gonzalo stubbornly .    i warn you   said dunhill .   it s a long story of no interest whatever except to me .     that s beside the point   said gonzalo .    very well  but you asked for it .      during world war ii  i was a young chap who missed actual army service  for a few years  anyway  because i was working for the navy as a chemist .  this was in philadelphia .  i was rather an unsocial creature in those days and my chief amusement lay in making my way out to the main branch of the free library and reading whatever i came across .  and one of the things i came across was the historians  history of the world in twenty four volumes .  it was published in       with a second edition in       with two supplementary volumes carrying things through world war i  and an index volume     twenty seven altogether .  did any of you ever hear of it .    there was silence .  dunhill went on   i m not surprised .  to most people  it would be a deadly work .  it was long out of print even at the time i came across it forty years ago  and now       he shrugged  and went on .   the volumes are a cut and paste job .  sections from the greek and roman historians and from the modern historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were included in the proper order in a series of histories dealing with the various nations separately .  volumes three and four were on greece  volumes five and six were on rome  and so on .  there is a great deal of overlapping  of course  but that just meant that the same events are described from the viewpoints of different historians  possibly of different nationalities .    the general editor  henry smith williams  filled in gaps with essays of his own .  he was a humane person of liberal views and almost every time i read what i thought was a particularly telling passage  it proved to be one of his .  you must understand that it was edited to read as connectedly as possible .  there was just an occasional unobtrusive superscript which guided you to the end of the volume  where you found out that you were reading gibbon or prescott or bury or macaulay or thucydides or whoever .    the library had the set in double volumes and i picked them out one and by one and quickly found i could not bear to stop reading them for anything as dull as my daily work .  i took them to the lab with me and read them during lunch or through a partially open desk while i had something boiling slowly under a reflex condenser .  my memories of that entire period are vague except for those volumes .    i had always been interested in history  but it was those volumes that converted that interest into an obsession .  the volumes were all terribly old fashioned  of course  for prior to the twentieth century  history was almost exclusively a matter of battles and court intrigue .  still  that was what i loved and my own histories are just as old fashioned .  i dwell very little on social and economic issues .    rubin said   the social and economic issues would make your histories more valuable .     and more dull  perhaps   said dunhill .   i don t omit such things altogether but i always remember i am writing for the general public  not for scholars .  in any case  by the late     s  nearly ten years after i had held those library books in my hands for the last time  i abandoned chemistry and began to spend my full time on histories and historical novels .    dunhill paused and seemed to brood awhile .   drake chuckled as he stubbed out a cigarette .  he said   unless you re telling the story with a total absence of art  which i cannot believe of a novelist  that historians  history is going to turn up again .    dunhill nodded vigorously .   you are quite correct .  a few years ago  i made a new acquaintance  and my wife and i visited his house and had dinner there with several other couples .  after dinner  i wandered over to his bookshelves and studied them     a bad habit that exasperates my wife but of which even she cannot cure me .    and there  filling an entire shelf  was the historians  history .  i hadn t thought of it in years  had all but forgotten it .  the instant i saw it  however  everything flooded back .  the memory of reading those volumes at a terrible time in modern history  memories gilded and made more wonderful by the passage of years  were achingly sweet and intense .    i was no longer the impecunious lad of decades ago .  i am quite well off now and can afford to cater to my whims .  i approached my host at once  therefore  and offered to buy his set .  i couldn t believe that it had any attraction to anyone but myself and i was ready to pay far more than it was worth .  unfortunately  my host  for some reason he never explained  would not sell .  he was quite emphatic about it .    i tell you  gentlemen  if there were a million dollars on this table  and i knew i could take it without danger of detection  i would not touch it  out of a simple sense of honesty .  but i actually thought of stealing those volumes that my friend would not sell me .  it was only the thought of being caught if i tried breaking and entering that held me back .  my sense of ethics simply shattered under the strain and i ended the new friendship rather than expose myself to the bitterness of seeing those volumes in someone else s possession .    i began visiting such secondhand bookstores as i could reach  and calling those i could not reach  asking them if they had or could get a set of the volumes .  i even advertised in the new york times book review  in general magazines  and in periodicals of interest to history buffs .  the longer i waited the more i was willing to pay if i had to .      and this brings me down to the present .    halsted said   i hope you re not going to tell us you drew a complete blank and that that s the end of the story .    dunhill frowned at him  his eyebrows hunching low .  he said bitterly   how i wish i could tell you exactly that .  i gave a box number in the advertisement and the booksellers all had my home address  but i got nothing in either case .  nothing .  nil .  zilch .    one week ago  however  i picked up a letter at my publisher s .  i see them once a week and they usually hold any letters for me that are written care of them .  they re never important  and usually they re from people who nitpick some historical point i make  something that must be dealt with  but always depresses me .    i was holding the letter in my hand as i left my publisher s and walked down the street to grand central .  idly  i glanced at the envelope and noted that it was addressed in pen and ink in a spidery hand  which i accepted as a bad sign .  i decided it was from an elderly man who would raise some faint and querulous point concerning some pet theory of his .  in a bad temper  i ripped open the envelope and removed the sheet of paper inside .  at that point  i passed a garbage truck and tossed the envelope into its yawning maw  like a good citizen .  but then i had to cross the street  which takes all one s concentration in manhattan  and shoved the note into my pocket .    i didn t remember it till i was in my commuter train and  taking out the note  i read it and a sudden rush of ecstasy filled me .      here  i have the letter .  let me read it to you .    dunhill unfolded a letter and read its crabbed handwriting aloud and with ease  as though he had memorized it .   dear mr .  dunhill   i am a great fan of your books and i read your ad and would like to tell you that i have a complete set of  the historians  history of the world  that i would be delighted to let you have .  my father bought it for me when i was quite young and i enjoyed it greatly .  it is still in very good shape and if you are willing to pay me a reasonable price plus all mailing costs  i would have it sent to you by insured express mail .   i would never dream of selling the set but i am quite old now and will be moving to a little place near my daughter s home  and there will be no room for the set there .  i am a widower and i m afraid i cannot live alone any longer .  i just can t cope with the harsh winters .   it means having to live in a small town instead of in a sizable city .  it also means giving up my apartment on the shore where  on clear evenings  i have often watched the sun set into the endless stretch of water so that i almost imagined i could hear it hiss .   still  if i must give up these books  i can t think of anyone i d rather give it up to than you .  i hope you have many years of pleasure with it .  please let me hear from you soon .   sincerely   ludovic broadbottom  rubin said   congratulations  mr .  dunhill .  is everything arranged  or is that where the trivialities come in .    dunhill said grimly   that is where the trivialities come in .  here  take this letter and look at it and tell me where to write .    rubin took the letter  and glanced over the writing which filled one side of the sheet .  he turned it over and looked at the totally blank other side .  he said   there s no return address on it .     no  there isn t   said dunhill indignantly .   can you imagine the stupidity of people who don t put return addresses on their letters and then expect an answer .    avalon said   people who don t put return addresses on their letters usually do put it on their envelopes     oh   he concluded  remembering .    that s right   said dunhill .   i threw the damned envelope away .  there are your trifles .  here s a guy who reads an ad that clearly has a box number attached  yet he writes in care of my publisher instead .  that not only means a delay of several days  but deprives me of the chance of knowing at once that the letter is important .    then i decide  of all things  to open the letter on the street and to discard the envelope into a handy garbage truck without really looking at it .  if i had only just noted the name of the city and nothing more  i could have got his address from the city directory .  there can t be more than one ludovic broadbottom in any one city .  and to top it all off  he doesn t include his return address in the body of the letter .  what s the result of all these trivialities .  i have an offer of my historians  history and i can t reach out and take it .    gonzalo said   is there a bright side  mr .  dunhill .  can you get other reference books for your histories and novels .    dunhill said  with real anguish   get other books .  i have other books .  i have two large rooms crammed with historical reference material of the finest sort  to say nothing of the resources of the new york public library and of columbia university .  you don t get the point .  i want a copy of historians  history for myself for sentimental reasons  for what it s done for me  for what it s meant to me .  and i have it  and can t get it .    for a moment  what was almost a child s whine entered his deep voice .  he must have recognized that himself  if belatedly  for he threw himself back in his chair  took a deep breath  and said   pardon me  gentlemen  i don t mean to rail uselessly at fate .     why not .   said avalon .   we all do it from time to time .  but look here  we usually see more than we think we do .  you glanced at the envelope long enough to see that it was addressed to you and to note that it was an old man s handwriting        yes   said dunhill vehemently   another trifle .  the handwriting threw me off  too  and added to my conviction the letter was unimportant .  if he had only typed my address on the envelope  i would surely have treated it with more respect .     yes   said avalon  ploughing on   but the point is that you must have glanced at the return address  too .  if you concentrate quietly  you may remember something about it .     no   said dunhill hopelessly .   i ve been trying for days .  it s useless .    trumbull said   why don t we work from what he says in his letter .  he lives in a sizable city on the shore  and sees the sunset over the ocean .  that means he s on the west coast  or  the coast   to quote manny s fan .  here in new york  we can see sunrise out of the water  but never sunset into the water .  can we make a start with that .    dunhill seemed to have recovered his self control .  he said quietly   gentlemen  i have been a chemist  and i am a historian .  i am used to the process of reasoning .  please note  however  that he talks of the harsh winters he experiences and that he can no longer endure .  neither los angeles nor san francisco can possibly be considered as having harsh winters .  no city on the west coast can .    gonzalo said   seattle is pretty damned rainy .  i was there once  and you can believe me .  that might sicken anyone .     then he would speak of rainy weather .  no one speaks of harsh winters unless they mean cold and snow .  that eliminates the west coast  and hawaii  too  but        wait   said rubin   how do you know it was from the united states .  the letter is written in english  but it could be from canada  scotland  australia .  for that matter  almost any educated  non anglophone foreigner can write in english these days .    dunhill flushed .   well  then  i did notice something about the envelope .  it had an american stamp .  i know because i save foreign stamps for a friend of mine and i automatically watch for one on all envelopes .  had there been a foreign stamp on the envelope i would have torn it off and discarded the rest .  i think i would even have noticed a foreign postal meter mark .      as i say  then  we can eliminate california  oregon  washington  and hawaii .  that leaves alaska .     i wouldn t have thought of alaska   muttered gonzalo .    i would   said drake  smiling .   i was born there .     in any case   said dunhill   the only town in alaska that even an alaskan would think of as sizable is anchorage .  it s on the coast but not on the open ocean .  it s on cook inlet .  the inlet is to the west of anchorage  however  and perhaps you can see the sun set into it .  perhaps .  i didn t take chances .  i called the anchorage phone exchange and the post office .  there s no ludovic broadbottom in the city .  in fact  just to play it safe  i called juneau and sitka .  juneau is on another inlet farther south  and sitka has a population of less than ten thousand .  but i called them     and nothing doing .    halsted said thoughtfully   if you re going to count cities on inlets  what about the east coast .  the ocean may be to the east  but there may be inlets to the west .     i know   said dunhill .   florida has a long western coast and someone living on the shore in tampa or key west could watch the sunset on the water as the sun dives into the gulf of mexico .  however  where would the harsh winters come in .    there s a long peninsula that forms the eastern shore of chesapeake bay .  the largest city on the western shore of that peninsula is cambridge .  it has a population of about eleven or twelve thousand  but from it you can watch the sunset on the water  since chesapeake bay is a broad stretch .  so i called the town and drew a blank there  too .    besides  the only harsh winters on the east coast would be from philadelphia northward     new england particularly .  any city on the northeast coast  however  faces an ocean on the east or south .  even provincetown  at the tip of cape cod  which could face west to the ocean  faces south .  falmouth faces west but it is a small town .  absolutely no town that could conceivably be considered sizable has a western exposure to the ocean .    gonzalo said  more to himself than to anyone else   from manhattan you can see the sun tumble into the hudson .     no  you can t   said drake .   it squats down on new jersey .    halsted rubbed his high  pinkish forehead and said   you don t suppose your letter writer got his directions twisted  do you .  not long ago an american delegate to the united nations invited any nation which was dissatisfied with american hospitality to leave .  he said he would be delighted to wave farewell to them as they sailed off into the sunset .  he didn t bother to explain how one can sail into the sunset from new york .    dunhill snorted loudly .   i remember that incident .  he was simply using a metaphor stupidly .  besides  we re not talking about any member of the present administration .  we re talking about an average american of  presumably  average intelligence .     besides   pointed out avalon   a man can mistake east and west  but if he s describing solar motions there is no way in which he can confuse sunset and sunrise .  no  we need a sizable city with the ocean to the west and with a harsh winter .  i confess i can t think of one that fills the bill .    gonzalo said   how about american islands that aren t part of states .  puerto rico  guam .  they would still use american stamps  wouldn t they .     yes  they would   said dunhill   and they re all tropical islands  too .      believe me  gentlemen  i m at the end of my rope .    halsted said   you don t think this whole thing might be a gag  do you .  maybe ludovic broadbottom is a made up name  and he deliberately sent you clues that lead nowhere .  maybe there was no return address on the envelope  either .  or a fake one .    slowly  dunhill said   why should anyone bother .  i m a harmless person and my request is harmless  too .  what would be the point of a practical joke of this nature .     the confirmed practical joker   said avalon   doesn t have to have a point     except on top of his head  of course .    halsted said   do you have any friends who are practical jokers .     not that i know of   said dunhill .   i select my friends with reasonable care .    gonzalo said   maybe henry has some idea .   he turned in his seat and said  puzzled   where s henry .  he was here a moment ago  listening to us .   he raised his voice .   henry .    henry emerged from the cloakroom and said  imperturbably   i am here  gentlemen .  i was merely engaged in a small task .      mr .  dunhill  i have mr .  ludovic broadbottom on the telephone .  he is anxious to speak to you .    dunhill s eyes bulged .  he said in a choked voice   mr .  ludovic     are you serious .     quite   said henry  with a bland smile .   perhaps you had better not delay .  and i might advise you to offer a generous sum .  he s moving next week  and there will be no time to bargain .    dunhill rose  appearing dazed  and vanished into the cloakroom toward the phone booth located there .   the black widowers sat in shocked silence for a few moments  and then rubin said   all right  henry  what kind of magic did you use .    henry said   no magic  gentlemen .  it was mr .  rubin who gave me the idea when he initiated the discussion of provincial attitudes toward coasts     the manner in which americans on one coast sometimes forget  or ignore  the other .    it seems to me that americans on all three seacoasts the pacific  the atlantic  and the gulf  too  if you want to count that separately     tend altogether to ignore america s fourth coast  which is quite a long one  too .     the fourth coast .   said avalon  frowning .    of course   said rubin  shaking his head in disgust .    yes  mr .  rubin   said henry .   i m thinking of the great lakes .  we don t think of it as a coastline but mr .  broadbottom didn t refer to it as that .  he spoke of the  shore   and the great lakes certainly have a shore .  we very commonly speak of a lakeshore .  and anyone living in a place on the shore of any one of the great lakes would perceive the same effect as would be obtained if one were overlooking an ocean .  those are large lakes  gentlemen .    however  all the sizable cities on the lakeshores have their lakes to the east  south  or north .  we can even include the canadian cities  if we wish .  duluth has lake superior on the east .  milwaukee and chicago have lake michigan on the east .  gary has lake michigan on the north .  detroit has lake st .  clair on the east     tiny by great lake standards but large enough to give the effect of sunrise out of the water .  toledo has lake erie on the east .  cleveland and erie have lake erie on the north  though erie gets some western view .  hamilton has lake ontario on the east  while toronto has that lake on the south and east  and rochester has it on the north .    the only really sizable city that looks west to a great lake is buffalo  new york .  it has lake erie to the west .  from a proper location in buffalo one can see the sun set into lake erie     and buffalo is notorious for its snowy winters .  so i tried that first .  i phoned buffalo  obtained mr .  broadbottom s number  called it  and he answered at once .  he was quite concerned at not having heard from mr .  dunhill .  he is as anxious to sell as mr .  dunhill       at this point  dunhill emerged from the cloakroom  his face alight with joy .   all arranged   he said .   i will pay five hundred dollars plus shipping costs and i hope to have it in just a matter of days .    he reached for his wallet before a horrified avalon could stop him .   henry  you deserve a ten percent finder s fee for this   dunhill said .   how did you do it .    henry raised his hand in a gentle gesture of rejection .    mr .  dunhill   he said with quiet firmness   as a member of the black widowers  i cannot accept a fee in connection with my club duties .    dunhill hesitated  then replaced his wallet in his pocket .   but how did you do it  man .    henry said   just a matter of thinking of the great lakes as small oceans .  it s not worth discussing .  the important thing is that you ll have your books .    afterword  notice that dunhill lusted for the historians  history of the world .  it was i that lusted for it .  it was i who had read it as a youngster  taking it volume by volume from the public library  and it was i who noticed it in a friend s library .  and it was i who would have stolen it if i had been able to think of a way .  it was the only thing that i was ever tempted to steal .   however  my own story ended quite happily .  i tried to find a copy that i could buy legitimately for money  and failed .  my friend  however  managed to get another copy and presented it to me .  after long persuasion  i managed to get him to accept a pittance in exchange .  i still own the set and it is one of the apples of my eye .   but as a matter of conscience  i must make a confession to you .  my friend s set was missing a volume .  the set he presented to me was not .  for a while i tried to persuade myself to offer him the volume he was missing     but i just could not make myself do it .  how s that for being a mean bum .   this story first appeared in the january      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   where is he .   when roger halsted introduced his guest as his investment broker  the members of the black widowers  assembled at their monthly banquet  responded at first with a stunned silence .   halsted ignored that  and went about the room  introducing the members methodically .    as i said  this is w .  bradford hume  folks .      brad  i want you to meet emmanuel rubin  who writes mysteries  mario gonzalo  who will be doing your portrait soon  james drake  who s coughing over his cigarette  and was a chemist before he retired  geoffrey avalon  a patent attorney  though i ve never found out what they do  and thomas trumbull  who works for a hush hush branch of the government .      and this is our waiter  henry  who s also a member  and who has just brought you your drink .    hume acknowledged all the introductions with grace and a smile .  he took his martini with a  thank you  henry   and by that time the assemblage had recovered .   rubin  his eyes wide behind his thick glasses  said   are you telling us this is your investment broker .     that s exactly what i m telling you   said halsted  haughtily .    have they given you a raise in salary .  quintupled it .    halsted said   no need to assume i m a beggar  manny  just because i teach mathematics at a junior high school .  i ve got seniority  security  and a reasonable salary  neither rich nor gaudy  but reasonable .  besides  alice works also and makes more than i do  and i have a small inheritance from my mother  rest her soul     so brad takes care of a few bucks for me  and very well  too .    hume smiled appreciatively  and said   not that i m trying to drum up business  gentlemen .  it s my understanding that this is a purely social evening .     purely .   growled trumbull .   avalon cleared his throat .   i should think  mr .  hume  that being a financial adviser in these unsettled times makes for a tense life .     so it does  mr .  avalon  but all times are unsettled  and that makes it particularly difficult for a financial adviser  since he is expected to see the future     the immediate future  at any rate .     what stocks go up .  what stocks go down .   murmured gonzalo .  he was already working at hume s caricature and had put in the shock of dark hair under which he intended to hang an almost cherubic face .    that  certainly   said hume   but a little more than that  too .  you have to be able to judge what will be useful as a long term investment  to anticipate changes in tax       at this point  halsted put his hand on hume s arm .   don t talk about it now  brad .  they re going to grill you after the meal  and until then you have a right to relax .     that suits me   said hume .   what s on the menu for tonight  or am i not supposed to ask .     why shouldn t you ask .   said halsted .   henry  what s on .    henry s smooth  sixtyish face crinkled slightly .   there will be grilled salmon tonight  mr .  halsted  and i think you will find it most unusual .  the lobster sauce is a private recipe of the chef s .     trying it out on us  is he .   said drake  in his hoarse voice .    you will not be disappointed  dr .  drake .  it will be preceded by a portuguese fish chowder  which you may find a bit spicy .     that won t bother me   said avalon  his bushy eyebrows hunching low and giving his face an amiably satanic look .   as it turned out  henry was quite right .  from soup through the rum chocolate cake  there were sounds of approval .  even rubin s stout assertion that the  now fashionable exercise of futurism  was empty of content did not rouse much in the way of clamorous opposition .    all you have to do   said rubin   is to go back and read the predictions for the present time handed out by the charlatans of half a century ago .  you ll find that they saw a million things that didn t happen  saw almost nothing of what did happen .    hume listened gravely to the discussion that followed  but said nothing .   gonzalo said  with obvious mischief in his eyes   your good friend  asimov  is a futurist  isn t he .     he .   said rubin  every hair in his sparse beard seeming to bristle .   he describes the future in what he calls science fiction  but the only points he gets right are those that are painfully obvious to anyone .  and i wouldn t call him my friend .  i just help him with the plot of a story now and then  when he s stuck .    halsted patted his stomach with a satisfied smile and tapped his water glass with his spoon .   gentlemen  it is time for brad to pay for his excellent meal by facing a grilling .  manny  since you have so low an opinion of futurism  would you serve as grill master .  and please remember to maintain an elementary level of courtesy to one who is our honored guest .    rubin snorted .   i ll let you know  roger  when i need lessons in manners .      mr .  hume  how do you justify your existence .     if you expect me to say   said hume   that i justify it by making people rich through clever investments  you ll be disappointed .  the justification comes from my skill as an after dinner speaker .     it does  does it .  i take it you consider yourself good at it .     yes  i do .  i ve been doing it for fifteen years and by now i ve reached a routine fee of seventy five hundred dollars for an hour talk .  i think that s an adequate measure of my skill .     huh   said rubin  seeing no immediate opportunity for a riposte .   why do you bother doing anything else .    hume shrugged .   i don t particularly like to travel  so i want to be in a position to be able to pick and choose     to turn down any talk  regardless of fee .  i can do that best if i have a regular job as a financial cushion .  and that s why i don t have an agent .  they put pressure on you     and they take thirty percent .    rubin said   if you don t have an agent  how do you get speaking engagements .     word of mouth .  if you can give a good talk  the world will beat a path to your door .     what s your subject .     futurism  mr .  rubin     which you don t think much of .  despite your comments on the subject  everyone seems interested these days in what the future holds .  what s the future of education .  of robots .  of international relations .  of space exploration .  you name it     they re interested .     and you speak on all of that .     i do .     how many different talks do you have prepared .     none .  if i had to prepare my talks  i d have to neglect my brokerage work  and i can t do that .  i speak extemporaneously and i don t need preparation .  call out your subject and i ll stand up and talk for an hour     but you ll have to pay me my fee .    halsted said   listen  i ve heard him speak .  he is good .    gonzalo said   have you had any funny experiences in your speaking career  mr .  hume .     funny .   said hume  leaning back in his chair  and looking completely comfortable .   i ve had some memorable introductions  which i didn t think were funny  though others might laugh .  i once had someone object to my fee and write me a letter saying that it was four times as much as they had ever paid anyone .  i wrote back and said   i m four times as good     at least .   in introducing me  he read the correspondence  and the audience  a professional engineers organization  suddenly realized they were being soaked four times the usual by an arrogant bum .  i could feel the north wind blow as i rose and it took me half the talk to win them over .    another time  a woman introduced me in a thoroughly pedestrian way     which i m used to .  mild applause came and i rose  in order to begin right after it had peaked so that i could start with the audience s self hypnosis in my favor .  except that the woman who introduced me     and may she have a special place in hell someday     began to call out to latecomers that there were seats on the side .  she kept it up till the applause died  and i had to rise and address a dead audience .  i never did quite liven them up .    then there s the funny man .  i had one give a fifteen minute talk as an introduction .  fifteen minutes .  i timed it on my watch .  and he was funny  really funny .  he had the audience rolling and he wasn t charging a penny .  i had to follow him  and i knew that the audience was going to consider me far less funny     and at an exorbitant price .  i was considering forfeiting the money and leaving  when my introducer concluded by saying   but don t let me give you the impression that mr .  hume can do anything .  i happen to know that he has never sung the role of the duke in rigoletto   and sat down to loud laughter .    what he didn t know was that he had handed it to me on a plate .  i got up  waited for the routine applause to die all the way down  and in the dead silence i belted out  in my best tenor voice   bella figlia dell amore   the first notes of the duke s contribution to the famous quartet  and the audience rocked with the loudest laugh of the evening  and i had them .    i had to give a talk twelve hours before i had a heart attack  and then another twelve hours after the attack .  fortunately  i didn t know it was a heart attack at the time .  the second talk was to a bunch of cardiologists  and not one of them       gonzalo said   hold on for a minute .  hold on .    hume rather skidded to a halt  and looked surprised .   i beg your pardon .    gonzalo said   i believe you when you say you can speak for an hour extemporaneously without notice  but you didn t get my question .     you asked me if i had had any funny experiences  didn t you .     yes  but i didn t mean funny     humorous .  i meant funny     odd or puzzling .  i meant funny .    hume rubbed his nose and said   could you explain that at greater depth  mr .  gonzalo .     i meant something you couldn t explain .  a puzzle .  a mystery .    avalon brought the palm of his hand down on the table with a loud slap .   mario  i move we eject you from membership .     you can t   said gonzalo angrily .   there are no restrictions on the questions we ask .     except the canons of good taste  for heaven s sake .     what s in bad taste about asking for a mystery .  i like mysteries .  if he doesn t have any  he can say so .   he turned to hume  frowning  and  in a distinctly self righteous voice  said   well  have you had any kind of mystery in connection with your speaking engagements .   he then brushed the sleeves of his red velvet jacket  as though sweeping away all petty objections to the question .   hume was smiling delightedly .   well  yes .  as a matter of fact  i did have .  how odd that you should ask .  it was years ago  of course  but it was a real mystery .  we didn t have the slightest idea where the fellow had gone .      do you want to hear it .    gonzalo rose from his seat and said   i do  but i ll be glad to put it to a vote .  is there anyone here who doesn t want to hear it .    there wasn t a sound  and then avalon said   well  mario  we ll listen .    gonzalo nodded his head emphatically .   all right  then .  mr .  hume  you have the floor .    hume said mildly   i ll be glad to .  but are you going to stop me midway  or will i be allowed to talk freely .    avalon said   i assure you  mr .  hume .  you will be allowed to talk .  roger as host will have absolute control over the conversation and when he sayeth  speak  we will speak  and when he sayeth  speak not   we will remain silent .      right  roger .     right   said halsted .    i will begin   said hume   and take my chance .    the story begins  said hume  some years ago when i was invited to give a talk in seattle .  it meant i would have to fly  obviously  and i m not keen on flying .  i never do it voluntarily  certainly not in january .  what s more  the fee offered was considerably less than i liked .  so  to put it all into one tightly crumpled ball  i said no .   and it was a good thing i said no  because  as it happened  the northwest was visited by a tenacious fog on just the day i would have arrived .  even assuming i would have landed safely  very few planes left seattle for a week thereafter  and i would have been stranded .  that would have annoyed me  since i had work to do at home  and it would have annoyed my employer  too .  the firm doesn t mind my speaking  since i generally give it a plug or two  and it looks good for them to be concerned with  and involved in  the future .  still  my staying away a week would have been pushing them a little far .   all that is irrelevant  however .  the important thing is that the gentleman at the other end didn t accept my no .  he and his associates took advantage of the miracle of modern communication and came back at me with the suggestion that i sit right in new york and submit to a twenty minute interview on television .  the interview would be taped and eventually played for a presumably eager audience in seattle .   the fee was still less than i would have liked  but i was flattered at their persistence .  then  too  i wouldn t have to travel .  the interview would take place at a midtown location within walking distance of my apartment  if the weather was passable  which is  of course  by no means a foregone conclusion in december .  anyway  i accepted .   the gentleman inviting me     i forget his name  but that s immaterial  so i ll call him smith     sensed a residium of unenthusiasm about me and tried to reassure me that all would be made as simple as possible for me .  he told me that he would come and get me in a taxi at nine twenty a . m .  in order to get me there at nine thirty .  the cameraman  scheduled to get there shortly after nine a . m .   would be all set up and ready when i arrived .   that was an important point to me .  i d done television work     cameras being set up for an interview in some hotel room  for instance     and let me tell you that there s no easier way to be driven crazy .  television has been around for forty years and the cameramen still haven t worked out a system for setting up lights in such a way that the subject is well illuminated and with no distracting shadows .   besides  they all consider themselves artists and there s some sort of law  apparently  that compels artists never to be satisfied .  every adjustment here throws out something there .  it takes hours for them to reach a point of near satisfaction  and then when you sit down  they become aware for the first time that you wear glasses  and that those glasses cast an undesirable reflection     and so all the weary work must be gone through again .   i said   are you sure the cameraman will be ready  that all i ll have to do will be to sit down .     positive   he said  and that swung it .   came the day .  smith pulled up in his taxi on time and off we went .  we arrived at the proper place within ten minutes  and  as we went up  smith said to me   he ll be all ready for us .    i tried not to let my cynicism show .  i m convinced that cameramen are not ready for anything at any time for anyone .   fine   i said .   we rose to one of the upper floors and swung into the office just before nine thirty a . m .  we had entered the offices of quite a large law firm  in which an old army buddy of smith s was a senior partner .  let s call him jones  because i don t remember his name  either .  they were lending us the use of a conference room .   smith said jovially to the receptionist   hello  i m smith and this is mr .  hume .  we re here for the television taping .  i suppose the cameraman has arrived and is set up .    the receptionist said  rather indifferently   i didn t see any cameraman  sir .     what .  no cameraman .     no  sir .    smith frowned but decided to be invincibly optimist .   it can t be   he said .   he s waiting for us .    but he wasn t .  we walked into the conference room and it was as bare as a shakespearean stage .    where is he .   i asked .    i don t know   said smith .   down came smith s buddy  jones  who shook hands with me  and said to smith   well  where is he .     i don t know   said smith again .   i said   better call his office .    smith said   his office is in indianapolis .    whereupon i said  rather nonplussed   aren t there any cameramen in new york .  why send in one from indianapolis .    smith shrugged .   it s a firm we always work with .    jones pointed to a telephone in the corner .  he said to smith   push any button at the bottom that s not lit up  then push   and wait for another dial tone  push    the area code  and the number .    i waited patiently .  it s an amazing thing .  usually  the one thing that brings out the fury in me is having to wait .  all sorts of things can go wrong and i am patience itself .  everyone remarks on what a sweet fellow i am .  but if someone doesn t appear at the agreed upon instant  a frown creases my brow .  let five minutes pass  and smoke is curling out of my ears .  but time was passing and it was almost the moment at which i was counting on having finished the interview  and the cameraman hadn t even showed up  and i wasn t in the least perturbed .  there was a mystery about it  and i was interested .   smith had returned from the telephone .   he left yesterday   he said   and the manager says he had the right name  the right address  and everything was as it should be .  what s more  the manager says the cameraman assigned to us is known as  old reliable .   he s worked all over the world  and he never misses an appointment .    i said   he s missed this one .  where s he supposed to be today  then  if he left yesterday .     at a hotel   said smith .    did he ever get there .   i asked .   it was back to the telephone and  after a while  smith said   he registered last night .    jones said   all right  then .  he took a taxi and the taxi driver spotted him for an out of towner and took him to this place by way of yonkers .  taxi drivers have been known to do that .     that s impossible   said smith with intense irritation .   he s staying at the new york hilton .  isn t that right in the neighborhood .     the new york hilton .   jones sounded nonplussed .   yes  it is .  it s right across the street .  all he has to do is cross fifty fourth street .     yes .  so he wouldn t take a taxi  would he .     i guess not .  the hotel s address is      sixth and we re at      sixth .  the biggest greenhorn in the world wouldn t take a taxi to go ten numbers along a particular street  and this guy is a world traveler who s called old reliable .    i felt cynicism rising as high as my nostrils and said   so old reliable is here in the big city .  he s gone on a toot  brought home an amiable young woman  and he s sleeping it off .    smith looked indignant .   come on  the manager said he s forty eight years old .  he s no wild kid .     he s no dead hulk  either   i said .   i m older than he is and i could do it easily .  i mean  i don t  but i could if i wanted to .     well  he wouldn t do it  if he had a date to keep in the morning .  he s a professional man .     all right   i said .   you re talking me into wondering if he didn t have a heart attack in the night  if he might not be lying in that hotel bed right now  dying  or maybe dead .    smith and jones both looked uneasy .  smith said uncertainly   do you think we ought to call the police .    jones said   not before we have someone look into his room .    jones went to the phone this time .  he spoke crisply into it  then hung up .  we all maintained a worried silence for a while .   smith said   do you suppose he came to this building and couldn t get in .  i imagine the security is tight  and he may be wandering about the lobby right now .     security is tight  sure   said jones   but a pass was delivered to him last night .  he should have had no trouble getting in .     maybe it never got to him   i said  ever the pessimist   and he never got past the lobby .    jones said   i ll send someone to the lobby to look .    by that time the phone was ringing .  jones answered it  talked awhile  and came back to say   hotel security went into his room .  his baggage is there  but he isn t .  and there s no camera equipment .  so he left with his cameras .     then where is he .   i asked .   there was no answer  of course .  jones thought awhile and said   i suppose they looked in the bathroom .    smith shrugged .   i assume the security people know their business .    by now i had been there nearly an hour and word came up that there was no sign of any cameraman wandering about the lobby .  obviously  if he was carrying camera equipment about with him  he would be easily spotted .  for that matter  the security man downstairs had not seen anyone with such equipment come in  with or without a pass .   i said   did they check as to whether he had signed in .    jones shook his head .   he wouldn t have to sign in  if he had a pass .  they d just wave him through .    smith said   you don t suppose he got off the elevator on the wrong floor  do you .  he couldn t be wandering about helplessly .    jones looked at his watch .   he was due here an hour and a half ago .  how could he be wandering around on the wrong floor for an hour and a half .  there s not a floor in this building which doesn t have security guards .  no one would be allowed to wander about anywhere .      and he wouldn t  anyway .  he d ask .  after all  he knew the name of this firm .  for that matter  he knew the correct floor .    there was a sticky silence and we all took turns looking at our watches .  finally  jones muttered an  excuse me  and left .  he was back in three minutes and said   i just talked to josie        who s she .   i asked .    the receptionist .  she swears no cameraman came in .  in fact  no one  no one came in who wasn t a member of the firm  except you  smith  and you  mr .  hume .    smith said   was she at her desk the whole time .     the receptionist insists she was .     you mean she didn t go out to powder her nose  or whatever .     she says she didn t .  she says she was on the job and alert all morning  and she says no one could possibly have gotten into the place without her seeing him .    i said   is she a truthful woman .    jones frowned at me .   we can trust her .  we ve had her on the job nearly five years now and if she says no one got in  no one got in .    smith said   then where is he .  how could he have gotten lost just crossing the street .    i said   we re eliminating everything  except the possibility that he might have had an accident crossing the street .        smith said shakily   you mean he might have been hit by a car .     it s been known to happen   i said .    it would have to be pretty serious   said jones .   being a professional  he would call us  or the home office .  even if he were immobilized he would tell someone else to call us .    i said   if he were conscious .  if he were alive .    jones said   if it was a really serious accident in the street just outside  they d known about it downstairs .    i said   did anyone ask .    jones hesitated about two seconds and called downstairs .  it didn t take long .  he shook his head .   no one down there knows anything about any accident .    smith said   call the police .  they would have to have a record .    jones didn t seem to want to  but he did .  that took longer  but the result was the same .  he said   the police say there is no record of any accident at any time this a . m .  at fifty fourth street and sixth avenue .    smith said   then where is he .    i got up .   gentlemen   i said   i don t know where he is  but i can wait no longer .  i ve got other appointments to meet  other work to do .  i m terribly sorry but i have to leave now .  still  i would like to know the answer to this .  if at any time you find out  please phone me .  if you re kind enough to do this  then i ll come back a second time to complete the taping .    so i left .      within an hour  smith did call me and explained the situation .  a week later  i returned and did the job .  there s your mystery .   the black widowers stared dubiously at their guest .  halsted spoke for all  finally  when he said   did that really happen  brad .  or are you having a bit of fun with us .     no  no   said hume .   it s all true .  every word .  scout s honor .  it happened exactly as i described it .     well  then  tell us what happened to the cameraman .    hume shook his head  still smiling .   you wanted a mystery and i gave it to you .  you tell me what happened .  you have all the facts .  i ll give you two hints .  no one was lying .  it wasn t a setup of any kind .  the second hint is that it s no tragedy .  the cameraman was in no way harmed .  now  where was he .    gonzalo said   did he have a temporary bout of amnesia and go wandering off .    hume said   no  he was in no way harmed .  neither physically nor mentally .     see here   said avalon rather heavily .   you don t really know he was in the hotel at all     or in new york  even .  no one saw him there that morning .  the pass was sent over the night before  but i ll bet it was just left at the desk for him .  who knows who might have been in the room .    hume said   it was someone who signed the cameraman s name in the register .     anyone could do that if he knew the name   said avalon .   the cameraman had a reservation at the hotel and someone knew of it .  the someone delayed the cameraman somehow  registered in his name  and had a room for a night at a very posh hotel at someone else s expense .  hotel service found baggage there in the morning  when our imposter had gone about his own business  but no camera equipment .  that might just mean that there was no camera equipment in the first place .    hume said   why should anyone do this .    avalon said   i don t know .  i could invent motives by the score  perhaps  but i couldn t prove any of them .    trumbull said   someone on the run needed a false name and a secure room just for the night     a spy       drake said  with a tone that showed clearly he was not serious   a bomb outrage .  needed a room in which to plant a bomb .     gentlemen   said hume  brushing back his mane of hair .   you are inventing things .  as a matter of fact  it never occurred to us to locate the bellhop who took the cameraman s baggage to the room  but if we had  that bellhop would have told us he had brought up some items that looked as though they might be camera equipment .  no  no  it s absolutely certain that the right man registered in the hotel .     in that case   said rubin   he was himself up to funny stuff .  he had a girl he had to see  some money matter he had to attend to  something or other in the great city he wanted to do .  when he got down to the lobby of the hotel  he checked his equipment  grabbed a taxi  and dashed off .  maybe he thought he d be back in half an hour and that you would wait that long for him without much fuss .  but perhaps it took two hours  because he may have underestimated new york traffic  or gotten into a minor tangle of some sort that delayed him .    hume said   i wouldn t think he d do that .  surely  a job would come first with old reliable .    now there was a long  dank silence  as every face furrowed  and every pair of lips pursed themselves .  so it seemed to hume  until he noticed the exception .   he said   henry s the only one smiling .      henry  what are you grinning about .    henry said   i beg your pardon  sir .  i mean no disrespect  but you did say it was no tragedy  and it occurs to me that it was a farce  and so i can t help but smile .    avalon said  in his rolling baritone   do you have a solution  henry .  if so  out with it .    henry said   if i have your permission  gentlemen .    the chorus was immediate and unanimous .   henry said   mr .  hume made it clear that the cameraman was an old  reliable professional who had worked all over the world  and who had  presumably  always given satisfaction .  since he was not found dead in the room  and the police had no report of any accident  we can only assume that in the morning he had gotten ready to do his work  had crossed the street to the office building as he had been instructed to do  and  going to the proper place  had set up his television equipment .     no   said avalon .   the receptionist swears he never came in and mr .  hume has told us the receptionist didn t lie .  that means     mr .  hume  please forgive me the question i am forced to ask .  it is merely a matter of the search for a solution .  when you told us the receptionist did not lie  may i take it that you did not lie .     i did not lie   said hume with equanimity .    in that case  henry   said avalon   your assumption is wrong .     perhaps not  mr .  avalon   said henry .   mr .  hume was supposed to arrive at nine thirty a . m .  and the cameraman was supposed to come at about   a . m .  in order to be ready by nine thirty .  isn t that right  mr .  hume .     that s right .     and the receptionist would have been a very curious receptionist if she had arrived much before nine a . m .   which would be the opening of the business day .  the cameraman  however  was so reliable  efficient  and professional  that it is quite likely he arrive at eight thirty a . m .  that would account for the fact that the receptionist never saw him .  what s more  i expect a new shift came on in the lobby at nine a . m .  and that s why no one who is in the next shift down there saw him come in .     and the door would have been locked   said avalon   and he would have had to wait for her .     would he  sir .  it was a large legal firm  we were told  so there would be many lawyers working there .  at least one would have been at work early .  he would answer the door  see the cameraman s pass  let him in  go back to his own work  and then forget the whole thing .    avalon said   and what happened to the cameraman thereafter .  did he drop through a hole in the floor .  where was he .  no one saw him .     mr .  hume   said henry   may i ask you one more question .     go ahead  henry .     considering that it was a large legal firm  did it possess more than one conference room .    hume leaned his head back and laughed in sheer enjoyment .   two  it turned out  henry .  two .     i thought so   said henry .   the lawyer who let him in took him to the wrong conference room .  the cameraman waited in one  and you waited in the other the whole morning  and neither knew where the other was .     no   said avalon .   how would that be possible .  wouldn t the cameraman come out and say   where is everybody .       in a way  he did   said hume  choking down his laughter .   he used the phone in his room to call jones .  jones s secretary answered and said that jones was away from his desk     which he was  being down in our conference room  wondering where the cameraman was .  the cameraman said he had to tape someone  and the secretary said she would tell jones just as soon as he returned  only jones didn t return until after i had left .      how did you get it  henry .     in the usual way   said henry .   once you and the other two gentlemen in the conference room  and my fellow members of the black widowers  too  had cut away all the complexity  the only thing left was something very simple and i just pointed it out .    afterword  of all the black widowers stories i have written  this one made the least demand on my imagination .  it really happened .  it happened exactly as i have described it in the story .  i must say that it made me realize how much less clever i am than henry .  i was completely lost for a solution when it happened to me .   incidentally  i was very amused at the fact that this story received more reader flak than any other black widowers i had written .  a surprising number of people wrote to object to this or that facet of the story as improbable .  some even criticized my street addresses  although i gave the actual addresses that the buildings did have .   the conclusion is that in my fiction i am careful to make everything probable and to tie up all loose ends .  real life is not hampered by such considerations .   the story first appeared in the october      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   the old purse   william teller .   said thomas trumbull  host for that month s banquet of the black widowers  announcing the guest of the evening .  he did so  however  with a certain trepidation .  his frowning glance fixed itself particularly on mario gonzalo .   gonzalo  gorgeously arrayed as usual  this time in his brown velvet jacket  ignored it .   william teller   he said delightedly .   are you a descendant of william tell  perhaps .     not at all   said teller agreeably .  he had an olive complexion  thick black hair  and a thick black mustache as well .   actually  william tell is simply a legend and probably never really existed .  however  i m of swiss extraction and the first name runs in the family  perhaps in homage to the old fraud .  actually  teller is an ordinary german word and means  plate .      geoffrey avalon  looking down from his seventy four inches  said   parents are often insensitive to the plight of a youngster .  i was saved from serious scapegoating by the fact that i always used jeff as my name .  at that i was lucky  since the name alternates with broderick  and it is my eldest son  not i  who must cope with that .  fortunately  he has always been a muscular youth  as i never was .     names can be an inspiration  too   said teller .   when i was young i dreamed of being a superlative archer .  i wanted people to say   william tell was good  but william teller is better .   i was an assiduous archer at summer camp for that reason .     did you make it .   asked james drake with interest  lighting up the inevitable cigarette .    no .  i was remarkably untalented .  the only time i ever hit the target  let alone the bull s eye  was when i deliberately aimed at something else .  too bad .  if i could have won the national archery contest with my name  i would have made every newspaper in the united states  also the  believe it or not  columns  if any exist now .     you d have done even better   said emmanuel rubin judiciously   if your name had been robin hood .    roger halsted said eagerly   a great many so called coincidences are manufactured in this way .  someone named robin hood would be bound to try his hand at archery and if he were good  saying  believe it or not  misses the point .  it would be a natural consequence .  in fact  i have a suspicion that the queer things that happen to everybody aren t mystical  but natural .  for instance       no one ever found out the instance that halsted was about to give  for henry  that waiter supreme  chose that moment to announce in his quietly effective manner that dinner was served .   all sat down to tripe madeleine  followed by crisp roast duck in cherry brandy sauce with wild rice and truffles  something that effectively muffled conversation .  in fact the dinner pursued a kind of satisfied quiet  in which even rubin s occasional comments were given out with hushed equanimity  until trumbull  over the coffee  rattled his spoon against the water glass and appointed avalon as griller in chief .    mr .  teller   said avalon   how do you justify your existence .    teller did not seem to be perturbed by the question .   by making people think .     and how do you do that .     i have a newspaper column called  on the contrary .   it does not appear in any of the new york newspapers but it does in one hundred and two papers of moderate size elsewhere in the nation .  in my column  i present the unpopular side of any controversy  not necessarily because i passionately support that side but because i think it is apt to be inadequately presented to the public .  the public may  after all  be misled  even sometimes dangerously misled  by hearing only one side of a question .  many might not even know that another view exists .     can you give us an example of that .   asked avalon .    certainly .  in a recent column i presented the view that so called terrorists have of themselves .     so called .   said drake  in gentle interrogation .    yes  indeed .  so called   said teller .   they don t think of themselves as terrorists  any more than we think of terrorists as such when they are on our side .  when we approve their aims  we call them freedom fighters and compare them favorably with george washington .     then you defend terrorism .   said avalon .    not necessarily .  i merely try to penetrate the reasoning for the defense .  for instance  the united states thinks all conflicts should either take place with missiles  planes  tanks  and all the paraphernalia of war  or by votes  resolutions  arguments  debates  and all the paraphernalia of politics .  however  what if there are people who feel they have a just cause  but who lack the paraphernalia of war and are denied the paraphernalia of politics .  what do they then do .  surely  they must fight with the weapons they have .  our cry  then  is that they are cowards who strike without warning  and kill innocent civilians at random .  but then  is it brave of us to  fight fair  against forces that are infinitely smaller than our own .     i see your point   said rubin   but terrorism can be argued against on pragmatic grounds even if you abandon the high moral stand .  it simply won t work .  random bombings make headlines and cause private pain and public frustration  but they don t achieve their ends .     sure they do  on occasion   said teller .   the iranian capture of the american embassy held the united states up to worldwide ridicule  made khomeini the hero of the arab radicals throughout islam  and destroyed the carter presidency .  and they didn t even kill anybody .     yes   said rubin   but that was self defeating  for it led to the reagan presidency  which has taken a much harder antiterrorist line  and brought about the bombing of libya  for instance  as punishment for its support of terrorism .     yes  but we have yet to see what that will lead to on the other side .  to continue my argument  during war  terrorists are called guerrillas or resistance forces or raiders or commandos  or anything but terrorists  and during world war ii such irregular forces in every supposedly conquered nation  notably in yugoslavia  did much to help defeat the nazis .  similarly  the guerrillas of spain did much to defeat napoleon .     perhaps   said avalon   you would not be so cold blooded about it if you had suffered directly at terrorist hands .     i imagine not  but the argument would exist even if i  out of personal pique  were to refuse to advance it .    drake chuckled .   you know  tom  i assume that mr .  teller is a friend of yours since you ve brought him as a guest .  isn t he  with his views  a dangerous friend  considering your government employment .     not at all   said trumbull .   he s just a professional devil s advocate .  he often supports the government strongly  provided it has happened to do something unpopular .    teller said   true enough .   he stopped and frowned  as though a sudden thought had struck him .  then he said slowly   you know  this wouldn t have occurred to me if there hadn t been that talk before dinner about odd connections such as that between me and archery  but there s a connection here in the terrorism matter .     may i ask what connection you are thinking of .   said avalon .    mr .  rubin had pointed out that my views might change if i were a victim .  to be sure  i haven t been  but my wife has  and that might be considered close enough .  on the very day my column on terrorism appeared     the very day     my wife was the victim of a mild sort of terrorism .  she had her purse snatched .  of course  that was the purest of coincidences .  however      he stopped again .    yes  mr .  teller .   said avalon .    nothing apropos .  i was just thinking of the sequel to the incident that was really humorous and even mystifying .  but never mind that  let s go back to our discussion of my justification for existence .  at the time of our misadventure in lebanon        wait  wait   said gonzalo  rattling his spoon on his water glass .   back up  mr .  teller .  i want to hear about the humorous and mystifying sequel to the purse snatching .    teller looked surprised and he turned automatically to trumbull .   tom       trumbull shrugged .   go ahead  tell us about the mystifying sequel .  if not  mario will make life hideous for all of us .     wait   said gonzalo .   wait one minute .  henry isn t here .     henry .   said teller .    our waiter .   and gonzalo raised his voice   henry .    henry entered the dining room .   yes  mr .  gonzalo .     don t disappear like that   said gonzalo peevishly .   where were you .     disposing of dishes and cutlery  mr .  gonzalo  but i am at your service now .     good .  i want you to hear this .  mr .  teller  please start at the beginning .    teller was staring in surprise .  he said   there really isn t much .  my wife was in grand central station and on a crowded escalator her purse vanished .  she had it slung over her left shoulder  for she was carrying something in each hand  and our guess is that someone behind her carefully cut the strap  held the bag steady till they reached the bottom of the escalator  and then walked rapidly away  with the purse under his arm .  she didn t see a thing  she didn t feel a thing .  she knows she had the purse in her possession at the top of the escalator  for she shoved it toward her back for greater convenience  and she didn t have it when she was at the bottom .  that s all there is to the story .  she wasn t hurt  she wasn t shoved  she wasn t threatened .  it was a very professional job .     you don t seem annoyed   said gonzalo .    well  i was  of course  and so was my wife .  such a loss is always inconvenient .  she didn t have much money in it     a few dollars     but she had several credit cards  her driver s license  her automobile registration  some personal papers and photographs  and so on .  it meant that she had to report the loss of the credit cards and face a few weeks of doing without  or using mine .  it meant negotiating with city hall over her automobile items  and apparently saying good bye to all the junk she had in the purse .    mostly  though  it was her pride that was hurt .  the purse was an old one  old and decrepit and on its last legs .  this was on purpose .  she had any number of new and fancy purses that she used on dress occasions  but this was the battered thing she used on her shopping trips  when she expected to be in crowds .  she claimed that no self respecting thief would dream of taking a purse so disreputable .  they would know there was nothing worthwhile in it .  well  they did take it  and even though i was careful to make no reference to her earlier statements     she had always been very smug about her cleverness in this respect     she watched me closely and probably knew what i was thinking .     and what was the mystifying sequel .   asked gonzalo .    well  yesterday  two days after the snatch  i opened the door of my apartment in order to take the rubbish to the compacter     i work at home     and virtually stumbled over a package which had my wife s name on it in straggling letters .  i assumed  at first  it was something the mailman had left  even though he perfectly well knew he wasn t supposed to do that without ringing the bell .  but when i picked it up i found it had no address and no stamps on it .  so it must have been hand delivered and that rather infuriated me .    after all  our apartment house is supposed to have tight security and no one should be able to get into the elevator without passing inspection by the doormen and having us called on the intercom to get our consent to have him  or her  sent up .  naturally  this doesn t always work .  someone comes in when the doormen are busy with something else  or tails someone who belongs in the house so that he seems to be a guest     but it still infuriated me .    i was angry enough to inspect the length of the hall and look into the two stairwells and the compacter room  which wasn t exactly intelligent of me  and found no one .  i then called my wife  showed her the package  and asked if she knew what it might be .    she said at once  and with great conviction   it s a bomb .   naturally  i laughed at this .  we are all getting ridiculously terrorist conscious .  it seemed to me too small to hold a bomb and yet i didn t have the nerve to attempt to open it .  after considerable indecision  listening to it for some telltale tick  although i don t know if bombs tick these days  and smelling it  and not having quite enough courage to shake it  i called the police .  they told us to put it in the center of our largest room and leave the apartment .  down came a bomb squad in virtually no time  with a portable x ray unit  and  well     it wasn t a bomb .    they opened it for us  and when they called us back into the apartment  they showed us the contents .  damned if it wasn t what had been stolen from my wife two days before .  everything .  the package contained all the papers  including the credit cards  all the junk .  it even contained every last bit of money down to the little cache of quarters she kept for public transportation and even a few smaller coins .  she counted it in amazement and it was all there .  they had taken nothing .  did you ever hear of such a thing .  i consider that mystifying .  presumably  it was a thief with an attack of conscience .    gonzalo  who had listened with close attention  seemed disappointed .   is that the end of it .     the absolute end   said teller .   but then i told you there was nothing much to it  so you mustn t feel annoyed with me .    gonzalo shook his head  obviously baffled .   henry  however  said quietly   i beg your pardon  mr .  teller  but may i have your permission to ask a question .     well  of course  if you want to  but i don t see what there is to question .     it s just that you mentioned all the contents  sir  but you didn t mention the purse itself .  was that returned as well .    teller looked astonished .   no  it wasn t .  i m glad you asked .  it was the only thing that didn t come back .  my wife was annoyed about that  actually .  she said that the purse was valuable to her and they might have returned that  too .  my own feeling was that it was simply too bulky to fit into a neat little package .  of course  i pointed out that since her scheme of carrying an old purse hadn t worked  it was no great loss  and  equally of course  she gave me the exasperated look that wives always give husbands who descend into mere logic .  anyway  that s it .  they returned everything but the purse .    halsted said   that is mystifying .  they could easily have made a somewhat bigger package .  if the thief were sufficiently conscience stricken to return every last penny  he would certainly have been sufficiently conscience stricken to return the purse .    rubin said   maybe it fell apart  and he felt it was useless to return the tatters .     no  no  no   interposed teller .   it was a staunch leather purse .  it was old  and weatherbeaten  and looked like hell  but it wasn t going to fall apart .    trumbull said   do you suppose there was a purpose in keeping it .  i mean maybe the purse was what they wanted  so they returned everything else .     ridiculous   said rubin .   if they wanted the purse  they could just dump the contents  at least those parts of it they couldn t use .    drake stubbed out his cigarette and said in his softly hoarse voice   you can t have it both ways  manny .  either the thief was not troubled by a conscience and would return nothing  just dumping whatever he didn t want  as you suggest .  or else  he had a conscience and would return everything except what he absolutely needed .  the way i see it is that he was reluctantly stealing something he wanted desperately  and he had no intention of stealing anything else .     you mean   said avalon   he was an honest man who had no choice but to steal something he had to have  but not another item was going to sully his tender and gentlemanly soul .     that s right   said drake .   now if that s the case  think it out a bit .  he wants to steal a purse in order to get some specific object it contains .  but he only sees the purse and nothing else .  he doesn t see what s in it .  if he wants something that it contains  he couldn t be sure that this particular purse actually contained it .  he might have to steal half a dozen purses  examine each  and then  disappointed of his wish  return everything to its owner  or if he finally found a purse with what he wanted inside  he would remove the wanted object and return everything else .    i don t think an honest man  a man so honest that he would be driven to make a package of what he had taken and run the risk of returning it personally  would steal in so wholesale and cavalier a fashion .  if we allow that        wait   said rubin .   we don t necessarily allow that .  he might be after what any purse might be thought to contain     money  credit cards        or   said trumbull   he might have happened to see mrs .  teller open her purse and happened to spy something in it that he wanted  and thereafter followed her in order to seize the chance of grasping it .     or for some reason   said gonzalo   all he wanted was her identification .  he just wanted to know her name and address .    drake considered matters a moment  humming under his breath  then he said   i don t think so .  if he wanted money or credit cards  he would have kept them  but he returned them .  if he had spied something in it that he wanted but that wasn t intrinsically valuable  he wouldn t have returned that  but he did .     wait   said gonzalo   how can we be sure he returned everything .  there might be some little item that mrs .  teller didn t notice was gone .  perhaps there was something in the purse that even mrs .  teller didn t know was there  or had forgotten was there .     i don t think so   said teller dubiously .   i can t speak for my wife altogether  but she is a very methodical person with an orderly brain .  if she says everything was returned  i m ready to bet on it .    avalon cleared his throat and said   you understand  mr .  teller  this is a game we re playing .  we re trying to work out the implications of this odd event .  please do not be offended  then  when i suggest  merely as a remote possibility  that your wife had  let us say  a letter in her purse that she wanted no one to see .  if the thief now has it  and if your wife dare not admit it s gone       teller said grimly   you are suggesting that the thief now intends to blackmail her .  gentlemen  you ll have to assume i know my wife .  she would sooner see the blackmailer     and herself     in hell than pay a penny .  please put blackmail right out of your mind .    halsted said   he might return the credit cards but keep a record of the number for later forgery .  or of the car registration .    teller said   useless .  my wife has already canceled all those things and will eventually have new ones .  the forgeries would be unusable .     what about the identification .   insisted gonzalo .   he had her name and address  and he didn t have to keep the physical objects that gave him the information .     why on earth   said trumbull   would he run the risk of purse snatching for that .  he might simply have followed her home .  he might have struck up an acquaintanceship with her somehow .  and why would he want to know the name and address of a woman unknown to him .  you ll excuse me  bill  if i say that she s not a raving beauty .    teller smiled .   she s beautiful to me  but to anyone else she is merely a rather ordinary looking middle aged woman  i dare say .    drake was looking from one to another as each spoke  and he finally said   if we ve eliminated all the various reasons for stealing a purse and returning the contents  may i be allowed to finish my thought .     go ahead  jim   said avalon .    very well  then .  you ve all played about with complexities and  like henry  i m going for simplicity .  the thief returned everything but the purse .  what s more  all he could see at the time he decided to steal something from mrs .  teller was the purse  not its contents .  conclusion  he was after the purse itself  nothing more  so he returned all it contained .    rubin said   but jim  that just substitutes one problem for another .  why on earth should the thief want the purse .      mr .  teller  are you sure the purse had no intrinsic value .     none   said teller emphatically .    it wasn t an antique of some sort  was it .    teller thought a moment .   i m not an expert on antiques .  my wife bought the purse at least twenty years ago  but it s my impression she picked it up in klein s .  nothing klein s sells would become an antique  would it .    gonzalo said   mickey mouse watches  which sold for a dollar apiece to begin with  are now valuable antiques .     yes   said avalon   but if the man were a collector and recognized that an object might be worth  say  ten thousand dollars  wouldn t he say   pardon me  madam  but your purse reminds me of one my dear  dead wife once had .  would you be willing to sell it to me for ten dollars so that i can have it for its sentimental value .   even if he were driven to theft  he would try to get it legally first .    drake said   it looks as though we re driven to the conclusion that he wanted an old  beat up purse for its own sake .     why .   said avalon .    because he couldn t buy one .  all those for sale are new ones .  even if he went to a secondhand store  the purses would be furbished to look as good as possible .  he had to find one that was already old and beaten up and looked it .    gonzalo said   wouldn t he try to buy it first .   hey  lady  you wouldn t sell me that old beat up  worthless purse for ten dollars  would you  lady .       besides   said trumbull   why would anybody want an old  beat up purse .    halsted said   in the story of aladdin  the wicked sorcerer went about offering to give new lamps for old  because he wanted aladdin s old wishing lamp .    avalon favored halsted with a haughty stare .   i think we can eliminate the possibility that mrs .  teller owned a wishing purse .     just joking   said halsted .    maybe the thief was a theatrical director who needed an old purse for a play he was doing   said gonzalo .    nuts   said rubin with contempt .   they would buy a new purse and scuff it up .    trumbull said   that eliminates the whole need for an old  beat up purse .  whatever use one might have  couldn t one buy a new purse  or a good looking second hand one and scuff it up and stamp on it and scrape it .  why steal one .    the conversation came to a dead halt .  finally  avalon said   i think we ve beaten this to death .  there s no logical explanation  and we may simply have to admit that people do illogical things sometimes  and let it go .     oh  no   said gonzalo   not until henry has his say .      henry  what do you make of all this .    henry smiled gently and said   i think  as mr .  avalon does  that people sometimes do illogical things .  however  if we want to continue to play the game  there is one occasion when stealing an old purse is more effective than buying a purse and scuffing it up .     when is that  henry .   asked teller .    when the thief wants to make sure he is not identified .  if the purse is bought  then it is conceivable that something about it can lead investigators to the place where it is purchased  and the seller can then  conceivably  identify the person who bought it .  in this case  the thief was not seen and cannot conceivably be identified .  even if it is traced back to mrs .  teller  she cannot make an identification .  he may be so honest a man that he takes the risk of returning everything else  but if he is careful to use a nondescript box and paper for a package  wearing gloves at the time  scrawls a simple name on it  and quietly delivers it without being seen  he is still not likely to be identified .     but in that case   said teller   he would want the purse for a criminal purpose .     one would suppose so   said henry .    like what .     still playing the game   said henry   i can invent a purpose     farfetched  but making a weird kind of sense .  the purse was stolen in grand central station and it is well known that there are homeless people who live in the station and who are generally left alone by a society that is too callous to go too far out of its way to help them  but not so callous as to evict them from a warm and secure place .    no one pays much attention to these derelicts  in fact .  the average person tends to avert his or her eyes from these sad individuals  if only because they look dirty and miserable so that the onlooker feels either uncomfortably repelled or uncomfortably conscience stricken .  it would be easy for someone to assume the dirt  the old clothes  and the wretched appearance of a homeless person and count on not being interfered with  or even noticed .  suppose  then  a woman were made up as what is called a bag lady and needs a purse to carry off the deception       gonzalo interrupted .   hold on  you call them bag ladies because they carry their personal belongings in brown paper bags .     i m sure that is the origin of the term  mr .  gonzalo   said henry   but it has become a generic word for such derelicts .  i am sure that a homeless woman with a purse would still be considered a bag lady .  however  the purse could scarcely be a new one .  a bag lady  carrying a new purse  would surely attract attention .  it would have to be an old beat up purse that would fit in with the rest of the costume .    teller laughed .   very clever tale spinning  henry  but i don t think my wife would take to the notion that she carries a purse suitable for a bag lady .  why would this disguised bag lady need a purse anyway .  why not a brown paper bag .     perhaps   said henry   because a paper bag would not be strong enough to contain whatever the bag lady was carrying  only a sturdy  but old purse would do .  for instance     and this thought occurs to me only because of the earlier discussion of terrorism     what if the supposed bag lady were carrying an explosive device which she planned to place in the station so as to do a great deal of damage .  as mr .  teller has pointed out  terrorists may look upon themselves as lofty and noble patriots .  they would steal a purse that was absolutely essential to their needs  if stealing were the safest way to obtain it  but they would scorn to keep the contents .  they are not thieves  but patriots .  in their own eyes  at least .    gonzalo said admiringly   good lord  henry  how nicely you make it all fit .     simply a game  sir .  dr .  drake did the real work .    trumbull said  frowning darkly as he passed his hand over his tightly waved white hair   you make it all fit too nicely  henry .  is there a chance this is what really happened .     i scarcely think so  mr .  trumbull   said henry .   there has been no report of an explosion anywhere in the city .     it s only three days since the purse was stolen   said trumbull .  he turned to teller .   i don t suppose your wife reported the theft  did she .     no  of course not .  she couldn t make any identification  not the slightest .  she might as well say the purse had disappeared by the wave of an enchanter s wand .     even if she had   said avalon   what could the police do about it  tom .  and why should they think anything like the story henry has dreamed up .  that only arose out of the fact that everything was returned yesterday .     and i don t suppose you reported that  either  did you  bill .   asked trumbull .    no  of course not   said teller .    well   said trumbull  rising heavily to his feet .   this may be crazy  but i m going to call someone i know .  and if      he looked at his watch      i catch him watching television or getting ready for bed  that s just too bad .     he might not be home  tom   said avalon .    i ll get someone   said trumbull grimly .   he left for the telephone in the next room  while the remaining black widowers and their guest remained in an uneasy silence .  only henry seemed unperturbed .   finally  gonzalo said   do you really think there might be something to what you ve thought up  henry .    henry said   we had better simply wait for mr .  trumbull to return .    he did  eventually .  he sat down and for perhaps fifteen seconds simply stared at henry .    well  tom .   said avalon .   tom said   it amounts to this .  if ever this gets out  henry is going to be indicted for witchcraft .    henry s eyebrows lifted slightly .   if you mean by that  sir  that there was a bomb  i think it would be more appropriate to give the credit to the logical minds of the black widowers .     of you  henry   said trumbull .   there was indeed a bomb .  it was placed in a spot where it would perhaps not have caused very much in the way of casualties  but it would certainly have disrupted train service for weeks .      what s more  it was contained in an old leather purse .     but   said henry   there was no explosion  i take it .     no  because the purse was spotted  quite by accident  and because the person who did the spotting lifted it and was surprised by its weight .  then  because these are troubled times  it occurred to him to do precisely the right thing .  he called the bomb squad     as you did  bill .     that s luck   said gonzalo .   if it hadn t been found  henry s analysis would have come too late .     it s not too late for everything .  i m afraid i told them enough of the story so that your wife is going to have to go there and identify her purse .  if it is her purse  and i m ready to bet my last year s salary it is  then they know something important the terrorists don t know they know .  they ll start looking at the derelicts in the station and they might well find something .  thank you  henry .    teller looked perturbed .   i don t think jenny is going to enjoy getting involved with this .    trumbull said   she has no choice .  just tell her she s got to .     yes  that s easy for you to say   said the troubled teller .   henry said   take heart  mr .  teller .  i m sure that your professional ability to uphold unpopular points of view in a convincing manner will make it possible for you to accomplish this task with ease .    afterword  people ask me where i get my ideas  and the answer is  from any place i can .   for the most part i have to think and think before something occurs to me  and that s hard work .   try it  if you don t believe me .   therefore  when something comes my way that can be twisted into a story without my having to knock myself out thinking  i grab it at once .   a woman told me that her purse had once been stolen  and then returned  rather in the fashion i described in this story .  i asked why it was returned  and she said   i don t know .    saying  i don t know  sets my antennae to quivering at once .  after all  henry would know .  all i have to do is make up a story around the incident .  in this case  that was exactly what i did .   the story first appeared in the march      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   the quiet place  emmanuel rubin  who was host of the black widowers banquet that evening  had been at his loudest and most quarrelsome .   he had insisted on the unimportance of algebra to roger halsted  who taught the subject in a junior high school  denounced the patent system to geoffrey avalon  who was a patent lawyer  denied the validity of quantum theory in connection with molecular structure to james drake  the chemist  pointed out the uselessness of espionage in modern warfare to thomas trumbull  the cipher expert  and finally placed the cherry on the sundae by watching mario gonzalo as  with consummate ease and skill  he drew a cartoon of that evening s guest  and telling him he knew nothing at all about caricature .   trumbull  who  of all the black widowers  was least likely to be amused by rubin in his wilder moments  finally said   what the devil is wrong with you  manny .  we re used to having you wrong at the top of your voice  and taking on one or another of us with some indefensible point of view  but this time you re tackling us all .    it was rubin s guest who answered trumbull in a quiet voice and  at that  it was almost the first time he had spoken that evening .  he was a young man  not far gone into his thirties  it would appear  with thin blond hair  light blue eyes  a face that was wide across the cheek bones  and a smile that seemed to come easily and yet had something sad about it .  his name was theodore jarvik .    i m afraid  gentlemen  the fault is mine  if it be a fault to follow professional procedure .  i have recently become manny s editor and i was forced to hand back his latest manuscript with requests for revision .     for eviscerative revision   muttered rubin .    i did offer to cancel out the invitation for this evening   said jarvik  with his sad smile   on the supposition that manny would just as soon not look at me right now .    gonzalo raised his eyebrows and said   manny doesn t mind this sort of thing .  we ve all heard him say about a thousand times that the true professional writer takes revisions and even rejections in stride .  he says that one way you can tell an amateur or a beginner is by noting that he considers his every word sac       oh  shut up  mario   said rubin  clearly chafing .   you don t know the details .     actually   said jarvik   manny and i will work it out .    avalon  from his seventy four inches of height  said in his grave baritone   i m curious  manny  have you called mr .  jarvik a  young punk  yet .     oh  for god s sake   said rubin  reddening .    no  he hasn t  mr .  avalon   said jarvik   but he s thought it very loudly .     that is not true   shouted rubin at the top of his considerable decibel rating .    let s wash out this night   said drake in resignation .   you re going to be in such a foul humor  manny  that        when have i ever been in a foul      began rubin  and then henry  the pearl beyond price of waiters  interrupted .    gentlemen  please be seated   he said .   dinner is served .    to do rubin justice  he did his best to control himself during the dinner .  his eyes  behind his thick glasses  flashed  his sparse beard bristled  and he snarled unceasingly  but he managed to say little and leave the conversation to the others .   gonzalo  who sat next to jarvik  said to him   pardon me  but you keep humming .    jarvik flushed again  something his fair skin made easy .   i m sorry  i didn t mean to disturb you .     it doesn t exactly disturb me .  it s just that i don t recognize the tune .     i don t know .  i m just improvising  i suppose .     is that so .   and gonzalo was quiet for the remainder of the dinner until the rattle of spoon on glass marked the beginning of the questioning of the guest .   gonzalo said   may i volunteer to do the grilling .     you can  for all of me   growled rubin  who  as host  had the task of appointing the griller .   just don t ask him to justify his existence .  the editor doesn t live who can do that .     on the contrary   said gonzalo   any editor who has handed back a manuscript of yours has already justified his existence a hundred times over .    halsted said   may i suggest we go ahead with grilling our guest and not needling each other .    gonzalo brushed some imaginary dust off the sleeve of his loudly checked jacket and said   exactly .  mr .  jarvik  during the course of the dinner i asked you what tune you were humming and you said you were improvising .  i don t think that s quite right .  once or twice you hummed again after that and it was always the same tune .  now that you are being grilled  you are forced to give full and honest answers  as i hope manny has explained to you .  i therefore repeat  what was the tune you were humming .    trumbull intervened .   what kind of stupid question is that .    gonzalo turned a haughty face on trumbull .   as the griller  i am under the impression i can ask any question i choose consistent with human dignity .  host s decision .     go ahead  manny   said rubin  thus appealed to .   ask away .      and leave him alone  tom .    gonzalo said   answer the question  mr .  jarvik .   and when jarvik still hesitated  gonzalo said   i ll help you out .  this is the tune .   and he hummed a few bars .   avalon said at once   i know what that is .  it s  the lost chord .   the music is by arthur sullivan of the gilbert and sullivan operettas .  except for those operettas  sullivan is known only for the music to two songs .  one is  onward  christian soldiers  and the other is the aforementioned  the lost chord .       is that what you were humming  jarvik .     i suppose so .  you know how a song gets trapped in your mind and won t get out .    there was a chorus of agreement from the others and avalon said sententiously   it s a universal complaint .     well  whenever i m trapped in some sort of loudness   said jarvik   that song keeps going through my head .    drake chuckled .   if you re going to be dealing with manny  you ll be humming it till either you or he dies .    gonzalo said   does it have some significance in that connection .  what are the words .     i only know a few words  actually .     i know the words   said avalon .    don t sing them   cried out trumbull in sudden alarm .   avalon  whose singing voice was well known to resemble the sound of an alligator in heat  said with dignity   i shall recite them .  the words are by a lady named adelaide anne procter  concerning whom i know nothing  and the poem goes as follows    he cleared his throat .    seated one day at the organ  i was weary and ill at ease  and my fingers wandered idly over the noisy keys .   i don t know what i was playing  or what i was dreaming then   but i struck one chord of music  like the sound of a great amen .   it flooded the crimson twilight  like the close of an angel s psalm   and it lay on my fevered spirit with a touch of infinite calm .   it quieted pain and sorrow  like love overcoming strife   it seemed like the harmonious echo from our discordant life .   it linked all perplexed meanings into one perfect peace   and trembled away into silence as if it were loth to cease .   i have sought  but i seek it vainly  that one lost chord divine   which came from the soul of the organ  and entered into mine .   it may be that death s bright angel will speak in that chord again   may be that only in heaven shall i hear that grand amen .   there was a short silence and then halsted said   you know  i wonder about that .  i don t know how many different chords you can strike on a large organ  considering all the different stops you can push and pull and the things you do with your feet .  i suppose it is a very large number indeed and you re not likely to find a particular chord just by fooling around at random .    rubin said testily   we ll leave it to your mathematical bent to work out the total number of chords  roger .  as for you  ted jarvik  we can at least see why you hum that song when things are noisy .  all that talk about infinite calm and one perfect peace and trembling away into silence .  naturally  your mind reverts to the song .     no   said jarvik quietly  shaking his head   that s not it .     hah   shouted gonzalo in triumph .   i knew it .  i knew it .  i have a sixth sense about these things .  what is it .  what does that song mean to you .     quiet  mario   said avalon .   now  mr .  jarvik  if mario has managed to touch a sore point  something about which you do not like to speak  please do so anyway .  i assure you nothing you say will ever leave this room .    jarvik looked about at the assembled black widowers in bewilderment and said   how did this ever manage to come up .  it s a sore point  certainly  but i can talk about it without trouble .  it s just something that s totally uninteresting to anyone but me .     you can never tell   said gonzalo  grinning .   henry refilled the brandy glasses  and jarvik sighed and began   i m a quiet man  said jarvik  as perhaps you can tell .  i m told it shows .  there s something ironic in the fact that i have to live and work in manhattan  but a man must earn a living .   still  i m a single man  i don t have a wife and children to support     not yet  anyway     and i can indulge myself now and then .  so  two or three times a year i take a week off and go to a resort up the hudson river .  it s a large rambling mansion  with a victorian atmosphere .  the clientele is composed largely of people who are middle aged or older and everything about the place is staid and respectable .  even the young people who happen to come there are impressed  or perhaps oppressed  by the atmosphere and behave themselves .   it means that it is quiet to some degree and  at night  particularly  it is very quiet .  soothing .  i love it and  naturally  i try to escape even the noise that exists .  people will talk after all and since there are hundreds in the house at all times  the talk can mount up .  there are also vehicles     trucks  lawn mowers  and so on .   however  the place is set in an estate of thousands of acres of hilly woodland laced by roads and pathways  some of which are very rough indeed .  it s my particular pleasure to walk those pathways  looking for someplace where i can see only trees and huge glacier brought rocks  seat myself in one of the gazebos that dot the roads  and look at the wildness of the scenery and listen to the silence .  there are  of course  the calling of the birds  the rustling of the leaves     but that is no bother .  such natural sounds simply punctuate and emphasize the silence .   but no matter where i go  where i sit  sooner or later  usually sooner  i can hear human voices .  there are groups  tramping on nearby trails  or following along the one i just took .  i always found it irritating and would feel invaded .  it s silly  i know .  after all  i was only one of hundreds  but i felt i ought to be undisturbed .  i would get up and keep on wandering  looking always for a quiet place  a really quiet place     and never finding it .   one time  as i was sitting in one of my favorite gazebos  a man passed  looked at me  hesitated a moment  and said in half a whisper   may i join you .    i nodded .  i couldn t refuse  though i resented him at once  and i couldn t rise and immediately leave without being unbearably discourteous .   after we had been there  in utter silence  some five minutes  the inevitable sound of conversation came from up the road  and there was an explosion of feminine laughter .  my newfound companion grimaced and said   isn t that annoying .    my heart warmed to him at once .  i shook my head .   you can t get away from it .    he said   in one place you can   then stopped short as though he had been trapped into saying too much .  but i waited with an inquiring look on my face  and didn t say anything  and he said   there s a place i discovered three  four years ago .      would you like to see it .     quiet .     oh  yes .     that would be nice .     come with me .   he rose  and looked about as if he were taking his bearings .  it was a beautifully sunny day  clear blue sky  unclouded  not too warm at all  so when he set off  i followed gladly .   i didn t like to speak  but finally i had to say   i haven t seen you about .     i m usually out on the trails .     so am i   i said  my heart warming further .   ted jarvik is my name   i said  putting out my hand .   he took it and shook it heartily .   call me dark horse   he said .   and at this point  he suddenly walked right into the woods and began scrambling through and around the underbrush .  i was glad i had on a pair of slacks .  had it been warmer  i might have been in shorts and i would undoubtedly have been plant scratched and insect bitten .  as it was  i followed dutifully .   i couldn t make out where he was going .  there was no path and we were clambering over boulders as though we were mountain climbing .  despite the coolness of the day  i was puffing  hot  and sweaty before long .  finally  we stopped for a bit under the hemlocks and my companion said   i usually stop here to catch my breath .  it takes me longer these days .    i panted a bit  welcoming the break  and said   how do you know where you re going .     landmarks .  a tree that looks just so .  a rock with a particular pattern of moss .  i notice these things automatically and don t forget them .  it s just a knack  but i never get lost .    i said ruefully   you re lucky .  i have no sense of direction at all .  i get irretrievably lost in hotel corridors .  maids have to take me by the hand and lead me to my room .    my companion laughed and said   i m sure you have many talents .  my inability to get lost is the only one i ve got .     you said your name is dark horse .  you re not an indian  are you .  a native american .   i was staring at him .  he looked as little an indian as i did .    not at all .  it s not my name .  i just said to call me that .  you see  i believe if you really want to come out on a vacation  you should shuck all the paraphernalia of your ordinary life .  i have to give my real name to the hotel  because i have to make a reservation and i have to use my credit card  but while i m here  i won t be called by my name .  nor will i talk about my business .  i simply won t recognize any part of my ordinary self .  whatever i am  officially  is back in manhattan .  it isn t here .    i was struck by that .   interesting idea .  i ought to do the same .  not that i m very social when i come up here .    he said   rested a bit .  let s go  then .  we don t have much farther .    i tried to watch where he turned and to observe landmarks  but it was no use .  i m not a noticing man .  to me  a tree is a tree and a rock is a rock .      but then we half slid downward into a hollow and dark horse whispered   this is it .    i looked about .  the rocks enclosed us on almost every side .  there were trees growing between them here and there .  ferns flourished .  it was cool  very cool  welcomingly cool .   above all else  it was quiet .  there was not a sound .  a rustle of leaves now and then .  a faint insect stridulation .  once a brief bird call .  but it was quiet  a healing silence in a world which was one large  long  eternal cacophony of noise .   there was a rocky ledge at a convenient height and my companion indicated it silently .  we sat down and i let the silence flow into me .  what did the poem say .   it lay on my fevered spirit with a touch of infinite calm .    we sat there half an hour  and in all that time i said nothing  and my companion said nothing  and there was not a human sound of any kind .  no distant laughter  no crackle of far off conversation  no vibration of any internal combustion engine .  nothing .  i had never experienced anything like it .   finally  my companion rose and without saying anything asked the question as to whether we ought to go now .  reluctantly  and without saying anything  i answered that we might .   out we went .  we were a quarter mile away before i dared speak .   how did you find the quiet place .   i asked .    accident at first .  since then  i ve gone back half a dozen times at least .  i love it .  it s somewhere out of reach of all the trails and  as far as i know  it s not on any of the hotel maps and it s just a hidden undiscovered nook  known only to me  i think     and now you .     thanks for showing me .  really   i said  with infinite gratitude .   you wouldn t think there would be a spot untrodden by human feet in a place like this .     why not .   said dark horse .   i imagine that all over the world there are little areas undisturbed by humanity  sometimes in places that are very busy and crowded overall .  there are fewer than there used to be  i m sure  and perhaps someday they ll be all gone     but not yet  not yet .    he led me back to one of the main trails without hesitation .  we scrambled over rocks and roots and through the underbrush again  and to me it seemed it was uphill both ways     but he got us back .  i said good bye and thanked him again and we shook hands .  i went back to the room  got cleaned up  and was eventually ready for dinner .   i didn t see him at dinner  though i looked  and  in fact  i didn t see him again during the remainder of the stay .  to put it baldly  i have never seen him again from that day to this .   the day after he had taken me to the quiet place  i tried to return on my own .  i took a book with me and some sandwiches i had begged at the kitchen  and it was my intention to stay there most of the day if the weather held  but of course i never made it .  i had no luck at all .  i was wrong from the first turning  i believe .   i didn t give up  though .  after i returned to the city  i kept dreaming of the quiet place and as soon as i could manage  i returned to the resort  studied the map  and marked off the area that i felt must contain it .  i could make my way to the gazebo where i met dark horse and  from there  i set about a systematic course of exploration .   it did me no good whatever .  i could never find the place .  no matter how i tried to remember the twists and turns  no matter how i kidded myself into believing i recognized one of those blasted trees or rocks  no matter what bogs i slogged through  what crags i stumbled over  i ended up nowhere .  i had bites  and scratches  and bruises  and contusions  and sprains .  what i didn t have was the place .   i think it s become an obsession with me .  i happened to know that passage of  the lost chord  and i suppose i began to hear it go through my head with appropriate changes in words   i have sought  but i seek it vainly  that one lost place divine  from which came the spirit of silence that entered into me .    and i suppose i hum it when things grow loud and chaotic      there was a pronounced pause when jarvik concluded .   finally  halsted said   i suppose you simply need this fellow who took you there to take you there again so that you can mark off each twist and turn on the map as best you can .    gonzalo said hesitantly   i suppose the fellow really existed .  you didn t dream it  did you .    jarvik frowned .   believe me  i didn t dream it .  and he wasn t an elf leading me into fairyland  either .  it happened exactly as i told you .  the problem is that he had a precise sense of direction and i have none at all .     then you ought to find him   said rubin flatly   if you re that stuck on being in the middle of nowhere .     fine   said jarvik .   i agree .  i ought to find him .  now tell me how .  i didn t know his room number .  i didn t know his name .  it didn t occur to me to try to identify him at the front desk that evening or the next day .    he shook his head and seemed to debate with himself whether to go on or not .  then he shrugged and said   i might as well tell you how obsessed i ve become .  the last time i was at the resort  i spent half the day with the various desk employees trying to get a list of the people who had been at the hotel the day on which i was taken to the quiet place .    it took a lot of negotiating and a lot of scurrying through records  and then they were kind enough to make me up an alphabetized list containing two hundred forty nine names .  they did it for me because i was a regular customer and because i spread fifty dollars among them .    they didn t include addresses because they said that was against policy and if they were caught doing that they would be fired and blacklisted and who knows what else .  i had to make do with the list of names .  i made one last effort to find the place the next day     and failed  of course  and then spent the remainder of the stay studying the list of names .    and you know  i ve memorized them .  not on purpose  of course .  i just memorized them .  i can rattle them off in the alphabetical order in which they were arranged .  i happen to have one of those memories .   he brooded a little .   if my sense of direction were as good as my memory for trivial items on a list     that is  if my sense of observation could give me small variations i could then remember     i suppose i wouldn t be in the fix i am now .    drake said  frowning through the smoke of his cigarette   how would the list of names help you .    jarvik said   the first thing that occurred to me was that the false name he used must have some reason behind it .  why would anyone call himself dark horse .  possibly because the initials were the same as those of his real name .  so i went through the list and there was only one d . h .  and the name was dora harboard .  well  whatever my friend was  he was not a woman  so that was out .    then i thought that perhaps the initials were reversed .  so i looked for an h . d .  and there was none .  then i looked for unattached males .  a great many people were listed as  let us say  ira and hortense abel  to take the first names on the list .  it seemed to me i ought to eliminate them  especially if they had children with them .  that left me with seventeen unattached males and at first i thought that that was a big advancement .    but then i realized that dark horse gave me no indication that he was unattached .  he might well have had a wife and child back in his room  or out attending the mah jongg game that was being played in the lounge that afternoon .    trumbull said   you could try force majeure .  follow up every male name on the list and see if one of them is dark horse .  who knows  you may strike it lucky the first name you try .  and you know he lives in manhattan .  he said so .  try the phone book to begin with .    jarvik said   one of the people listed is s .  smith .  i dread the thought of how many smiths there are in the phone book with s as the first initial .  besides  if i recall correctly  he said that whatever he was officially was back in manhattan .  it seems to me that meant he worked in manhattan but not necessarily that he lived there .  he could live in any of the five boroughs  or in new jersey  or connecticut  or westchester .    listen  i ve thought of force majeure .  just to show you  i thought that i might hire someone at some small nearby airfield to fly me over the resort so that i could see the spot from above  but i know i wouldn t recognize it .  not from above  in a hurried pass .  and even if i did  they d have to land me back at the airport and if i then tried to reach the quiet place from the ground i d fail again .    then i thought that perhaps i could hire a helicopter and if i recognized the spot  i could have myself lowered by some sort of rope while the helicopter hovered overhead .  that s ridiculous  though .  i wouldn t have the nerve to dangle from a helicopter even if i recognized the place  and then  after i left it  what if i still couldn t find my way back .  i couldn t very well use a helicopter every time  could i .    gonzalo said   dark horse .  isn t that a racing term .     originally  yes   said avalon .   it refers to some horse of unknown potential that might have an outside chance to win  especially if it enters a race in which all the other horses are known quantities .     why dark horse  then .   said halsted .    i presume   said avalon   as an indication of how minimal the information is .  after all  most horses are dark in coloring .  besides   dark  gives the impression of mystery  of the unknown .     well   said gonzalo   perhaps this fellow has some connection with the racing game .    jarvik said bitterly   fine .  suppose he does .  how does that help me find him .     besides   said trumbull   it seems to me that  dark horse  has spread out to mean anyone who enters a contest without being a known item .  in boxing  tennis  in politics  even .     and how does that help me find him .   said jarvik .   avalon sighed heavily and said   mr .  jarvik  why don t we look at  the lost chord  from another angle .  roger halsted pointed out that a complex organ might have many  many varieties of chords and that one chord could be easily lost among the quantity .  but that is surely a way of looking at it that is rather too simplistic .    any sensation consists of the sensation itself  objectively  and of the person receiving the sensation  subjectively .  the same chord is always the same chord if it is measured by an instrument that analyzes its wave function .  however  the chord one hears may well vary with the mood and immediate circumstances of the listener .    the person playing the organ in the poem was  weary and ill at ease .   for that reason  the chord had a particular effect on him .   it quieted pain and sorrow  which he may have been feeling .  from then on  when he sought the chord again  his mood would be one of anxious expectation  of careful attention .  even if he heard the same chord again  the same chord precisely  it would not strike him in the same way and he would not consider it to be the same chord .  no wonder he sought it vainly .  he was seeking to duplicate not only the chord but himself as he had been .    jarvik said   you are saying .     i am saying  mr .  jarvik   said avalon   that perhaps you ought to attach less importance to the place .  you found it on a perfect day .  you found it when someone else was guiding you there so that you were  in a sense  carefree .  if you find it again a second time  it may be on a less desirable day     when it is hotter  or colder  or cloudier .  you yourself will be seeking anxiously  you will not be at ease .  the result is that it may not be the same place you remember .  you will be bitterly disappointed .  would it not be better to remain with the memory and let it go at that .    jarvik s head bent  and for a few moments he seemed lost in thought .  then he said   thank you  mr .  avalon .  i think you re right .  if i fail to find the place  i will certainly try to follow your advice and find solace in it .  however     i would like  if i can  to find it once more  just to make sure .  after all  dark horse found it a number of times  and enjoyed it each time .     dark horse knew how to get there   said avalon .   his own mood was fairly constant  and it might be he always chose days of particularly favorable weather to go there .     even so   said jarvik stubbornly   i would like to find it once more  if there were only a way of finding it .     but apparently there isn t   said avalon .   you must admit that .     i don t know   said mario .   no one has asked henry .     in this case   said avalon stubbornly   even henry can do nothing .  there is nothing to seize on .     what have we to lose .   demanded mario .   henry  what can you tell us .    jarvik  who had been listening in astonishment  now turned to rubin and  jerking his thumb over his shoulder  mouthed silently  the waiter .   rubin put a finger to his lips and shook his head slightly .   henry  who had been listening with absorption  said   i must say that i agree fully with mr .  avalon with respect to the subjective nature of the charms of the place and would hate to have mr .  jarvik spoil an idyllic memory .  nevertheless        aha   said gonzalo .   go on  henry .    henry smiled in his avuncular fashion and said   nevertheless  the one thing to seize upon is the phrase  dark horse   which everyone has been seizing upon  as it happens .  may i ask  mr .  jarvik  if  by any chance  there was anyone on the list named polk     not a very common name .  a james polk  perhaps .    jarvik s eyes opened wide .   you re kidding .     not at all .  may i take it there was such a name .     there s a j .  polk  certainly .  it could be james .     then perhaps that is your man .     but why .     mr .  trumbull mentioned  i believe  that  dark horse  is used in politics .  that  i suspect  is its most common use these days .  a dark horse is some politician who is never thought of in connection with nomination by a major party  but who is nevertheless nominated as a way of breaking what otherwise seems an intransigent deadlock .  nowadays  dark horses rarely show up because the nomination is decided by primary contests .  however  as recently as       wendell willkie was a dark horse named by the republican party .    however  the name is most often used in american history for the very first party nominee who was a dark horse .  in       the democrats were all set to nominate ex president martin van buren  but he needed a two thirds majority and intransigent southern opposition prevented that .  out of sheer weariness  the convention switched to tennessee s senator james knox polk  whom no one had thought of in connection with the nomination .  he was the first dark horse candidate  and went on to win the election .  he made a pretty good one term president .     he s right   said rubin .   you do know everything  henry .     no  mr .  rubin   said henry   but i had a dim memory of it and while the discussion was going on  i checked our reference shelf .  it may be that the j .  polk on mr .  jarvik s list is a lineal or collateral descendant  which is why he took the name of dark horse .     amazing   muttered jarvik .    however   said henry   you may still have trouble finding him  mr .  jarvik  and even if you find him  he may still be the wrong person  and even if he is the right person  you may still end up disappointed in the quiet place .  however     may good luck be with you .    afterword  my dear wife  janet  and i have as our favorite resort mohonk mountain house  which is located about ninety two miles from our home  in new paltz  new york .  it has wide acres through which we can wander .  janet does so because she loves to be in the wilderness  and i do so because i love to be with janet .   and one time we found a place where we appeared to be thoroughly isolated and where  it seemed for a few magic minutes  humanity had not yet been invented .   but there s the difference between janet and myself .  janet loved that place and those moments for itself and themselves alone  with a pure and holy love that lacked all alloy .  i  on the other hand  thought   i ll bet i can make a black widowers out of this .       and i did  and you ve just read it .   this story first appeared in the march      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   the four leaf clover  considering the circumstances  it might have been predicted that when the black widowers met at the milano restaurant for their monthly banquet  the sole topic of conversation would be the iran contra hearings .   each of the black widowers had something to say  one about oliver north s hurt little boy look and his appeal to middle aged women  another of john poindexter s sievelike memory .  james drake  who was host of the banquet  pointed out that  between them  north and poindexter had badly tarnished the reagan presidency  something all the democrats in combination had failed to as much as scratch .  why  then  he wanted to know  was the republican right making heroes out of that laurel and hardy team .   it was emmanuel rubin who  not unexpectedly  brought the discussion down to the matter of hostages and principle .    the thing is   he said   how does one deal with loss of life  or potential loss of life  or even just a matter of imprisonment .  must the national interest come second to the rescue of hostages .  if that is the case  how would we ever dare carry out any armed strike .  in any such move  even one as simple and safe as attacking the mighty army of grenada  or bombing the mighty fortress of tripoli  we suffer casualties and run the risk of having prisoners taken .    geoffrey avalon  staring down at rubin s sixty four inches from the height of his own seventy four  said   you re talking military action .  the hostages are civilians  pursuing a peaceful life  taken without cause by gangsters and thugs .  wouldn t you pay any price and abandon any principle to gain the freedom of someone you loved .  wouldn t you pay a ransom to kidnappers if that would keep them from killing your wife .     yes  of course  i would   said rubin  his eyes flashing through his thick spectacles .   i would  as an individual .  but would i expect two hundred and thirty million americans to suffer a weakening of the national interest because i am suffering .  not even an american president has the right to do that  and that was reagan s mistake .  and don t think that hostage taking is an aberration of peace .  it isn t .  we re at war with terrorism and the hostages are prisoners of war .  we wouldn t think of giving an enemy arms to buy back our prisoners of war .  it would have been treason to do that in any other war we ve fought .     terrorism isn t like any other war   growled thomas trumbull   and you can t make a point by point analogy .     actually   said roger halsted   all this talk about national interest is irrelevant .  surely  terrorism is a global problem which will yield only to global action .    mario gonzalo said   oh  sure .  global .  how do you manage a global solution when each nation is willing to make a deal with the terrorists  hoping that it will be left alone and to hell with its neighbors .     that s what s got to stop   said halsted earnestly .   trying to buy off the terrorists only points out to them how they might make a profit .  if hostages sell at a premium  they will take more hostages whenever they run short of funds .     of course  and our proper answer to the taking of hostages is making the procedure expensive for the hostage takers .  you inflict casualties on them   said gonzalo .    provided you know who the enemy is   protested avalon .   you can t simply kill people at random .     why not .  we do that in every war .  when we bombed german and japanese cities during world war ii  didn t we know that uncounted thousands of totally innocent people would be killed  including babies .  did we think our bombs were selective enough to kill only villains .     all of germany and japan was fighting us  even if only by passively supporting the german and japanese governments   said avalon .    and do you think that terrorism can survive without at least the passive approval or acquiescence of the society in which it exists .   demanded rubin .   at that point  james drake  who had been listening to the exchange with manifest unease  said   gentlemen  my guest is coming up the stairs .  could we suspend the argument for now  and not return to it  either .  please .   he then said hurriedly   henry  my guest isn t a drinker .  would you get him a large diet cola .  not much ice .    henry  the perennial waiter at the black widower banquets  nodded his head slightly just as the guest entered the banquet room .   he was a tall man  darkly tanned  with a large curved nose  and blue eyes that stood out startlingly against his dark coloring .  his hair  still copious  was graying and he looked fiftyish .    sorry i m late  jim   he said  grasping drake s hand .   the train did not feel at all bound by the timetable .     not too late  sandy   said drake .   let me introduce you to the black widowers .  this is alexander mountjoy  gentlemen .    one by one  the black widowers advanced to shake his hand .  last came henry with his tall drink .  mountjoy sniffed at it  then grinned .   you warned the waiter  i see .    drake nodded .   and i should add that our waiter is henry  and that he is a particularly valued member of our club .    the dinner was a hearty one .  melon  followed by a thick vegetable soup  a prime rib roast with baked potato and broccoli  and apple pie with cheese for dessert .   rubin  having abandoned topical references  chose to point out charles dickens s contribution to the evolution of the modern detective story with a stern disquisition on bleak house  which only he  of those at the table  had read .  drake  who was quite openly relieved at this new direction of the conversation  pointed out that dickens s detective had come a generation after edgar allan poe and that  if rubin s descriptions were correct  dickens had not at all benefited by poe s work .   this elicited only a snarl of contempt from rubin  who turned to wilkie collins and emile gaboriau .  at a crucial moment  drake mentioned arthur conan doyle  at which point mountjoy plunged in joyously and conversation grew general .   over the coffee  drake gave his water glass its ritual tinkle and said   manny has done his whole evening s share of talking by now  so if you don t mind  mario  you take over the grilling .  i know i can rely on you to keep manny quiet .    gonzalo adjusted his jacket with its subdued green stripe  made sure his tie was seated properly  sat back  and said   just how do you justify your existence  mr .  mountjoy .    mountjoy looked satisfyingly replete as he watched henry pour the brandy  and said   i m a sherlock holmes enthusiast and a member of the baker street irregulars  which should be justification enough for this crowd  eh .    gonzalo said   i don t know about that .  actually  manny is the only one really interested in mysteries because he writes them  or does something he calls writing them  and makes a living of sorts out of it .   he raised his hand  palm held imperiously in the direction of rubin  who shifted in his seat and gave all the signs of wanting to burst into speech .   try something else .     in that case   said mountjoy   i might mention that i m a college president  but i don t know if any perceptible fraction of the world s population would consider that as justifying my existence .     we are all academic personalities  one way or another   said avalon   and we might be willing to consider the matter moot .    mountjoy grinned .   if college has taught you to speak in that fashion  that s a black mark against me .    gonzalo said  with clear disappointment   a college president .  is that all .    mountjoy s eyebrows went up .   well  the post may not justify my existence  but i would scarcely think of it as trivial .  dealing with students and faculty and trustees and potential donors and the general public is quite a bit more than enough .  what do you mean   is that all  .    gonzalo said   i mean do you work for the government in any way .     no  i m spared that .     you haven t been involved in any government investigations .     no  of course not .     well  then   said gonzalo   why is it that drake asked us not to discuss the matter of hostages in front of you .     oh  for god s sake   exploded drake .   if i asked you not to  why do you bring the matter up .    it was impossible for mountjoy to turn pale  but he took on a rigid look and said angrily   jim .    drake shook his head .   i m sorry  sandy .  the conversation was on hostages before you came .  it was bound to be  considering what the nation has been going through .  but i did ask them to drop it .     and i want to know why   said gonzalo stubbornly .    i can t say why   said drake .   but i put the matter out of bounds .  as host        even as host you can t do that   said gonzalo .   the whole point of the club dinners is that there are no holds barred at the grilling .  even the host can t limit the matter .  it s     it s unconstitutional .    avalon  turning the brandy glass in his hand  said thoughtfully   mario has a point there .      mr .  mountjoy  may i assure you that nothing said within these walls is ever repeated outside them .  the habit of confidentiality is strong and it includes our excellent waiter  henry .  does that help .     no  it doesn t   said mountjoy .   i have no secrets  but the government does .  i am fully satisfied of the honor and honesty of every person here  but the government is not satisfied as easily as i am .     you said you don t work for the government   said gonzalo .    nor do i  but i have managed to get entangled with it just the same  and through no deliberate desire of my own .    thomas trumbull said gently   i am employed by the government and i have been entrusted with secrets in my time .  i vouch for these gentlemen  too .  it would have been more convenient all around if we had avoided this matter  but in a free for all grilling it would have arisen sooner or later  and perhaps it would have been better if jim had brought you as guest at another time .  but here you are  and mario s question puts us face to face with it .  if you feel you cannot discuss the matter  then the rules of the club put an end to the dinner  which we would all regret .  is there anything you can tell us .  if we decide that it would count as a satisfactory answer to the question we can drop the matter and go on to other subjects .     the question is this   said gonzalo .   why can t we discuss the matter of hostages in front of you .  that s just to remind you .    mountjoy thought for a while  head bent  chin touching his chest .  when he looked up  his eyes were friendly and his appearance seemed normal .    i ll tell you this much  if you ll be kind enough not to ask me names and places and details  which i am not allowed to give you  in any case .  i told you i was president of a college .  well  some members of the faculty were kidnapped some months ago by terrorists .     but there s no secret to that   broke in rubin .   it was in all the papers .  obviously  you re president of the        please .   said mountjoy .   i don t care how certain you are that you know the details of the case .  please realize you may not have them all and that i can t confirm or deny anything .  just listen to what i say .  some faculty members were kidnapped .  they are held as hostages .  one hostage who was being held  and i am specifically refraining from saying whether he was one of the faculty members or not  was killed .  presumably  he was tortured first .    now  then  the subject of hostages is bothersome to me personally since the hostages are known to me  and it is bothersome to me officially since i have been extensively interviewed by government agencies on various aspects of the event .  does that satisfy you  gentlemen .  can we go on to other matters .     no   said gonzalo .   why were you extensively interviewed .  what had you to do with it .     with the hostage taking .  absolutely nothing .     with anything at all .  you said you were interviewed on various aspects of the event .  what aspects .  why limit it to hostage taking .     i don t know what you mean .     what s so hard about the question .  i mean why were you extensively interviewed .  if not about the hostage taking  then about what .     i can t answer that question .     then i m not satisfied .    drake said   come on  mario .  don t be a pigheaded fool .     i m not being pigheaded .  i have an idea .  there s something involved besides the hostage taking .  mountjoy said the interviews had nothing to do with that  but covered various aspects of the matter .  that means aspects besides the hostage taking .  i think there must be some sort of unfinished business in all of this or it wouldn t be so hush hush .  i ll bet there s a problem here of some kind  some puzzle  some mystery .  how about it  mr .  mountjoy .     i have nothing to say on the matter   said mountjoy woodenly .    it so happens   said gonzalo   that this club has solved a number of puzzles in the past .  we could help you now .    mountjoy looked toward drake questioningly .   drake smashed his cigarette to death and said   that s true enough  but we can t guarantee we can solve any particular mystery .    mountjoy muttered   i wish you could solve this one .     ah   said gonzalo   then there is one .      hey  tom  tell him we can help out  and tell him we can be trusted to the death .    trumbull said   i ve already told him we can all be trusted .      if there s a problem  mountjoy  and if you re in trouble over it  then mario is right .  maybe we can help .    mountjoy said   well  let s see what i can tell you .    he stared at the black widowers  who  in turn  remained silent .  indeed  they scarcely moved .   finally  mountjoy said   the hostage who was killed was not exactly innocent  at least in the eyes of the terrorists .  usually  the hostages that are taken are simply newsmen  or businessmen  or professors     people whose only value to the terrorists is as pawns .  they were handy and the american government and people want them back so they are bargaining points .    the hostage who was killed     and i can t name him or tell you anything about him     was working for the government  and to the terrorists he could be considered a spy or a secret agent or something like that .  they killed him  either because they considered that a just punishment for his crime of being on the other side  or they did so accidentally in the process of torturing him in order to elicit information .    the question is  how did they know he was worth torturing .  they don t torture all their hostages as a matter of course .  in fact  they treat them as well as they reasonably can  for a dead hostage has no value to them  and in fact any hostage that is in anything but good condition merely inflames american public opinion and may encourage the united states to more violent reprisals  something for which they are obviously not eager .    the feeling is that someone fingered him .  in short  a traitor of some sort is involved .  the dead hostage had confided his true role to someone for some reason  or let it slip inadvertently  and that someone betrayed him .  the question  of course  is who .  naturally  the government wants to know  not simply in order to avenge the death by punishing the traitor  but because if the traitor is left at large  he is in a position in which his treason can continue  you understand .    i come into it because the circumstances of the kidnapping of the faculty members     those particular ones and no others     make it seem clear that the traitor is also a member of the faculty .  there is good reasoning behind that  but i can t pass it on to you .  i simply say that that is the conclusion     that we have a traitor on the faculty .    i was interviewed extensively on the matter  and so were others  and it seems that the conclusion come to is that the traitor is one of four members of the faculty  but which of the four     ah  that s the rub .    rubin said   the only safe thing to do is to remove all four from their posts  put them where they can do no harm  and keep them all under surveillance while you continue the investigation .     and that has been done   said mountjoy   but does it occur to you that a great deal of unjustified harm is being done to three innocent people who are loyal americans and do not deserve such treatment .     casualties of war   said rubin .   halsted said   you re being very callous tonight  mannie .  are you having trouble with your current novel .     that has nothing to do with it   said rubin .   i say what i think .     well  what i think   said mountjoy   is that it is much more important to absolve the three innocents than to catch the guilty .  and there s a way of doing it if only we were clever enough .  we assume  for instance  that the dead hostage knew who the traitor was .  he would know  after all  to whom he had confided  or let slip  the matter .  now  then  he was forced to write a letter which the kidnappers then released .  you know the kind .    the black widowers nodded  and halsted said   the hostage admits he s a member of the cia and that he spied on the poor mistreated groups to which the kidnappers belong .  he goes on to confess to all sorts of other misdemeanors and then denounces the american government for not giving in to the simple demands of the captors so that he might be released .     exactly   said mountjoy .   exactly .  by then  he had undoubtedly been subject to some torture  so that they wouldn t release a photograph of him as they did in the case of other hostages .  even so  he might not have consented to sign that letter     and it was definitely his signature     were it not that the hostage we re speaking of was hoping to give us information under the nose of his captors .  he added at the end of the letter that he hoped he would be lucky enough to have the government arrange his release and drew a four leaf clover at the end .  very carefully drawn .  it was some time after that that he was killed .    avalon said   do you think the four leaf clover had anything to do with that  mr .  mountjoy .     the government thinks so .  he had to choose some sign that would indicate the traitor  yet do so in a sufficiently subtle manner to escape the kidnappers .  unfortunately  it was sufficiently subtle to escape us as well .  the government has not been able to work out the significance of the four leaf clover .  however  it may be that the traitor did     that the traitor saw the letter reproduced on television and realized that the four leaf clover was pointing straight at him .  he managed to get a message to the kidnappers  who then tortured their victim further and killed him .     well   said avalon   a four leaf clover is a well known symbol of good luck .  might it not be that the poor hostage really wanted to have the good luck of being freed and drew a four leaf clover as a piece of sympathetic magic .     it s possible   said mountjoy .   anything is possible .  the government doesn t give that credence  however .  the hostage was an outspoken rationalist  utterly contemptuous of anything that smacked of mysticism or superstition .  the people who knew him best say that it is unthinkable that he would draw a four leaf clover in the expectation of deriving good luck from it .     desperation will have people clutching at straws   muttered avalon .   trumbull said   it s an irish symbol .  are any of the four suspects irish  or of irish descent .  the traitor could be a member of the irish republican army and be sympathetic to other struggling underground groups .    mountjoy shook his head violently .   in the first place  the four leaf clover is not an irish symbol .  the three leaf clover is .  it was plucked up by saint patrick  according to legend  to explain to an irish king how the trinity could exist     one god in three personifications .  the irish king was converted and the three leaf clover became the shamrock .  and in any case  none of the four suspects are in any way irish .    trumbull said   what can you tell us about the four suspects  then .  we can t figure out at whom the four leaf clover is pointing if we know nothing about them .     i can t help that   said mountjoy despairingly .   i can t give you their names or tell you who they are .     can you give us their fields of specialty .   asked avalon .    i m not sure .      maybe i can take the chance .   mountjoy held up his fingers one by one   one is a historian  one is an entomologist  one is an astronomer  and one is a mathematician .  does that help .  it didn t help us .    halsted said   are you sure what he drew was a four leaf clover .     well  of course it was .  what else could it be .    halsted shrugged .   i don t know .  i didn t see it .  but it was something with four things sticking out of it .  right .     yes .     then could he have been trying to draw a star .  a point with rays of light coming from it .  that might indicate the astronomer .    mountjoy shook his head .   it might be the astronomer  for all i know  but not for that reason .  he didn t draw radiating lines  he drew four recognizable clover leaves .  the drawing also had a stem .  stars wouldn t have stems .    drake said   what kind of mathematician is the mathematician .    mountjoy said   i couldn t tell you .  i m in political science myself and all the mathematics i know barely suffices to enable me to balance my checkbook .     could he have done papers on probability .     i suppose i could find out  but i don t know it off the cuff .     because the thing about four leaf clovers is that they are rare .  i don t know what the chances are of finding one if you look through clover patches at random  but it must be very small .  when i was a youngster  i remember lying down in a field of clover and spending hours going over them one by one .  i never found a four leaf clover .  so to find one is remarkable and it s the sort of thing that might interest a mathematician who specializes in probability .    halsted  who was himself a mathematician  said   that doesn t sound likely at all .  what kind of a historian was the historian .     ah   said mountjoy .   that i can tell you .  he wrote a rather well known book entitled     well  no  obviously i can t tell you that .  it would identify him .  let s say   he added feebly   that he s a medievalist .     he specializes in medieval history .     yes .  byzantine empire .  fatimids .  things like that .     anything to do with four leaf clovers .     not that i know of .     and what about the entomologist  who obviously studies insects .     yes .     what kind of insects .  bees .    gonzalo put in   why bees  roger .     why not .  bees fly from clover blossom to clover blossom collecting honey and spreading pollen .  don t you know emily dickinson s quatrain   the pedigree of honey   does not concern the bee .    a clover any time to him   is aristocracy  .  well  then  a four leaf clover might easily signify a bee  which would signify our entomologist .    avalon said   why a four leaf clover in that case .  a three leaf clover would do as well and would be simpler to draw .    mountjoy said   it doesn t matter which .  the entomologist didn t work with bees .  he worked with smaller bugs and i couldn t even give you the name .  he told me once and i thought it sounded as though it came straight out of shakespeare s a comedy of errors  but i couldn t repeat it .     well   said rubin   where does it put us .  the four leaf clover doesn t point to anyone .  frankly  i find myself looking with favor on jeff s original idea that it was just a good luck symbol and nothing more .  the poor guy needed luck and didn t have it .     poor guy .   said halsted .   just a casualty of war  manny .    rubin looked annoyed .   i was just speaking theoretically .  when we get down to individuals  i m not any more callous than the rest of you  and you know it .    drake said   well  we chivied and tortured poor sandy into telling us more than he should have  probably  and putting him under the nervous tension of fearing the government may somehow find out he did  and we haven t been able to help him at all .      i m sorry  sandy .     hold on   said gonzalo  teetering his chair back on two legs .   we re not through yet .  i notice that henry is poking his way through the reference shelf .     oh  really   said trumbull .   we ll ask him just as soon as he gets back .     whom are we talking about .   said mountjoy  frowning .   the waiter .     we re talking about henry .  the best of the black widowers .    henry returned and resumed his usual place by the service table .   gonzalo said   well  henry  can you help us .     i have had a thought  mr .  gonzalo  concerning four leaf clovers .     tell us .     clovers almost always have three leaves .  occasionally  a clover grows from a seed that is slightly abnormal and it develops four leaves in consequence .  such a sudden change between parent and offspring is called a mutation   said henry politely .    so it is   said halsted .    mutations take place now and then in all species .  you can get a white blackbird  or a two headed calf  or a baby with six fingers .  i daresay the list is endless .     probably   murmured avalon .    for the most part  mutations are unfavorable and are viewed as deformities and monstrous distortions .  the four leaf clover is an example of a mutation  however  that not only does not strike people as a deformity but is valued and treasured by them     by almost all of them     as something very desirable  as a symbol and bringer of good luck .  that makes it very unusual as a mutation and it is one mutation that can be easily drawn without repelling people and can be made to seem as nothing more than a natural way of calling down good fortune .  it can therefore symbolize the idea of mutation unmistakably and yet escape detection by people without a certain degree of education .  however  to those who know the hostage s strong rationality  they would     or should     dismiss the good luck and cling to the symbolization of a mutation .     where does all that get us  henry .   asked trumbull .    to change the subject slightly  mr .  mountjoy mentioned shakespeare s a comedy of errors .  there are two characters in it named antipholus .  they are twin brothers  one from the city of syracuse in sicily and one from ephesus in asia minor .  does the name antipholus bring anything to your mind  mr .  mountjoy .     yes   said mountjoy .   the insects the entomologist was working with .  i still can t give you the exact name  though .     was it drosophila .     yes .  by god  yes .     it is more commonly known as the fruit fly and it is the classic insect used for the study of mutations .  it seems to me  then  that the four leaf clover may have been drawn to signify mutations and that that was meant to point rather precisely to the entomologist as the traitor .  at least  it seems so to me .     heavens .   said mountjoy .   it seems so to me  too .      i ll get in touch with     with some people in washington first thing in the morning and suggest it .  drosophila .  drosophila .  i ll have to remember the name .     fruit fly will be sufficient  sir   said henry   and if the suggestion is accepted  i would suggest you allow it to remain understood that it occurred to you quite independently .  no need to admit you spoke of the matter to the black widowers .    afterword  sometimes  if i feel really lazy  i think of some one thing and see if i can t build a story around it .  thus  i was in a grassy place at mohonk  see the previous afterword  and i noted that it was rich in three leaf clovers .  as is my wont  i looked about to see if there was a four leaf clover and after about two and a half seconds i decided there wasn t .   i have never found a four leaf clover in my life  but i have had enough good luck even without it .    so i thought  let s write a story about a four leaf clover  and i did .   this time  though  eleanor sullivan  the beautiful editor of ellery queen s mystery magazine  turned it down .  she thought the point of the story was sufficiently arcane to be unfair to the reader .  i didn t agree  i never agree with a rejection  but the editor s word is law  and i present the story here as the second in this collection to make its first time appearance .   the envelope  emmanuel rubin arrived at the black widowers banquet in a foul mood .  this was not much worse than his usual attitude  to be sure  but his eyes  magnified behind the thick lenses of his spectacles  flashed dangerously .    uh oh   said mario gonzalo  host of the occasion   someone has received a well deserved rejection .     i have not received a rejection   snapped rubin   well deserved or otherwise .  it s much worse than that .    geoffrey avalon stared down from his seventy four inch height at the diminutive rubin and said in his stately baritone   much worse than a rejection .  for a free lance writer like you  manny .  come now .     listen   said rubin furiously   i walked into the local post office this morning and asked for a roll of twenty five cent stamps .  that irks me to begin with .  i can remember when it cost two cents to mail a letter  but the price keeps going up and up without seeming to affect the eternal deficit        at least   said roger halsted   the service gets worse to balance the increase in rates .     you say that because you think it s funny  roger   said rubin   but you happen to be dead right .      thank you  henry .    henry  the unsurpassable waiter of the black widower banquets  recognizing the demands being made on rubin by his passion  had brought him a refill of his drink .   james drake  lighting his perennial cigarette  said   i remember when stamps were two cents  too  and the morning newspaper was two cents  and a pack of cigarettes was thirteen cents     and my weekly salary was fifteen dollars .  so what .     i haven t finished   said rubin .   so i asked for a roll of twenty five cent stamps and the confounded idiot at the window looked me right in the eye and said   we don t have any .   i was stunned .  it was a post office  damn it .  i said   why not .   and he just shrugged and shouted   next .   i mean  no sign of regret or embarrassment .  they might have put up a sign to say the rolls were temporarily out .  i had to wait half an hour in line to be told i couldn t have one .    gonzalo said   suppose we cool you down to your usual state of semi sanity  manny  so that i can introduce my guest     francis macshannon .  he s a good friend of mine .    rubin shook hands loftily .   any good friend of mario s  mr .  macshannon  is highly suspect in my eyes .     which is what you d expect   said gonzalo   from someone who falls into a tirade over a roll of twenty five cent stamps .      i ll give you a few to tide you over  manny .  no charge .     no  thanks   said rubin .   i got my roll later in the day .  it s a matter of principle .     i apologize for manny s dubious principles  frank   said gonzalo .   he makes one up whenever he can t get his way .    francis macshannon laughed .  he appeared sixtyish  with a round and jolly face above a short  plump body .  he had a ruddy complexion and a gray chin beard  giving him the appearance of a semi shaven santa claus .    i m on your side  mr .  rubin   he said in a high pitched voice that rather spoiled the santa claus image .   i have complaints about the post office  too .     doesn t everyone   growled thomas trumbull  who had arrived a moment before and who had seized upon the scotch and soda that henry held out for him .   there was a pause while macshannon was introduced to the final newcomer  and then he said   my own complaint is with the matter of postmarks .  nowadays  they are only dirty smudges  but when i was young  post marks were legible and beautifully clear .  they were geography lessons .  in fact  i built up a huge collection of postmarks .    avalon s formidable eyebrows raised .   how does one do that  mr .  macshannon .     to begin with  my parents gave me the envelopes they received in the mail .  so did the neighbors up and down the street  once they learned how serious i was about it .  the best part of it  though  was finding discarded envelopes in the street  in backyards  under bushes .  you d be surprised how many envelopes it was possible to find .  each new postmark i had never before encountered was a treasure and i d look it up carefully in the atlas .  i made lists of them by states and nations and pasted the envelopes into notebooks in organized fashion .  i became an aficionado of envelopes such as you could scarcely imagine .  in fact  it was my interest in envelopes that led to my       it was at this point that henry s softly authoritative voice said   dinner is served  gentlemen .    they sat down to their melon prosciutto  followed by cream of asparagus soup and a mixed green salad .  the conversation dealt with the new russian probe designed to study the martian satellite  phobos  and over the roast capon  the discussion grew heated over whether a joint soviet american mars expedition was desirable or not .  the post office and its manifold sins dwindled and vanished in the fire of the new controversy .  down went the chocolate almond pie and the coffee and  over the brandy  gonzalo called for the grilling .    manny   he said   you be the griller  and i invoke host s privilege and tell you that the subject of the post office must not be mentioned .    rubin scowled and said   mr .  macshannon  how do you justify your existence .    macshannon said amiably   i m a computer programmer and designer .  these days i think that speaks for itself .     maybe   said rubin .   we might get back to that later .  obviously  your present labors have nothing to do with your activities as a child     i mean your postmark collection .  you had said        manny   said gonzalo abruptly   i ruled out the post office .     fire and brimstone   exploded rubin .   who s talking post office .  i m talking postmark collection .  i appeal to the membership .     all right .  go ahead   said gonzalo resignedly .    now  then   said rubin  after an unnecessarily protracted glare at gonzalo   you said that it was your interest in envelopes that led you to your     and then  before you could finish your sentence  you were interrupted by the announcement that dinner was ready .  now  then  i would like to have the sentence finished .  what did your interest in envelopes lead to .    macshannon frowned thoughtfully .   did i say that .   then his brow cleared and a look of almost comic self satisfaction crossed his face .   oh  yes  of course .  back in       it was through my interest in envelopes that i caught a spy .  a real honest to pete spy .     in      .   said avalon  frowning suddenly .   don t tell me you were one of the young men working for senator joseph mccarthy .     who .  me .   said macshannon  clearly astonished at the suggestion .   never .  i never had any use for mccarthy at all .  of course      he pondered the matter a moment   he did make the nation spy conscious and traitor conscious  and that couldn t help but affect me  i suppose .  you couldn t help thinking in that direction even if you disapproved of mccarthy s tactics  as i did .     national paranoia  i call it   said rubin seriously .    maybe   said macshannon   but anyway  whatever you call it  i suppose that that s what put the whole melodrama in my mind .  in a quieter  less frenetic time  i would have seen that envelope and never given it a thought .     tell us about it   said rubin .    certainly  if you wish .  after thirty six years  it can t be sensitive .  besides  i don t know the details  only the general outline .  i was just starting out in the world  had my engineering degree  had a small job  was living by myself for the first time .  i was twenty four years old  though  and still a little uncertain of myself .    there was another person  living across the hall from me     benham was his name .  i don t remember his first name .  he was about thirty  i think  and i would occasionally see him going in or out .  he was a scowler  if you know what i mean  unfriendly  never addressed me .  i said hello once or twice  in passing  but he would give me the curtest possible nod and freeze me with his expression .  i grew to dislike him intensely  of course  and since i was a great reader of thrillers in those days  i fantasized that he was something villainous     a criminal  a hitman  or  best of all  a spy .    then  one day  as we were both waiting for an elevator to take us to our two apartments on the eighth floor  he tore open an envelope he was carrying  which i assumed he had just picked up from his letter box .  i had checked mine earlier and it was empty  as it almost always was in those days  except when my mother wrote me .  i watched my neighbor out of the corner of my eye  partly because i would naturally watch someone i was fantasizing to be a mysterious villain  partly because i envied anyone who got a letter  and even partly because i never quite got over my childhood fascination with envelopes .    having torn open the envelope  he extracted the letter  unfolded it  read it without the slightest expression on his face  then crumpled it and tossed it into the trash basket that stood by the elevators in the hall .  he then  still without expression  placed the empty envelope inside his inner jacket pocket .  he did it very carefully and patted the front of his jacket as though to assure himself it was well seated .    trumbull interrupted .   how did you know it was an empty envelope .  there could have been an enclosure along with the letter .  a check  for instance .    macshannon shook his head amiably .   i told you i had this quasi professional attitude concerning envelopes .  it was a flimsy kind  semi transparent .  he had held it in the hand near me while he scanned the letter and i could tell it was empty .  no mistake was possible .     odd   said halsted .    the odd thing about it   said macshannon   was that at first i didn t think it was odd .  after all  people frequently discard envelopes and keep letters  but i had never seen anyone discard a letter and keep an empty envelope and yet i didn t think it was odd .  i said to myself   gee  he s collecting postmarks   and for a moment i was a ten year old again and remembering the thrill of the chase .  in fact  for a little while i recognized this benham as a fellow postmarker and i could feel myself warming to him .    maybe it was just as well  for if i hadn t had the postmark thought  i might not have kept the envelope in mind .  but as it was  i did keep it in mind  and by the time i reached the eighth floor  i had other thoughts .  as usual  my neighbor had not addressed a word to me  or cast me a glance  and my heart hardened toward him again .  he couldn t be a postmarker  i decided  because postmarks had already deteriorated past the point where collecting could be profitable .  already  one never saw a clear postmark except on the occasional commemorative envelope .    why  then  did he save the envelope .  it took me only ten seconds to convert the matter into a spy thriller and i had it .  he had received a casual  meaningless message anyone could see and dismiss  but the real message was on the envelope where no one would look for it  and which he therefore kept for later study .    by the time i had thought of that  i was in my apartment .  i waited there for about half a minute  then peered out into the hall to make sure my neighbor wasn t lingering there .  he wasn t  so i got back into the elevator  went down to the lobby  and retrieved that crumpled letter .    rubin said   which  i suppose  turned out to be completely uninteresting .     well   said macshannon   at least it seemed to show benham in a more human light .  the letter was in a feminine handwriting  but by no means a cultivated one     a semi legible scrawl .    avalon said with a sigh   that is about the best you can expect in these degenerate days .    macshannon smiled .   i suppose so .  in any case  i studied that letter so closely over the next few days that i still remember it thirty six years later     not that there was much to remember .  it wasn t dated and it just started   dear mr .  benham  i had a very good time and it was kind of you to promise to check the matter of the job opening .  please let me know  and thank you .       i see what you mean   said halsted .   this neighbor might freeze you out  but his female correspondent thought him a kindly man .    trumbull said   many a curmudgeon will unbend to a young woman to achieve the usual end .    macshannon said   i didn t think of anything like that .  all it seemed to me was that the letter seemed totally innocuous  as i had thought it would have to be .  the whole thing about job openings and kindness might just be a matter of writing at random  so to speak .  to me  it meant that the envelope was all the more likely to be the important item .  the question was  what ought i to do about it .  i dithered for several days  and then finally took action .      please remember that i was young and naive in those days  because in the end i went to the local office of the fbi .    drake smiled and fingered the ashtray before him .   you risked making a fool of yourself .     even i knew that much   said macshannon .   in fact  i remember that as i told my story to an apparently politely bored functionary  i felt more and more foolish  as i sounded less and less convincing in my own ears .  i had several things on my side  though .  senator mccarthy had made it impossible for any agent to ignore any tale of spies .  after all  it would be his neck if he let one go that he should not have .     i can see that   said halsted .   an agent dismissing something wrongfully would probably be accused of being a spy himself  or a card carrying member of the communist party .     yes   said macshannon .   the fbi has to investigate anything brought to it even in easygoing times  but at the height of the mccarthy mania     then  too  it turned out that benham  this neighbor of mine  had a post in the infant computer industry and was in a position to know a few things the pentagon distinctly wanted to have kept secret .  in fact  it was my eventual understanding of this that roused my own interest in computers  so that i owe my present career to benham  in a sense .  in any case  i was listened to and the letter was taken from me .  i was given a receipt  even though it wasn t my letter .     it was in your possession   said rubin   and it belonged to you  since its previous owner had thrown it away and abandoned it  making it the property of anyone who picked it up .     in a way   said macshannon   i entered into a distant partnership with the fbi  for i was asked to keep an eye on benham and report anything further i thought unusual or suspicious .  it made a common spy out of me  which  looking back on it  makes me feel a little awkward  but i honestly thought i might be dealing with an enemy agent  and i was a bit of a romantic in those days .     and you might have been infected by the times   said avalon .    i wouldn t be surprised   said macshannon agreeably .   at the time  of course  i didn t know exactly what the fbi was doing  but eventually i became friendly with the agent i had first spoken to  especially as it slowly turned out that benham was indeed more than he seemed  so that the agent couldn t help but think highly of me .    rubin said   then the hidden envelope turned out to be important  i suppose .     let me tell you how things worked out in order   said macshannon .   they investigated the letter i gave them for some sort of code .  what seemed nonsignificant to me might contain a hidden meaning .  they could find none .  nor could they find hidden writing  or anything technically advanced  and that just made my story the more persuasive  since i  of course  had stressed the importance of the envelope from the beginning .    they took to intercepting benham s mail and opening it  reading it  resealing it  and sending it on .  i watched the process on one occasion and it gave me a grisly feeling .  it seemed so un american .  there was no way of telling at the conclusion that the letter had been opened  or in any way tampered with  and i have never been able to trust my own mail entirely since then .  who knows who might be studying it without my knowledge .    rubin said dryly   for that matter  phone calls can be listened to  rooms can be bugged  conversations in the open can be overheard .  we live in a world devoid of privacy .     i m sure you re right   said macshannon .   in any case  they were particularly interested in any letters that benham got from the young woman whose letter i had myself picked up .  these had their own points of interest to a nosybody  for  as i was eventually told by my friend the agent  it was plain that there was a burgeoning love affair going on there .  the letters grew more impassioned and devoted  but the woman s letters  at least  were always scrawled  brief  and continued to show no great intellectual capacity .    drake grinned .   intellectual capacity is not necessarily what a man might be after .    halsted asked   how long did the investigation go on .     months   said macshannon .   it was an on and off affair .     say   said gonzalo   if this was a love affair  the letter might not be significant in any case .  if agents are in the business of collecting and transmitting information  they re not going to fall in love .     why not .   said avalon sententiously .   love comes as it pleases  sometimes to the most unlikely participants in the most unlikely situations .  that s why eros  the god of love  is often pictured as blind .     that s not what i mean   said gonzalo .   of course they can fall in love  but they wouldn t use their official communications  if i may call them that  as a vehicle .  they d make love on their own time  so to speak  in their own way  and leave the important messages alone .    macshannon said   not if the real messages were on the envelope .  the more immaterial the letter itself  the better .  why not carry on a love affair  even a sincere love affair  in the letter itself .  who would think of looking at the envelopes in cases where the letter itself seems so all important to the writer and reader .  if i hadn t seen him save that first envelope        well   said trumbull  a little impatiently   get on with it .  i have some connection with counterintelligence myself and i m sure they investigated the envelopes .     they did  indeed   said macshannon .   every one of them  whether they were from the young lady or not .  at least  the agent told me they did  and i had no reason to think he was lying .  of course  i wondered  at the time if what they were doing was legal .  it seemed un american to me  as i have already said .     undoubtedly it was illegal   said trumbull .   they had no evidence of wrongdoing .  saving an empty envelope may be puzzling  but it is not a crime .  still  national security purifies a multitude of sins and a bit of illegality here and there is winked at .     bad in principle   growled rubin .   a bit of illegality leads to a lot  and in no time we d be at the gestapo level .     we aren t yet   said trumbull   and there s a tight rein placed on these organizations .     yes  when they re caught   said rubin .    and they re caught often enough to be kept within bounds .  come on  manny  let s let macshannon proceed .  you were telling us they inspected the envelopes .     yes  they did   said macshannon .   they removed the stamps to see what might be underneath .  they studied every bit of writing on the envelope to the last detail and they subjected the paper to every known test .  they even substituted new envelopes which they made just like the old except that they made small nonsignificant changes .  they wanted to see if the new envelope had something distorted that would reduce its message to nonsense .    drake said   that s a lot of trouble to take for anything as thin as your story .    you can thank mccarthy   said macshannon briefly .   but they never did find anything either in the letters or on the envelopes .    rubin said   hold on  mr .  macshannon  when you started this story  you said that as a result of your interest in envelopes  you caught an honest to pete spy .  did you or didn t you .     i did   said macshannon urgently   i did .     are you going to tell us   said rubin   that as a result of the investigation  a different person altogether was trapped as the spy .     no  no .  it was benham .  benham .     but you said the letters and the envelopes showed nothing .  you did say that  didn t you .     i didn t quite say they showed nothing  but i did say the fbi found nothing in the correspondence .  however  they didn t confine themselves to that .  they worked at the other end     his job .  they inspected his work record  kept him under hidden surveillance  and eventually found out what he was doing and with whom .  i gathered that quite a substantial spy ring was broken and i got some nice words from the bureau .  nothing official  of course  but it was the big excitement of my life and i owed it all  in a way  to my having collected postmarks as a boy .    there was perhaps less satisfaction on the faces of the assembled black widowers than there was on macshannon s .   avalon said   what about the young woman .  benham s light o  love .  was she picked up  too .    for a moment  macshannon looked uncertain .   i m not dead sure   he said .   i was never told .  my impression at the time was that there was insufficient evidence in her case  since they got nothing out of the letters or envelopes .      but that s the one thing that bothers me .  i got benham because he had saved that envelope .  why couldn t they find anything on the envelopes  then .  if benham and company had some secret communication system that the fbi didn t penetrate  who knows what damage has been done since then by its means .    halsted said   maybe the fbi found nothing on the envelope because there was nothing to find there .  even spies can t be spies every minute of the day .  maybe the love affair was only a love affair .    macshannon s good humor  until then unfailing  began to evaporate .  he looked a little grim as he said   but then why did he save that envelope .  it always comes down to that .  we re not talking about an ordinary person  but about a spy  a real spy .  why should he discard a letter so casually that anyone could pick it up  and save an empty envelope .  there has to be a reason .  if there s an innocent reason that has nothing to do with his profession  what is it .    avalon said gently   i take it that you yourself have never thought of an adequate reason  mr .  macshannon .     none  except that the envelope bore a message of some sort   said macshannon .    i suspect   said rubin   that you haven t tried thinking of what we have been calling an innocent explanation  mr .  macshannon .  perhaps you have been too satisfied with your message theory .     in that case  you think of an alternate reason  mr .  rubin   said macshannon defiantly .    now wait   said halsted   the spy thing was not mr .  macshannon s original assumption .  at first he thought that benham was collecting postmarks     or possibly stamps  for that matter .  suppose that very first thought was correct .    macshannon said   don t underestimate the fbi .  i had mentioned my original thought and  on one occasion  they managed to search his apartment .  there were no signs of any collecting mania of any kind .  certainly  there were no envelope collections .  they told me so .     you might have told us that   said rubin .    i just have   said macshannon   but it s not important .  the chance of his saving the envelope for collecting purposes was so small that it made no sense to dwell on it .      well  then  have you come up with some other explanation for saving the envelope  mr .  rubin .  or any of you .    drake said   it could have been a thoughtless action .  people do things out of habit  all sorts of silly things .  your mr .  benham meant to save the letter and discard the envelope and  without thinking  he did the reverse .     i can t believe that   said macshannon .    why not .  it s called being absentminded   said drake .   later  when he found he had saved the envelope  he may have gone downstairs to recover the letter and found it gone .    macshannon said   a man whose career is espionage is surely not absentminded .  he wouldn t last long if he were .  besides  he knew what he was doing .  he read the letter and crumpled it at once and discarded it .  then he looked at the envelope thoughtfully and put it away carefully .  he knew what he was doing .     are you sure .   said drake .   it happened thirty six years ago .  with all due respect  you may be honestly remembering what you want to remember .     not at all   said macshannon frigidly .   it was the big excitement of my life and i spent a lot of time thinking about it .  my memory is accurate .    drake shrugged .   if you insist  it s impossible to argue  of course .    macshannon looked about the table from face to face .   now  then  who has an alternate explanation .  no collection .  no absentmindedness .  what else .      and no sentimental attachment for the writer .  there might have been a love affair afterward  but that letter benham discarded was clearly the first one he had received .  he had just met her .  and even if it was love at first sight  something he didn t strike me as subject to  he would have kept the letter  not the envelope .    there was silence around the table and macshannon said   there you are .  it s bothered me for all these years .  what was there about the envelope that defeated the fbi .  i guess i ll just have to keep on wondering for the rest of my life .     wait   said avalon   the communication  if there was indeed one  may have been on the first envelope only  the one he saved and the one that the fbi presumably never saw .  all the others may have been clean and irrelevant .    macshannon s little beard quivered at that .   i ll leave it to mr .  trumbull   he said .   he said he was with counterintelligence .  does a conspirator of some sort give up a method of communication once it has been proven successful .    trumbull said   it s not a cosmic law  but successful gambits are not lightly abandoned  it s true .  however  it might no longer have been particularly successful .  that envelope he kept may have just happened to be the last of a line of such things that was using a technique that had grown risky .  it could then have been abandoned .     might .  may have .  could have been .   said macshannon  his voice rising to a squeak .   we have two actual facts .  the man was a spy .  the man did keep an empty envelope .  let s find an explanation as to why a spy should keep an empty envelope  an explanation that isn t pure speculation .    again there was silence about the table and macshannon smiled sardonically and said   there is no such explanation  except that it bore a message .    at this point  henry  from his post at the sideboard  said mildly   may i offer a suggestion .    macshannon whirled at this unexpected entry into the conversation and said in annoyed fashion   what is it you want  waiter .    gonzalo immediately held up his hand in a stop gesture and said   henry is a member of the club  frank .  he s expected to contribute .     i see   said macshannon  without any noticeable easing of his manner .   what is it you wish to say  then  my man .     only  sir  that saving an empty envelope is something so reasonable that any of us might do it and that each of us may  in fact  have done so at some time or another .     i deny that   said macshannon .    consider  sir   said henry quietly   that the letter you obtained from the trash can was  as you yourself have said  the first between them .  they had been out together on a date or  perhaps  as the result of a casual meeting .  they talked .  she told him of her difficulties in locating a suitable job  and he offered to help her .  since he was not an agreeable character from your description of him  mr .  macshannon  he must have been attracted to her and strove to be agreeable against his natural bent .  we don t know if she was young and pretty  but that s a reasonable assumption .  she must have been attracted to him  too .  certainly the letter expressed gratitude and encouraged a continuation of the correspondence .  she said   please let me know .   and  in fact  there was further correspondence and there is apparently no question but that a certain romance eventually began between them .  would you judge me correct in all this .     yes   said macshannon   but what of it .     we might further reason   said henry   that mr .  benham would want to continue the correspondence with a woman who may have been young and pretty and was certainly being grateful and inviting .  now you told us the contents of the letter  mr .  macshannon  and said you remembered it word for word .  it was not a long letter and i accept your memory .  it was the letter of a pleasant  but not well organized  young woman  for you said it was undated  and almost anyone with any sense of order would date a letter .     yes   said macshannon .   it was undated  but i still don t get what you re driving at .    henry said   someone casual enough to leave a letter undated may well have omitted other things as well .  you said it started  without preamble  with a  dear mr .  benham .   i take it then that there was no return address included on the letter sheet .    macshannon s frown smoothed out and he said  with a note of surprise   no  there wasn t .     then   said henry   since the letter was not a love letter and benham was not the type  perhaps  to place even a love letter next to his heart  he crumpled it and threw it away .  however  he did want to answer it and perhaps encourage a relationship he suspected might be sexually satisfying .  people who don t put the return address on the letter itself often do place it on the envelope .  so mr .  benham looked at the envelope  noted that it carried the return address  and naturally saved it so that he could answer the young lady .  surely that is a reasonable explanation .    a wave of brief applause swept the table  and henry  flushing slightly  said   thank you  gentlemen .    macshannon  clearly taken aback  said   but in that case the envelope had nothing to do with benham s espionage .     as mr .  halsted said earlier   said henry   a spy needn t be a spy every second .  there are bound to be intervals of normality .  however  he did break a cardinal rule of the profession  i think .     what was that  henry .   asked trumbull .    it seems to me that anyone engaged in the difficult profession of espionage must  above all  refrain from attracting attention of any kind .  the envelope should not have been saved and the letter discarded in front of a witness .  it should not even have been opened and read in front of a witness .      of course  mr .  benham had no way of knowing that the young man he always studiously ignored had once collected postmarks and was therefore sensitized to envelopes .    afterword  my favorite time for writing black widowers stories is when i m on vacation .  every once in a while  janet and i go on a cruise to bermuda .  for seven days  i m away from my typewriter  my word processor  and my reference library .  what i do  under such abysmal conditions  is smuggle a pad of paper and some ballpoint pens into my luggage  and then i write fiction .  this story and the following one were written on the bermuda trip in july of       together with a third story that was not a black widowers  so the vacation was not entirely a waste of time .   incidentally  it was not till i was putting the stories together for this collection that i noticed that the central point of  the envelope  was used as a subsidiary point in  sunset on the water .   that sort of thing is bound to happen once in a while  especially when one writes as much and as assiduously as i do  but it makes me feel bad just the same .   this story first appeared in the april      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   the alibi  emmanuel rubin was in an uncharacteristically mild mood during the cocktail hour preceding the black widowers  banquet .  and uncharacteristically thoughtful  too .      but characteristically didactic .   he was saying to geoffrey avalon  though his voice was loud enough to reach all corners of the room    i don t know how many mystery stories     or suspense stories  as they tend to call them these days     have been written  but the number is approaching the astronomical and i certainly haven t read them all .    of course  the old fashioned puzzle story is pass    though i like to write one now and then  but even the modern psychological story in which the crime is merely mentioned in passing  but the inner workings of the criminal s tortured soul occupies thousands of tortured words  may have its puzzle aspects .    what it amounts to is that i m trying to think up a new kind of alibi that is broken in a new kind of way  and i wonder     what are the odds of my thinking one up that has never been used before .  and no matter how ingenious i am  how can i possibly know that someone long ago  in some obscure volume i never read  did not use precisely the same bit of ingenuity .  i envy the early practitioners in the field .  almost anything they made up had never been used before .    avalon said   what s the odds  manny .  if you haven t read all the suspense stories written  neither has any reader .  just make up something .  if it s a repeat of some obscure device that appeared in a novel published fifty two years ago  who will know .    rubin said bitterly   somewhere someone will have read that early novel and he ll write to me  very likely sarcastically .    mario gonzalo  from the other end of the room  called out   in your case  it won t matter  manny .  there are so many other things to criticize in your stories that probably no one will bother pointing out that your gimmicks are old hat .     there speaks a man   said rubin   who in a lifetime of portraiture has produced only caricature .     caricature is a difficult art   said gonzalo   as you would know if you knew anything about art .    gonzalo was sketching the evening s guest in order that the sketch might be added to those that marched along the wall of the room at the milano restaurant in which the banquets took place .   he had what seemed an easy task this time  for the guest  brought in by avalon  who was host of the evening  had a magnificent mane of white hair  thick and lightly waved  shining like spun silver in the lamplight .  his regular features and spontaneous  even toothed smile made it quite certain that he was one of those men who grew statelier and more handsome with age .  his name was leonard koenig and avalon had introduced him merely as  my friend .    koenig said   you are making me look something like a superannuated movie star  mr .  gonzalo .     you can t fool an artist s eye  mr .  koenig   said gonzalo .   are you one  by any chance .     no   said koenig without further elaboration  and rubin laughed .    mario is right  mr .  koenig   said rubin .   you can t fool an artist s eye .    with that the conversation grew more general  breaking off temporarily only when the soft voice of that peerless waiter  henry  announced   please take your seats  gentlemen .  dinner is being served .       and they sat down to their turtle soup  which roger halsted  as the club gourmet  sipped carefully before giving it the benediction of a broad smile .   over the brandy  thomas trumbull  whose crisply waved white hair lost caste  somehow  against the brighter  softer hair of the guest  took up the task of grilling .    mr .  koenig  how do you justify your existence .   he asked .   koenig smiled broadly .   in view of mr .  rubin s problems with the invention of alibis  i suppose i can most easily justify my existence by pointing out that in my time i have been a breaker of alibis .     your profession has not been announced by jeff   said trumbull .   may i take it  then  that you are on the police force .     not quite .  not on an ordinary police force .  i am in counterespionage  or  to put it more accurately  i was .  i retired early and moved into the law  which is how i met jeff avalon .    trumbull s eyebrows shot up .   counterespionage .    koenig smiled again .   i read your mind  mr .  trumbull .  i know of your position with the government and you re wondering why you don t know my name .  i assure you i was a minor cog  who  except for one case  never did anything notable .  besides  as you know  it s not department policy to publicize its members .  we do our work best in obscurity .  and  as i said  i retired early  and have been forgotten in any case .    gonzalo said eagerly   that alibi you broke .  how did you do that .     it s a long story   said koenig   and not something i should talk about in detail .     you can trust us   said gonzalo .   nothing that s said at any black widowers meeting is ever mentioned outside .  that includes our waiter  henry  who s himself a member of the club .  tom  tell him .     well  it s true   said trumbull reluctantly .   we are all souls of discretion .  even so  though  i can t urge you to talk about matters that should not be talked of .    avalon pursed his lips judiciously .   i m not sure we can take that attitude  tom .  the conditions of the banquet are that the guest must answer all questions and rely on our discretion .    gonzalo said   well  look  mr .  koenig  you can leave out anything you think is too sensitive to talk about .  just describe the alibi and don t tell us how you broke it  and we ll break it for you .    james drake chuckled .   don t make rash promises  mario .     we can try  anyway   said gonzalo .   koenig said thoughtfully   do you mean you want to make a game of this .     why not  mr .  koenig .   said gonzalo .   and tom trumbull can disqualify himself if it turns out he remembers the case .     i doubt that he will .  the whole thing was on a  need to know  basis and he was not part of the same organization i was .   koenig paused to think for a moment .   i suppose it s possible to play the game  but it was almost thirty years ago .  i hope i remember all the details .   he cleared his throat and began .    it s interesting   said koenig   that mr .  rubin mentioned the tales that talk about the psychology of the criminal  because in my old business a lot depended on the psychology of the spy .  there were people who betrayed their country for money  or for spite  or out of sexual infatuation .  these are easy to handle  in a way  because they have no strong underpinning of conviction and  if caught  give way easily .     greed is the thing   said halsted feelingly   and you don t have to be a spy .  the corrupt politician  the tax finagling businessman  the industrialist who defrauds the armed forces with overcharges and shoddy work  can damage the country as badly as any spy .     yes   said rubin   but these guys will shout patriotism all over the place .  they can steal the government and the people blind  but as long as they hang out the flag on memorial day and vilify foreigners and anyone to the left of genghis khan  they re great guys .     that s why   said avalon   samuel johnson pointed out that patriotism was the last refuge of the scoundrel .     undoubtedly   said koenig   but we re veering from the point .  i was going on to say that there are also spies who do their job out of a strong ideological feeling .  they may do so out of admiration for the ideals of another nation  or because they feel they are serving the cause of world peace  or in some other way are behaving nobly in their own eyes .  we can t really complain about this  for we have people in foreign countries who work for us for similar idealistic reasons and  in fact  we have more of these than our enemies have .  in any case  these ideologues are the really dangerous spies  for they plan more carefully  are willing to take greater risks  and are far more resolute when caught .  a man of that sort was stephen .  notice that i m using only his first name  and stephen is not the true first name  either .    stephen lived a quiet life  koenig began   he did not draw attention to himself .  he did not make the mistake of trying to cover his true purposes by an unrealistic profession of patriotism .  it s just that he had available to him  in the way of his work and of circumstances  a great many items we did not want the enemy to have .  still  there are many people who know matters that had best be confidential  and the vast majority of them are thoroughly dependable .  there was no reason to suppose that stephen wasn t as dependable as any of them .   however  there were certain data that the enemy would particularly want to have  data to which stephen had access .  he could easily pass it along to the enemy  but if he did  circumstances were such that he would surely be suspected .  in fact  there would be what would amount to a moral certainty that he was the culprit .  yet such was the importance of the information that he had to obtain it .   notice  by the way  that i don t tell you anything at all about the nature of the data in question  about the manner in which he had access  or the manner in which he would make the transfer .  all that is irrelevant to the little game we are playing .  now let me try to put myself into stephen s mind  he knew he had to perform the task  and he knew he would instantly be suspected  strongly suspected .  he felt that he had to protect himself somehow .  it was not so much that he feared imprisonment  for he might be exchanged .  nor  i imagine  did he fear death  since the circumstances of his life were such that he must have known that he lived with the possibility of death  even unpleasant death  every day .   nevertheless  as a patriot     i suppose he could be considered that if viewed through his own eyes     he did not want to be caught because he knew he could not easily be replaced .  furthermore  if he could somehow be absolved of suspicion  our department would have to look elsewhere .  that would waste our energies and place any number of innocent people under suspicion  all of which would work to our disadvantage .   but how could he avoid being caught when he was  of necessity  the obvious culprit .  clearly  he would have to be in two places     in the city  where he could carry through his task  and  at the same time  in a far away place so that it would seem he could not possibly have had anything to do with the task .  the only way he could achieve this was to be two people .   here is the way he managed it  as we eventually found out .  the country stephen worked for provided a look alike  whom we might call stephen two .  i imagine that if stephen and stephen two stood next to each other it would be easy to distinguish between them  but if someone saw stephen two and then  a few days later  stephen himself  it would seem that he had seen the same person .   it also seems logical to suppose that stephen two s resemblance to stephen was reinforced .  he would be given stephen s hairstyling  would cultivate stephen s thin mustache  would practice stephen s voice as given on recordings  and his signature as recorded on documents .  he would even have learned to make use of some of stephen s favorite expressions .  naturally  he would have to be someone who spoke english and understood the culture as well as stephen did .   all this must have taken considerable time and effort  but it is a measure of the importance of what the enemy country was after that the time and effort was spent .   we eventually pieced together what it was stephen did and are satisfied that the account is essentially correct .  as the time approached  stephen let it be known  in as casual a manner as seemed appropriate  that he would be going to bermuda for a week s vacation by way of a cruise ship .  when the time came  he went into hiding and changed his appearance slightly  so that he would not readily be recognized while he carried out the theft and transmission of the data as quietly and as obscurely as possible .  it was stephen two  of course  who took the ship to bermuda .   stephen himself  as it happened  had never been to bermuda  and that struck him as a useful fact .  having been there but once would account for the fact that he might not know all there was to know about the island .  he had  however  to know what he himself had done on the island  and for that purpose  he had stephen two send him  by way of a simple code and a secure accommodation address  a condensed but detailed account of what he did and saw on bermuda .  in particular  stephen two must do a number of unimportant things that he would have to recount in detail  so that stephen could use them as proof of having been in bermuda .  a casual reference to the unimportant could be made to seem convincing evidence .   we are quite certain that stephen ordered stephen two to make friends with some reasonably attractive woman on the ship and get along with her well enough so that she would be certain to remember him     yet not so well that she could detect some difference between the two stephens .   in particular  he did not want stephen two to get intimate and start a romance .  i imagine that stephen did not want to be handed a situation that might make him uncomfortable  and a woman who imagined they had been lovers  when that was something he would not be able to deny without great danger to himself  would certainly represent something uncomfortable .   the week during which stephen two was in bermuda must have been a period of great suspense for stephen .  he carried through his own task  but what if the cruise ship foundered  or stephen two fell overboard  or had an accident in bermuda and was hospitalized  crippled  or even killed .  or suppose stephen two were fingerprinted for some reason  or had turned traitor  or had  from our point of view  defected  .  anything like that would have ruined stephen s alibi and made his jailing certain .   in actual fact  of course  none of these things took place .  stephen two sent his letters faithfully  numbering each so that stephen could be certain that none had been lost .  stephen carefully memorized each letter as well as he might .   eventually  stephen two returned from bermuda  and with quiet skill faded out and went back to his own country  while stephen resumed his identity .   it was two weeks after the end of the bermuda trip that we had reason to suspect that the data stephen had been after had been tampered with .  a quick investigation proved the case  and the finger of suspicion pointed forcefully and without question at stephen .   a group of us descended upon him .   he was quite admirable in his way .  his distress at the loss of the information seemed quite sincere and he admitted ruefully that he was the logical suspect  and indeed the only one .    but   he said with gentle patience   i was on the island duchess from the ninth to the sixteenth  and i was in bermuda between the eleventh and the fourteenth .  if the loss took place during that period  i simply couldn t have done it .    he gave us full details and  of course  had ample records to the effect that he had bought tickets  embarked  disembarked  paid his bar bill and some other expenses  and so on .  all seemed in order .  it didn t even seem suspicious that he could produce this all on demand .  he said   i m going to claim part of this as a business expense  so i ll need records for the irs .    there seemed to be a disposition among my confreres to accept this and to wonder if there might be other suspects after all .  i held off .  stephen seemed  for some reason  to be too smooth to me  and i insisted on continuing to question him while others tackled other angles of the case .  that was my big achievement as a spy catcher  of course .  if i had had one or two more like that  the department might not have been so willing to let me go when i asked for retirement  but i didn t .  this was my one and only .   in a second interview  i said to him   were you on the ship or on bermuda every moment from embarkation to disembarkation .     yes  of course   he said   i was at the mercy of the ship .     not entirely  sir .    he frowned a bit  as though trying to penetrate my meaning  then said   do you mean that i might have flown from the ship to here and then back to the ship and  in that way  have been here for the job and there for an alibi .     something like that   i said grimly .    i couldn t get on a plane without identifying myself .     there are such things as deliberate misidentifications .     i understand that   he said   but i suppose you can check as to whether any helicopter encountered the ship at any time .  i suppose you can check every passenger on every plane between here and bermuda during the time i was on the island and see whether any passenger is unaccounted for  or is anything but a real person distinct from myself .    i didn t bother to tell stephen that such checks were actually under way     and in the end  they uncovered nothing .   our interviews were recorded  of course  with stephen s permission .  we had read him his rights  but he said he was perfectly willing to talk and required no lawyer .  he was the very model of an innocent citizen confident of his innocence  and that simply raised my suspicions somehow .  he seemed too good to be true  and too confident .  it was about then that i began to wonder if he had a twin brother so that he could seem to be in bermuda even while he was at home .  that was checked out  too  and it was established he was a single birth and  indeed  an only son     but the idea of a look alike remained in my mind .   i said  in a later interview   did you stay on the ship while in bermuda .  or at a hotel .     on the ship .     had you ever been to bermuda before .  are you a well known figure there in any way .     it was my first trip to bermuda ever .     is there anyone who can vouch for your presence on the ship each day .  is there anyone who can vouch that you were indeed in bermuda at those times you were off the ship .    he hesitated .   i was on the cruise alone .  i didn t go with any friends .  after all  i had no idea  no faintest notion     how could i .      that i would have to prove i was on the ship .    i half smiled .  that seemed a hair too ingenuous .   you re not going to tell me   i said   that you were a recluse  skulking in corners and speaking to no one .     no   he said  looking a little uncomfortable .   as a matter of fact  i was friendly enough  but i can t guarantee that any of the people i interacted with casually would remember me .  except        go on .  what is the exception .     there was a certain young woman i grew friendly with at the start of the cruise .  she became my steady companion  so to speak  at ship s meals  and for much of the time on bermuda .      don t get me wrong  mr .  koenig .  there was nothing improper about the relationship .  i m not a married man  but even so it was just a casual friendship .  i think she might remember me .  we danced on board ship and  in bermuda  we visited the aquarium  went on the glass bottom boat together  took tours  ate at the princess hotel .  things like that .  she went to the beach alone  though .  i tend to avoid the sun .     did you see her every day .    he thought a moment .   yes  every day .  not all day  of course .  and not at night .  she was never in my room and i was never in hers .     we re not concerned with your morals  sir .     i m sure you re not  but i don t want to say anything that would unfairly reflect on her morals .     that s very considerate of you .  what was the young woman s name .     artemis .     artemis .   i said  rather in disbelief .    that s what she told me her name was  and that s what i heard others call her .  she was a very pretty woman  in her early thirties i should judge  with dark blond hair and blue eyes .  about five feet six in height .     and her last name .    he hesitated .   i don t remember .  she may not even have mentioned it .  it was shipboard  you know  very informal .  she called me stephen .  i don t think i ever mentioned my own last name .     her address .     i don t know .  she spoke as though she were a new yorker  but i don t know .  you can always look at the ship s records for the week .  she d be listed  and i d say the chances were virtually zero that there would be two artemis s .  they would surely have her last name and her home address .    i turned off the recording device at that and warned him that  as had been established  he would continue to be confined to his apartment for the duration of the questioning  but that anything necessary would be brought to him  and any reasonable errands would be run for him .   i was determined to prove if i could that whoever had been on bermuda  it was not stephen  but for that i would clearly need the woman .   it took three days to arrange matters  and each day was an annoyance .  obviously  i could not keep stephen under wraps indefinitely  and once he began to complain loudly enough  we would have to come up with something definite or let him go .   but he did not complain .  he continued to be a model citizen and once i had artemis in tow  i arranged to have her see him when he did not know she was looking at him .  she said   it certainly looks like stephen .     let s meet him  then .  just act naturally  but please keep your eyes open and let me know if  for any reason  you think it s not the man you met on the ship .    i brought her into the room and stephen looked at her  smiled  and said without hesitation   hello  artemis .    she said  a little hesitantly   hello  stephen .    she was no actress .  she looked at him anxiously  and stephen would have had to be far less intelligent than he clearly was not to guess that  under instructions  she was trying to tell whether he might not be an imposter .   finally  she said   he certainly looks like stephen  except stephen had little tufts of hair on the back of the rear end of his fingers .  i thought that was so virile .  i don t see them now .    stephen didn t seem to mind being discussed in the third person  or to be offended that the woman searched for difference .  he merely smiled and held up his hands .   the hair is there .    she said   it should be darker .   she didn t sound definite about it  though .   stephen said   remember the time when i tripped over my own two left feet while we were dancing and my hand slipped out of yours and you said it was because they were so smooth .  that doesn t sound as though you were so terribly impressed over their hairiness  does it .    artemis s face lit up .  she turned to me and said   yes  that did happen .     and you remember i apologized for being a clumsy dancer  and you kept saying i was a good dancer  but i knew you were just being sweet  and trying to make me feel better .  remember  artemis .    she said happily   yes  i remember .  hello  stephen .  i m glad it s you .    he said   thanks for recognizing me  artemis .  i d have been in considerable trouble if you hadn t .    i interrupted a bit irritably  i suppose .   wait  miss cataldo .  don t rush to conclusions .    he said   is that your last name  artemis .  they asked me  but i didn t know .  you d never told me .    i waved him quiet .  i said   ask him some questions  miss cataldo  little things that he ought to get right .    artemis flushed .   did you ever kiss me  stephen .    stephen looked a little embarrassed .   i did once     just once .  in the taxi  artemis .  remember .    i didn t give the woman a chance to reply .  i said sharply   the details  stephen .  and no hesitation .    he shrugged .   we were in the taxi being driven to a place called spittal pond  a bird refuge that artemis wanted to see .  artemis teased me because i said how pleasant it was to be going with a young woman who wanted to see bird refuges and not nightclubs and she said that by the next week  i would have forgotten her completely  and i wouldn t even remember her name .  so i said gallantly   what .  forget artemis  the chaste huntress .   i reached over her and wrote the name on the car window on the left .  it was a humid day and there was a thin film of moisture on it .     where does the kiss come in .   i demanded .    well  i was seated on her right   said stephen   and i reached across her chest with my right arm to write her name .  my left arm was on the back of the seat .   he showed me how it was  stretching his left arm behind an imaginary companion  and then pushing his right hand across in front  so that his arms nearly enclosed that companion .   i had just finished writing her name when the taxi lurched  for some reason .  my elbow nearly collided with the driver s head so i grabbed artemis s shoulder to steady myself     pure reflex     and there i was embracing her .   he was still demonstrating .   i found the position so irresistible that i kissed her .  only on the cheek  i am sorry to say .    i looked at the woman .   well .    her eyes were shining .  she said   that s exactly how it happened  mr .  koenig .  this is stephen  all right .  there is just no question about it .   she added dramatically   i identify this man as the man on the ship and in bermuda .    stephen smiled with just a touch of triumph  it seemed to me  and i said   very well .  you can leave now  miss cataldo .    and that s it .   koenig stopped talking and looked at the black widowers with his eyebrows raised .   gonzalo said explosively   that s it .  i thought you said you cracked his alibi .     so i did .  but you wanted me simply to tell you about the alibi and that you would then break it down .     and you haven t left out anything .     nothing essential   said koenig .   avalon cleared his throat and said   i presume you found stephen two .  that would break the alibi .     so it would   said koenig cheerfully   but we never found stephen two  i m sorry to say .    halsted said   is it possible that miss whatsername was paid off .  that she was lying .     if she was   said koenig   we found no evidence to back it .  in any case  the alibi was broken quite apart from anything she said or didn t say .      have any of you gentlemen visited bermuda .    there was a general silence and finally gonzalo said   i was taken there when i was four years old or so .  i don t remember anything .    trumbull said   are you hinting that stephen got some of the places in bermuda wrong .  was it that there was no bird refuge of the kind he mentioned or no princess hotel or something like that .     no  he got all the places correct .  no mistake that we could find as far as the geography or sights of the place were concerned .    again there was a silence and drake finally said   henry  is there anything about this that strikes you as making sense .    henry  who was just returning from the reference shelf  said thoughtfully   i can t speak through firsthand knowledge because i  too  have never been on bermuda  but it s possible that what mr .  stephen said may have proved that he was never on bermuda  either .    drake said in surprise   why  what did he say .    henry said   mr .  koenig ended his tale with the account of the kiss in the taxi  so i thought that perhaps something about that account broke the alibi .  now  bermuda is a british crown colony and it strikes me that it may follow british custom as far as traffic is concerned .  i have just checked the columbia encyclopedia on the reference shelf and it says nothing about that  but it is a possibility .    if  in bermuda  traffic is always on the left  as it is in great britain  the automobiles must have the steering wheel  and  therefore  the driver  on the right side of the front seat as in great britain  whereas in the united states  with traffic on the right  steering wheel and driver are on the left .  if mr .  stephen was sitting to the young woman s right and reaching over her to write her name on the left window as he said  he could scarcely have nearly struck the driver when the taxi lurched .  the driver would have been on the other side .    i imagine stephen two told mr .  stephen about the kissing incident  but neglected to mention the matter of the steering wheel or the driver  taking that for granted .  mr .  stephen added the matter of the driver for added verisimilitude and that was his great mistake  for  undoubtedly  mr .  koenig saw the point at once .    koenig sat back in his chair and smiled admiringly .   that s very good  henry .     not at all .  the praise is yours  mr .  koenig   said henry .   i knew you had broken the alibi  i knew you had done it by reason  and i knew that the reasoning had to be deduced from the facts you gave us .  you  in breaking the alibi  did not have the advantage of that special knowledge .    afterword  the influence of my having been on my bermuda vacation  see the previous afterword  shows itself clearly in this story  which first appeared in the september      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   the recipe  roger halsted said in a whisper to geoffrey avalon   he s my plumber .    avalon stared at him for a moment or two  more in incredulity than in disapproval .   your plumber .     used to be  actually .  he s retired and moved to the suburbs .  he s a nice fellow  and if you want to judge by the usual criterion of american success  he has always made a lot more money than i have .     i m not at all surprised   said avalon .   a master plumber        he was that .  and i just teach algebra at a junior high school .  no comparison .  but  you know  jeff  we always get professional men as guests at these black widower banquets and i thought it would be rather refreshing to have someone who works with his hands .    avalon said  rather unconvincingly   far be it from me to indulge in social snobbery  roger  but he may find us uncomfortable .     you can t tell .      and it may give us a chance to find out about plumbing .    in another part of the room  thomas trumbull nursed his scotch and soda and said   i ve just read the third bullet by john dickson carr  jim .    james drake squinted at trumbull and said   that s an oldie .     it s about half a century old  according to the copyright notice .  i read it decades ago  as a matter of fact  but i didn t remember it well enough to spoil my fun .  it s one of those locked room mysteries  you know .     i know .  that was carr s specialty .  no one did them as consistently  or as well  as he did .     and yet      trumbull shook his head .   something bothered me .    emmanuel rubin had gravitated toward the pair at the first mention of a mystery .  he said   let me guess what s bothering you  tom .  carr is terrific  but he has his faults .  for one thing  his writing tends to be overdramatic so that the reader is always uncomfortably aware that he is reading fiction .  then  when carr finally gets to the solution  he has devised one that takes at least twenty pages .  what s more  it is so intricate that the reader can t follow it without reading it several times  which he never does .  and that means that it s all unconvincing .     that s the point   said trumbull .   that last bit .  it s unconvincing .  a locked room mystery is usually so tortured in its construction and in its solution that you just can t accept it .  i mean  has there ever been a locked room mystery in real life .  somehow i doubt it .    drake said   we d have to ask someone who is a connoisseur of real life mysteries .  manny .     don t look at me .  i confine myself strictly to the fictional variety .  i ve never tried a locked room mystery because  frankly  i think carr killed the market for them .  i can t bring myself to undertake thinking up a new variation .    mario gonzalo joined the group at this point .  he said   that reminds me of a game you can try sometimes .  it s called   what s the greatest not by .       what does that mean .   said rubin suspiciously .   assuming you know .     easy .  it s asking a question like  what s the greatest elizabethan tragedy not by shakespeare .     the usual answer to that   said rubin   is webster s the duchess of malfi  though i never liked it .     all right .  what s the best waltz not by johann strauss .       the merry widow waltz  by franz leh  r  i would say   said rubin .    what about  the skater s waltz  .   demanded gonzalo .    a matter of taste   said rubin .    what s the greatest comic opera not by gilbert and sullivan .     how about strauss s die fledermaus .   said rubin .    or anything by offenbach .   suggested drake .    and now   said gonzalo   what s the greatest locked room mystery story not written by john dickson carr .    there was a tremendous silence  followed by three people beginning to talk at once and others joining .  in the increasing babble  henry  that imperturbable waiter  announced that dinner was served .   halsted s guest  the plumber  was myron dynast .  his aging had not been entirely graceful .  his hair was mostly gone  he had pouches under his eyes  a corrugated neck  and a pronounced paunch .  his eyes  however  were sharp  his voice was not harsh  and his vocabulary was reasonably good .  avalon consequently said in a whisper to halsted   he doesn t sound like a plumber .    halsted said   what you really mean  jeff  is that he doesn t sound like your mental stereotype of a plumber .    avalon drew himself to his full height and brought his formidable eyebrows downward to affix halsted with an offended glare .  but then he thought better of it and said mildly   perhaps you re right  roger .    dynast  however  did not talk a great deal .  whether he was abashed at finding himself in intellectual company  or whether he was simply interested in the topics of conversation that enlivened the meal  he listened quietly  for the most part  his quick eyes darting from speaker to speaker .   finally  over the brandy  halsted rattled his spoon against his water glass and said   jeff  will you do the honors with respect to our guest .     gladly   said avalon .  with a somewhat exaggerated courtesy  he turned to dynast and said   it is customary at these  our banquets  to begin by asking our guest to justify his existence .  how do you justify your existence  mr .  dynast  or  in other words        i don t need other words  mr .  avalon   said dynast .   just being a good plumber is all the justification i need .  has anyone ever awakened in the middle of the night and realized that he suddenly needed a hotshot nuclear physicist .  think of all the emergencies in which you would be a lot happier if you lived next door to a plumber like me than to a professor like     like        like any of us   said avalon  and cleared his throat .   you are quite right  mr .  dynast .  i accept your answer .  tell me  how long have you been a plumber .    dynast suddenly looked anxious .   is this what it s going to be .  are you going to ask me all about plumbing .     possibly  mr .  dynast  we might .    halsted interrupted in his soft voice .   i told you  mike  that the conditions of the banquet are that you must answer all the questions we ask .     i will  rog  but i ve got something more interesting to say     if you ll let me .    avalon paused thoughtfully for a moment  then said   it is not our intention to hamper you unduly  mr .  dynast .  you may tell us what it is you want to say  but if we go back to plumbing  you must accede to that .  that is        i know what you said  mr .  avalon  and it s okay with me   said dynast .   what i want to say is that before the banquet i heard you talking about locked room mysteries .  i heard you say you didn t know if a locked room mystery could happen in real life .  the thing is that i have one .    that brought the table to a frozen moment of immobility .  even henry  who was quietly and efficiently clearing the last remnants of the banquet  looked up in thoughtful surprise .   finally  trumbull said in what was almost a hushed tone   do you mean you ve heard of one  or that you ve experienced one .  are you saying that you yourself have been involved in one .     not me .  my wife .  she was .    mario gonzalo  at the other end of the table  was leaning forward in his seat  a look of unholy glee on his face .   wait awhile  now  mr .  dynast  are you going to tell us there was a locked room and someone was killed inside and it wasn t suicide and there was no murderer inside and your wife was there and knows all about it .    dynast stared in horror at that .   murder .  i m not talking about murder .  good lord  there was no murder .  nothing like that .    gonzalo deflated visibly .   then what are you talking about .    dynast said   there was this room that was locked .  and something happened that couldn t happen  that s all .  and it involved my wife .  it doesn t have to be murder to be a locked room  does it .    avalon raised his hand and said in his deepest baritone   i am doing the grilling  gentlemen  so let s have order .  this may well be interesting and it may supersede our probing of the plumbing profession  at least temporarily  but let s go about it reasonably .    he waited  frowning  for silence  then said   mr .  dynast  exactly what happened in the locked room that couldn t have happened .     something was stolen .     something of value .     to my wife  it had a great deal of value .  can i explain .  i can t really talk about it without some explaining .    avalon looked about the table .   are there any objections to our listening to mr .  dynast .    gonzalo said   i have objections to not listening to him .     yes  mario  i should suppose you have .  very well  mr .  dynast  but you must understand we will interrupt with questions at such times as we have any .     sure  go ahead .   dynast turned to henry  who had taken up his accustomed position at the sideboard .   waiter  could i have more coffee .    henry obliged  and dynast said   my wife  gentlemen  was born in a small town .  she married me when she was thirty three and  as it happened  we never had children .  we spent some twenty years in the city  but she never got over being a small town girl .  old fashioned  too  if you know what i mean .     i m not sure we do   said avalon .   what do you mean .     i mean she went out for church socials  and picnics  and all kinds of neighborhood activities .  you couldn t really do much of that in the city  you know  but once i retired and we moved out of town  and bought a nice little house with some land  she went right back into the swim .  it was as though she were trying to be a girl again .  with no children  and no money problems  she could spend all her time at that sort of thing .  and i m willing     as long as she doesn t drag me into it .     i take it  then  you re not a small town boy   said rubin .    definitely not .  i m a boy out of the concrete canyons .     don t you find it rather dull in the suburbs  then .     oh  sure  but in the first place  i m not so far from the city that i can t come in  now and then  to fill my lungs with the foul air .  ginny     that s my wife     doesn t mind .  and then  too  i m not entirely retired .  i take on plumbing jobs when someone needs it  and that fills some of my time .  you know  each plumbing job is different  each one is a challenge  especially if you want to do it well .  and the plumbing in the suburbs is just different enough from that in the city to be interesting .  besides       he paused and flushed a little .   besides  ginny has been a good wife .  she stuck it out in the city when things weren t so hot sometimes and didn t complain any more than she had to .  now it s her turn and she s happy     or was happy     and i wasn t about to spoil it for her .    she keeps busy .  not having children  she sort of makes up for it by always being ready to do some baby sitting .  half the time  the house has kids in it  running around and making noise .  she loves it .     do you love it .   asked trumbull  scowling .    no  i don t  but it s her job .  she doesn t ask me to help out .  i know nothing about kids .     does your wife .  if she has none of her own      said avalon .    oh  lord .  she just hasn t had any     uh     biologically  but she was the oldest of six .  she spent practically all her life till she married me being a kind of assistant mother .  me  i had one big brother and we never got along .  kids are a closed book to me  but i don t miss them .  once we talked about adopting  but i was sort of against it  and she didn t force it on me .    gonzalo said  with a touch of impatience   are we getting to the locked room .     there s one more point i have to explain .  what makes my wife popular at these church socials is that she s a great cook .  i can t explain it myself .  i m just an eater and i don t know what makes food special  but hers is special and i spent my whole life trying not to get fat on her food .   he looked down at his abdomen with some chagrin as he said that .    listen  if she were a bad wife  i d still stand her for the sake of her cooking     but she s a good wife .  i don t say her cooking is fancy .  she doesn t turn out the kind of food you get in fancy restaurants .  hers is plain stuff  but it melts in the mouth .  just to show you  her specialty is blueberry muffins .  that doesn t sound like much because you can get them anywhere  but once you taste ginny s blueberry muffins  you ll never buy them again .  compared to hers everything else is trash .    she s got dozens of little things she does better than anyone else .  i don t know how .  maybe it s spices  or how she mixes them  or how long she cooks  or who knows     she s just a genius at it  like i m pretty good at plumbing .  when she brings in her creations to one of these socials or picnics she goes to  everyone stands around with their tongues hanging out .  and she loves it .  it s her passport to fame and success .  but what she s proudest of  what s nearest her heart  are those blueberry muffins .    no one can get any recipes out of her .  she doesn t have them except in her head  and that s where she keeps them .  secret .  they re her crown jewels .  she never lets anyone into her kitchen when she s cooking except me  because she knows i don t know what s going on .    drake said   i remember my mother used to be a bit like that .  when cooking is your expertise  you don t want anyone competing with you by making use of your own discoveries .     that s right   said dynast .   but you know  people kept talking to her about writing down all the recipes and making a book out of it .  one of the ladies brought in a friend who worked at a publishing house and she talked to ginny and said that cookbooks made money  and that a good cookbook of plain food could be a gold mine .  she also said that someday ginny would pass on and it wouldn t be right that her cooking secrets should die with her .  she flattered ginny right out of her shoes  and i could see ginny was beginning to think there was something to it .    to tell you the truth  i was sort of in favor  too .  i would have liked to have her known far and wide for her cooking .  i would be proud .  so i pushed her  and she began thinking about it even more .    not that it was easy  you know .  she talked about it and she would say things like   i just cook .  i do things without even thinking about it .  i add and mix and it s all in my fingertips  not in my brain .  if i sit down to write a recipe  i would have to figure each one out .       do it anyway   i said .   even if it s hard  you do it .  writing any kind of book is hard .  why shouldn t a cook book be hard  too .     so she started to work at it now and then  and she d keep all the recipes she worked out in a little fireproof box  which locked up with a key  and she would say to me   i just can t include the blueberry muffin recipe .  that s my secret .   i would say   come on  ginny  no secrets   but i knew what she meant .    those blueberry muffins were the one thing that created hard feelings against ginny .  they were so good and all the husbands loved them so much that all the wives had their noses out of joint .  the other things lots of them could do almost as well  but ginny s muffins were just out of reach .  there was a lot of sentiment that she ought to put the recipe up on the church bulletin board and that it was a lack of christian charity to hog it like that .  but ginny wouldn t be moved .    anyway  now you have the explanation .  one day  they were having some meeting at the church and  for a wonder  ginny didn t feel she had to attend .  she explained she wanted to stay home and work on her recipes and she said she would take care of some of the younger kids for those who attended the meeting to make up for not going .  she ended up with five kids in the house for about three hours .  in those three hours  the house was locked up  even the windows  because we had air conditioning .  there was no one in the house but ginny and five little kids .  that was it .     where were you  mr .  dynast .   asked avalon .    i was in the city .  to tell you the truth  i always try to be elsewhere when the kids get too thick .  ginny doesn t mind .  glad not to have me underfoot  i suppose .    gonzalo said   is this the locked room you re talking about  mr .  dynast .  your house locked up with just your wife and the five children in it .     that s right .     i should have thought   said avalon   that mrs .  dynast would get very little work done with five children underfoot .     it wasn t bad   said dynast .   four of the children were old timers  so to speak  who d been in the house lots of times .  they knew ginny and ginny knew them .  they were all three or four years old and they had cookies and milk  and toys  and games .  one of the children was new  but he was the best one .  he belonged to a cousin of one of the regular mothers .  the cousin and her husband were both going to the meeting with the mother  and ginny was glad to take on the new child .  his name was harold and he was maybe almost five  very well behaved and good natured  according to ginny .  he helped take care of the other children  in fact .  he was very good with them .    so ginny kept working on her recipes and  for the first time  she actually wrote down the recipe for her blueberry muffins .  she hated to do it  she said  so she wrote it down in pencil  lightly  as though that were equivalent to only half writing it down .  even so  she lost heart because just before it was all over and the children were taken away  she tore the card into confetti .    that was what was so impossible to explain .  she had written down the recipe near the start of her babysitting stint  she had torn it up near the end .  it had existed maybe two and a half hours in that closed house  with no one inside but her and the five children  and during that two and a half hour period the recipe was stolen .      wouldn t you call that a locked room mystery .    trumbull said   the recipe was stolen .  i thought you said she tore it up .     i didn t say the piece of paper was stolen .  the recipe on it was stolen .  the next day that recipe was on the church bulletin board  word for word  as she had written it .  poor ginny .  she was devastated .  since then  she s just been a different woman .  she s not going to do the cook book now  and she s not going to have anything to do with the church anymore .     she s angry with the whole church .   said gonzalo .   who did the stealing .     she doesn t know  and i don t know .  we don t know who stole it and we don t know how it was stolen .  if we did know  she might get over it .  she might have some specific person to be enraged with .  she might see it was her own carelessness .  as it is      he shook his head .   that s why i was so interested when someone said there were no locked room mysteries in real life .  what do you call this .    there was a silence  and rubin said   you were away the whole time .  you saw none of this .     almost the whole time  mr .  rubin .  i came home just as everything was breaking up .  the others were milling about  taking their kids  and thanking ginny .  there was the cousin and her husband  the parents of little harold .  they were both quite short     about five feet tall each     but friendly and pleasant .  i saw their boy for a moment .  he was introduced to me and shook hands like a little man .  it was all the height of pleasantness but  by that time  ginny had already torn up the recipe and it had already  somehow  been stolen .    halsted leaned back in his chair  hands clasped across his abdomen .   how sure can you be  mike  that the house was really the equivalent of a locked room  that there was no window open and no way of getting in .    dynast shook his head .   that really doesn t matter  does it .  all the doors and windows were locked  because ginny is very careful  and as long as the kids are in her care  she wants none of them falling out a window or wandering out of the house .  but never mind that .  the fact is that she and the recipe were in this particular room and no one entered that room during all the time the recipe existed .  it s just not possible that someone might have gotten in without her noticing .     even if she was absorbed in her recipes .   demanded rubin .    she wouldn t be that absorbed .  the children came first .  she would be on the alert at all times .    gonzalo said   and she never left the room at any time .  she didn t go to the bathroom .     listen   said dynast .   we talked about this and i asked her that particular question .  no  she didn t have to go to the bathroom  but she did leave the room .  she left the house  in fact .     ah   said gonzalo .   why .     she remembered she had promised to deliver something to the neighbors who lived across the way  and she was afraid she would continue to forget if she didn t bring it over right then .  it was only a matter of fifty feet and it would only take a minute .  so she ran over  rang the bell  the husband came out  she shoved it into his hands with an explanation     his wife was at the meeting     exchanged two sentences  and dashed back .  the whole thing took two minutes at the most .    gonzalo said   you weren t there  mr .  dynast .  a woman may feel she took only two minutes  and actually take twenty .     never   said dynast indignantly .   she had a houseful of kids to take care of .  she wouldn t take more than two minutes .  she had no reason to take more than two minutes .     did she lock the door when she left .   asked gonzalo .    no  she didn t like to .  without being there  she was afraid that if something happened to her  and then something happened to the children  and there was a locked door to delay people getting in  well     but that doesn t matter .  she had the front door under observation at all times .  no one approached it .  no one came anywhere near it .  when she got back  and locked the door again  she asked little harold if anything at all had happened when she was gone and he said nothing had .  certainly nothing was disturbed and the children seemed perfectly contented .    gonzalo said   just the same  it s not really a locked room if it was open at some point .     let s not be legalistic  mario   said avalon .   if the story is accurate  then the house is still the equivalent of a locked room .  i must admit  though  that the story is secondhand .  i wish we could interview mrs .  dynast first hand .     well  we can t   said rubin .   trumbull said   now wait awhile .  if we were talking about something material that was stolen  then the house might be considered a locked room .  however  nothing material was stolen .  the card on which the recipe was written was destroyed by mrs .  dynast herself .  all that was stolen was the information on the card  and that makes the situation different .      mr .  dynast  i believe that you implied that mrs .  dynast s friends  her church social associates  knew that she was preparing recipes .     oh  yes  it was big news .     and would they know that she was working on those recipes at this particular time  when the rest attended the church meeting .     yes  i believe i mentioned that she had told them so  as her excuse for not going .     and in preparing the recipes  she would label each and identify it  wouldn t she .     certainly .  in fact  the blueberry muffin recipe would be labeled  grandma s blueberry muffins  because that s how she always referred to them to me and to everyone else .  her grandmother had apparently taught her the recipe and she had then improved on it .     and i presume the room in which she worked had windows .     yes  of course .     in that case   said trumbull  you certainly didn t have a locked room .  people might not have been able to reach into it physically to steal a recipe card  but they could surely look through a window and read what was on the recipe card  couldn t they .     no  i don t think so  mr .  trumbull   said dynast .   the front of our house was street level  but the ground slanted downward as one moved away from the street .  that left room for a basement and garage with openings at ground level in the backyard and with a driveway going back there .  but the back rooms  in which ginny was working and had the kids  was one story high .  you couldn t very well look into the windows unless you were ten or eleven feet high  or unless you used a ladder .  and i rather think ginny would have noticed in either case .    trumbull wouldn t let go .   he might have been in a tree  if the room faced a backyard .     he might have been     or she     but there was no tree within twenty feet of those windows .  besides  as i had said  ginny had been irresolute and had written the recipe very lightly in pencil .  i don t think anyone could have read it even if his or her nose had been pressed right up against the glass of the window .  and then  to make matters worse  in order to keep it even more secure  ginny had slipped the recipe under a book after she had written it .  it was still under the book when her heart failed her and she took it out to tear it up .    drake said   was that the only time the recipe was written down .     the only time .     and was it really quoted word for word .  it couldn t have been a merely similar recipe that someone else had independently invented  could it .  after all  i must tell you that even the greatest scientific discoveries are sometimes independently thought up by two different scientists at more or less the same time .  these things do happen .     the same words   said dynast intransigently .   ginny swears to it and i believe her .  at one point  she said   stir furiously till your hand is in danger of falling off .  then count ten rapid breaths and       all that was right there .  that s the way she talks about cooking when she talks to me .  no one else is likely to talk that same exact way .    there was silence around the table and avalon said   i m afraid  mr .  dynast  that i don t see how it could have been done .  you re not making this up as a joke  i suppose .    dynast shook his head .   i wish i were  mr .  avalon  but it s no joke to ginny  and if we don t find out how it s done  i wouldn t be surprised if  in the end  we ll have to sell our house and move away .  ginny can t bear the thought of living near the people who did this to her .    drake said   would you say that your wife has really told the entire truth .     i d stake my life on it   said dynast .    then with a room containing one woman and five young children you have to conclude that the woman herself stole her own recipe .  do you suppose it is possible that mrs .  dynast arranged the whole thing herself as an excuse to be able to move away .    dynast said   if she wanted to move  she would just have to say so .  she wouldn t have to arrange a big  fancy trick .  and if you knew ginny  you d know how impossible it would have been for her to play tricks with her blueberry muffins .  you can t imagine what they meant to her .    rubin said   well  it s the damnedest locked room mystery i ve ever heard .  there s no solution .    at this point  henry said half apologetically   gentlemen .    rubin looked up .   come on  henry  are you trying to tell us there is a solution .     i can t guarantee it  but i would like to ask mr .  dynast a question .    avalon said   would that be all right with you  mr .  dynast .  henry is a valued member of our organization .     i suppose so   said dynast .   sure .     in that case  the oldest child     harold .     yes .     how old did you say harold was .     five at the most .     how do you know  mr .  dynast .     ginny said so .     how did she know  mr .  dynast .     i suppose she asked him .     did she say she had asked him .     n no .      but i saw him myself when i came home .  i told you .  he was a little fellow .  five at the outside .     but  mr .  dynast  you also said that you saw harold s parents and that each was five feet tall .  you wouldn t say that because they were each five feet tall they were teenagers .     no .  they were just short .     exactly .  and short parents may well have short children .  it is possible that harold may look five  judging by his height and size  and yet be eight years old .  and  for all we may know  he may be uncommonly bright for eight .     good lord   said avalon .   do you really think that could be so  henry .     consider the consequences  mr .  avalon  if it is so .  one of the women of the neighborhood desperately wants the recipe .  she has a short sister who has married a short man  and the two have an uncommonly small boy  who happens to be a prodigy .  he is a bright eight year old who can easily pass for an unremarkable five year old .  this bright boy is placed in your house  mr .  dynast  and told what to look for .    mrs .  dynast would feel no concern if this little boy were watching her  or staring curiously at what she is writing .  he is  after all  to all appearances  a preschool youngster who cannot read .  he might see her do a recipe for  grandma s blueberry muffins  and place it under a book .  then  when she leaves on her errand  even if it is only for two minutes  the boy can take the recipe out from under the book  read it  memorize it  and put it back .  it would not be a terribly long thing to memorize  and particularly bright children can pick up such things as though their minds were blotting paper .  i remember that well from my own childhood .    gonzalo said triumphantly   sure .  that explains it  and there s no other explanation possible .    henry said   it is merely a possibility .  however  if you can find out the name of the cousin and her husband  it would be simple to find out how old the boy is  what school he is going to  what grade he is in  and how well he is doing .  if the woman refuses to give you any information about her cousin and her nephew  then that in itself would strongly imply that our theory is correct .     who d have thought it .   said dynast blankly .   henry murmured   there must be a rational explanation to everything  sir  and  as usual  the black widowers had carefully eliminated all possible explanations and left me to point out what remained .    afterword  i was reading the third bullet by john dickson carr  as trumbull did in the story  and it occurred to me that i had never written a black widowers story involving a locked room mystery .   naturally  i was at once overwhelmed with a desire to do so  but it didn t seem possible to me to think up a new gimmick involving a locked room .  john dickson carr had simply done it all  and other writers had filled in what inconsiderable gaps might remain .   however  i hated to give up .  could i possibly think of some new way of explaining a locked room mystery .  and to my astonishment  i found i could .   in great excitement  i sat down and wrote  the recipe  in one sitting     the whole thing .  i don t think i ever enjoyed writing a story more .   and now that this collection is done  may i tell you once again that i m still in reasonably good health and have no intention of stopping .  the black widowers  i assure you  will continue as long as i do .
