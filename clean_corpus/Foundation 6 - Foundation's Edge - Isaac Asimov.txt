secret galactic refuge .  at issue the destiny of humankind .   foundation s edge is the most eagerly anticipated science fiction novel of our time .  it is the first science fiction novel from the

millions throughout the world and awarded a hugo as  best alltime science fiction series .   he is the inventor of the three laws of robotics and lives in new york city .                                                                   back cover information                              he was the analog the mirror image of the mayor of terminus  who ruled over the first foundation .  but they were different in every respect .  the mayor of terminus was known to all the galaxy and the first foundation was therefore simply  the foundation  to all the worlds .  the first speaker of the second foundation was known only to his associates .   and yet it was the second foundation which held the real power .  the first foundation was supreme in the realm of physical power  of technology  of weapons .  the second foundation was supreme in the realm of mental power  of the mind  of the ability to control .  in any conflict between the two  what would it matter how many ships and weapons the first foundation controlled  if the second foundation could control the minds of those who controlled the ships and weapons .   but how long could this remain a secret .   from  foundation s edge                                                                prologue    the first galactic empire was falling .  it had been decaying and breaking down for centuries and only one man fully realized that fact .   he was hari seldom the last great scientist of the first empire  and it was he who perfected psychohistory the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations .   the individual human being is unpredictable  but the reactions of human mobs  seldon found  could be treated statistically .  the larger the mob  the greater the accuracy that could be achieved .  and the size of the human masses that seldon worked with was no less than the population of all the inhabited millions of worlds of the galaxy .   seldon s equations told him that  left to itself  the empire would fall and that .  thirty thousand years of human misery and agony would elapse before a second empire would arise from the ruins .  and yet  if one could adjust some of the conditions that existed  that interregnum could be decreased to a single millennium just one thousand years .   it was to insure this that seldon set up two colonies of scientists that he called  foundations .   with deliberate intention  he set them up  at opposite ends of the galaxy .   the first foundation  which centered on physical science  was set up in the fuel daylight of publicity .  the existence of the other  the second foundation  a world of psychohistorical and  mentalic  scientists  was drowned in silence .   in the foundation trilogy  the story of the first four centuries of the interregnum is told .  the first foundation  commonly known as simply  the foundation   since the existence of another was unknown to almost all  began as a small community lost in the emptiness of the outer periphery of the galaxy .  periodically it faced a crisis in which the variables of human intercourse  and of the social and economic currents of the time constricted about it .  its freedom to move lay along only one certain line and when it moved in that direction a new horizon of development opened before it .  all had been planned by hari seldon  long dead now .   the first foundation with its superior science  took over the barbarized planets that surrounded it .  it faced the anarchic warlords who broke away frog  a dying  empire and beat them .  it faced the remnant of the empire itself under its last strong emperor and its last strong general and beat it .   it seemed as though the    seldon plan  was going through smoothly and that nothing would prevent the second empire from being established or  time and with a minimum of intermediate devastation .   but psychohistory is a statistical science .  always there is a small chance that something will go wrong  and something did something which hari seldon could not have foreseen .  one man  called the mule  appeared atom nowhere he had mental powers in a galaxy that lacked them .  he could mold men s emotions and shape their minds so that his bitterest opponents were made into his devoted servants .  aries could not  would not  fight him .  the first foundation fell and seldon s p an seemed to lie in ruins .   there was left t    mysteriou  second foundation  which had been caught unprepared by the sudden appearance of the mule  but which was now slowly working out a counterattack .  its great defense was the fact of its unknown location .  the mule sought it in order to make his conquest of the galaxy complete .  the faithful of what was left of the first foundation sought it to obtain help .   neither found it .  the mule was stopped first by the action of a woman  bayta darell and that bought enough time for the second foundation to organize the proper action and  with that  to stop the mule permenently .  slowly they prepared to reinstate the seldon plan .   but  in a way  the cover of the second foundation was gone .  the first foundation knew of the second s existence  and the first did not want a future in which they  were overseen by the mentalists .  the first foundation was the superior in physical force  while the second foundation was hampered not only by that fact  but by being faced by a double task  it had not only to stop the first foundation but had also to regain its anonymity .   this the second foundation  under its greatest  first speaker   preem salver  manages to do .  the first foundation was allowed to seem to win  to seems to defeat the second foundation  and it moved on to greater and greater strength in the galaxy  totally ignorant that the second foundation still existed .   it is now four hundred and ninety eight years after the first foundation had come into existence .  it is at the peak of its strength  but one man does not accept appearances     chapter one  councilman     i don t believe it  of course   said golan trevize standing on the wide steps of seldon hall and looking out over the city as it sparkled in the sunlight .   terminus was a mild planet  with a high water land ratio .  the introduction of weather control had made it all the more comfortable and considerably less interesting  trevize often thought .    i don t believe any of it   he repeated and smiled .  his white  even teeth gleamed out of his youthful face .   his companion and fellow councilman  munn li compor who had adopted a middle name in defiance of terminus tradition  shook his head uneasily .   what don t you believe .  that we saved the city .     oh  i believe that .  we did  didn t we .  and seldon said that we would  and he said we would be right to do so  and that he knew all about it five hundred years ago .    compor s voice dropped and he said in a half whisper   look  i don t mind your talking like this to me  because i take it as just talk  but if you shout it out in crowds others will hear and  frankly  i don t want to be standing near you when the lightning strikes .  i m not sure how precise the aim will be .    trevize s smile did not waver .  he said   is there harm in saying that the city is saved .  and that we did it without a war .     there was no one to fight   said compor .  he had hair of a buttery yellow  eyes of a sky blue  and he always resisted the impulse to alter those unfashionable hues .    have you never heard of civil war  compor .    said trevize .  he was tall  his hair was black  with a gentle wave to it  and he had a habit of walking with his thumbs hitched into the soft fibered sash he always wore .    a civil war over the location of the capital .     the question was enough to bring on a seldon crisis .  it destroyed hannis s political career .  it put you and me into the council last election and the issue hung   he heisted one hand slowly  back and forth  like a balance coming to rest on the level .   he paused on the steps  ignoring the other members of the government and the media  as well as the fashionable society types who had finagled an invitation to witness seldon s return  or the return of his image  at any rate  .   all were walking down the stairs  talking  laughing  glorying in the correctness of everything  and basking in seldon s approval .   trevize stood still and let the crowd swirl past him .  compor  having walked two steps ahead  paused an invisible cord stretching between them .  he said   aren t you coming .     there s no hurry .  they won t start the council meeting until mayor branno has reviewed the situation in her usual flat footed  one syllable at a time way .  i m in no hurry to endure another ponderous speech .   look at the city .     i see it .  i saw it yesterday  too .     yes  but did you see it five hundred years ago when it was founded .     four hundred ninety eight   compor corrected him automatically .   two years from now  they ll have the hemimillennial celebration and mayor branno will still be in the office at the time  barring events of  we hope  minor probability .     we hope   said trevize dryly .   but what was it like five hundred years ago when it was founded .  one city .  one small city  occupied by a group of men preparing an encyclopedia that was never finished .     of course it was finished .     are you referring to the encyclopedia galactica we have now .  what we have isn t what they were working on .  what we have is in a computer and it s revised daily .  have you ever looked at the uncompleted original .     you mean in the hardin museum .     the salvor hardin museum of origins .  let s have the full name  please  since you re so careful about exact dates .  have you looked at it .     no .  should i .     no  it isn t worth it .  but anyway there they were a group of encyclopedists  forming the nucleus of a town one small town in a world virtually without metals  circling a sun isolated from the rest of the galaxy  at the edge  the very edge .  and now  five hundred years later  we re a suburban world .  the whole place is one big park  with all the metal we want .  we   re at the center of everything now .     not really   said compor .   we re still circling a sun isolated from the rest of the galaxy .  still at the very edge of the galaxy .     ah no  you re saying that without thinking .  that was the whole point of this little seldon crisis .  we are more than the single world of terminus .  we are the foundation  which sends out its tentacles galaxy wide and rules that galaxy from its position at the very edge .  we can do it because we re not isolated  except in position  and that doesn t count .     all right .  i ll accept that .   compor was clearly uninterested and took another step downward .  the invisible cord between them stretched farther .   trevize reached out a hand as though to haul his companion up the steps again .   don t you see the significance  compor .  there s this enormous change  but we don t accept it .  in our hearts we want the small foundation  the small one world operation we had in the old days the days of iron heroes and noble saints that are gone forever .     come on .     i mean it .  look at seldon hall .  to begin with  in the first crises in salvor hardin s day  it was just the time vault  a small auditorium in which the holographic image of seldon appeared .  that was a   .  now it s a colossal mausoleum  but is there a force field ramp in the place .  a slideway .  a gravitic lift .   no  just these steps  and we walk down them and we walk up them as hardin would have had to do .  at odd and unpredictable times  we cling in fright to the past .    he flung his arm outward passionately .   is there any structural component visible that is metal .  not one .  it wouldn t do to have any  since in salvor hardin s day there was no native metal to speak of and hardly any imported metal .  we even installed old plastic  pink with age  when we built this huge pile  so that visitors from other worlds can stop and say   galaxy .  what lovely old plastics  i tell you  compor  it s a sham .     is that what you don t believe  then .  seldon hall .     and all its contents   said trevize in a fierce whisper .   i don t really believe there s any sense in hiding here at the edge of the universe  just because our ancestors did .  i believe we ought to be out there  in the middle of everything .     but seldon says you re wrong .  the seldon plan is working out as it should .     i know .  i know .  and every child on terminus is brought up to believe that hari seldon formulated a plan  that he foresaw everything five centuries ago  that he set up the foundation in such a way that he could spot certain crises  and that his image would appear holographically at those crises  and tell us the minimum we had to know to go on to the next crisis  and thus lead us through a thousand years of history until we could safely build a second and greater galactic empire on the ruins of the old decrepit structure that was falling apart five centuries ago and had disintegrated completely by two centuries ago .     why are you telling me all this  golan .     because i m telling you it s a sham .  it s all a sham .   or if it was real to begin with  it s a sham now .  we are not our own masters .  it is not we who are following the plan .    compor looked at the other searchingly .   you ve said things like this before  golan  but i ve always thought you were just saying ridiculous things to stir me up .  by the galaxy  i actually think you re serious .     of course i m serious .     you can t be .  either this is some complicated piece of fun at my expense or you re out of your mind .     neither .  neither   said trevize  quiet now  hitching his thumbs into his sash as though he no longer needed the gestures of hands to punctuate passion .   i speculated on it before  i admit  but that was just intuition .  that farce in there this morning  however  has made it suddenly all .  quite plain to me and i intend  in turn  to make it quite plain to the council .    compor said   you are crazy .     all right .  come with me and listen .    the two walked down the stairs .  they were the only ones left the last to complete the descent .  and as trevize moved slightly to he fore  compor s lips moved silently  casting a voiceless word in the direction of the other s back   fool .    mayor harla branno called the session of the executive council to order .  her eyes had looked with no visible sign of interest at the gathering  yet no one there doubted that she had noted all who were present and all who had not yet arrived .   her gray hair was carefully arranged in a style that was neither markedly feminine nor imitation masculine .  it was simply the way she wore it  no more .  her matter of fact face was not notable for beauty  but somehow it was never for beauty that one searched there .   she was the most capable administrator on the planet .  no one could  or did  accuse her of the brilliance of the salvor hardins and the hober mallows whose histories enlivened the first two centuries of the foundation s existence  but neither would anyone associate her with the follies of the hereditary indburs who had ruled the foundation just prior to the time of the mule .   her speeches did not stir men s minds  nor did she have a gift for the dramatic gesture  but she had a capacity for making quiet decisions and sticking by them as long as she was convinced she was right .  without any obvious charisma  she had the knack of persuading the voters those quiet decisions would be right  since by the seldon doctrine  historical change is to a large degree difficult to swerve  always barring the unpredictable  something most seldonists forget  despite the wrenching incident of the mule   the foundation might have retained its capital on terminus under any conditions .  that is a  might   however .  seldon  in his just finished appearance as a five century old simulacrum  had calmly placed the probability of remaining on terminus at    .   percent .   nevertheless  even to seldonists  that meant there was a    .   percent chance that the shift to some point closer to the center of the foundation federation would have been made  with all the dire consequences that seldon had outlined .  that this one out of eight chance did not take place was surely due to mayor branno .   it was certain she would not have allowed it .  through periods of considerable unpopularity  she had held to her decision that terminus was the traditional seat of the foundation and there it would remain .  her political enemies had caricatured her strong jaw  with some effectiveness  it had to be admitted  as an underslung granite block .   and now seldon had backed her point of view and  for the while at least  that would give her an overwhelming political advantage .  she had been reported to have said a year earlier that if in the coming appearance seldon did back her  she would consider her task successfully completed .  she would then retire and take up the role of elder statesperson  rather than risk the dubious results of further political wars .   no one had really believed her .  she was at home in the political wars to an extent few before her had been  and now that seldon s image had come and gone there was no hint of retirement about her .   she spoke in a perfectly clear voice with an unashamed foundation accent  she had once served as ambassador to mandrels  but had not adopted the old imperial style of speech that was so fashionable now and was part of what had been a quasi imperial drive to the inner provinces  .   she said   the seldon crisis is over and it is a tradition  and a wise one  that no reprisals of any kind either in deed or in speech  be taken against those who supported the wrong side .  many honest people believed they had good reason for wanting that which seldon did not want .  there is no point in humiliating them to the point where they can retrieve their self respect only by denouncing the seldon plan itself .  in turn  it is a strong and desirable custom that those who supported the lost side accept the loss cheerfully and without further discussion .  the issue is behind us  on both sides  forever .    she paused  gazed levelly at the assembled faces for a moment  then went on   half the time has passed  people of the council  half the thousand year stretch between empires .  it has been a time of difficulties  but we have come a fang way .  we are  indeed  almost a galactic empire already and there remain no external enemies of consequence .    the interregnum would have endured thirty thousand years  were it not for the seldon plan .  after thirty thousand years of disintegration  it might be there would be no strength left with which to form an empire again .  there might be left only isolated and probably dying worlds .    what we have today we owe to hari seldom and it is upon his long dead mind that we must rely far the rest .  the danger henceforward  councillors  is ourselves  and from this point on there must be no official doubt of the value of the flan .  let us agree nosy  quietly and firmly  that there are to be no official doubts  criticisms  or condemnations of the plan .  we must support it completely .  it has proved itself over five centuries .  it is the security o    humanity and it must not be tampered with .  is it agreed .    there was a quiet murmur .  the mayor hardly looked up to seek visual proof of agreement .  she knew every member of the council and how each would react .  in the wake of the victory  there would be no objection now .  next year perhaps .  not now .  she would tackle the problems of next year next year .   always except for    thought control  mayor branno .   asked golan trevize  striding down the aisle and speaking loudly  as though to make up for the silence of the rest .  he did not bother to take his seat which  since he was a new member  was in fine back row .   branno still did not look up .  she said   your views  councilman trevize .     that the government cannot impose a ban on free speech  that all individuals most certainly including councilmen and councilwomen who have been elected for the purpose have a right to discuss the political issues of the day  and that no political issue can possibly be divorced from the seldon plan    branno folded her hands and looked up .  her face was expressionless .  she said   councilman trevize  you have entered this debate irregularly and were out of order in doing so .  however  i asked you to state your views and i will now answer you .    there is no limit to free speech within the context of the seldon plan .  it is only the plan itself that limits us by its very nature .  there can be many ways of interpreting events before the image makes the final decision  but once he makes that decision it can be questioned no further in council .  nor may it be questioned in advance as though one were to say   if hari seldon were to state thus and so  he would be wrong .      and yet if one honestly felt so  madam mayor .     then one could say so  if one were a private individual  discussing fine matter in a private context .     you mean  then  that the limitations on free speech which you propose are to apply entirely and specifically to government officials .     exactly .  this is not a new principle of foundation law .  it has been applied before by mayors of all parties .  a private point of view means nothing  an official expression of opinion carries weight and can be dangerous .  we have not come this far to risk danger now .     may i point out  madam mayor  that this principle of yours has been applied  sparsely and occasionally  to specific acts of council .  it has never been applied to something as vast and indefinable as the seldon plan .     the seldon plan needs the protection most  for it is precisely there that questioning can be most fatal .     will you not consider  mayor branno   trevize turned  addressing now the seated rows of council members  who seemed one and ail to have caught their breath  as though awaiting the outcome of a duel .   will you not consider  council members  that there is every reason to think that there is no seldon plan at all .     we have all witnessed its workings today   said mayor branno  even more quietly as trevize became louder and more oratorical .    it is precisely because we have seen its workings today  councilmen and councilwomen  that we can see that the seldon plan  as we have been taught to believe it to be  cannot exist .     councilman trevize  you are out of order and must not continue along these lines .     i have the privilege of office  mayor .     that privilege has been withdrawn  councilman .     you cannot withdraw the privilege .  your statement limiting free speech cannot  in itself  have the force of law .  there has been no formal vote in council  mayor  and even if there were i would have the right to question its legality .     the withdrawal  councilman  has nothing to do with my statement protecting the seldon plan .     on what  then  does it depend .     you are accused of treason  councilman .  i wish to do the council the courtesy of not arresting you within the council chamber  but waiting at the door are members of security who will take you into custody as you leave .  i will ask you now to leave quietly .  if you make any ill considered move  then  of course  that will be considered a present danger and security will enter the chamber .  i trust you will not make that necessary .    trevize frowned .  there svgs absolute silence in the hall .   did everyone expect this   everyone but himself and compor .   he looked back at the exit .  he saw nothing  but he had no doubt that mayor branno was not bluffing .   he stammered in rage .     repre represent an important constituency  mayor branno     no doubt  they will be disappointed in you .     on what evidence do you bring forth this wild charge .     that will appear in due course  but be assured that we have all we need .  you are a most indiscreet young man and should realize that someone may be your friend and yet not be willing to accompany you into treason    trevize whirled to meet compor s blue eyes .  they met his stonily .   mayor branno said calmly   i call upon all to witness that when i made my last statement  councilman trevize turned to look at councilman compor .  will you leave now  councilman  or will you force us to engage in the indignity of an arrest within the chamber .    golan trevize turned  mounted the steps again  and  at the door  two men in uniform  well armed  fell in on either side .   and harla branno  looking after him impassively  whispered through barely parted lips   fool .    liono kodell had been director of security through all of mayor branno s administration .  it was not a backbreaking job  as he liked to say  but whether he was lying or not  one could not  of course  tell .  he didn t look like a liar  but that did not necessarily mean anything .   he looked comfortable and friendly  and it might well be that this was appropriate for the job .  he was rather below the average height  rather above the average weight  had a bushy mustache  most unusual for a citizen of terminus  that was now more white than gray  bright brown eyes  and a characteristic patch of primary color marking the outer breast pocket of his drab coverall .   he said   sit down  trevize .  let us keep this on a friendly basis if we can .     friendly .  with a traitor .   trevize hooked both his thumbs in his sash and remained standing .    with an accused traitor .   we have not yet come to the point where accusation even by the mayor herself is the equivalent of conviction .  i trust we never do .  my job is to clear you  if i can .  i would much rather do so now while no harm is done except  perhaps  to your pride rather than be forced to make it all a matter of a public trial .  i hope you are with me in this .    trevize didn t soften .  he said   let s not bother with ingratiation .  your job is to badger me as though i were a traitor .  i am not one  and i resent the necessity of having to have that point demonstrated to your satisfaction .  why should you not have to prove your loyalty to my satisfaction .     in principle  none .  the sad fact  however  is that i have power on my side  and you have none on yours .  because of that  it is my privilege to question  and not yours .  if any suspicion of disloyalty or treason fell upon me  by the way  i imagine i would find myself replaced  and i would then be questioned by someone else  who  i earnestly hope  would treat me no worse than i intend to treat you .     and how do you intend to treat me .     like  i trust  a friend and an equal  if you will so treat me .     shall i stand you a drink .   asked trevize bitterly .    later  perhaps  but for now  please sit down .  i ask it as a friend .    trevize hesitated  then sat .  any further defiance suddenly seemed meaningless to him .   what now .   he said .    now  may i ask that you will answer my questions truthfully and completely and without evasion .     and if not .  what is the threat behind it .  a psychic probe .     i trust not .     i trust not  too .  not on a councilman .  it will reveal no treason  and when i am then acquitted  i will have your political head and the mayor s too  perhaps .  it might almost be worth making you try a psychic probe .    kodell frowned and shook his head slightly .   oh no .  oh no .  too much danger of brain damage .  it s slow healing sometimes  and it would not be worth your while .  definitely .  you know  sometimes  when the probe is used in exasperation     a threat  kodell .     a statement of fact  trevize .   don t mistake me  councilman .  if i must use the probe i will  and even if you are innocent you will have no recourse .     what do you want to know .    kodell closed a switch on the desk before him .  he said   what i ask and what you answer to my questions will be recorded  both sight and sound .  i do not want any volunteered statements from you  or anything nonresponsive .  not at this time .  you understand that  i am sure .     i understand that you will record only what you please   said trevize contemptuously .    that is right  but again  don t mistake me .  i wilt not distort anything you say .  i will use it or not use it  that is all .  but you will know what i will not use and you will not waste my time and yours .    we ll see .     we have reason to think  councilman trevize  and somehow the touch of added formality in his voice was evidence enough that he was recording  that you have stated openly  and on a number of occasions  that you do not believe in the existence of the seldon plan .    trevize said slowly   if i have said so openly  and on a number of occasions  what more do you need .     let us not waste time with quibbles  councilman .  you know that what i want is an open admission in your own voice  characterized by its own voiceprints  under conditions where you are clearly in perfect command of yourself .     because  i suppose  the use of any hypno effect  chemical or otherwise  would alter the voiceprints .     quite noticeably .     and you are anxious to demonstrate that you have made use of no illegal methods in questioning a councilman .  i don t blame you  .  .    i m glad you do not blame me  councilman .  then let us continue .  you have stated openly  and on a number of occasions  that you do not believe in the existence of the seldon plan .  do you admit that .    trevize said slowly  choosing his words   i do not believe that what we call seldon s plan has the significance we usually apply to it .    a vague statement .  would you care to elaborate .     my view is that the usual concept that hari seldon  five hundred years ago  making use of the mathematical science of psychohistory  worked out the course of human events to the last detail and that we are following a course designed to take us from the first galactic empire to the second galactic empire along the line of maximum probability  is naive .  it cannot be so     do you mean that  in your opinion  hari seldon never existed .     not at all .  of course he existed .     that he never evolved the science of psychohistory .     no  of course i don t mean any such thing .  see here  director  i would have explained this to the council if i had been allowed to  and i will explain it to you .  the truth of what i am going to say is so plain    the director of security had quietly  and quite obviously  turned off the recording device .   trevize paused and frowned .   why did you do that .     you are wasting my time  councilman .  i am not asking you for speeches .     you are asking me to explain my views  aren t you .     not at all .  i am asking you to answer questions simply  directly  and straightforwardly .  answer only the questions and offer nothing that i do not ask for .  do that and this won t take long .    trevize said   you mean you will elicit statements from me that will reinforce the official version of what i am supposed to have done .     we ask you only to make truthful statements  and i assure you we will not distort them .  please  let me try again .  we were talking about hari seldon .   the recording device was in action once more and kodell repeated calmly   that he never evolved the science o    psychohistory .     of course he evolved the science that we call psychohistory   said trevize  failing to mask his impatience  and gesturing with exasperated passion .    which you would define how .     galaxy .  it is usually defined as that branch of mathematics that deals with the overall reactions of large groups of human beings to given stimuli under given conditions .  in other words  it is supposed to predict social and historical changes     you say  supposed to  do you question that from the standpoint of mathematical expertise .     no   said trevize .   i am not a psychohistorian .  nor is any member of the foundation government  nor any citizen of terminus  nor any    kodell s hand raised .  he said softly   councilman  please .   and trevize was silent .   kodell said   have you any reason to suppose that hari seldon did not make the necessary analysis that would combine  as efficiently as possible  the factors of maximum probability and shortest duration in the path leading from the first to the second empire by way of the foundation .     i wasn t there   said trevize sardonically .   how can i know .     can you know he didn t .   no .    do you deny  perhaps  that the holographic image of hari seldon that has appeared during each of a number of historical crises over the past five hundred years is  in actual fact  a reproduction of hari seldon himself  made in the last year of his life  shortly before the establishment of the foundation .     i suppose i can t deny that .     you  suppose .   would you care to say that it is a fraud  a hoax devised by someone in past history for some purpose .    trevize sighed .   no .  i am not maintaining that .     are you prepared to maintain that the messages that hari seldon delivers are in any way manipulated by anyone at all .     no .  i have no reason to think that such manipulation is either possible or useful .     i see .  you witnessed this most recent appearance of seldon s image .  did you find that his analysis prepared five hundred years ago did not match the actual conditions of today quite closely .     on the contrary   said trevize with sudden glee .   it matched very closely .    kodell seemed indifferent to the other s emotion .   and yet  councilman  after the appearance of seldon  you still maintain that the seldon plan does not exist .     of course i do .  i maintain it does not exist precisely because the analysis matched so perfectly    kodell had turned off the recorder .   councilman   he said  shaking his head   you put me to the trouble of erasing .  i ask if you still maintain this odd belief of yours and you start giving me reasons .  let me repeat my question .    he said   and yet  councilman  after the appearance of seldon  you still maintain that the seldon plan does not exist .     how do you know that .  no one had a chance to speak to my informer friend  compor  after the appearance .     let us say we guessed  councilman .  and let us say you have already answered   of course i do  if you will say that once more without volunteering added information  we can get on with it .     of course i do   said trevize ironically .    well   said kodell   i will choose whichever of the  of course i do s  sounds more natural .  thank you  councilman   and the recording device was turned off again .   trevize said   is that it .     for what i need  yes .     what you need  quite clearly  is a set of questions and answers that you can present to terminus and to all the foundation federation which it rules  in order to show that i accept the legend of the seldon plan totally .  that will make any denial of it that i later make seem quixotic or outright insane .     or even treasonable in the eyes of an excited multitude which sees the plan as essential to the foundation s safety .  it will perhaps not be necessary to publicize this  councilman trevize  if we can come to some understanding  but if it should prove necessary we will see to it that the federation hears .     are you fool enough  sir   said trevize  frowning   to be entirely uninterested in what i really have to say .     as a human being i am very interested  and if an appropriate time comes i will listen to you with interest and a certain amount of skepticism .  as director of security  however  i have  at the present moment  exactly what i want    i hope you know that this will do you  and the mayor  no good .     oddly enough  i am not at all of that opinion .  you will now leave .  under guard  of course .     where am i to be taken .    kodell merely smiled .   good bye  councilman .  you were not perfectly co operative  but it would have been unrealistic to have expected you to be .    he held out his hand .   trevize  standing up  ignored it .  he smoothed the creases out of his sash and said   you only delay the inevitable .  others must think as i do now  or will come to think that way later .  to imprison me or to kill me will serve to inspire wonder and  eventually  accelerate such thinking .  in the end the truth and i shall win .    kodell took back his hand and shook his head slowly .   really  trevize   he said .   you are a fool .    it was not till midnight that two guards came to remove trevize from what was  he had to admit  a luxurious room at security headquarters .  luxurious but locked .  a prison cell by any name .   trevize had over four hours to second guess himself bitterly  striding restlessly across the floor for much of the period .   why did he trust compor .   why not .  he had seemed so clearly in agreement .   no  not that .  he had seemed so ready to be argued into agreement .   no  not that  either .  he had seemed so stupid  so easily dominated  so surely lacking a mind and opinions of his own that trevize enjoyed the chance of using him as a comfortable sounding board .  compor had helped trevize improve and hone his opinions .  he had been useful and trevize had trusted him for no other reason than that it had been convenient to do so .   but it was useless now to try to decide whether he ought to have seen through compor .  he should have followed the simple generalization  trust nobody .   yet can one go through life trusting nobody .   clearly one had to .   and who would have thought that branno would have had the audacity to pluck a councilman out of the council and that not one of the other councilmen would move to protect one of their own .  though they had disagreed with trevize to their very hearts  though they would have been ready to bet their blood  drop by drop  on branno s rightness  they should still  on principle  have interposed themselves against this violation of their prerogatives .  branno the bronze she was sometimes called  and she certainly acted with metallic rigor    unless she herself was already in the grip   no .  that way led to paranoia .   and yet   his mind tiptoed in circles  and had not broken out of uselessly repetitive thought when the guards came .    you will have to come with us  councilman   the senior of the two said with unemotional gravity .  his insignia showed him to be a lieutenant .  he had a small scar on his right cheek  and he looked tired  as though he had been at his job too long and had done too little as might be expected of a soldier whose people had been at peace for over a century .   trevize did not budge .   your name  lieutenant .     i am lieutenant evander sopellor  councilman .     you realize you are breaking the law  lieutenant sopellor .  you cannot arrest a councilman .    the lieutenant said   we have our direct orders  sir .     that does not matter .  you cannot be ordered to arrest a councilman .  you must understand that you will be liable for court martial as a result .    the lieutenant said   you are not being arrested  councilman .     then i don t have to go with you  do i .     we have been instructed to escort you to your home .     i know the way .     and to protect you en route .     from what .   or from whom .     from any mob that may gather .     at midnight .     it is why we have waited for midnight  sir .   and now  sir  for your protection we must ask you to come with us .  may i say not as a threat but as a matter of information that we are authorized to use force if necessary .    trevize was aware of the neuronic whips with which they were armed .  he rose with what he hoped was dignity .   to my home  then .   or will i find out that you are going to take me to prison .     we have not been instructed to lie to you  sir   said the lieutenant with a pride of his own .  trevize became aware that he was in the presence of a professional man who would require a direct order before he would lie and that even then his expression and his tone of voice would give him away .   trevize said   i ask your pardon  lieutenant .  i did not mean to imply that i doubted your word .    a ground car was waiting for them outside .  the street was empty and there was no sign of any human being  let alone a mob but the lieutenant had been truthful .  he had not said there was a mob outside or that one would form .  he had referred to  any mob that may gather .   he had only said  may .    the lieutenant had carefully kept trevize between himself and the car .  trevize could not have twisted away and made a run for it .  the lieutenant entered immediately after him and sat beside him in the back .   the car moved off .   trevize said   once i am home  i presume i may then go about my business freely that i may leave  for instance  if i choose .     we have no order to interfere with you  councilman  in any way  except insofar as we are ordered to protect you .     insofar .  what does that mean in this case .     i am instructed to tell you that once you are home  you may not leave it .  the streets are not safe for you and i am responsible for your safety .     you mean i am under house arrest .     i am not a lawyer  councilman .  i do not know what that means .    he gazed straight ahead  but his elbow made contact with trevize s side .  trevize could not have moved  however slightly  without the lieutenant becoming aware of it .   the car stopped before trevize s small house in the suburb of flexner .  at the moment  he lacked a housemate flavella having wearied of the erratic life that council membership had forced upon him so he expected no one to be waiting for him .    do i get out now .   trevize asked .    i will get out first  councilman .  we will escort you in .     for my safety .     yes  sir .    there were two guards waiting inside his front door .  a night light was gleaming  but the windows had been opacified and it was not visible from outside .   for a moment  he was indignant at the invasion and then he dismissed it with an inward shrug .  if the council could not protect him in the council chamber itself  then surely his house could not serve as his castle .   trevize said   how many of you do i have in here altogether .  a regiment .     no  councilman   came a voice  hard and steady .   just one person aside from those you see  and i have been waiting for you long enough .    harla branno  mayor of terminus  stood in the door that led into the living room .   time enough  don t you think  for us to talk .    trevize stared .   all this rigmarole to    but branno said in a low  forceful voice .   quiet  councilman .   and you four  outside .  outside .   all will be well in here .    the four guards saluted and turned on their heels .  trevize and branno were alone .     chapter two  mayor    branno had been waiting for an hour  thinking wearily .  technically speaking  she was guilty of breaking and entering .  what s more  she had violated  quite unconstitutionally  the rights of a councilman .  by the strict laws that held mayors to account since the days of indbur iii and the mute  nearly two centuries before she was impeachable .   on this one day  however  for twenty four hours she could do no wrong .   but it would pass .  she stirred restlessly .   the first two centuries had been the golden age of the foundation  the heroic era at least in retrospect  if not to the unfortunates who had lived in that insecure time .  salvor hardin and hober mallow had been the two great heroes  semideified to the point of rivaling the incomparable hari seldon himself .  the three were a tripod on which all foundation legend  and even foundation history  rested .   in those days  though  the foundation had been one puny world  with a tenuous hold on the four kingdoms and with only a dim awareness of the extent to which the seldon plan was holding its protective hand over it  caring for it even against the remnant of the mighty galactic empire .   and the more powerful the foundation grew as a political and commercial entity  the less significant its rulers and fighters had come to seem .  lathan devers was almost forgotten .  if he was remembered at all  it was for his tragic death in the slave mines  rather than for his unnecessary but successful fight against bel riose .   as for bel riose  the noblest of the foundation s adversaries  he too was nearly forgotten  overshadowed by the mule  who alone among enemies had broken the seldon plan and defeated and ruled the foundation .  he alone was the great enemy indeed  the last of the greats .   it was little remembered that the mule had been  in essence  defeated by one person a woman  bayta darell and that she had accomplished the victory without the help of anyone   without even the support of the seldon plan .  so  too  was it almost forgotten that her son and granddaughter  toran and arkady darrell  had defeated the second foundation  leaving the foundation  the first foundation  supreme .   these latter day victors were no longer heroic figures .  the times had become too expansive to do anything but shrink heroes into ordinary mortals .  then  too  arkady s biography of her grandmother had reduced her from a heroine to a figure of romance .   and since then there had been no heroes not even figures of romance .  the kalganian war had been the last moment of violence engulfing the foundation and that had been a minor conflict .  nearly two centuries of virtual peace .  a hundred and twenty years without so much as a ship scratched .   it had been a good peace branno would not deny that a profitable peace .  the foundation had not established a second galactic empire it was only halfway there by the seldon plan but  as the foundation federation  it held a strong economic grip on over a third of the scattered political units of the galaxy  and influenced what it didn t control .  there were few places where  i am of the foundation  was not met with respect .  there was no one who ranked higher in all the millions of inhabited worlds than the mayor of terminus .   that was still the title .  it was inherited from the leader of a single small and almost disregarded city on a lonely world on the far edge of civilization  some five centuries before  but no one would dream of changing it or of giving it one atom more glory in sound .  as it was  only the all but forgotten title of imperial majesty could rival it in awe .    except on terminus itself  where the powers of the mayor were carefully limited .  the memory of the indburs still remained .  it was not their tyranny that people could not forget but the fact that they had lost to the mule .   and here she was  harla branno  the strongest to rule since the mule s death  she knew that  and only the fifth woman to do so .  on this day only had she been able to use her strength openly .   she had fought for her interpretation of what was right and what should be against the dogged opposition of those who longed for the prestige filled interior of the galaxy and for the aura of imperial power and she had won .   not yet  she had said .  not yet .  jump too soon for the interior and you will lose far this reason and for that .  and seldon had appeared and had supported her in language almost identical with her own .   it made her  for a time  in the eyes of all fine foundation  as wise as seldon himself .  she knew they could forget that any hour  however .   and this young man dared to challenge her on this day of days .   and he dared to be right .   that was the danger of it .  he was right .  and by being right  he might destroy the foundation .   and now she faced him and they were alone .   she said sadly   could you not have come to see me privately .  did you have to shout it all out in the council chamber in your idiotic desire to make a fool of me .  what have you done  you mindless boy .    trevize felt himself flushing and fought to control his anger .  the mayor was an aging woman who would be sixty three on her next birthday .  he hesitated to engage in a shouting match with someone nearly twice his age .   besides  she was well practiced in the political wars and knew that if she could place her opponent off balance at the start then the battle was half won .  but it took an audience to make such a tactic effective and there was no audience before whom one might be humiliated .  there were just the two of them .   so he ignored her words and did his best to survey her dispassionately .  she was an old woman wearing the unisex fashions which had prevailed for two generations now .  they did not become her .  the mayor  the leader of the galaxy if leader there could be was just a plain old woman who might easily have been mistaken for an old man  except that her iron gray hair was tied tightly back  instead of being worn free in the traditional male style .   trevize smiled engagingly .  however much an aged opponent strove to make the epithet  boy  sound like an insult  this particular  boy  had the advantage of youth and good looks and the full awareness of both .   he said   it s true .  i m thirty two and  therefore  a boy in a manner of speaking .  and i m a councilman and  therefore  ex officio  mindless .  the first condition is unavoidable .  for the second  i can only say i m sorry .     do you know what you ve done .  don t stand there and strive for wit .  sit down .  put your mind into gear  if you can  and answer me rationally .     i know what i ve done .  i ve told the truth as i ve seen it .     and on this day you try to defy me with it .  on this one day when my prestige is such that i could pluck you out of the council chamber and arrest you  with no one daring to protest .     the council will recover its breath and it will protest .  they may be protesting now .  and they will listen to me all the more for the persecution to which you are subjecting me .     no one will listen to you  because if i thought you would continue what you have been doing  i would continue to treat you as a traitor to the full extent of the law .     i would then have to be tried .  .  i d have my day in court .     don t count on that .  a mayor s emergency powers are enormous  even if they are rarely used .     on what grounds would you declare an emergency .     i ll invent the grounds .  i have that much ingenuity left  and i do not fear taking the political risk .  don t push me  young man .  we are going to come to an agreement here or you will never be free again .  you will be imprisoned for the rest of your life .  i guarantee it .   they stared at each other  branno in gray  trevize in multishade brown .   trevize said   what kind of an agreement .     ah .  you re curious .  that s better .  then we can engage in conversation instead of confrontation .  what is your point of view .     you know it well .  you have been crawling in the mud with councilman compor  have you not .     i want to hear it from you in the light of the seldon crisis just passed .     very well  if that s what you want madam mayor .    he had been on the brink of saying  old woman .     the image of seldon was too correct  too impossibly correct after five hundred years .  it s the eighth time he has appeared  i believe .  on some occasions  no one was there to hear him .  on at least one occasion  in the time of indbur iii  what he had to say was utterly out of synchronization with reality but that was in the time of the mule  wasn t it .  but when  on any of those occasions  was he as correct as he was now .    trevize allowed himself a small smile .   never before  madam mayor  as far as our recordings of the past are concerned  has seldon managed to describe the situation so perfectly  in all its smallest details .    branno said   is it your suggestion that the seldon appearance  the holographic image  is faked  that the seldon recordings have been prepared by a contemporary such as myself  perhaps  that an actor was playing the seldon role .     not impossible  madam mayor  but that s not what i mean .  the truth is far worse .  i believe that it is seldon s image we see  and that his description of the present moment in history is the description he prepared five hundred years ago .  i have said as much to your man  kodell  who carefully guided me through a charade in which i seemed to support the superstitions of the unthinking foundationer .     yes .  the recording will be used  if necessary  to allow the foundation to see that you were never really in the opposition .    trevize spread his arms .   but i am .  there is no seldon plan in the sense that we believe there is  and there hasn t been for perhaps two centuries .  i have suspected that for years now  and what we went through in the time vault twelve hours ago proves it .     because seldon was too accurate .     precisely .  don t smile .  that is the final proof .     i m not smiling  as you can see .  go on .     how could he have been so accurate .  two centuries ago  seldon s analysis of what was then the present was completely wrong .  three hundred years had passed since the foundation was set up and he was wide of the mark .  completely .     that  councilman  you yourself explained a few moments ago .  it was because of the mule .  the mule was a mutant with intense mental power and there had been no way of allowing for him in the plan .     but he was there just the same allowed or not .  the seldon plan was derailed .  the mule didn t rule for long and he had no successor .  the foundation regained its independence and its domination  but how could the seldon plan have gotten back on target after so enormous a tearing of its fabric .    branno looked grim and her aging hands clasped together tightly .   you know the answer to that .      e were one of two foundations .  you ve read the history books .     i ve read arkady s biography of her grandmother required reading in school  after all and i ve read her novels  too .  i ve read the official view of the history of the mule and afterward .  am i to be allowed to doubt them .     in what way .     officially we  the first foundation  were to retain the knowledge of the physical sciences and to advance them .  we were to operate openly  our historical development following whether we knew it or not the seldon plan .  there was  however  also the second foundation  which was to preserve and further develop the psychological sciences  including psychohistory  and their existence was to be a secret even from us .  the second foundation was the fine tuning agency of the plan  acting to adjust the currents of galactic history  when they turned from the paths outlined by the plan .     then you answer yourself   said the mayor .   bayta darell defeated the mule  perhaps under the inspiration of the second foundation  although her granddaughter insists that was not so .  it was the second foundation without doubt  however  which labored to bring galactic history back to the plan after the mule died and  quite obviously  they succeeded .   what on terminus  then  are you talking about  councilman .     madam mayor  if we follow arkady darell s account  it is clear that the second foundation  in making the attempt to correct galactic history  undermined seldon s entire scheme  since in their attempt to correct they destroyed their own secrecy .  we  the first foundation  realized that our mirror image  the second foundation  existed  and we could not live with the knowledge that we were being manipulated .  we therefore labored to find the second foundation and to destroy it .    branno nodded .   and we succeeded  according to arkady darell s account  but quite obviously  not until the second foundation had placed galactic history firmly on track again after its disruption by the mule .  it is still on track .     can you believe that .  the second foundation  according to the account  was located and its various members dealt with .  that was in     f . e .   a hundred twenty years ago .  for five generations  the have supposedly been operating without the second foundation  and yet have remained so close to target where the plan is concerned that you and the image of seldon spoke almost identically .     this might be interpreted to mean that i have seen into the significance of developing history with keen insight     forgive me .  i do not intend to cast doubt upon your keen insight  but to me it seems that the more obvious explanation is that the second foundation was never destroyed .  it still rules us .  it still manipulates us .   and that is why we have returned to the track of the seldon plan .    if the mayor was shocked by the statement  she showed no sign of it .   it was past   a . m .  and she wanted desperately to bring an end to it  and yet could not hasten .  the young man had to be played and she did not want to have him break the fishing line .  she did not want to have to dispose of him uselessly  when he might first be made to serve a function .   she said   indeed .  you say then that arkady s tale of the kalganian war and the destruction of the second foundation was false .  invented .  a game .  a lie .    trevize shrugged .   it doesn t have to be .  that s beside the point .  suppose arkady s account were completely true  to the best of her knowledge .  suppose all took place exactly as arkady said it did  that the nest of second foundationers was discovered  and that they were disposed of .  how can we possibly say  though  that we got every last one of them .  the second foundation was dealing with the entire galaxy .  they were not manipulating the history of terminus alone or even of the foundation alone .  their responsibilities involved more than our capital world or our entire federation .  there were bound to be some second foundationers that were a thousand  or more parsecs away .  is it likely we would have gotten them all .    and if we failed to get them all  could we say we had won .  could the mule have said it in his time .  he took terminus  and with it all the worlds it directly controlled but the independent trading worlds still stood .  he took the trading worlds yet three fugitives remained  ebling mis  bayta darell  and her husband .  he kept both men under control and left bayta only bayta uncontrolled .  he did this out of sentiment  if we are to believe arkady s romance .  and that was enough .  according to arkady s account  one person only bayta was left to do as she pleased  and because of her actions the mule was not able to locate the second foundation and was therefore defeated .    one person left untouched  and all was lost .  that s the importance of one person  despite all the legends that surround seldon s plan to the effect that the individual is nothing and the mass is all .    and if we left not just one second foundationer behind  but several dozen  as seems perfectly likely  what then .  would they not gather together  rebuild their fortunes  take up their careers again  multiply their numbers by recruitment and training  and once mare make us all pawns .    branno said gravely   do you believe that .     i am sure of it .     but tell me  councilman .  why should they bother .  why should the pitiful remnant continue to cling desperately to a duty no one welcomes .  what drives them to keep the galaxy along its path to the second galactic empire .  and if the small band insists on fulfilling its mission  why should we care .  why not accept the path of the plan and be thankful that they will see to it that we do not stray or lose our way .    trevize put his hand over his eyes and rubbed them .  despite his youth  he seemed the more tired of the two .  he stared at the mayor and said   i can t believe you .  are you under the impression that the second foundation is doing this for us .  that they are some sort of idealists .  isn t it clear to you from your knowledge of politics of the practical issues of power and manipulation that they are doing it for themselves .    we are the cutting edge .  we are the engine  the force .  we labor and sweat and bleed and weep .  they merely control adjusting an amplifier here  closing a contact there  and doing it all with ease and without risk to themselves .  then  when it is all done and when  after a thousand years of heaving and straining  we have set up the second galactic empire  the people of the second foundation will move in as the ruling elite .    branno said   do you want to eliminate the second foundation then .  having moved halfway to the second empire  do you want to take the chance of completing the task on our own and serving as our own elite .  is that it .     certainly .  certainly .  shouldn t that be what you want  too .  you and i won t live to see it  but you have grandchildren and someday i may  and they will have grandchildren  and so on .  i want them to have the fruit of our labors and i want them to look back to us as the source  and to praise us for what we have accomplished .  i don t want it all to fall to a hidden conspiracy devised by seldon who is no hero of mine .  i tell you he is a greater threat than the mule if we allow his plan to go through .  by the galaxy  i wish the mule had disrupted the plan altogether and forever .  we would have survived him .  he was one of a kind and very mortal .  the second foundation seems to be immortal .     but you would like to destroy the second foundation  is that not so .     if i knew how .     since you don t know how  don t you think it quite likely they will destroy you .    trevize looked contemptuous .   i have had the thought that even you might be under their control .  your accurate guess as to what seldon s image would say and your subsequent treatment of me could be all second foundation .  you could be a hollow shell with a second foundation content .     then why are you talking to me as you are .     because if you are under second foundation control  i am lost in any case and i might as well expel some of the anger within me and because  in actual fact  i am gambling that you are not under their control  that you are merely unaware of what you do .    branno said   you win that gamble  at any rate .  i am not under anyone s control but my own .  still  can you be sure i am telling the truth .  were i under control of the second foundation  would i admit it .  would i even myself know that i was under their control .    but there is no profit in such questions .  i believe i am not under control and you have no choice but to believe it  too .  consider this  however .  if the second foundation exists  it is certain that their biggest need is to make sure that no one in the galaxy knows they exist .  the seldon plan only works well if the pawns we are not aware of how the plan works and of how we are manipulated .  it was because the mule focused the attention of the foundation on the second foundation that the second foundation was destroyed in arkady s time .   or should i say nearly destroyed  councilman .    from this we can deduce two corollaries .  first  we can reasonably suppose that they interfere grossly as little as they can .  we can assume it would be impossible to take us all over .  even the second foundation  if it exists  must have limits to its power .  to take over some and allow others to guess the fact would introduce distortions to the plan .  consequently  we come to the conclusion that their interference is as delicate  as indirect  as sparse as is possible and therefore i am not controlled .  nor are you    trevize said   that is one corollary and i tend to accept it out of wishful thinking  perhaps .  what is the other .     a simpler and more inevitable one .  if the second foundation exists and wishes to guard the secret of that existence  then one thing is sure .  anyone who thinks it still exists  and talks about it  and announces it  and shouts it to all the galaxy must  in some subtle way  be removed by them at once  wiped out  done away with .  wouldn t that be your conclusion  too .    trevize said   is that why you have taken me into custody  madam mayor .  to protect me from the second foundation .     in a way .  to an extent .  liono kodell s careful recording of your beliefs m   be publicized not only in order to keep the people o    terminus and the foundation from being unduly disturbed by your silly talk but to keep the second foundation from being disturbed .  if it exists  i do not want to have its attention drawn to you .     imagine that   said trevize with heavy irony .   for my sake .  for my lovely brown eyes .    branno stirred and then  quite without warning  laughed quietly .  she said   i am not so old  councilman  that i am not unaware that you have lovely brown eyes and  thirty years ago  that might have been motive enough .  at this time  however  i wouldn t move a millimeter to save them or all the rest of you if only your eyes were involved .  but if the second foundation exists  and if their attention  is drawn to you  they may not stop with you .  there s my life to consider  and that of a number of others far mare intelligent and valuable than you and all the plans we have made .     oh .  do you believe the second foundation exists  then  that you react so carefully to the possibility of their response .    branno brought her fist down upon the table before her .   of course i do  you consummate fool .  if i didn t know the second foundation exists  and if i weren t fighting them as hard and as effectively as i could  would i care what you say about such a subject .  if the second foundation did not exist  would it matter that you are announcing they do .  i ve wanted for months to shut you up before you went public  but lacked the political power to deal roughly with a councilman .  seldon s appearance made me look good and gave me the power if only temporarily and at that moment  you did go public .  i moved at once  and now i will have you killed without a twinge of conscience or a microsecond of hesitation if you don t do exactly as you re told .    our entire conversation now  at an hour in which i would much rather be in bed and asleep  was designed to bring you to the point of believing me when i tell you this .  i want you to know that the problem of the second foundation  which i was careful to have you outline  gives me reason enough and inclination to have you brainstopped without trial .    trevize half rose from his seat .   branno said   oh  don t make any moves .  i m only an old woman  as you re undoubtedly telling yourself  but before you could place a hand on me  you d be dead .  we are under observation  foolish young man  by my people .    trevize sat down .  he said  just a bit shakily   you make no sense .  if you believed the second foundation existed  you wouldn t be speaking of it so freely .  you wouldn t expose yourself to the dangers to which you say i am exposing myself .     you recognize  then  that i have a bit more good sense than you do .  in other words  you believe the second foundation exists  yet you speak freely about it  because you are foolish .  i believe it exists  and i speak freely  too but only because i have taken precautions .  since you seem to have read arkady s history carefully  you may recall that she speaks of her father having invented what she called a  mental static device .   it serves as a shield to the kind of mental power the second foundation has .  it still exists and has been improved on  too  under conditions of the greatest secrecy .  this house is  for the moment  reasonably safe against their prying .  with that understood  let me tell you what you are to do .     what s that .     you are to find out whether what you and i think is so is indeed so .  you are to find out if the second foundation still exists and  if so  where .  that means you will have to leave terminus and go i know not where even though it may in the end turn out  as in arkady s day  that the second foundation exists among us .  it means you will not return till you have something to tell us  and if you have nothing to tell us  you will never return  and the population of terminus will be less one fool .    trevize found himself stammering .   how on terminus can i look for them without giving away the fact .  they will simply arrange a death for me  and you will be none the wiser .     then don t look for them  you naive child .  look for something else .  look for something else with all your heart and mind  and if  in the process  you come across them because they have not bothered to pay you any attention  then goods you may  in that case  send us the information by shielded and coded hyperwave  and you may then return as a reward .     i suppose you have something in mind that i should look for .     of course i do .  do you know janov pelorat .     never heard of him .     you will meet him tomorrow .  he will tell you what you are looking for and he will leave with you in one of our most advanced ships .  there will be just the two of you  for two are quite enough to risk .  and if you ever try to return without satisfying us that you have the knowledge we want  then you will be blown out of space before you come within a parsec of terminus .  that s all .  this conversation is over .    she arose  looked at her bare hands  then slowly drew on her gloves .  she turned toward the door  and through it came two guards  weapons in hand .  they stepped apart to let her pass .   at the doorway she turned .   there are other guards outside .  do nothing that disturbs them or you will save us all the trouble of your existence .     you will also then lose the benefits i might bring you   said trevize and  with an effort  lie managed to say it lightly .    we ll chance that   said branno with an unamused smile .   outside liono kodell was waiting for her .  he said   i listened to the whole thing  mayor .  you were extraordinarily patient .     and i am extraordinarily tired .  i think the day has been seventy two hours long .  you take over now .     i will  but tell me  was there really a mental static device about the house .     oh  kodell   said branno wearily .   you know better than that .  what was the chance anyone was watching .  do you imagine the second foundation is watching everything  everywhere  always .  i m not the romantic young trevize is  he might think that  but i don t .  and even if that were the case  if second foundational eyes and ears were everywhere  would not the presence of an msd have given us away at once .  for that matter  would not its use have shown the second foundation a shield against its powers existed once they detected a region that was mentally opaque .  isn t the secret of such a shield s existence until we are quite ready to use it to the full   something worth not only more than trevize  but more than you and i together .  and yet    they were in the ground car  with kodell driving .   and yet   said kodell .    and yet what .   said branno .    oh yes .  and yet that young man is intelligent .  i called him a fool in various ways half a dozen times just to keep him in his place  but he isn t one .  he s young and he s read too many of arkady darell s novels  and they have made him think that that s the way the galaxy is but he has a quick insight about him and it will be a pity to lose him .     you are sure then that he will be lost .     quite sure   said branno sadly .   just the same  it is better that way .  we don t need young romantics charging about blindly and smashing in an instant  perhaps  what it has taken us years to build .  besides  he will serve a purpose .  he will surely attract the attention of the second foundationers always assuming they exist and are indeed concerning themselves with us .  and while they are attracted to him  they will  perchance  ignore us .  perhaps we can gain even more than the good fortune of being ignored .  they may  we can hope  unwittingly give themselves away to us in their concern with trevize  and let us have an opportunity and time to devise countermeasures .     trevize  then  draws the lightning .    branno s lips twitched .   ah  the metaphor i ve been looking for .  he is our lightning rod  absorbing the stroke and protecting us from harm .     and this pelorat  who wilt also be in the path of the lightning bolt .     he may suffer  too .  that can t be helped .    kodell nodded .   well  you know what salvor hardin used to say   never let your sense of morals keep you from doing what is right .      at the moment  i haven t got a sense of morals   muttered branno .   i have a sense of bone weariness .  and yet i could name a number of people i would sooner lose than golan trevize .  he is a handsome young man .   and  of course  he knows it .   her tact words slurred as she closed her eyes and fell into a light sleep .     chapter three  historian    janov pelorat was white haired and his face  in repose  looked rather empty .  it was rarefy in anything but repose .  he was of average height and weight and tended to move without haste and to speak with deliberation .  he seemed considerably older than his fifty two years .   he had never left terminus  something that was most unusual  especially for one of his profession .  he himself wasn t sure whether his sedentary ways were because of or in spite of his obsession with history .   the obsession had come upon him quite suddenly at the age of fifteen when  during some indisposition  he was given a book of early     legends .  in it  he found the repeated motif of a world that was alone and isolated   a world that was not even aware of its isolation  since it had never known anything else .   his indisposition began to clear up at once .  within two days  he had read the book three times and was out of bed .  the day after that he was at his computer terminal  checking for any records that the terminus university library might have on similar legends .   it was precisely such legends that had occupied him ever since .  the terminus university library had by no means been a great resource in this respect but  when he grew older  he discovered the joys of interlibrary loans .  he had printouts in his possession which had been taken off hyper radiational signals from as far away as ifnia .   he had become a professor of ancient history and was now beginning his first sabbatical   one for which he had applied with the idea of taking a trip through space  his first  to trantor itself   thirty seven years later .   pelorat was quite aware that it was most unusual for a person of terminus to have never been in space .  it had never been his intention to be notable in this particular way .  it was just that whenever he might have gone into space  some new book  some new study  some new analysis came his way .  he would delay his projected trip until he had wrung the new matter dry and had added  if possible  one more item of fact  or speculation  or imagination to the mountain he had collected .  in the end  his only regret was that the particular trip to trantor had never been made .   trantor had been the capital of the first galactic empire .  it had been the seat of emperors for twelve thousand years and  before that  the capital of one of the most important pre imperial kingdoms  which had  little by little  captured or otherwise absorbed the other kingdoms to establish the empire .   trantor had been a world girdling city  a metal coated city .  pelorat had read of it in the works of gaal dornick  who had visited it in the time of hari seldon himself .  dornick s volume no longer circulated and the one pelorat owned might have been sold for half the historian s annual salary .  a suggestion that he might part with it would have horrified the historian .   of course  what pelorat cared about  as far as trantor was concerned  was the galactic library  which in imperial times  when it was the imperial library  had been the largest in the galaxy .  trantor was the capital of the largest and most populous empire humanity had ever seen .  it had been a single worldwide city with a population well in excess of forty billion  and its library had been the gathered record of all the creative  and not so creative  work of humanity  the full summary of its knowledge .  and it was all computerized in so complex a manner that it took experts to handle the computers .   what was more  the library had survived .  to pelorat  that was the amazing thing about it .  when trantor had fallen and been sacked  nearly two and a half centuries before  it had undergone appalling destruction  and the tales of human misery and death would not bear repeating yet the library had survived  protected  it was said  by the university students  who used ingeniously devised weapons .   some thought the defense by the students might well have been thoroughly romanticized .    in any case  the library had endured through the period of devastation .  ebling mis had done his work in an intact library in a ruined world when he had almost located the second foundation  according to the story which the people of the foundation still believed  but which historians have always treated with reserve  .  the three generations of darells bayta  toran  and arkady had each  at one time or another  been on trantor .  however  arkady had not visited the library  and since her time the library had not impinged on galactic history .   no foundationer had been on trantor in a hundred and twenty years  but there was no reason to believe the library was not still there .  that it had made no impingement was the surest evidence in favor of its being there .  its destruction would surely have made a noise .   the library was outmoded and archaic it had been so even in ebling mis s time but that was all to the good .  pelorat always rubbed his hands with excitement when he thought of an old and outmoded library .  the older and the more outmoded  the more likely it was to have what he needed .  in his dreams  he would enter the library and ask in breathless alarm   has the library been modemized .  have you thrown out the old tapes and computerizations .   and always he imagined the answer from dusty and ancient librarians   as it has been  professor  so is it still .    and now his dream would come true .  the mayor herself had assured him of that .  how she had known of his work  he wasn t quite sure .  he had not succeeded in publishing many papers .  little of what he had done was solid enough to be acceptable for publication and what had appeared had left no mark .  still  they said branno the bronze knew all that went on in terminus and had eyes at the end of every finger and toe .  pelorat could almost believe it  but if she knew of his work  why on terminus didn t she see its importance and give him a little financial support before this .   somehow  he thought  with as much bitterness as he could generate  the foundation had its eyes fixed firmly on the future .  it was the second empire and their destiny that absorbed them .  they had no time  no desire  to peer back into the past and they were irritated by those who did .   the more fools they  of course  but he could not single handedly wipe out folly .  and it might be better so .  he could hug the great pursuit to his own chest and the day would come when he would be remembered as the great pioneer of the important .   that meant  of course  and he was too intellectually honest to refuse to perceive it   that he  too  was absorbed in the future a future in which he would be recognized  and in which he would be a hero on a par with hari seldon .  in fact  he would be the greater  for how could the working out of a clearly visualized future a millennium long stand comparison with the working out of a lost past at least twenty five millennia old .   and this was the day  this was the day .   the mayor had said it would be the day after seldon s image made its appearance .  that was the only reason pelorat had been interested in the seldon crisis that for months had occupied every mind on terminus and indeed almost every mind in the federation .   it had seemed to him to make the most trifling difference as to whether the capital of the foundation had remained here at terminus  or had been shifted somewhere else .  and now that the crisis had been resolved  he remained unsure as to which side of the matter hari seldon had championed  or if the matter under dispute had been mentioned at all .   it was enough that seldon had appeared and that now this was the day .   it was a little after two in the afternoon that a ground car slid to a halt in the driveway of his somewhat isolated house just outside terminus proper .   a rear door slid back .  a guard in the uniform of the mayoralty security corps stepped out  then a young man  then two more guards .   pelorat was impressed despite himself .  the mayor not only knew of his work but clearly considered it of the highest importance .  the person who was to be his companion was given an honor guard  and he had been promised a first class vessel which his companion would be able to pilot .  most flattering .  most   pelorat s housekeeper opened the door .  the young man entered and the two guards positioned themselves on either side of the entrance .  through the window  pelorat saw that the third guard remained outside and that a second ground car had now pulled up .  additional guards .   confusing .   he turned to find the young man in his room and was surprised to find that he recognized him .  he had seen him on holocasts .  he said   you re that councilman .  you re trevize .     golan trevize .  that s right .  you are professor janov pelorat .     yes  yes   said pelorat .   are you he who will     we are going to be fellow travelers   said trevize woodenly .   or so i have been told .     but you re not a historian .     no  i m not .  as you said  i m a councilman  a politician .     yes  yes  but what am i thinking about .  i am a historian  therefore what need for another .  you can pilot a spaceship .     yes  i m pretty good at that .     well  that s what we need  then .  excellent .  i m afraid i m not one of your practical thinkers  young man  so if it should happen that you are  we ll make a good team .    trevize said   i am not  at the moment  overwhelmed with the excellence of my own thinking  but it seems we have no choice but to try to make it a good team .     let s hope  then  that i can overcome my uncertainty about space .  i ve never been in space  you know  councilman .  i am a groundhog  if that s the term .  would you like a glass of tea  by the way .  i ll have moda prepare us something .  it is my understanding that it will be some hours before we leave  after all .  i am prepared right now  however .  i have what is necessary for both of us .  the mayor has been most co operative .  astonishing her interest in the project .    trevize said   you ve known about this  then .  how long .     the mayor approached me   here pelorat frowned slightly and seemed to be making certain calculations   two  or maybe three  weeks ago .  i was delighted .  and now that i have got it clear in my head that i need a pilot and not a second historian  i am also delighted that my companion will be you  my dear fellow .     two  maybe three  weeks ago   repeated trevize  sounding a little dazed .   she was prepared all this time  then .  and i   he faded out .    pardon me .     nothing  professor .  i have a bad habit of muttering to myself .  it is something you will have to grow accustomed to  if our trip extends itself .     it will .  it will   said pelorat  bustling the other to the dining room table  where an elaborate tea was being  prepared by his housekeeper .   quite open ended .  the mayor said we were to take as long as we liked and that the galaxy lay all before us and  indeed  that wherever we went we could call upon foundation funds .  she said  of course  that we would have to be reasonable .  i promised that much .   he chuckled and rubbed his hands   sit down  my good fellow  sit down .  this may be our last meal on terminus for a very long time .    trevize sat down .  he said   do you have a family  professor .     i have a son .  he s on the faculty at santanni university .  a chemist  i believe  or something like that .  he took after his mother s side .  she hasn t been with me for a long time  so you see i have no responsibilities  no active hostages to fortune .  i trust you have none   help yourself to the sandwiches  my boy .     no hostages at the moment .  a few women .  they come and go .     yes .  yes .  delightful when it works out .  even more delightful when you find it need not be taken seriously .   no children  i take it .    none .     good .  you know  i m in the most remarkable good humor .  i was taken aback when you first came in .  i admit it .  but i find you quite exhilarating now .  what i need is youth and enthusiasm and someone who can find his way about the galaxy .  we re on a search  you know .  a remarkable search .   pelorat s quiet face and quiet voice achieved an unusual animation without any particular change in either expression or intonation .   i wonder if you have been told about this .   trevize s eyes narrowed .   a remarkable search .     yes indeed .  a pearl of great price is hidden among the tens of millions of inhabited worlds in the galaxy and we have nothing but the faintest clues to guide us .  just the same  it will be an incredible prize if we can find it .  if you and i can carry it off  my boy   trevize  i should say  for i don t mean to patronize our names will ring down the ages to the end of time .     the prize you speak of this pearl of great price     i sound like arkady darell the writer  you know speaking of the second foundation  don t i .  no wonder you look astonished .   pelorat leaned his head back as though he were going to break into loud laughter but he merely smiled .   nothing so silly and unimportant  i assure you .    trevize said   if you are not speaking of the second foundation  professor  what are you speaking of .    pelorat was suddenly grave  even apologetic .   ah  then the mayor has not told you .   it is odd  you know .  i ve spent decades resenting the government and its inability to understand what i m doing  and now mayor branno is being remarkably generous .     yes   said trevize  not trying to conceal an intonation of irony   she is a woman of remarkable hidden philanthropy  but she has not told me what this is all about .     you are not aware of my research  then .     no .  i m sorry .     no need to excuse yourself .  perfectly all right .  i have not exactly made a splash .  then let me tell you .  you and i are going to search for and find  for i have an excellent possibility in mind earth .    trevize did not sleep well that night .   over and over  he thrashed about the prison that the old woman had built around him .  nowhere could he find a way out .   he was being driven into exile and he could do nothing about it .  she had been calmly inexorable and did not even take the trouble to mask the unconstitutionality of it all .  he had relied on his rights as a councilman and as a citizen of the federation  and she hadn t even paid them lip service .   and now this pelorat  this odd academic who seemed to be located in the world without being part of it  told him that the fearsome old woman had been making arrangements for this for weeks .   he felt like the  boy  that she had called him .   he was to be exiled with a historian who kept  dear fellowing  him and who seemed to be in a noiseless fit of joy over beginning a galactic search for earth .   what in the name of the mule s grandmother was earth .   he had asked .  of course .  he had asked upon the moment of its mention .   he had said   pardon me  professor .  i am ignorant of your specialty and i trust you won t be annoyed if i ask for an explanation in simple terms .  what is earth .    pelorat stared at him gravely while twenty seconds moved slowly past .  he said   it is a planet .  the original planet .  the one on which human beings first appeared  my dear fellow .    trevize stared .   first appeared .  from where .     from nowhere .  it s the planet on which humanity developed through evolutionary processes from lower animals .    trevize thought about it  then shook his head .   i don t know what you mean .    an annoyed expression crossed pelorat s face briefly .  he cleared his throat and said   there was a time when terminus had no human beings upon it .  it was settled by human beings from other worlds .  you know that  i suppose .     yes  of course   said trevize impatiently .  he was irritated at the other s sudden assumption of pedagogy .    very well .  this is true of all the other worlds .  anacreon  santanni  kalgan   all of them .  they were all  at some time in the past  founded .  people arrived there from other worlds .  it s true even of trantor .  it may have been a great metropolis for twenty thousand years  but before that it wasn t .     why  what was it before that .     empty .  at least of human beings .     that s hard to believe .     it s true .  the old records show it .     where did the people come from who first settled trantor .     no one is certain .  there are hundreds of planets which claim to have been populated in the dim mists of antiquity and whose people present fanciful tales about the nature of the first arrival of humanity .  historians tend to dismiss such things and to brood over the  origin question .    what is that .  i ve never heard of it .     that doesn t surprise me .  it s not a popular historical problem now  i admit  but there was a time during the decay of the empire when it roused a certain interest among intellectuals .  salvor hardin mentions it briefly in his memoirs .  it s the question of the identity and location of the one planet from which it all started .  if  we look backward in time  humanity flows inward from the most recently established worlds to older ones  to still older ones  until all concentrates on one the original .    trevize thought at once of the obvious flaw in the argument .   might there not have been a large number of originals .     of course not .  all human beings all over the galaxy are of a single species .  a single species cannot originate on more than one planet .  quite impossible .     how do you know .     in the first place   pelorat ticked off the first finger of his left hand with the first finger of his right  and then seemed to think better of what would undoubtedly have been a long and intricate exposition .  he put both hands at his side and said with great earnestness   my dear fellow  i give you my word of honor .    trevize bowed formally and said   i would not dream of doubting it  professor pelorat .  let us say  then  that there is one planet of origin  but might there not be hundreds who lay claim to the honor .     there not only might be  there are .  yet every claim is without merit .  not one of those hundreds that aspire to the credit of priority shows any trace of a prehyperspatial society  let alone any trace of human evolution from prehuman organisms .     then are you saying that there is a planet of origin  but that  for some reason  it is not making the claim .     you have hit it precisely .     and you are going to search for it .     we are .  that is our mission .  mayor branno has arranged it all .  you will pilot our ship to trantor .     to trantor .  it s not the planet of origin .  you said that much a while ago .     of course trantor isn t .  earth is .     then why aren t you telling me to pilot the ship to earth .     i am not making myself clear .  earth is a legendary name .  it is enshrined in ancient myths .  it has no meaning we can be certain of  but it is convenient to use the word as a one syllable synonym for  the planet of origin of the human species .   just which planet in real space is the one we are defining as  earth  is not known .     will they know on trantor .     i hope to find information there  certainly .  trantor possesses the galactic library  the greatest in the system .     surely that library has been searched by those people you said were interested in the  origin question  in the time of the first empire .    pelorat nodded thoughtfully   yes  but perhaps not well enough .  i have learned a great deal about the  origin question  that perhaps the imperials of five centuries back did not know .  i might search the old records with greater understanding  you see .  i have been thinking about this for a long time and i have an excellent possibility in mind .     you have told mayor branno all this  i imagine  and she approves .     approves .  my dear fellow  she was ecstatic .  she told me that trantor was surely the place to find out all i needed to know .     no doubt   muttered trevize .   that was part of what occupied him that night .  mayor branno was sending him out to find out what he could about the second foundation .  she was sending him with pelorat so that he might mask his real aim with the pretended search for earth a search that could carry him anywhere in the galaxy .  it was a perfect cover  in fact  and he admired the mayor s ingenuity .   but trantor .  where was the sense in that .  once they were on trantor  pelorat would find his way into the galactic library and would never emerge .  with endless stacks of books  films  and recordings  with innumerable computerizations and symbolic representations  he would surely never want to leave .   besides that    ebling mis had once gone to trantor  in the mule s time .  the story was that he had found the location of the second foundation there and had died before he could reveal it .  but then  so had arkady darell  and she had succeeded in locating the second foundation .  but the location she had found was on terminus itself  and there the nest of second foundationers was wiped out .  wherever the second foundation was now would be elsewhere  so what more had trantor to tell .  if be were looking for the second foundation  it was best to go anywhere but trantor .   besides that    what further plans branno had  he did not know  but he was not in the mood to oblige her .  branno had been ecstatic  had she  about a trip to trantor .  well  if branno wanted trantor  they were not going to trantor .   anywhere else .   but not trantor .   and worn out  with the night verging toward dawn  trevize fell at last into a fitful slumber .   mayor branno had had a good day on the one following the arrest of trevize .  she had been extolled far beyond her deserts and the incident was never mentioned .   nevertheless  she knew well that the council would soon emerge from its paralysis and that questions would be raised .  she would have to act quickly .  so  putting a great many matters to one side  she pursued the matter of trevize .   at the time when trevize and pelorat were discussing earth  branno was facing councilman munn li compor in the mayoralty office .  as he sat across the desk from her  perfectly at ease  she appraised him once again .   he was smaller and slighter than trevize and only two years older .  both were freshmen councilmen  young and brash  and that must have been the only thing that held them together  for they were different in all other respects .   where trevize seemed to radiate a glowering intensity  compor shone with an almost serene self confidence .  perhaps it was his blond hair and blue eyes  not at all common among foundationers .  they lent him an almost feminine delicacy that  branno judged  made him less attractive to women than trevize was .  he was clearly vain of his looks  though  and made the most of them  wearing his hair rather long and making sure that it was carefully waved .  he wore a faint blue shadowing under his eyebrows to accentuate the eye color .   shadowing of various tints had become common among men these last ten years .    he was no womanizer .  he lived sedately with his wife  but had not yet registered parental intent and was not known to have a clandestine second companion .  that  too  was different from trevize  who changed housemates as often as he changed the loudly colored sashes for which he was notorious .   there was little about either young councilman that kodell s department had not uncovered  and kodell himself sat quietly in one corner of the room  exuding a comfortable good cheer as always .   branno said   councilman compor  you have done the foundation good service  but unfortunately for yourself  it is not of the sort that can be praised in public or repaid in ordinary fashion .    compor smiled .  he had white and even teeth  and branno idly wondered  for one flashing moment if all the inhabitants of the sirius sector looked like that .  compor s tale of stemming from that particular  rather peripheral  region went back to his maternal grandmother  who had also been blond haired and blue eyed and who had maintained that her mother was from the sirius sector .  according to kodell  however  there was no hard evidence in favor of that .   women being what they were  kodell had said  she might well have claimed distant and exotic ancestry to add to her glamour and her already formidable attractiveness .    is that how women are .   branno had asked drily  and kodell had smiled and muttered that he was referring to ordinary women  of course .   compor said   it is not necessary that the people of the foundation know of my service only that you do .     i know and i will not forget .  what i also will not do is to let you assume that your obligations are now over .  you have embarked on a complicated course and you must continue .  we want more about trevize .     i have told you all i know concerning him .     that may be what you would have me believe .  that may even be what you truly believe yourself .  nevertheless  answer my questions .  do you know a gentleman named janov pelorat .    for just a moment compor s forehead creased  then smoothed itself almost at once .  he said carefully   i might know him if i were to see him  but the name does not seem to cause any association within me .     he is a scholar .    compor s mouth rounded into a rather contemptuous but unsounded  oh .   as though he were surprised that the mayor would expect him to know scholars .   branno said   pelorat is an interesting person who  for reasons of his own  has the ambition of visiting trantor .  councilman trevize will accompany him .  now  since you have been a good friend of trevize and  . perhaps know his system of thinking  tell me  do you think trevize will consent to go to trantor .    compor said   if you see to it that trevize gets on the ship  and if the ship is piloted to trantor  what can he do but go there .  surely you don t suggest he will mutiny and take over the ship .     you don t understand .  he and pelorat will be alone on the ship and it will be trevize at the controls .         you are asking whether he would go voluntarily to trantor .     yes  that is what i am asking .     madam mayor  how can i possibly know what he will do .     councilman compor  you have been close to trevize .  you know his belief in the existence of the second foundation .  has he never spoken to you of his theories as to where it might exist  where it might be found .     never  madam mayor .     do you think he will find it .    compor chuckled .   i think the second foundation  whatever it was and however important it might have been  was wiped out in the time of arkady darell .  i believe her story .     indeed .  in that case  why did you betray your friend .  if he were searching for something that does not exist  what harm could he have done by propounding his quaint theories .    compor said   it is not the truth alone that can harm .  his theories may have been merely quaint  but they might have succeeded in unsettling the people of terminus and  by introducing doubts and fears as to the foundation s role in the great drama of galactic history  have weakened its leadership of the federation and its dreams of a second galactic empire .  clearly you thought this yourself  or you would not have seized him on the floor of the council  and you would not now be forcing him into exile without trial .  why have you done so  if i may ask  mayor .     shall we say that i was cautious enough to wonder if there were some faint chance that he might be right  and that the expression of his views might be actively and directly dangerous .    compor said nothing .   branno said   i agree with you  but i am forced by the responsibilities of my position to consider the possibility .  let me ask you again if you have any indication as to where he might think the second foundation exists  and where he might go .     i have none .     he has never given you any hints in that direction .     no  of course not .     never .  don t dismiss the thought easily .  think .  never .     never   said compor firmly .    no hints .  no joking remarks .  no doodles .  no thoughtful abstractions at moments that achieve significance as you look back on them .     none .  i tell you  madam mayor  his dreams of the second foundation are the most nebulous starshine .  you know it  and you but waste your time and your emotions in your concern over it .     you are not by some chance suddenly changing sides again and protecting the friend you delivered into my hands .     no   said compor .   i turned him over to you for what seemed to me to be good and patriotic reasons .  i have no reason to regret the action  or to change my attitude .     then you can give me no hint as to where he might go once he has a ship at his disposal .     as i have already said     and yet  councilman   and here the lines of the mayor s face so folded as to make her seem wistful   i would like to know where he goes .     in that case  i think you ought to place a hyper relay on his ship .     i have thought of that  councilman .  he is  however  a suspicious man and i suspect he will find it however cleverly it might be placed .  of course  it might be placed in such a way that he cannot remove it without crippling the ship  and he might therefore be forced to leave it in place     an excellent notion .     except that   said branno   he would then be inhibited .  he might not go where he would go if he felt himself free and untrammeled .  the knowledge i would gain would be useless to me .     in that case  it appears you cannot find out where he will go .     i might  for i intend to be very primitive .  a person who expects the completely sophisticated and who guards against it is quite apt never to think of the primitive .   i m thinking of having trevize followed .     followed .     exactly .  by  another pilot in another spaceship .  see how astonished you are at the thought .  he would be equally astonished .  he might not think of scouring space for an accompanying mass and  in any case  we will see to it that his ship is not equipped with our latest mass detection devices .    compor said   madam mayor  i speak with all possible respect  but i must point out that you lack experience in space flight .  to have one ship followed by another is never done because it won t work .  trevize will escape with the first hyperspatial jump .  even if he doesn t know he is being followed  that first jump will be his path to freedom .  if he doesn t have a hyper relay on board ship  he can t be traced .     i admit my lack of experience .  unlike you and trevize  i have had no naval training .  nevertheless  i am told by my advisers who have had such training that if a ship is observed immediately prior to a jump  its direction  speed  and acceleration make it possible to guess what the jump might be in a general way .  given a good computer and an excellent sense of judgment  a follower might duplicate the jump closely enough to pick up the trail at the other end  especially if the follower has a good mass detector .     that might happen once   said compor energetically   even twice if the follower is very lucky  but that s it .  you can t rely on such things .     perhaps we can .   councilman compor  you have hyper raced in your time .  you see  i know a great deal about you .  you are an excellent pilot and have done amazing things when it comes to following a competitor through a jump .    compor s eyes widened .  he almost squirmed in his chair .   i was in college then .  i am older now .     not too old .  not yet thirty five .  consequently you are going to follow trevize  councilman .  where he goes  you will follow  and you will report back to me .  you will leave soon after trevize does  and he will be leaving in a few hours .  if you refuse the task  councilman  you will be imprisoned for treason .  if you take the ship that we will provide for you  and if you fail to follow  you need not bother coming back .  you will be shot out of space if you try .    compor rose sharply  to his feet .    .  have a life to live .  i have work to do .  i have a wife .  i cannot leave it all .     you will have to .  those of us who choose to serve the foundation must be prepared at ail times to serve it in a prolonged and uncomfortable fashion  if that should become necessary .     my wife must go with me  of course .     do you take me for an idiot .  she stays here  of course .     as a hostage .     if you like the word .  i prefer to say that you will be taking yourself into danger and my kind heart wants her to stay here where she will not be in danger .   there is no room for discussion .  you are as much under arrest as trevize is  and i am sure you understand i must act quickly   before the euphoria enveloping terminus wears off .  i fear my star will soon be in the descendant .    kodell said   you were not easy on him  madam mayor .    the mayor said with a sniff   why should i have been .  he betrayed a friend .     that was useful to us .     yes  as it happened .  his next betrayal  however  might not be .     why should there be another .     come  liono   said branno impatiently   don t play games with me .  anyone who displays a capacity for double dealing must forever be suspected of being capable of displaying it again .     he may use the capability to combine with trevize once again .  together  they may     you don t believe that .  with all his folly and naivete  trevize goes straight for his goal .  he does not understand betrayal and he will never  under any circumstances  trust compor a second time .    kodell said   pardon me  mayor  but let me make sure i follow your thinking .  how far  then  can you trust compor .  how do you know he will follow trevize and report honestly .  do you count on his fears for the welfare of his wife as a restraint .  his longing to return to her .     both are factors  but i don t entirely rely on that .  on compor s ship there will be a hyper relay .  trevize would suspect pursuit and would search for one .  however compor   being the pursuer will  i assume  not suspect pursuit and will not search for one .   of course  if he does  and if he finds it  then we must depend on the attractions of his wife .    kodell laughed .   to think i once had to give you lessons .  and the purpose of the pursuit .     a double layer of protection .  if trevize is caught  it may be that  compor will carry on and give us the information that trevize will not be able to .     one more question .  what if  by some chance  trevize finds the second foundation  and we learn of it through him  or through compor  or if we gain reason to suspect its existence despite the deaths of both .     i m hoping the second foundation does exist  liono   she said .   in any case  the seldon plan is not going to serve us much longer .  the great hari seldon devised it in the dying days of the empire  when technological advance had virtually stopped .  seldon was a product of his times  too  and however brilliant this semimythical science of psychohistory must have been  it could not rise out of its roots .  it surely would not allow for raid technological advance .  the foundation has been achieving that  especially in this last century .  we have mass detection devices of a kind undreamed of earlier  computers that can respond to thought  and most of all mental shielding .  the second foundation cannot control us for much longer  if they can do so now .  i want  in my final years in power  to be the one to start terminus on a new path .     and if there is  in fact  no second foundation .     then we start on a new path at once .    the troubled sleep that had finally come to trevize did not last long .  a touch on his shoulder was repeated a second time .   trevize started up  bleary and utterly failing to understand why he should be in a strange bed .   what   what  .    pelorat said to him apologetically   i m sorry  councilman trevize .  you are my guest and i owe you rest  but the mayor is here .   he was standing at the side of the bed in flannel pajamas and shivering slightly .  trevize s senses leaped to a weary wakefulness and he remembered .   the mayor was in pelorat s living room  looking as composed as always .  kodell was with her  rubbing lightly at his white mustache .   trevize adjusted his sash to the proper snugness and wondered how long the two of them branno and kodell   were ever apart .   trevize said mockingly    has the council recovered yet .  are its members concerned over the absence of one of them .    the mayor said   there are signs of life  yes  but not enough to do you any good .  there is no question but that i still have the power to force you to leave .  you will be taken to ultimate spaceport     not terminus spaceport  madam mayor .  am i to be deprived of a proper farewell from weeping thousands .     i see you have recovered your penchant for teenage silliness  councilman  and i am pleased .  it stills what might otherwise be a certain rising twinge of conscience .  at ultimate spaceport  you and professor pelorat will leave quietly .     and never return .     and perhaps never return .  of course   and here she smiled briefly   if you discover something of so great an importance and usefulness that even i will be glad to have you back with your information  you will return .  you may even be treated with honor .    trevize nodded casually   that may happen .     almost anything may happen .   in any case  you will be comfortable .  you are being assigned a recently completed pocket cruiser  the far star  named for hober mallow s cruiser .  one person can handle it  though it will hold as many as three with reasonable comfort .    trevize was jolted out of his carefully assumed mood of light irony .   fully armed .     unarmed but otherwise fully equipped .  wherever you go  you will be citizens of the foundation and there will always be a consul to whom you can turn  so you will not require arms .  you will be able to draw on funds at need .   not unlimited funds  i might add .     you are generous .     i know that  councilman .  but  councilman  understand me .  you are helping professor pelorat search for earth .  whatever you think you are searching for  you are searching for earth .  all whom you meet must understand that .  and always remember that the far star is not armed .     i am searching for earth   said trevize .   i understand that perfectly .     then you will go now .     pardon me  but surely there is more to all of this than we have discussed .  i have piloted ships in my time  but i have had no experience with a late model pocket cruiser .  what if i cannot pilot it .     i am told that the far star is thoroughly computerized .   and before you ask  you don t have to know how to handle a late model ship s computer .  it will itself tell you anything you need to know .  is there anything else you need .    trevize looked down at himself ruefully .   a change of clothing .     you will find them on board ship .  including those girdles you wear  or sashes  whichever they are called .  the professor is also supplied with what he needs .  everything reasonable is already aboard  although i hasten to add that this does not include female companions .     too bad   said trevize .   it would be pleasant  but then  i have no likely candidate at the moment  as it happens .  still  i presume the galaxy is populous and that once away from here i may do as i please .     with regard to companions .  suit yourself .    she rose heavily .   i will not take you to the spaceport   she said   but there are those who will  and you must make no effort to do anything you are not told to do .  i believe they will kill you if you make an effort to escape .  the fact that i will not be with them will remove any inhibition .    trevize said   i will make no unauthorized effort  madam mayor  but one thing     yes .    trevize searched his mind rapidly and finally said with a smile that he very much hoped looked unforced   the time may come  madam mayor  when you will ask me for an effort .  i will then do as i choose  but i will remember the past two days .    mayor branno sighed .   spare me the melodrama .  if the time comes  it will come  but for now i am asking for nothing .      chapter four  space    the ship looked even more impressive than trevize   with his memories of the time when the new cruiser class had been glowingly publicized had expected .   it was not the size that was impressive for it was rather small .  it was designed for maneuverability and speed  for totally gravitic engines  and most of all for advanced computerization .  it didn t need size size would have defeated its purpose .   it was a one man device that could replace  with advantage  the older ships that required a crew of a dozen or more .  with a second or even a third person to establish shifts of duty  one such ship could fight off a flotilla of much larger non foundation ships .  in addition  it could outspeed and escape from any other ship in existence .   there was a sleekness about it not a wasted line  not a superfluous curve inside or out .  every cubic meter of volume was used to its maximum  so as to leave a paradoxical aura of spaciousness within .  nothing the mayor might have said about the importance of his mission could have impressed trevize more than the ship with which he was asked to perform it .   branno the bronze  he thought with chagrin  had maneuvered him into a dangerous mission of the greatest significance .  he might not have accepted with such determination had she not so arranged matters that he wanted to show her what he could do .   as for pelorat  he was transported with wonder .   would you believe   he said  placing a gentle finger on the hull before he had climbed inside   that i ve never been close to a spaceship .     i ll believe it  of course  if you say so  professor  but how did you manage it .     i scarcely know  to be honest with you  dear fel   i mean  my dear trevize .  i presume i was overly concerned with my research .  when one s home has a really excellent computer capable of reaching other computers anywhere in the galaxy  one scarcely needs to budge  you know .   somehow i expected spaceships to be larger than this .     this is a small model  but even so  it s much larger inside than any other ship of this size .     how can that be .  you are making fun of my ignorance .     no  no .  i m serious .  this is one of the first ships to be completely graviticized .     what does that mean .   but please don t explain if it requires extensive physics .  i will take your word  as you took mine yesterday in connection with the single species of humanity and the single world of origin .     let s try  professor pelorat .  through all the thousands of years of space flight  we ve had chemical motors and ionic motors and hyperatomic motors  and all these things have been bulky .  the old imperial navy had ships five hundred meters long with no more living space in them than would fit into a small apartment .  fortunately the foundation has specialized in miniaturization through all the centuries of its existence  thanks to its lack of material resources .  this ship is the culmination .  it makes use of antigravity and the device that makes that possible takes up virtually no space and is actually included in the hull .  if it weren t that we still need the hyperatomic    a security guard approached .   you will have to get on  gentlemen .    the sky was grooving light  though sunrise was still half an hour off .   trevize looked about .   is my baggage loaded .     yes  councilman  you will find the ship fully equipped .     with clothing  i suppose  that is not my size or to my taste .    the guard smiled  quite suddenly and almost boyishly .   i think it is   he said .   the mayor had us working overtime these last thirty or forty hours and we ve matched what you had closely .  money no object .  listen   he looked about as though to make sure no one noticed his sudden fraternization   you two are lucky .  best ship in the world .  fully equipped  except for armament .  you re swimming in cream .     sour cream  possibly   said trevize .   well  professor  are you ready .     with this i am   pelorat said and held up a square wafer about twenty centimeters to the side and encased in a jacket of silvery plastic .  trevize was suddenly aware that pelorat had been holding it since they had left his home  shifting it from hand to hand and never putting it down  even when they had stopped for a quick breakfast .    what s that  professor .     my library .  it s indexed by subject matter and origin and i ve gotten it all into one wafer .  if you think this ship is a marvel  how about this wafer .  a whole library .  everything i have collected .  wonderful .  wonderful .     well   said trevize   we are swimming in cream .    trevize marveled at the inside of the ship .  the utilization of space was ingenious .  there was a storeroom  with supplies of food  clothing  films  and games .  there was a gym  a parlor  and two nearly identical bedrooms .    this one   said trevize   must be yours  professor .  at least  it contains an fx reader .     good   said pelorat with satisfaction .   what an ass i have been to avoid space flight as i have .  i could live here  my dear trevize  in utter satisfaction .     roomier than i expected   said trevize with pleasure .    and the engines are really in the hull  as you said .     the controlling devices are  at any rate .  we don t have to store fuel or make use of it on the spot .  we re making use of the fundamental energy store of the universe  so that the fuel and the engines are all out there .   he gestured vaguely .    well  now that i think of it what if something goes wrong .    trevize shrugged .   i ve been trained in space navigation  but not on these ships .  if something goes wrong with the gravitics  i m afraid there s nothing i can do about it .     but can you run this ship .  pilot it .     i m wondering that myself .    pelorat said   do you suppose this is an automated ship .  might we not merely be passengers .  we might simply be expected to sit here .     they have such things in the case of ferries between planets and space stations within a stellar system  but i never heard of automated hyperspace travel .  at least  not so far .   not so far .    he looked about again and there was a trickle of apprehension within him .  had that harridan mayor managed to maneuver that far ahead of him .  had the foundation automated interstellar travel  too  and was he going to be deposited on trantor quite against his will  and with no more to say about it than any of the rest of the furniture aboard ship .   he said with a cheerful animation he didn t feel   professor  you sit down .  the mayor said this ship was completely computerized .  if your room has the fx reader  mine ought to have a computer in it .  make yourself comfortable and let me look around a bit on my own .   pelorat looked instantly anxious .   trevize  my dear chap  you re not getting off the ship  are you .     not my plan at all  professor .  and if i tried  you can count on my being stopped .  it is not the mayor s intention to allow me off .  all i m planning to do is to learn what operates the far star .   he smiled   i won t desert you  professor .    he was still smiling as he entered  what he felt to be his own bedroom  but his face grew sober as he closed the door softly behind him .  surely there must be some means of communicating with a planet in the neighborhood of the ship .  it was impossible to imagine a ship deliberately sealed off from its surroundings and  therefore  somewhere   perhaps in a wall recess there would have to be a reacher .  he could use it to call the mayor s office to ask about controls .   carefully he inspected the walls  the headboard of the bed  and the neat  smooth furniture .  if nothing turned up here  he would go through the rest of the ship .   he was about to turn away when his eye caught a glint of light on the smooth  light brown surface of the desk .  a round circle of light  with neat lettering that read  computer instructions .   ah .   nevertheless his heart beat rapidly .  there were computers and computers  and there were programs that took a long time to master .  trevize had never made the mistake of underestimating his own intelligence  but  on the other hand  he was not a grand master .  there were those who had a knack for using a computer  and those who had not   and trevize knew very well into which class he fell .   in his hitch in the foundation navy  he had reached the rank of lieutenant and had  on occasion  been officer of the day and had had occasion to use the ship s computer .  he had never been in sole charge of it  however  and he had never been expected to know anything more than the routine maneuvers being officer of the day required .   he remembered  with a sinking feeling  the volumes taken up by a fully described program in printout  and he could recall the behavior of technical sergeant krasnet at the console of the ship s computer .  he played it as though it were the most complex musical instrument in the galaxy  and did it all with an air of nonchalance  as though he were bored at its simplicity yet even he had had to consult the volumes at times  swearing at himself in embarrassment .   hesitantly trevize placed a finger on the circle of light and at once the light spread out to cover the desk top .  on it were the outline of two hands  a right and a left .  with a sudden  smooth movement  the desk top tilted to an angle of forty five degrees .   trevize took the seat before the desk .  no words were necessary .  it was clear what he was expected to do .   he placed his hands on the outlines on the desk  which were positioned for him to do so without strain .  the desk top seemed soft  nearly velvety  where he touched it and his hands sank in .   he stared at his hands with astonishment  for they had not sunk in at all .  they were on the surface  his eyes told him .  yet to his sense of touch it was as though the desk surface had given way  and as though something were holding his hands softly and warmly .   was that all .   now what .   he looked about and then closed his eyes in response to a suggestion .   he had heard nothing .  he had heard nothing .   but inside his brain  as though it were a vagrant thought of his own  there was the sentence   please close your eyes .  relax .  we will make connection .    through the hands .   somehow trevize had always assumed that if one were going to communicate by thought with a computer  it would be through a hood placed over the head and with electrodes against the eyes and skull .   the hands .   but why not the hands .  trevize found himself floating away  almost drowsy  but with no loss of mental acuity .  why not the hands .   the eyes were no more than sense organs .  the brain was no more than a central switchboard  encased in bone and removed from the working surface of the body .  it was the hands that were the working surface  the hands that felt and manipulated the universe .   human beings thought with their hands .  it was their hands that were the answer of curiosity  that felt and pinched and turned and lifted and hefted .  there were animals that had brains of respectable size  but they had no hands and that made all the difference .   and as he and the computer held hands  their thinking merged and it no longer mattered whether his eyes were open or closed .  opening them did not improve his vision nor did closing them dim it .   either way  he saw the room with complete clarity not just in the direction in which he was looking  but all around and above and below .   he saw every room in the spaceship and he saw outside as well .  the sun had risen and its brightness was dimmed in the morning mist  but he could look at it directly without being dazzled  for the computer automatically filtered the light waves .   he felt the gentle wind and its temperature  and the sounds of the world about him .  he detected the planet s magnetic field and the tiny electrical charges on the wall of the ship .   he became aware of the controls of the ship  without even knowing what they were in detail .  he knew only that if he wanted to lift the ship  or turn it  or accelerate it  or make use of any of its abilities  the process was the same as that of performing the analogous process to his body .  he had but to use his will .   yet his will was not unalloyed .  the computer itself could override .  at the present moment  there was a formed sentence in his head and he knew exactly when and how the ship would take off .  there was no flexibility where that was concerned .  thereafter  he knew just as surely  he would himself he able to deride .   he found as he cast the net of his computer enhanced consciousness outward that he could sense the condition of the upper atmosphere  that he could see the weather patterns  that he could detect the other ships that were swarming upward and the others that were settling downward .  all of this had to be taken into ac  count and the computer was taking it into account .  if the computer had not been doing so  trevize realized  he need only desire the computer to do so and it would be done .   so much for the volumes of programming  there were none .  trevize thought of technical sergeant krasnet and smiled .  he had read often enough of the immense revolution that gravities would make in the world  but the fusion of computer and mind was still a state secret .  it would surely produce a still greater revolution .   he was aware of time passing .  he knew exactly what time it was by terminus local and by galactic standard .   how did he let go .   and even as the thought entered his mind  his hands were released and the desk top moved back to its original position and trevize was left with his own unaided senses .   he felt blind and helpless as though  for a time  he had been held and protected by a superbeing and now was abandoned .  had he not known that he could make contact again at any time  the feeling might have reduced him to tears .   as it was he merely struggled for re orientation  for adjustment to limits  then rose uncertainly to his feet and walked out of the room .   pelorat looked up .  he had adjusted his reader  obviously  and he said   it works very well .  it has an excellent search program .   did you find the controls  my boy .     yes  professor .  all is well .     in that case  shouldn t we do something about takeoff .  i mean  self protection .  aren t we supposed to strap ourselves in or something .  i looked about for instructions  but i didn t find anything and that made me nervous .  i had to turn to my library .  somehow when i am at my work    trevize had been pushing his hands at the professor as though to dam and stop the flood of words .  now he had to speak loudly in order to override him .   none of that is necessary  professor .  antigravity is the equivalent of noninertia .  there is no feeling of acceleration when velocity changes  since everything on the ship undergoes the change simultaneously .     you mean  we won t know when we are off the planet and out in space .     it s exactly what i mean  because even as i speak to you  we have taken off .  we will be cutting through the upper atmosphere in a very few minutes and within half an hour we will be in outer space .    pelorat seemed to shrink a little as he stared at trevize .  his long rectangle of a face grew so blank that  without showing any emotion at all  it radiated a vast uneasiness .   then his eyes shifted right left .   trevize remembered how he had felt on his own first trip beyond the atmosphere .   he said  in as matter of fact a manner as he could   janov    it was the first time he had addressed the professor familiarly  but in this case experience was addressing inexperience and it was necessary to seem the older of the two   we are perfectly safe here .  we are in the metal womb of a warship of the foundation navy .  we are not fully armed  but there is no place in the galaxy where the name of the foundation will not protect us .  even if some ship went mad and attacked  we could move out of its reach in a moment .  and i assure you i have discovered that i can handle the ship perfectly .    pelorat said   it is the thought  go golan  of nothingness     why  there s nothingness all about terminus .  there s just a thin layer of very tenuous air between ourselves on the surface and the nothingness just above .  ail we re doing is to go past that inconsequential layer .     it may be inconsequential  but we breathe it .     we breathe here  too .  the air on this ship is cleaner and purer  and will indefinitely remain cleaner and purer than the natural atmosphere of terminus .     and the meteorites .     what about meteorites .     the atmosphere protects us from meteorites .  radiation  too  for that matter .    trevize said   humanity has been traveling through space for twenty millennia  i believe     twenty two .  if we go by the hallblockian chronology  it is quite plain that  counting the     enough .  have you heard of meteorite accidents or of radiation deaths .   i mean  recently .   i mean  in the case of foundation ships .     i have not really followed the news in such matters  but i am a historian  my boy  and     historically  yes  there have been such things  but technology improves .  there isn t a meteorite large enough to damage us that can possibly approach us before we take the necessary evasive action .  four meteorites coming at us simultaneously from the four directions drawn from the vertices of a tetrahedron might conceivably pin us down  but calculate the chances of that and you ll find that you ll die of old .  age a trillion trillion times over before you will have a fifty fifty chance of observing so interesting a phenomenon .     you mean  if you were at the computer .     no   said trevize in scorn .   if i were running the computer on the basis of my own senses and responses  we would be hit before i ever knew what was happening .  it is the computer itself that is at work  responding millions of times faster than you or i could .   he held out his hand abruptly .   janov  come let me show you what the computer can do  and let me show you what space is like .    pelorat stared  goggling a bit .  then he laughed briefly .   i m not sure i wish to know  golan .     of course you re not sure  janov  because you don t know what it is that is waiting there to be known .  chance it .  come .  into my room .    trevize held the other s hand  half leading him  half drawing him .  he said  as he sat down at the computer   have you ever seen the galaxy  janov .  have you ever looked at it .    pelorat said   you mean in the sky .     yes  certainly .  where else .     i ve seen it .  everyone has seen it .  if one looks up  one sees it .     have you ever stared at it on a dark  clear night  when the diamonds are below the horizon .    the  diamonds  referred to those few stars that were luminous enough and close enough to shine with moderate brightness in the night sky of terminus .  they  were a small group that spanned a width of no more than twenty degrees  and for large parts of the night they were all below the horizon .  aside from he group  there was a scattering of dim stars just barely visible to the unaided eye .  there was nothing more but the faint milkiness of the galaxy the view one might expect when one dwelt on a world like terminus which was at the extreme edge of the outermost spiral of the galaxy .    i suppose so  but why stare .  it s a common sight .     of course it s a common sight   said trevize .   that s why no one sees it .  why see it if you can always see it .  but now you ll see it  and not from terminus  where the mist and the clouds are forever interfering .  you ll see it as you d never see it from terminus no matter how you stared  and no matter how clear and dark the night .  how i wish i had never been in space before  so that like you i could see the galaxy in its bare beauty for the first time .    he pushed a chair in pelorat s direction .   sit there  janov .  this may take a little time .  i have to continue to grow accustomed to the computer .  from what i ve already felt  i know the viewing is holographic  so we won t need a screen of any sort .  it makes direct contact with my brain  but i think i can have it produce an objective image that you will see  too .   put out the light  will you .   no  that s foolish of me .  i ll have the computer do it .  stay where you are .    trevize made contact with the computer  holding hands warmly and intimately .   the light dimmed  then went out completely  and in the darkness  pelorat stirred .   trevize said   don t get nervous  janov .  i may have a little trouble trying to control the computer  but i ll start easy and you ll have to be patient with me .  do you see it .  the crescent .    it hung in the darkness before them .  a little dim and wavering at first  but getting sharper and brighter .   pelorat s voice sounded awed .   is that terminus .  are we that far from it .     yes  the ship s moving quickly .    the ship was curving into the night shadow of terminus  which appeared as a thick crescent of bright light .  trevize had a momentary urge to send the ship in a wide arc that would carry them over the daylit side of the planet to show it in all its beauty  but he held back .   pelorat might find novelty in this  but the beauty would be tame .  there were too many photographs  too many reaps  too many globes .  every child knew what terminus looked like .  a water planet more so than most rich in water and poor in minerals  good in agriculture and poor in heavy industry  but the best in the galaxy in high technology and in miniaturization .   if he could have the computer use microwaves and translate it into a visible model  they would see every one of terminus s ten thousand inhabited islands  together with the only one of them large enough to be considered a continent  the one that bore terminus city and  turn away .   it was just a thought  an exercise of the will  but the view shifted at once .  the lighted crescent moved off toward the borders of vision and rolled off the edge .  the darkness of starless space filled his eyes .   pelorat cleared his throat .   i wish you would bring back terminus  my boy .  i feel as though i ve been blinded .   there was a tightness in his voice .    you re not blind .  look .    into the field of vision came a filmy fog of pale translucence .  it spread and became brighter  until the whole room seemed to glow .   shrink .   another exercise of will and the galaxy drew off  as though seen through a diminishing telescope that was steadily growing more powerful in its ability to diminish .  the galaxy contracted and became a structure of varying luminosity .   brighten .   it grew more luminous without changing size  and because the stellar system to which terminus belonged was above the galactic plane  the galaxy was not seen exactly edge on .  it was a strongly foreshortened double spiral  with curving dark nebula rifts streaking the glowing edge of the terminus side .  the creamy haze of the nucleus far off and shrunken by the distance looked unimportant .   pelorat said in an awed whisper   you are right .  i have never seen it like this .  i never dreamed it had so much detail .     how could you .  you can t see the outer half when terminus s atmosphere is between you and it .  you can hardly see the nucleus from terminus s surface .      what a pity we re seeing it so nearly head on .     we don t have to .  the computer can show it in any orientation .  i just have to express the wish and not even aloud .    shift co ordinates .   this exercise of will was by no means a precise command .  yet as the image of galaxy began to undergo a slow change  his mind guided the computer and had it do what he wished .   slowly the galaxy was turning so that it could be seen at right angles to the galactic plane .  it spread out like a gigantic  glowing whirlpool  with curves of darkness  and knots of brightness  and a central all but featureless blaze .   pelorat asked   how can the computer see it from a position in space that must be more than fifty thousand parsecs from this place .   then he added  in a choked whisper   please forgive me that i ask .  i know nothing about all this .    trevize said   i know almost as little about this computer as you do .  even a simple computer  however  can adjust co ordinates and show the galaxy in any position  starting with what it can sense in the natural position  the one  that is  that would appear from the computer s local position in space .  of course  it makes use only of the information it can sense to begin with  so when it changes to the broadside view we would find gaps and blurs in what it would show .  in this case  though     yes .     we have an excellent view .  i suspect that the computer is outfitted with a complete map of the galaxy and can therefore view it from any angle with equal ease .     how do you mean  a complete map .     the spatial co ordinates of every star in it must be in the computer s memory banks .     every star .   pelorat seemed awed .    well  perhaps not all three hundred billion .  it would include the stars shining down on populated planets  certainly  and probably every star of spectral class k and brighter .  that means about seventy five billion  at least .     every star of a populated system .     i wouldn t want to be pinned down  perhaps not all .  there were  after all  twenty five million inhabited systems in the time of hari seldon which sounds like a lot but is only one star out of every twelve thousand .  and then  in the five centuries since seldon  the general breakup of the empire didn t prevent further colonization .  i should think it would have encouraged it .  there are still plenty of habitable planets to expand into  so there may be thirty million now .  it s possible that not all the new ones are in the foundation s records .     but the old ones .  surely they must all be there without exception .     i imagine so .  i can t guarantee it  of course  but i would be surprised if any long established inhabited system were missing from the records .  let me show you something if my ability to control the computer will go far enough .    trevize s hands stiffened a bit with the effort and they seemed to sink further into the clasp of the computer .  that might not have been necessary  he might only have had to think quietly and casually  terminus .   he did think that and there was  in response  a sparkling red diamond at the very edge of the whirlpool .    there s our sun   he said with excitement .   that s the star that terminus circles .     ah   said pelorat with a low  tremulous sigh .   a bright yellow dot of light sprang into life in a rich cluster of stars deep in the heart of the galaxy but well to one side of the central haze .  it was rather closer to the terminus edge of the galaxy than to the other side .    and that   said trevize   is trantor s sun .    another sigh  then pelorat said   are you sure .  they always speak of trantor as being located in the center of the galaxy .     it is  in a way .  it s as close to the center as a planet can get and still be habitable .  it s closer than any other major populated system .  the actual center of the galaxy consists of a black hole with a mass of nearly a million stars  so that the center is a violent place .  as far as we know  there is no life in the actual center and maybe there just can t be any life there .  trantor is in the innermost subring of the spiral arms and  believe me  if you could see its night sky  you would think it was in the center of the galaxy .  it s surrounded by an extremely rich clustering of stars .     have you been on trantor  golan .   asked pelorat in clear envy .    actually no  but i ve seen holographic representations of its sky .    trevize stared at the galaxy somberly .  in the great search for the second foundation during the time of the mule  how everyone had played with galactic maps and how many volumes had been written and filmed on the subject  and all because hari seldom had said  at the beginning  that the second foundation would be established  at the other end of the galaxy   calling the place  star s end .    at the other end of the galaxy .  even as trevize thought it  a thin blue line sprang into view  stretching from terminus  through the galaxy s central black hole  to the other end .  trevize nearly jumped .  he had not directly ordered the line  but he had thought of it quite clearly and that had been enough for the computer .   but  of course  the straight line route to the opposite side of the galaxy was not necessarily an indication of the  other end  that seldom had spoken of .  it was arkady darell  if one could believe her autobiography  who had made use of the phrase  a circle has no end  to indicate what everyone now accepted as truth  and though trevize suddenly tried to suppress the thought  the computer was too quick for him .  the blue line vanished and was replaced with a circle that neatly rimmed the galaxy in blue and that passed through the deep red dot of terminus s sun .   a circle has no end  and if the circle began at terminus  then if we searched for the other end  it would merely return to terminus  and there the second foundation had indeed been found  inhabiting the same world as the first .   but i     in reality  it had not been found if the so called finding o    the second foundation had been an illusion what then .  what beside a straight line and a circle would make sense in this connection .   pelorat said   are you creating illusions .  why is there a blue circle .     i was just testing my controls .   would you like to locate earth .    there was silence for a moment or two  then pelorat said   are you joking .     no .  i ll try .    he did .  nothing happened .    sorry   said trevize .    it s not there .  no earth .     i suppose i might have misthought my command  but that doesn t seem likely .  i suppose it s more likely that earth isn t listed in the computer s vitals .    pelorat said   it may be listed under another name .    trevize jumped at that quickly   what other name  janov .    pelorat said nothing and  in the darkness  trevize smiled .  it occurred to him that things might just possibly be falling into place .  let it go for a while .  let it ripen .  he deliberately changed the subject and said   i wonder if we can manipulate time .     time .  how can we do that .     the galaxy is rotating .  it takes nearly half a billion years for terminus to move about the grand circumference of the galaxy once .  stars that are closer to the center complete the journey much more quickly  of course .  the motion of each star  relative to the central black hole  might be recorded in the computer and  if so  it may be possible to have the computer multiply each motion by millions of times and make the rotational effect visible .  i can try to have it done .    he did and he could not help his muscles tightening with the effort of will he was exerting as though he were taking hold of the galaxy and accelerating it  twisting it  forcing it to spin against terrible resistance .   the galaxy was moving .  slowly  mightily  it was twisting in the direction that should be working to tighten the spiral arms .   time was passing incredibly rapidly as they watched a false  artificial time and  as it did so  stars became evanescent things .   some of the larger ones here and there reddened and grew brighter as they expanded into red giants .  and then a star in the central clusters blew up soundlessly in a blinding blaze that  for a tiny fraction of a second  dimmed the galaxy and then was gone .  then another in one of the spiral arms  then still another not very far away from it .    supernovas   said trevize a little shakily .   was it possible that the computer could predict exactly which stars would explode and when .  or was it just using a simplified model that served to show the starry future in general terms  rather than precisely .   pelorat said in a husky whisper   the galaxy looks like a living thing  crawling through space .     it does   said trevize   but i m growing tired .  unless i learn to do this less tensely  i m not going to be able to play this kind of game for long .    ire let go .  the galaxy slowed  then halted  then tilted  until it was in the view from the side from which they had seen it at the start .   trevize closed his eyes and breathed deeply .  he was aware of terminus shrinking behind them  with the last perceptible wisps of atmosphere gone from their surroundings .  he was aware of all the ships filling terminus s near space .   it did not occur to him to check whether there was anything special about any one of those ships .  was there one that was gravitic like his own and matched his trajectory more closely than chance would allow .     chapter five  speaker    trantor .   for eight thousand years  it was the capital of a large and mighty political entity that spanned an ever growing union of planetary systems .  for twelve thousand years after that  it was the capital of a political entity that spanned the entire galaxy .  it was the center  the heart  the epitome of the galactic empire .   it was impossible to think of the empire without thinking of trantor .   trantor did not reach its physical peak until the empire was far gone in decay .  in fact  no one noticed that the empire had lost its drive  its forward look  because trantor gleamed in shining metal .   its growth had peaked at the point where it was a planet girdling city .  its population was stabilized  by law  at forty five billion and the only surface greenery was at the imperial palace and the galactic university library complex .   trantor s land surface was metal coated .  its deserts and its fertile areas were alike engulfed and made into warrens of humanity  administrative jungles  computerized elaborations  vast storehouses of food and replacement parts .  its mountain ranges were beaten down  its chasms filled in .  the city s endless corridors burrowed under the continental shelves and the oceans were turned into huge underground aquacultural cisterns the only  and insufficient native source of food and minerals .   the connections with the outer worlds  from which trantor obtained the resources it required  depended upon its thousand spaceports  its ten thousand warships  its hundred thousand merchant ships  its million space freighters .   no city so vast was ever recycled so tightly .  no planet in the galaxy had ever made so much use of solar power or went to such extremes to rid itself of waste heat .  glittering radiators stretched up into the thin upper atmosphere upon the nightside and were withdrawn into the metal city on the dayside .  as the planet turned  the radiators rose as night progressively fell around the world and sank as day progressively broke .  so trantor always had an artificial asymmetry that was almost its symbol .   at this peak  trantor ran the empire .   it ran it poorly  but nothing could have run the empire well .  the empire was too large to be run from a single world even under the most dynamic of emperors .  how could trantor have helped but run it poorly when  in the ages of decay  the imperial crown was traded back and forth by sly politicians and foolish incompetents and the bureaucracy had become a subculture of corruptibles .   but even at its worst  there was some self propelled worth to the machinery .  the galactic empire could not have been run without trantor .   the empire crumbled steadily  but as long as trantor remained trantor  a core of the empire remained and it retained an air of pride  of millennia  of tradition and power and exaltation .   only when the unthinkable happened when trantor finally fell and was sacked  when its citizens were killed by the millions and left to starve by the billions  when its mighty metal coating was scarred and punctured and fused by the attack of the  barbarian  fleet only then was the empire considered to have fallen .  the surviving remnants on the once great world undid further what had been left and  in a generation  trantor was transformed from the greatest planet the human race had ever seen to an inconceivable tangle of ruins .   that had been nearly two and a half centuries ago .  in the rest of the galaxy  trantor as it had been still was not forgotten .  it would live forever as the favored site of historical novels  the favored symbol and memory of the past  the favored word for sayings such as  all starships land on trantor    like looking for a person in trantor   and  no more alike than this and trantor .    in all the rest of the galaxy    but that was not true on trantor itself .  here the old trantor was forgotten .  the surface metal seas gone  almost everywhere .  trantor was now a sparsely settled world of self sufficient farmers  a place where trading ships rarely came and were not particularly welcome when they did come .  the very word  trantor   though still in official use  had dropped out of popular speech .  by present day trantorians  it was called  name   which in their dialect was what would be called  home  in galactic standard .   quindor shandess thought of all this and much more as he sat quietly in a welcome state of half drowse  in which he could allow his mind to run along a self propelled and unorganized stream of thought .   he had been first speaker of the second foundation for eighteen years  and he might well bold on for ten or twelve years more if his mind remained reasonably vigorous and if he could continue to fight the political wars .   he was the analog  the mirror image  of the mayor of terminus  who ruled over the first foundation  but how different they were in every respect .  the mayor of terminus was known to all the galaxy and the first foundation was therefore simply  the foundation  to all the worlds .  the first speaker of the second foundation was known only to his associates .   and yet it was the second foundation  under himself and his predecessors  who held the real power .  the first foundation was supreme in the realm of physical power  of technology  of war weapons .  the second foundation was supreme in the realm of mental power  of the mind  of the ability to control .  in any conflict between the two  what would it matter how many ships and weapons the first foundation disposed of  if the second foundation could control the minds of those who controlled the ships and weapons .   but how long could he revel in this realization of secret power .   he was the twenty fifth first speaker and his incumbency was already a shade longer than average .  ought he  perhaps  not be too keen on holding on and keeping out the younger aspirants .  there was speaker gendibal  the keenest and newest at the table .  tonight they would spend time together and shandess looked forward to it .  ought he look forward also to gendibal s possible accession some day .   the answer to the question was that shandess had no real thought of leaving his post .  he enjoyed it too much .   he sat there  in his old age  still perfectly capable of performing his duties .  his hair was gray  but it had always been light in color and he wore it cut an inch long so that the color scarcely mattered .  his eyes were a faded blue and his clothing conformed to the drab styling of the trantorian farmers .   the first speaker could  if he wished  pass among the hamish people as one of them  but his hidden power nevertheless existed .  he could choose to focus his eyes and mind at any time and they would then act according to his will and recall nothing about it afterward .   it rarely happened .  almost never .  the golden rule of the second foundation was   do nothing unless you must  and when you must act   hesitate .    the first speaker sighed softly .  living in the old university  with the brooding grandeur of the ruins of the imperial palace not too far distant  made one wonder on occasion how golden the rule might be .   in the days of the great sack  the golden rule had been strained to the breaking point .  there was no way of saving trantor without sacrificing the seldon plan for establishing a second empire .  it would have been humane to spare the forty five billion  but they could not have been spared without retention of the core of the first empire and that would have only delayed the reckoning .  if would have led to a greater destruction some centuries later and perhaps no second empire ever  the early first speakers had worked over the clearly foreseen sack for decades but had found no solution no way of assuring both the salvation of trantor and the eventual establishment of the second empire .  the lesser evil had to be chosen and trantor had died .   the second foundatianers of the time had managed by the narrowest of margins to save the university library complex and there had been guilt forever after because o    that  too .  though no one had ever demonstrated that saving the complex had led to the of the mule  there was always the intuition that there was a connection .   how nearly that had wrecked everything .   yet following the decades of the sack acrd the mule came the golden age o    the second foundation .   prior to that  for over two and a half centuries after seldon s death  the second foundation had burrowed like moles into the library  intent only on staying out of the way of the imperials .  they served as librarians in a decaying society that cared less and less for the ever more misnamed galactic library  which fell into the desuetude that best suited the purpose of the second foundationers .   it was an ignoble life .  they merely conserved the plan  while out at the end of the galaxy  the first foundation fought for its life against always greater enemies with neither help from the second foundation nor any real knowledge of it .   it was the great sack that liberated the second foundation   another reason  young gendibal   who had courage had recently said that it was the chief reason  why the sack was allowed to proceed .   after the great sack  the empire was gone and  in all the later times  the trantorian survivors never trespassed on second foundation territory uninvited .  the second foundationers saw to it that the university library complex which had survived the sack also survived the great renewal .  the ruins of the palace were preserved  too .  the metal was gone over almost all the rest of the world .  the great and endless corridors were covered up  filled in  twisted  destroyed  ignored  all under rock and soil all except here  where metal still surrounded the ancient open places .   it might be viewed as a grand memorial of greatness  the sepulcher of empire  but to the trantorians   the hamish people these were haunted places  filled with ghosts  not to be stirred .  only the second foundationers ever set foot in the ancient corridors or touched the titanium gleam .   and even so  all had nearly come to nothing because of the mule .   the mule had actually been on trantor .  what if he had found out the nature of the world he had been standing on .  his physical weapons were far greater than those at the disposal of the second foundation  his mental weapons almost as great .  the second foundation would have been hampered always by the necessity of doing nothing but what they must  and by the knowledge that almost any hope of tinning the immediate fight might portend a greater eventual loss .   had it not been for banta darell and her swift moment of action  and that  too  had been without the help of the second foundation .   and then the golden  . age  when somehow the first speakers of the time found ways of becoming active  stopping the mule in his career of conquest  controlling his mind at last  and then stopping the first foundation itself when it grew wary and overcurious concerning the nature and identity of the second foundation .  there was preem palver  nineteenth first speaker and greatest of them all  who had managed to put an end to all danger not without terrible sacrifice   and who had rescued the seldon plan .   now  for a hundred and twenty years  the second foundation was again as it once had been  hiding in a haunted portion of trantor .  they were hiding no longer from the imperials  but from the first foundation still a first foundation almost as large as the galactic empire had been and even greater in technological expertise .   the first speaker s eyes closed in the pleasant warmth and he passed into that never never state of relaxing hallucinatory experiences that were not quite dreams and not quite conscious thought .   enough of gloom .  all would be well .  trantor was still capital of the galaxy  for the second foundation was here and it was mightier and more in control than ever the emperor had been .   the first foundation would be contained and guided and would move correctly .  however formidable their ships and weapons  they could do nothing as long as key leaders could be  at need  mentally controlled .   and the second empire would come  but it would not be like the first .  it would be a federated empire  with its parts possessing considerable self rule  so that there would be none of the apparent strength and actual weakness of a unitary  centralized government .  the new empire would be looser  more pliant  more flexible  more capable of withstanding strain  and it would be guided always always by the hidden men and women of the second foundation .  trantor would then be still the capital  more powerful with its forty thousand psychohistorians than ever it had been with its forty five billion  the first speaker snapped awake .  the sun was lower in the sky .  had he been mumbling .  had he said anything aloud   if the second foundation had to know much and say little  the ruling speakers had to know mere and say less  and the first speaker lead to know mist and say least .   he smiled wryly .  it was always so tempting to become a trantorian patriot to see the whole purpose of the second empire as that of bringing about trantorian hegemony .  seldon had warned of it  he had foreseen even that  five centuries before it could come to pass .   the first speaker had not slept too long  however .  it was not yet time for gendibal s audience .   shandess was looking forward to that private meeting .  gendibal was young enough to look at the plan with new eyes  and keen enough to see what others might not .  and it was not beyond possibility that shandess would learn from what the youngster had to say .   no one would ever be certain how much preem palver   the great palver himself had profited from that day when the young kol benjoam  not yet thirty  came to talk to him about possible ways of handling the first foundation .  benjoam  who was later recognized as the greatest theorist since seldon  never spoke of that audience in later years  but eventually he became the twenty first first speaker .  there were some who credited benjoam  rather than palver  for the great accomplishments of palver s administration .   shandess amused himself with the thought of what gendibal might say .  it was traditional that keen youngsters  confronting the first speaker alone for the first time  would place their entire thesis in the first sentence .  and surely they would not ask for that precious first audience for something trivial something that might ruin their entire subsequent career by convincing the first speaker they were lightweights .   four hours later  gendibal faced him .  the young man showed no sign of nervousness .  he waited calmly for shandess to speak first .   shandess said   you have asked for a private audience  speaker  on a matter of importance .  could you please summarize the matter for me .    and gendibal  speaking quietly  almost as though he were describing what he had just eaten at dinner  said   first speaker  the seldon plan is meaningless .    stor gendibal did not require the evidence of others to give him a sense of worth .  he could not recall a time when he did not  .  now himself to be unusual .  he had been recruited for the second foundation when he was only a ten year old boy by an agent who had recognized the potentialities of his mind .   he had then done remarkably well at his studies and had taken to psychohistory as a spaceship responds to a gravitational field .  psychohistory had pulled at him and he had curved toward it  reading seldon s text on the fundamentals when others his age were merely trying to handle differential equations .   when he was fifteen  he entered trantor s galactic university  as the university of trantor had been officially renamed   after an interview during which  when asked what his ambitions were  he had answered firmly   to be first speaker before i am forty .    he had not bothered to aim for the first speaker s chair without qualification .  to gain it  one way or another  seemed to him to be a certainty .  it was to do it in youth that seemed to him to be the goal .  even preem palver bad been forty two on his accession .   the interviewer s expression had flickered when gendibal had said that  but the young man already had the feel of psycholanguage and could interpret that flicker .  he knew  as certainly as though the interviewer had announced it  that a small notation would go on his records to the effect that he would be difficult to handle .   well  of course .   gendibal intended to be difficult to handle .   he was thirty now .  he would be thirty one in a matter of two months and he was already a member of the council of speakers .  he had nine years  at most  to become first speaker and he knew he would make it .  this audience with the present first speaker was crucial to his plans and  laboring to present precisely the proper impression  he had .  spared no effort to polish his command of psycholanguage .   when two speakers of the second foundation communicate with each other  the language is like no other in the galaxy .  it is as much a language of fleeting gestures as of words  as much a matter of detected mental change patterns as anything else .   an outsider would hear little or nothing  but in a short time  much in the way of thought would be exchanged and the communication would be unreportable in its literal form to anyone but still another speaker .   the language of speakers had its advantage in speed and in infinite delicacy  but it had the disadvantage of making it almost impossible to mask true opinion .   gendibal knew his own opinion of the first speaker .  he felt the first speaker to be a man past his mental prime .  the first speaker  in gendibal s assessment expected no crisis  was not trained to meet one  and lacked the sharpness to deal with one if it appeared .  with all shandess s goodwill and amiability  he was the stuff of which disaster was made .   all of this gendibal had to hide not merely from words  gestures  and facial expressions  but even from his thoughts .  he knew no way of doing so efficiently enough to keep the first speaker from catching a whiff of it .   nor could gendibal avoid knowing something of the first speaker s feeling toward him .  through bonhomie and goodwill   quite apparent and reasonably sincere gendibal could feel the distant edge of condescension and amusement  and tightened his own mental grip to avoid revealing any resentment in return or as little as possible .   the first speaker smiled and leaned back in his chair .  he did not actually lift his feet to the desk top  but he got across just the right mixture of self assured ease and informal friendship just enough of each to leave gendibal uncertain as to the effect of his statement .   since gendibal had not been invited to sit down  the actions and attitudes available to him that might be designed to minimize the uncertainty were limited .  it was impossible that the first speaker did not understand this .   shandess said   the seldon plan is meaningless .  what a remarkable statement .  have you looked at the prime radiant lately  speaker gendibal .     i study it frequently  first speaker .  it is my duty to do so and my pleasure as well .     do you  by any chance  study only those portions of it that fall under your purview  now and then .  do you observe it in microfashion an equation system here  an adjustment rivulet there .  highly important  of course  but i have always thought it an excellent occasional exercise to observe the whole course .  studying the prime radiant  acre by acre  has its uses but observing it as a continent is inspirational .  to tell you the truth  speaker  i have not done it for a long time myself .  would you join me .    gendibal dared not pause too long .  it had to be done  and it must be done easily and pleasantly or it might as well not be done .   it would be an honor and a pleasure  first speaker .    the first speaker depressed a lever on the side of his desk .  t here was one such in the office of every speaker and the one in gendibal s office was in no way inferior to that of the first speaker .  the second foundation was an equalitarian society in all its surface manifestations the unimportant ones .  in fact  the only official prerogative of the first speaker was that which was explicit in his title he always spoke first .   the room grew dark with the depression of the lever but  almost at once  the darkness lifted into a pearly dimness .  both long walls turned faintly creamy  then brighter and whiter  and finally there appeared neatly printed equations so small that they could not be easily read .    if you have no objections   said the first speaker  making it quite clear that there would be none allowed   we will reduce the magnification in order to see as much at one time as we can .    the neat printing shrank down into fine hairlines  faint black meanderings over the pearly background .   the first speaker touched the keys of the small console built into the arm of his chair .   we ll bring it back to the start to the lifetime of hari seldon   and we ll adjust it to a small forward movement .  we ll shutter it so that we can only see a decade of development at a time .  it gives one a wonderful feeling of the flow of history  with no distractions by the details .  i wonder if you have ever done this .     never exactly this way  first speaker .     you should .  it s a marvelous feeling .  observe the sparseness of the black tracery at the start .  there was not much chance for alternatives in the first few decades .  the branch points  however  increase exponentially with time .  were it not for the fact that  as soon as a particular branch is taken  there is an extinction of a vast array of others in its future  all would soon become unmanageable .  of course  in dealing with the future  we must be careful what extinctions we rely upon .     i know  first speaker .   there was a touch of dryness in gendibal s response that he could not quire remove .   the first speaker did not respond to it .   notice the winding lines of symbols in red .  there is a pattern to them .  to all appearances  they should exist randomly  as even  speaker earns his place by adding refinements to seldon s original plan .  it would seem there is no way  after all  of predicting where a refinement can be added easily or where a particular speaker will find his interests or his ability tending  and yet i have long suspected that the admixture of seldon black and speaker red follows a strict law that is strongly dependent on time and on very little else .    gendibal watched as the years passed and as the black and red hairlines made an almost hypnotic interlacing pattern .  the pattern meant nothing in itself  of course .  what counted were the symbols of which it was composed .   here and there a bright blue rivulet made its appearance  bellying out  branching  and becoming prominent  then falling in upon itself and fading into the black or red .   the first speaker said   deviation blue   and the feeling of distaste  originating in each  filled the space between them .   we catch it over and over  and we ll be coming to the century of deviations eventually .    they did .  one could tell precisely when the shattering phoneme  non of the mule momentarily filled the galaxy  as the prime radiant suddenly grew thick with branching rivulets of blue more starting than could be closed down until the room itself seemed to turn blue as the lines thickened and marked the wall with brighter and brighter pollution .   it was the only word .    it reached its peak and then faded  thinned  and came together for a long century before it trickled to its end at last .  when it was gone  and when the plan had returned to black and red  it was clear that preem palver s hand had been there .   onward  onward   that s the present   said the first speaker comfortably .   onward  onward  then a narrowing into a veritable knot of close knit black with little red in it .    that s the establishment of the second empire   said the first speaker .   he shut off the prime radiant and the room was bathed in ordinary light .   gendibal said   that was an emotional experience .     yes   smiled the first speaker   and you are careful not to identify the emotion  as far as you can manage to fail to identify it .  it doesn t matter .  let me make the points i wish to make .    you will notice  first  the all but complete absence of deviation blue after the time of preem palver   over the last twelve decades  in other words .  you will notice that there are no reasonable probabilities of deviations above the fifth class over the next five centuries .  you will notice  too  that we have begun extending the refinements of psychohistory beyond the establishment of the second empire .  as you undoubtedly know  hari seldon   although a transcendent genius is not  and could not  be all knowing .  we have improved on him .  we know more about psychohistory than he could possibly have known .    seldon ended his calculations with the second empire and we have continued beyond it .  indeed  if i may say so without offense  the new hyper plan that goes past the establishment of the second empire is very largely my doing and has earned me my present post .    i tell you all this so that you can spare me unnecessary talk .  with all this  how do you manage to conclude that the seldon plan is meaningless .  it is without flaw .  the mere fact that it survived the century of deviations with all due respect to palver s genius is the best evidence we have that it is without flaw .  where is its weakness  young man  that you should brand the plan as meaningless .    gendibal stood stiffly upright .   you are right  first speaker .  the seldon plan has no flaw .     you withdraw your remark  then .     no  first speaker .  its lack of flaw is its flaw .  its flawlessness is fatal .    the first speaker regarded gendibal with equanimity .  he had learned to control his expressions and it amused him to watch gendibal s ineptness in this respect .  at every exchange  the young man did his best to hide his feelings  but each time  he exposed them completely .   shandess studied him dispassionately .  he was a thin young man  not much above the middle height  with thin lips and bony  restless hands .  he had dark  humorless eyes that tended to smolder .   he would be  the first speaker knew  a hard person to talk out of his convictions .    you speak in paradoxes  speaker   he said .    it sounds like a paradox  first speaker  because there is so much about seldon s plan that we take for granted and accept in so unquestioning a manner .     and what is it you question  then .     the plan s very basis .  we all know that the plan will not work if its nature or even its existence is known to too many of those whose behavior it is designed to predict .     i believe hari seldon understood that .  i even believe he made it one of his two fundamental axioms of psychohistory .     he did not anticipate the mule  first speaker  and therefore he could not anticipate the extent to which the second foundation would become an obsession with the people of the first foundation  once they had been shown its importance by the mule .     hari seldon   and for one moment  the first speaker shuddered and fell silent .   hari seldon s physical appearance was known to all the members of the second foundation .  reproductions of him in two and in three dimensions  photographic and holographic  in bas relief and in the round  sitting and standing  were ubiquitous .  they all represented him in the last few years of his life .  all were of an old and benign man  face wrinkled with the wisdom of the aged  symbolizing the quintessence of well ripened genius .   but the first speaker now recalled seeing a photograph reputed to be seldon as a young man .  the photograph was neglected  since the thought of a young seldon was almost a contradiction in terms .  yet shandess had seen it  and the thought had suddenly come to him that stor gendibal looked remarkably like the young seldon .   ridiculous .  it was the sort of superstition that afflicted everyone  now and then  however rational they might be .  he was deceived by a fugitive similarity .  if he had the photograph before him  he would see at once that the similarity was an illusion .  yet why should that silly thought have occurred to him now .   he recovered .  it had been a momentary quaver a transient derailment of thought too brief to be noticed by anyone but a speaker .  gendibal might interpret it as he pleased .    hari seldon   he said very firmly the second time   knew well that there were an infinite number of possibilities he could not foresee  and it was for that reason that he set up the second foundation .  we did not foresee the mule either  but tie recognized him once he was upon us and we stopped him .  we did not foresee the subsequent obsession of the first foundation with ourselves  but we saw it when it came and we stopped it .  what is it about this that you can possibly find fault with .     for one thing   said gendibal   the obsession of the first foundation with us is not yet over .    there was a distinct ebb in the deference with which gendibal had been speaking .  he had noted the quaver in the first speaker s voice  shandess decided  and had interpreted it as uncertainty .  that had to be countered .   the first speaker said briskly   let me anticipate .  there would be people on the first foundation  who comparing the hectic difficulties of the first nearly four centuries of existence with the placidity of the last twelve decades will come to the conclusion that this cannot be unless the second foundation is taking good care of the plan and  of course  they will be right in so concluding .  they will decide that the second foundation may not have been destroyed after all and  of course  they will be right in so deciding .  in fact  we ve received reports that there is a young man on the first foundation s capital world of terminus  an official of their government  who is quite convinced of all this .     forget his name     golan trevize   said gendibal softly .   it was i who first noted the matter in the reports  and it was i who directed the matter to your office .     oh .   said the first speaker with exaggerated politeness .   and how did your attention come to be focused on him .     one of our agents on terminus sent in a tedious report on the newly elected members of their council a perfectly routine matter usually sent to and ignored by all speakers .  this one caught my eye because of the nature of the description of one new councilman  golan trevize .  from the description  he seemed unusually self assured and combative .     you recognized a kindred spirit  did you .     not at all   said gendibal  stiffly .   he seemed a reckless person who enjoyed doing ridiculous things  a description which does not apply to me .  in any case  i directed an in depth study .  it did not take long for me to decide that he would have made good material for us if he had been recruited at an early age .     perhaps   said the first speaker   but you know that we do not recruit on terminus .     i know that well .  in any case  even without our training  he has an unusual intuition .  it is  of course  thoroughly undisciplined .  i was  therefore .  not particularly surprised that he  .  . ad grasped the fact that the second foundation still exists .  i felt it important enough  however  to direct a memo on the matter to your office .     and i take it from your manner that there is a new development .     having grasped the fact that we still exist  thanks to his highly developed intuitive abilities  he then used it in a characteristically undisciplined fashion and has  as a result  been exiled from terminus .    the first speaker lifted his eyebrows .   you stop suddenly .  you want me to interpret the significance .  without using my computer  let me mentally apply a rough approximation of seldon s equations and guess that a shrewd mayor  capable of suspecting that the second foundation exists  prefers not to have an undisciplined individual shout it to the galaxy and thus alert said second foundation to the danger .  i take it branno the bronze decided that terminus is safer with trevize off the planet .     she might have imprisoned trevize or had him quietly assassinated .     the equations are not reliable when applied to individuals  as you well know .  they deal only with humanity in mass .  individual behavior is therefore unpredictable and it is possible to assume that the mayor is a humane individual who feels imprisonment  let alone assassination  is unmerciful .    gendibal said nothing for a while .  it was an eloquent nothing  and he maintained it just long enough for the first speaker to grow uncertain of himself but not so long as to induce a defensive anger .   he timed it to the second and then he said   that is not my interpretation .  i believe that trevize  at this moment  represents the cutting edge of the greatest threat to the second foundation in its history a greater danger even than the mule .    gendibal was satisfied .  the force of the statement had worked well .  the first speaker had not expected it and was caught off balance .  from this moment  the whip hard was gendibal s .  if he had any doubt of that at all  it vanished with shandess s next remark .    does this have anything to do with your contention that seldon s plan is meaningless .    gendibal gambled on complete certainty  driving in with a didacticism that would not allow the first speaker to recover .  he said   first speaker  it is an article of faith that it was preem palver who restored the plan to its course after the wild aberrance of the century of deviations .  study the prime radiant and you will see that the deviations did not disappear till two decades after palver s death and that not one deviation has appeared since .  the credit might rest with the first speakers since palver  but that is improb    improbable .  granted none of us have been palvers  but why   will you allow me to demonstrate  first speaker .  using the mathematics of psychohistory  i can clearly show that the chances of total disappearance of deviation are too microscopically small to have taken place through anything the second foundation can do .  you need not allow me if you lack the time or the desire for the demonstration  which will take half an hour of close attention .  i can  as an alternative  call for a full meeting of the speaker s table and demonstrate it there .  but that would mean a loss of time for me and unnecessary controversy .     yes  and a possible loss of face for me .   demonstrate the matter to me now .  but a word of warning .   the first speaker was making a heroic effort to recover .   if what you show me is worthless  i will not forget that .     if it proves worthless   said gendibal with an effortless pride that overrode the other   you will have my resignation on the spot .    it took  actually  considerably more than half an hour  for the first speaker questioned the mathematics with near savage intensity .   gendibal made up some of the time by his smooth use of his microradiant .  the device which could locate any portion of the vast plan holographically and with required n either wall nor desk sized console had come into use only a decade ago and the first speaker had never learned the knack of handling it .  gendibal was aware of that .  the first speaker knew that he was .   gendibal hooked it over his rigth thumb and manipulated it with his four fingers  using his hand deliberately as though it were a musical instrument .   indeed  he had written a small paper on the analogies .     the equations gendibal produced  and found with sure ease  moved back and forth snakily to accompany his commentary .  he could obtain definitions  if necessary  set up axioms  and produce graphics  both two dimensional and three dimensional  to say nothing of projections of multidimensional relationships  .   gendibal s commentary was clear and incisive and the first speaker abandoned the game .  he was won over and said   i do not recall having seen an analysis of this nature .  whose work is it .     first speaker  it is my own .  i have published the basic mathematics involved .     very clever  speaker gendibal .  something like this will put you in line for the first speakership  should i die or retire .     i have given that matter no thought  first speaker but since there s no chance of your believing that  i withdraw the comment .  i have given it thought and i hope i will be first speaker  since whoever succeeds to the post must follow a procedure that only i see clearly .     yes   said the first speaker   inappropriate modesty can be very dangerous .  what procedure .  perhaps the present first speaker may follow it  too .  if i am too old to have made the creative leap you have  i am not so old that i cannot follow your direction .    it was a graceful surrender and gendibal s heart warned  rather unexpectedly  toward the older man  even as he realized that this was precisely the first speaker s intention .    thank you  first speaker  for i will need your help badly .  i cannot expect to sway the table without your enlightened leadership .    grace for grace .    i assume  then  that you have already seen from what i have demonstrated that it is impossible for the century of deviations to have been corrected under our policies or for all deviations to have ceased since then .     this is clear to me   said the first speaker .   if your mathematics is correct  then in order for the plan to have recovered as it did and to work as perfectly as it seems to be working  it would be necessary for us to be able to predict the reactions of small groups of people   even of individuals with some degree of assurance .     quite so .  since the mathematics of psychohistory does not allow this  the deviations should not have vanished and  even more so  should not have remained absent .  you see  then  what i meant when i said earlier that the flaw in the seldon plan was its flawlessness .    the first speaker said   either the seldon plan does possess deviations  then  or there is something wrong in your mathematics .  since i must admit that the seldon plan has not shown deviations in a century and more  it follows that there is something wrong with your mathematics except that i detected no fallacies or missteps .     you do wrong   said gendibal   to exclude a third alternative .  it is quite possible for the seldon plan to possess no deviations and yet for there to be nothing wrong in my mathematics when it predicts that to be impossible .     i fail to see the third alternative .     suppose the seldon plan is being controlled by means of a psychohistorical method so advanced that the reactions of small groups of people even perhaps of individual persons can be predicted  a method that we of the second foundation do not possess .  then  and only then  my mathematics would predict that the seldon plan should indeed experience no deviations .    for a while  by second foundation standards  the first speaker made no response .  he said   there is no such advanced psychohistorical method that is known to me or  i am certain from your manner  to you .  if you and i know of none  the chance that any other speaker  or any group of speakers  has developed such a micropsychohistory if i may call it that and has kept it secret from the rest of the table is infinitesimally small .  don t you agree .     i agree .     then either your analysis is wrong or else micropsychohistory is in the hands of some group outside the second foundation .     exactly  first speaker  the latter alternative must be correct .     can you demonstrate the truth of such a statement .     i cannot  in any formal way  but consider  has there not already been a person who could affect the seldon plan by dealing with individual people .     i presume you are referring to the mule .     yes  certainly .     the mule could only disrupt .  the problem here is that the seldon plan is working too well  considerably closer to perfection than your mathematics would allow .  you would need an anti mule someone who is as capable of overriding the plan as the mule was  but who acts for the opposite motive overriding not to disrupt but to perfect .     exactly  first speaker .  i wish i had thought of that expression .  what was the mule .  a mutant .  but where did he come from .  how did he come to be .  no one really knows .  might there not be more .     apparently not .  the one thing that is best known about the mule is that he was sterile .  hence his name .  or do you think that is a myth .     i am not referring to descendants of the mule .  might it not be that the mule was an aberrant member of what is or has now become a sizable group of people with mulish powers who for some reason of their own are not disrupting the seldon plan but supporting it .     why in the galaxy should they support it .     why do we support it .  we plan a second empire in which we  or  rather  our intellectual descendants will be the decision makers .  if  some other group is supporting the plan even more efficiently than we are  they cannot be planning to leave the decision making to us .  they will make the decisions but to what end .  ought we not try to find out what kind of a second empire they are sweeping us into .     and how do you propose to find out .     well  why has the mayor of terminus exiled golan trevize .  by doing so  she allows a possibly dangerous person to move freely about the galaxy .  that she does it out of motives of humanity  i cannot believe .  historically the rulers of the first foundation have always acted realistically  which means  usually  without regard for  morality .   one of their heroes salvor hardin counseled against morality  in fact .  no  i think the mayor acted under compulsion from agents of the anti mules  to use your phrase .  i think trevize has been recruited by them and i think he is the spearhead of danger to us .  deadly danger .    and the first speaker said   by seldon  you may be right .  but how will we ever convince the table of this .     first speaker  you underestimate your eminence .      chapter six  earth    trevize was hot and annoyed .  he and pelorat were sitting in the small dining area  having just completed their midday meal .   pelorat said   we ve only been in space two days and i find myself quite comfortable  although i miss fresh air  nature  and all that .  strange .  never seemed to notice all that sort of thing when it was all round me .  still between my wafer and that remarkable computer of yours  i have my entire library with me or all that matters  at any rate .  and i don t feel the least bit frightened of being out in space now .  astonishing .    trevize made a noncommittal sound .  his eyes were inwardly focused .   pelorat said gently   i don t mean to intrude  golan  but i don t really think you re listening .  not that i m a particularly interesting person always been a hit of a bore  you know .  still  you seem preoccupied in another way .   are we in trouble .  needn t be afraid to tell me  you know .  not much i could do  i suppose  but i won t go into panic  dear fellow .     in trouble .   trevize seemed to come to his senses  frowning slightly .    i mean the ship .  it s a new model  so i suppose there could be something wrong   pelorat allowed himself a small  uncertain smile .   trevize shook his head vigorously .   stupid of me to leave you in such uncertainty  janov .  there s nothing wrong at all with the ship .  it s working perfectly .  it s just that i ve been looking for a hyper relay .     ah  i see .   except that i don t .  what is a hyper relay .     well  let me explain  janov .  i am in communication with terminus .  at least  i can be anytime i wish and terminus can  in reverse  be in communication with us .  they know the ship s location  having observed its trajectory .  even if they had not  they could locate us by scanning near space for mass  which would warn them of the presence of a ship or  possibly  a meteoroid .  but they could further detect an energy pattern  which would not only distinguish a ship from a meteoroid but would identify a particular ship  for no two ships make use of energy in quite the same way .  in some way  our pattern remains characteristic  no matter what appliances or instruments we turn on and off .  the ship may be unknown  of course  but if it is a ship whose energy pattern is on record in terminus as ours is it can be identified as soon as detected    pelorat said   it seems to me  golan  that the advance of civilization is nothing but an exercise in the limiting of privacy .     you may be right .  sooner or later  however  we must move through hyperspace or we will be condemned to remain within a parsec or two of terminus for the rest of our lives .  we will then be unable to engage in interstellar travel to any but the slightest degree .  in passing through hyperspace  on the other hand  we undergo a discontinuity in ordinary space .  we pass from here to there and i mean across a gap of hundreds of parsecs sometimes in an instant of experienced time .  we are suddenly enormously far away in a direction that is very difficult to predict and  in a practical sense  we can no longer be detected .     i see that .  yes .     unless  of course  they have planted a hyper relay on board .  a hyperrelay sends out a signal through hyperspace   a signal characteristic of this ship and the authorities on terminus would know where we are at all times .  that answers your question  you see .  there would be nowhere in the galaxy we could hide and no combination of jumps through hyperspace would make it possible for us to evade their instruments     but  golan   bald pelorat softly   don t    e want foundation protection .     yes  janov  but only when we ask for it .  you said the advance of civilization meant the continuing restriction of privacy .   well .  i don t want to be that advanced .  i want freedom to move undetected as i wish   unless and until i want protection so i would feel better  a great deal better  if there weren t a hyper relay on board .     have you found one  golan .     no  i have not .  if i had  i might be able to render it inoperative somehow .     would you know one if you saw it .     that s one of the difficulties .  i might not be able to recognize it .  i know what a hyper relay looks like generally and i know ways of testing a suspicious object but this is a late model ship  designed for special tasks .  a hyper relay may have been incorporated into its design in such a way as to show no signs of its presence .     on the other hand  maybe there is no hyper relay present and that s why you haven t found it .     i don t dare assume that and i don t like the thought of making a jump until i know .    pelorat looked enlightened .   that s why we ve just been drifting through space .  i ve been wondering why we haven t jumped .  i ve heard about jumps  you know .  been a little nervous about it  actually been wandering when you d order me to strap myself in or take a pill or something like that .    trevize managed a smile .   no need for apprehension .  these aren t ancient times .  on a ship like this  you just leave it all to the computer .  you give it your instructions and it does the rest .  you won   t know that anything has happened at all  except that the view of space will suddenly change .  if you ve ever seen a slide show  you ll know what happens when one slide is suddenly projected in place of another .  well  that s what the jump will seem like .     dear me .  one won t feel anything .  odd .  i find that somewhat disappointing .     i ve never felt anything and the ships i ve been in haven t been as advanced as this baby of ours .   but it s not because of the hyperrelay that we haven t jumped .  we have to get a bit further away from terminus and from the sun  too .  the farther we are from any massive abject  the easier to control the jump  to make re emergence into space at exactly desired co ordinates .  in an emergency  you might risk a jump when you re only two hundred kilometers off she surface of a planet and just trust to luck that you ll end up safely .  since there is much mete safe than unsafe volume in the galaxy  you can reasonably count on safety .  still  there s all ways the possibility that random factors will cause you to re emerge within a few million kilometers of a large star or in the galactic core and you will find yourself fried before you can blink .  the further away you are from mass  the smaller those factors and the less likely it is that anything untoward will happen .     in that case  i commend your caution .  we re not in a tearing hurry     exactly .   especially since i would dearly love to find the hyperrelay before i make a move .   or find a way of convincing myself there is no hyper relay .    trevize seemed to drift off again into his private concentration and pelorat said  raising his voice a little to surmount the preoccupation barrier   how much longer do we have .     what .     i mean  when would you make the jump if you had no concerns over the hyper relay  my dear chap .     at our present speed and trajectory  i should say on our fourth day out .  i ll work out the proper time on the computer .     well  then  you still have two days for your search .  may i make a suggestion .     go ahead .     i have always found in my own work quite different from yours  of course  but possibly we may generalize that zeroing in tightly on a particular problem is self defeating .  why not relax and talk about something else  and your unconscious mind not laboring under the weight of concentrated thought may solve the problem for you .    trevize looked momentarily annoyed and then laughed .   well  why not .   tell me  professor  what got you interested in earth .  what brought up this odd notion of a particular planet from which we all started .     ah .   pelorat nodded his head reminiscently .   that s going back a while .  over thirty years .  i planned to be a biologist when i was going to college .  i was particularly interested in the variation of species on different worlds .  the variation  as you know well  maybe you don t know  so you won t mind if i tell you is very small .  all forms of life throughout the galaxy at least all that we have yet encountered share a water based protein nucleic acid chemistry .    trevize said   i went to military college  which emphasized nucleonics and gravities  but i m not exactly a narrow specialist .  i know a bit about the chemical basis of life .  we were taught that water  proteins  and nucleic acids are the only possible basis for life .     that  i think  is an unwarranted conclusion .  it is safer to say that no other form of life has yet been found or  at any rate  been recognized   and let it go at that .  what is more surprising is that indigenous species   that is  species found on only a single planet and no other are few in number .  most of the species that exist  including homo sapiens in particular  are distributed through all or most of the inhabited worlds of the galaxy and are closely related biochemically  physiologically  and morphologically .  the indigenous species  on the other hand  are widely separated in characteristics from both the widespread forms and from each other .     well  what of that .     the conclusion is that one world in the galaxy one world is different from the rest .  tens of millions of worlds in the galaxy no one knows exactly how many have developed life .  it was simple life  sparse life  feeble life not very variegated  not easily maintained  and not easily spread .  one world  one world alone  developed life in millions of species easily millions some of it very specialized  highly developed  very prone to multiplication and to spreading  and including us .  we were intelligent enough to form a civilization  to develop hyperspatial flight  and to colonize the galaxy and  in spreading through the galaxy  we took many other forms of lifeforms related to each other and to ourselves along with us .     if you stop to think of it   said trevize rather indifferently   i suppose that stands to reason .  i mean  here we are in a human galaxy .  if we assume that it all started on some one world  then that one world would have to be different .  but why not .  the chances of life developing in that riotous fashion must be very slim indeed   perhaps one in a hundred million so the chances are that it happened in one life bearing world out of a hundred million .  it had to be one .     but what is it that made that particular one world so different from the others .   said pelorat excitedly .   what were the conditions that made it unique .       merely chance  perhaps .  after all  human beings and the lifeforms they brought with them now exist on tens of millions of planets  all of which can support life  so all those worlds must be good enough .       no .  once the human species had evolved  once it had developed a technology  once it had toughened itself in the hard struggle for survival  it could then adapt to life on any world that is in the least hospitable on terminus  for instance .  but can you imagine intelligent life having developed on terminus .  when terminus was first occupied by human beings in the days of the encyciopedists  the highest form of plant life it produced was a mosslike growth on rocks  the highest forms of animal life were small coral like growths in the ocean and insectlike flying organisms on land .  we just about wiped them out and stocked sea and land with fish and rabbits and goats and grass and grain and trees and so on .  we have nothing left of the indigenous life  except for what exists in zoos and aquaria .     hmm   said trevize .   pelorat stared at him for a full minute  then sighed and said   you don t really care  do you .  remarkable .  i find no one who does  somehow .  my fault  i think .  i cannot make it interesting  even though it interests me so much .    trevize said   it s interesting .  it is .  but but so what .     it doesn t strike you that it might be interesting scientifically to study a world that gave rise to the only really flourishing indigenous ecological balance the galaxy has ever seen .     maybe  if you re a biologist .   i m not  you see .  you must forgive me .     of course  dear fellow .  it s just that i never found any biologists who were interested  either .  i told you i was a biology major .  i took it up with my professor and he wasn t interested .  he told me to turn to some practical problem .  that so disgusted me i took up history instead which had been rather a hobby of mine from my teenage years  in any case and tackled the  origin question  from that angle .    trevize said   but at least it has given you a lifework  so you must be pleased that your professor was so unenlightened .     yes  i suppose one might look at it that way .  and the lifework is an interesting one  of which i have never tired .   but i do wish it interested you .  i hate this feeling of forever talking to myself .    trevize leaned his bead back and laughed heartily .   pelorat s quiet face took or  a trace of hurt .   why are you laughing at me .     not you  janov   said trevize .   i was laughing at my own stupidity  where you re concered  i am completely grateful .  you were perfectly right  you know     to take up the importance of human origins .     no  no .   well  yes  that too .   but   meant you were right to tell me to stop consciously thinking of my problem and to turn my mind elsewhere .  it worked .  when you were talking about the manner in which life evolved  it finally occurred to me that i knew how to find that hyperrelay if it existed .     oh  that .     yes  that .  that s my monomania at the moment .  i ve been looking for that hyper relay as though i were on my old scow of a training ship  studying every part of the ship by eye  looking for something that stood out from the rest .  i had forgotten that this ship is a developed product of thousands of years of technological evolution .  don t you see .     no  golan .     we have a computer aboard .  how could i have forgotten .    he waved his hand and passed into his own room  urging pelorat along with him .    i need only try to communicate   he said  placing his hands onto the computer contact .   it was a matter of trying to reach terminus  which was now some thousands of kilometers behind .   reach .  speak .  it was as though nerve endings sprouted and extended  reaching outward with bewildering speed the speed of light  of course   to make contact .   trevize felt himself touching well  not quite touching  but sensing   well  not quite sensing  but it didn t matter  for there wasn t a word for it .   he was aware of terminus within reach and  although the distance between himself and it was lengthening by some twenty kilometers per second  contact persisted as though planet and ship were motionless and separated by a few meters .   he said nothing .  he clamped shut .  he was merely testing the principle of communication  he was not actively communicating .   out beyond  eight parsecs away  was anacreon  the nearest large planet in their backyard  by galactic standards .  to send a message by the same light speed system that had just worked for terminus   and to receive an answer as well would take fifty two years .   reach for anacreon .  think anacreon .  think it as clearly as you can .  you know its position relative to terminus and the galactic core  you ve studied its planetography and history  you ve solved military problems where it was necessary to recapture anacreon  in the impossible case   these days that it was taken by an enemy  .   space .  you ve been on anacreon .   picture it .  picture it .  you will sense being on it via hyper relay .   nothing .  his nerve endings quivered and came to rest nowhere .   trevize pulled loose .   there s no hyper relay on board the far star  janov .  i m positive .   and if i hadn t followed your suggestion  i wonder how long it would have taken me to reach this point .    pelorat  without moving a facial muscle  positively glowed .   i m so pleased to have been of help .  does this mean we jump .     no  we still wait two more days  to be safe .  we have to get away from mass  remember .   ordinarily  considering that i have a new and untried ship with which i am thoroughly unacquainted  it would probably take me two days to calculate the exact procedure   the proper hyperthrust for the first jump  in particular .  i have a feeling  though  the computer will do it all .     dear me .  that leaves us facing a rather boring stretch of time  it seems to me .     boring .   trevize smiled broadly .   anything but .  you and i  janov  are going to talk about earth .    pelorat said   indeed .  you are trying to please an old man .  that is kind of you .  really it is .     nonsense .  i m trying to please myself .  janov  you have made a convert .  as a result of what you have told me  i realize that earth is the most important and the most devouringly interesting object in the universe .    it must surely have struck trevize at the moment that pelorat had presented his view of earth .  it was only because his mind was reverberating with the problem of the hyper relay that he hadn t responded at once .  and the instant the problem had gone  he had responded .       perhaps the one statement of hari seldon s that was most often repeated was his remark concerning the second foundation being  at the other end of the galaxy  from terminus .  seldon had even named the spot .  it was to be  at star s end .    this had been included in gaal dornick s account of the day of the trial before the imperial court .   the other end of the galaxy       those were the words seldon had used to dornick and ever since that day their significance had been debated .   what was it that connected one end of the galaxy with  the other end  .  was it a straight line  a spiral  a circle  or what .   and now  luminously  it was suddenly clear to trevize that it was no line and no curve that should or could be drawn on the map of the galaxy .  it was more subtle than that .   it was perfectly clear that the one end of the galaxy was terminus .  it was at the edge of the galaxy  yes our foundation s edge  which gave the word  end  a literal meaning .  it was  however  also the newest world of the galaxy at the time seldon was speaking  a world that was about to be founded  that had not as yet been in existence for a single moment .   what would be the other end of the galaxy  in that light .  the other foundation s edge .  why  the oldest world of the galaxy .  and according to the argument pelorat had presented without knowing what he was presenting that could only be earth .  the second foundation might well be on earth .   yet seldon had said the other end of the galaxy was  at star s end .   who could say he was not speaking metaphorically .  trace the history of humanity backward as pelorat did and the line would stretch back from each planetary system  each star that shone down on an inhabited planet  to some other planetary system  some other star from which the first migrants had come  then back to a star before that until finally  all the lines stretched back to the planet on which humanity had originated .  it was the star that shone upon earth that was  star s end    trevize smiled and said almost lovingly   tell me more about earth  janov .    pelorat shook his head .   i have told you all there is  really .  we will find out more on trantor .    trevize said   no  we won t  janov .  we ll find out nothing there .  why .  because we re not going to trantor .  i control this ship and i assure you we re not .    pelorat s mouth fell open .  he struggled for breath for a moment and then said  woebegone   oh  my dear fellow .    trevize said   come an  janov .  don t look like that .  we re going to find earth .     but it s only on trantor that       no  it s not .  trantor is just someplace you can study brittle films and dusty documents and turn brittle and dusty yourself .     for decades  i ve dreamed     you ve dreamed of finding earth .     but it s only    trevize stood up  leaned over  caught the slack of pelorat s tunic  and said   don t repeat that  professor .  don t repeat it .  when you first told me we were going to look for earth  before ever we got onto this ship  you said we were sure to find it because  and i quote your own words   i have an excellent possibility in mind  now i don t ever want to hear you say  trantor  again .  i just want you to tell me about this excellent possibility .     but it must be confirmed .  so far  it s only a thought  a hope  a vague possibility .     good .  tell me about it .     you don t understand .  you simply don t understand .  it is not a field in which anyone but myself has done research .  there is nothing historical  nothing firm  nothing real .  people talk about earth as though it s a fact  and also as though it s a myth .  there are a million contradictory tales     well then  what has your research consisted of .     i ve been forced to collect every tale  every bit of supposed history  every legend  every misty myth .  even fiction .  anything that includes the name of earth or the idea of a planet of origin .  for over thirty years  i ve been collecting everything i could find from every planet of the galaxy .  now if i could only get something more reliable than all of these from the galactic library at  but you don t want me to say the word .     that s right .  don t say it .  tell me instead that one of these items has caught your attention  and tell me your reasons for thinking why it  of them all  should be legitimate .    pelorat shook his head .   there  golan  if you will excuse my saying so  you talk like a soldier or a politician .  that is not the way history works .    trevize took a deep breath and kept his temper .   tell me how it works  janov .  we ve got two days .  educate me .     you can t rely on any one myth or even on any one group .  i ve had to gather them all  analyze them  organize them  set up symbols to represent different aspects of their content tales of impossible weather  astronomic details of planetary systems at variance with what actually exists  place of origin of culture heroes specifically stated not to be native  quite literally hundreds of other items .  no use going through the entire list .  even two days wouldn t be enough .  i spent over thirty years  i tell you .    i then worked up a computer program that searched through all these myths for common components and sought a transformation that would eliminate the true impossibilities .  gradually i worked up a model of what earth must have been like .  after all  if human beings all originated on a single planet  that single planet must represent the one fact that all origin myths  all culture hero tales  have in common .   well  do you want me to go into mathematical detail .    trevize said   not at the moment  thank you  but how do you know you won t be misled by your mathematics .  we know for a fact that terminus was founded only five centuries ago and that the first human beings arrived as a colony from trantor but had been assembled from dozens if not hundreds of other worlds .  yet someone who did not know this could assume that hari seldon and salvor hardin  neither of whom were born on terminus  came from earth and that trantor was really a name that stood for earth .  certainly  if the trantor as described in seldon s time were searched for  a world with all its land surface coated with metal it would not be found and it might be considered an impossible myth .    pelorat looked pleased .   i withdraw my earlier remark about soldiers and politicians  my dear fellow .  you have a remarkable intuitive sense .  of course  i had to set up controls .  i invented a hundred falsities based on distortions of actual history and imitating myths of the type i had collected .  i then attempted to incorporate my inventions into the model .  one of my inventions was even based on terminus s early history .  the computer rejected them all .  every one .  to be sure  that might have meant i simply lacked the fictional talents to make up something reasonable  but i did my best    i m sure you did  janov .  and what did your model tell you about earth .     a number of things of varying degrees of likelihood .  a kind of profile .  for instance  about  o percent of the inhabited planets in the galaxy have rotation periods of between twenty two and twenty six galactic standard hours .  well        trevize cut in .   i hope you didn t pay any attention to that  janov .  there s no mystery there .  for a planet to be habitable  you don t want it to rotate so quickly that air circulation patterns produce impossibly stormy conditions or so slowly that temperature variation patterns are extreme .  it s a property that s self selective .  human beings prefer to live on planets with suitable characteristics  and then when all habitable planets resemble each other in these characteristics  some say   what an amazing coincidence   when it s not amazing at all and not even a coincidence .     as a matter of fact   said pelorat calmly   that s a well known phenomenon in social science .  in physics  too  i believe but i m not a physicist and i m not certain about that .  in any case  it is called the  anthropic principle  the observer influences the events he observes by the mere act of observing them or by being there to observe them .  but the question is  where is the planet that served as a model .  which planet rotates in precisely one galactic standard day of twenty four galactic standard hours .    trevize looked thoughtful and thrust out his lower lip .   you think that might be earth .  surely galactic standard could have been based on the local characteristics of any world  might it not .     not likely .  it s not the human way .  trantor was the capital world of the galaxy for twelve thousand years the most populous world for twenty thousand years yet it did not impose its rotation period of   .    galactic standard days on all the galaxy .  and terminus s rotation period is   .    gsd and we don t enforce ours on the planets dominated by us .  every planet makes use of its own private calculations in its own local planetary day system  and for matters of interplanetary importance converts with the help of computers back and forth between lpd and gsd .  the galactic standard day must come from earth     why is it a must .     for one thing  earth was once the only inhabited world  so naturally its day and year would be standard and would very likely remain standard out of social inertia as other worlds were populated .  then  too  the model i produced was that of an earth that rotated on its axis in just twenty four galactic standard hours and that revolved about its sun in just one galactic standard year .     might that not be coincidence .    pelorat laughed .   now it is you who are talking coincidence .  would you care to lay a wager on such a thing happening by coincidence .     well well   muttered trevize .    in fact  there s more to it .  there s an archaic measure of time that s called the month     i ve heard of it .     it  apparently  about fits the period of revolution of earth s satellite about earth .  however     yes .     well  one rather astonishing factor of the model is that the satellite i just mentioned is huge over one quarter the diameter of the earth itself .     never heard of such a thing  janov .  there isn t a populated planet in the galaxy with a satellite like that .     but that s good   said pelorat with animation .   if earth is a unique world in its production of variegated species and the evolution of intelligence  then we want some physical uniqueness .     but what could a large satellite have to do with variegated species  intelligence  and all that .     well now  there you hit a difficulty .  i don t really know .  but it s worth examination  don t you think .    trevize rose to his feet and folded his arms across his chest .   but what s the problem  then .  look up the statistics on inhabited planets and find one that has a period of rotation and of revolution that are exactly one galactic standard day and one galactic standard year in length  respectively .  and if it also has a gigantic satellite  you d have what you want .  i presume  from your statement that you  have an excellent possibility in mind   that you ve done just this  and that you have your world .    pelorat looked disconcerted .   well  now  that s not exactly what happened .  i did look through the statistics  or at least i had it done by the astronomy department and well  to put it bluntly  there s no such world .    trevize sat down again abruptly .   but that means your whole argument falls to the ground .     not quite  it seems to me .     what do you mean  not quite .  you produce a model with all sorts of detailed descriptions and you can t find anything that fits .  your model is useless  then .  you must start from the beginning .     no .  it just means that the statistics on populated planets are incomplete .  after all  there are tens of millions of them and some are very obscure worlds .  for instance  there is no good data on the population of nearly half .  and concerning six hundred and forty thousand populated worlds there is almost no information other than their names and sometimes the location .  some galactographers have estimated that there may be up to ten thousand inhabited planets that aren t listed at all .  the worlds prefer it that way  presumably .  during the imperial era  it might have helped them avoid taxation .     and in the centuries that followed   said trevize cynically .   it might have helped them serve as home bases for pirates  and that might have  on occasion  proved more enriching than ordinary trade .     i  wouldn t know about that   said pelorat doubtfully .   trevize said   just the same  it seems to me that earth would have to be on the list of inhabited planets  whatever its own desires .  it would be the oldest of them all  by definition  and it could not have been overlooked in the early centuries of galactic civilization .  and once on the list  it would stay on .  surely we could count on social inertia there .    pelorat hesitated and looked anguished .   actually  there there is a planet named earth on the list of inhabited planets .    trevize stared .   i m under the impression that you told me a while ago that earth was not on the list .     as earth  it is not .  there is  however  a planet named gaia .     what has that got to do with it .  gahyah .     it s spelled ga i a .  it means  earth .      why should it mean earth  janov  any more than anything else .  the name is meaningless to me .    pelorat s ordinarily expressionless face came close to a grimace .   i m not sure you ll believe this  if i go by my analysis of the myths  there were several different  mutually unintelligible  languages on earth .     what .     yes .  after all  we have a thousand different ways of speaking across the galaxy     across the galaxy  there are certainly dialectical variations  but these are not mutually unintelligible .  and even if understanding some of them is a matter of difficulty  we all share galactic standard .     certainly  but there is constant interstellar travel .  what if some world was in isolation for a prolonged period .     but you re talking of earth .  a single planet .  where s the isolation .     earth is the planet of origin  don t forget  where humanity must at one time have been primitive beyond imagining .  without interstellar travel  without computers  without technology at all  struggling up from nonhuman ancestors .     this is so ridiculous .    pelorat hung his head in embarrassment at that .   there is perhaps no use discussing this  old chap .  i never have managed to make it convincing to anyone .  my own fault  i m sure .    trevize was at once contrite .   janov  i apologize .  i spoke without thinking .  these are views  after all  to which i am not accustomed .  you have been developing your theories for over thirty years  while i ve been introduced to them all at once .  you must make allowances .   look  i ll imagine that we have primitive people on earth who speak two completely different  mutually unintelligible  languages .        half a dozen  perhaps   said pelorat diffidently .   earth may have been divided into several large land masses and it may be that there were  at first  no communications among them .  the inhabitants of each land mass might have developed an individual language .    trevize said with careful gravity   and on each of these land masses  once they grew cognizant of one another  they might have argued an  origin question  and wondered on which one human beings had first arisen from other animals .     they might very well  golan .  it would be a very natural attitude for them to have .     and in one of those languages  gaia means earth .  and the word  earth  itself is derived from another one of those languages .     yes  yes      and while galactic standard is the language that descended from the particular language in which  earth  means  earth   the people of earth for some reason call their planet  gala  from another of their languages .     exactly .  you are indeed quick  golan .     but it seems to me that there s no need to make a mystery of this .  if gaia is really earth  despite the difference in names  then gala  by your previous argument  ought to have a period of rotation of just one galactic day  a period of revolution of just one galactic year  and a giant satellite that revolves about it in just one month .     yes  it would have to be so .     well then  does it or doesn t it fulfill these requirements .     actually i can t say .  the information isn t given in the tables .     indeed .  well  then  janov  shall we go to gaia and time its periods and stare at its satellite .     i would like to  golan   pelorat hesitated .   the trouble is that the location isn t given exactly  either .     you mean  all you have is the name and nothing more  and that is your excellent possibility .     but that is just why i want to visit the galactic library .     well  wait .  you say the table doesn t give the location exactly .  does it give any information at all .     it lists it in the sayshell sector and adds a question mark .     well  then  janov  don t be downcast .  we will go to the sayshell sector and somehow we will find gaia .      chapter seven  farmer    stor gendibal jogged along the country road outside the university .  it was not common practice for second foundationers to venture into the farming world of trantor .  they could do so  certainly  but when they did  they did not venture either far or for long .   gendibal was an exception and he had  in times past  wondered why .  wondering meant exploring his own mind  something that speakers  in particular  were encouraged to do .  their minds were at once their weapons and their targets  and they had to keep both offense and defense well honed .   gendibal had decided  to his own satisfaction  that one reason he was different was because he had come from a planet that was both colder and more massive than the average inhabited planet .  when he was brought to trantor as a boy  through the net that was quietly cast throughout the galaxy by agents of the second foundation on the lookout for talent   he found himself  therefore  in a lighter gravitational field and a delightfully mild climate .  naturally he enjoyed being in the open more than some of the others might .   in his early years on trantor  he grew conscious of his puny  undersized frame  and he was afraid that settling back into the comfort of a benign world would turn him flabby indeed .  he therefore undertook a series of self developing exercises that had left him still puny in appearance but kept hint wiry and with a good wind .  part of his regimen were these long walks arid joggings about which some at the speaker s table muttered .  gendibal disregarded their chattering .   he kept his own ways  despite the fact that he was first generation .  all the others at the table were second  and third generation  with parents and grandparents who had been second foundationers .  and they were all older than he  too .  what  then  was to be expected but muttering .   by long custom  all minds at the speaker s table were open  supposedly altogether  though it was a rare speaker who didn t maintain a comer of privacy somewhere in the long run  ineffectively  of course  and gendibal knew that what they felt was envy .  so did they  just as gendibal knew his own attitude was defensive  overcompensating ambition .  and so did they .   besides  gendibal s mind reverted to the reasons for his ventures into the hinterland  he had spent his childhood in a whole world a large and expansive one  with grand and variegated scenery and in a fertile valley of that world  surrounded by what he believed to be the most beautiful mountain ranges in the galaxy .  they were unbelievably spectacular in the grim winter of that world .  he remembered his former world and the glories of a now distant childhood .  he dreamed about it often .  how could he bring himself to be confined to a few dozen square miles of ancient architecture .   he looked about disparagingly as he jogged .  trantor was a mild and pleasant world  but it was not a rugged and beautiful one .  though it was a farming world  it was not a fertile planet .   it never had been .  perhaps that  as much as any other factor  had led to its becoming the administrative center of  first  an extensive union of planets and then of a galactic empire .  there was no strong push to have it be anything else .  it wasn t extraordinarily good for anything else .   after the great sack  one thing that kept trantor going was its enormous supply of metal .  it was a great mine  supplying half a hundred worlds with cheap alloy steel  aluminum  titanium  copper  magnesium   returning  in this way  what it had collected over thousands of years  depleting its supplies at a rate hundreds of times faster than the original rate of accumulation .   there were still enormous metal supplies available  but they were underground and harder to obtain .  the hamish farmers  who never called themselves  trantorians   a term they considered ill omened and which the second foundationers therefore reserved for themselves  had grown reluctant to deal with the metal any further .  superstition  undoubtedly .   foolish of them .  the metal that remained underground might well be poisoning the soil and further lowering its fertility .  and yet  on the other hand  the population was thinly spread and the land supported them .  and there were some sales of metal  always .   gendibal s eyes roved over the fiat horizon .  trantor was alive geologically  as almost all inhabited planets were  but it had been a hundred million years  at least  since the last major geological mountain building period had occurred .  what uplands existed had been eroded into gentle hills .  indeed  many of them had been leveled during the great metal coating period of trantor s history .   off to the south  well out of sight  was the shore of capital bay  and beyond that  the eastern ocean  both of which had been re established after the disruption of the underground cisterns .   to the north were the towers of galactic university  obscuring the comparatively squat but wide library  most of which was underground   and the remains of the imperial palace still farther north .   immediately on either side were farms  on which there was an occasional building .  he passed groups of cattle  goats  chickens the wide variety of domesticated animals found on any trantorian farm .  none of them paid him any mind .   gendibal thought casually that anywhere in the galaxy  on any of the vast number of inhabited worlds  he would see these animals and that on no two worlds would they be exactly alike .  he remembered the goats of home and his own tame nanny whom he had once milked .  they were much larger and more resolute than the small and philosophical specimens that had been brought to trantor and established there since the great sack .  over the inhabited worlds of the galaxy  there were varieties of each of these animals  in numbers almost beyond counting  and there was no sophisticate on any world who didn t swear by his favorite variety  whether for meat  milk  eggs  wool  or anything else they could produce .   as usual  there were no hamish in view .  gendibal had the feeling that the farmers avoided being seen by those whom they referred to as  scowlers   a mispronunciation perhaps deliberately of the word  scholars  in their dialect  .   superstition  again .   gendibal glanced up briefly at trantor s sun .  it was quite high in the sky  but its heat was not oppressive .  in this location  at this latitude  the warmth saved mild and the cold never bit .   gendibal ever .  missed the biting cold sometimes or so he imagined .  he had never revisited his native world .  perhaps  he admitted to himself  because he didn t want to be disillusioned .    he had the pleasant feel of muscles that were sharpened and tightened to keenness and he decided he had jogged just long enough .  he settled down to a walk  breathing deeply .   he would be ready for the upcoming table meeting and for one last push to force a change in policy  a new attitude that would recognize the growing danger from the first foundation and elsewhere and that would put an end to the fatal reliance on the  perfect  working of the plan .  when would they realize that the very perfection was the surest sign of danger .   had anyone but himself proposed it  he knew  it would have gone through without trouble .  as things stood now  there would be trouble  but it would go through  just the same  for old shandess was supporting him and would undoubtedly continue to do so .  he would not wish to enter the history books as the particular first speaker under whom the second foundation had withered .   hamish .   gendibal was startled .  he became aware of the distant tendril of mind well before he saw the person .  it was hamish mind a farmer  coarse and unsubtle .  carefully gendibal withdrew  leaving a touch so light as to be undetectable .  second foundation policy was very firm in this respect .  the farmers were the unwitting shields of the second foundation .  they must be left as untouched as possible .   no one who came to trantor for trade or tourism ever saw anything other than the farmers  plus perhaps a few unimportant scholars living in the past .  remove the farmers or merely tamper with their innocence and the scholars would become more noticeable with catastrophic results .   that was one of the classic demonstrations which neophytes at the university were expected to work out for themselves .  the tremendous deviations displayed on the prime radiant when the farmer minds were even slightly tampered with were astonishing .    gendibal saw him .  it was a farmer  certainly  hamish to the core .  he was almost a caricature of what a trantorian farmer should be tall and wide  brown skinned  roughly dressed  arms bare  dark haired  dark eyed  a long ungainly stride .  gendibal felt as though he could smell the barnyard about him .   not too much scorn  he thought .  preem palver had not minded playing the role of farmer  when that was necessary to his plans .  some farmer he was short and plump and soft .  it was his mind that had fooled the teenaged arkady  never his body .    the farmer was approaching him  clumping down the road  staring at him openly something that made gendibal frown .  no hamish man or woman had ever looked at him in this manner .  even the children ran away and peered from a distance .   gendibal did not slow his own stride .  there would be room enough to pass the other with neither comment nor glance and that would be best .  he determined to stay away from the farmer s mind .   gendibal drifted to one side  but the farmer was not going to have that .  he stopped  spread his legs wide  stretched out his large arms as though to block passage  and said   ho .  be you scowler .    try as he might  gendibal could not refrain from sensing the wash of pugnacity in the approaching mind .  he stopped .  it would be impossible to attempt to pass by without conversation and that would be  in itself  a weary task .  used as one was to the swift and subtle interplay of sound and expression and thought and mentality that combined to make up the communication between second foundationers  it was wearisome to resort to word combination alone .  it was like prying up a boulder by arm and shoulder  with a crowbar lying nearby .   gendibal said  quietly and with careful lack of emotion   i am a scholar .  yes .     ho .  you am a scowler .  don t we speak outlandish now .  and cannot i see that you be one or am one .   he ducked his head in a mocking bow .   being  as you be  small and weazen and pale and upnosed .     what is it you want of me  hamishman .   asked gendibal  unmoved .    i be titled rufirant .  and karoll be my previous .   his accent became noticeably more hamish .  his r s rolled throatily .   gendibal said   what is it you want with me  karoll rufirant .     and how be you titled  scowler .     does it matter .  you may continue to call me  scholar .      if i ask  it matters that i be answered  little up nosed scowler .     well then  i am titled stor gendibal and i will now go about my business .     what be your business .    gendibal felt the hair prickling on the back of his neck .  there were other minds present .  he did not have to turn to know there were three more hamishmen behind him .  off in the distance  there were others .  the farmer smell was strong .    my business  karoll rufirant  is certainly none of yours .     say you so .   rufirant s voice rose .   mates  he says his business be not ours .    there was a laugh from behind him and a voice sounded .   right he be  for his business be book mucking and  puter rubbing  and that be naught for true men .     whatever my business is   said gendibal firmly   i will be about it now .     and how will you do that  wee scowler .   said rufirant .    by passing you .     you would try .  you would not fear arm stopping .     by you and all your mates .  or by you alone .   gendibal suddenly dropped into thick hamish dialect .   art not feared alone .    strictly speaking  it was not proper to prod him in this manner  but it would stop a mass attack and that had to be stopped  lest it force a still greater indiscretion on his part .   it worked .  rufirant s expression grew lowering .   if fear there be  bookboy  th art the one to be full of it .  mates  make room .  stand back and let him pass that he may see if i be feared alane .    rufirant lifted his great arms and moved them about .  gendibal did not fear the farmer s pugilistic science  but there was always a chance that a goodly blow might land .   gendibal approached cautiously  working with delicate speed within rufirant s mind .  not much just a touch  unfelt but enough to slow reflexes that crucial notch .  then out  and into all the others  who were now gathering in greater numbers .  gendibal s speaker mind darted back and forth with virtuosity  never resting in one mind long enough to leave a mark  but just long enough for the detection of something that might be useful .   he approached the farmer catlike  watchful  aware and relieved that no one was making a move to interfere .   rufirant struck suddenly  but gendibal saw it in his mind before any muscle had begun to tighten and he stepped to one side .  the blow whistled past  with little room to spare .  yet gendibal still stood there  unshaken .  there was a collective sigh from the others .   gendibal made no attempt to either parry or return a blow .  it would be difficult to parry without paralyzing his own arm and to return a blow would be of no use  far the farmer would withstand it without trouble .   he could only maneuver the man as though he were a bull  forcing him to miss .  that would serve to break his morale as direct opposition would not .   bull like and roaring  rufirant charged .  gendibai was ready and drifted to one side just sufficiently to allow the farmer to miss his clutch .  again the charge .  again the miss .   gendibai felt his own breath begin to whistle through his nose .  the physical effort was small  but the mental effort of trying to control without controlling was enormously difficult .  he could not keep it up long .   he said as calmly as he could while batting lightly at rufirant s fear depressant mechanism  trying to rouse in a minimalist manner what must surely be the farmer s superstitious dread of scholars  i will now go about my business .    rufirant s face distorted with rage  but for a moment he did not move .  gendibal could sense his thinking .  the little scholar had melted away like magic .  gendibal could feel the other s fear rise and for a moment  but then the hamish rage surged higher and drowned the fear .   rufirant shouted   mates .  scowler he dancer .  he do duck on nimble toes and scorns the rules of honest hamish blow for blow .  seize him .  hold him .  we will trade blow for blow  then .  he may be firststriker  gift of me  and i i will be last striker .    gendibal found the gaps among those who now surrounded him .  his only chance was to maintain a gap long enough to get through  then to run  trusting to his own wind and to his ability to dull the farmers  will .   back and forth he dodged  with his mind cramping in effort .   it would rat work .  there were too many of them and the necessity of abiding within the rules of trantorian behavior was too constricting .   he felt hands on his arms .  he was held .   he would have to interfere with at least a few of the minds .  it would be unacceptable and his cancer would be destroyed .  but his life his very life was at hazard .   how had this happened .   the meeting of the table was not complete .   it was not the custom to wait if any speaker were late .  nor  thought shandess  was the table in a mood to wait  in any case .  stor gendibal was the youngest and far from sufficiently aware of the fact .  he acted as though youth were in itself a virtue and age a matter of negligence on the part of those who should know better .  gendibal was not popular with the other speakers .  he was not  in point of fact  entirely popular with shandess himself .  but popularity was not at issue here .   delora delarmi broke in on his reverie .  she was looking at him out of wide blue eyes  her round face with its accustomed air of innocence and friendliness masking an acute mind  to all but other second foundationers of her own rank  and ferocity of concentration .   she said  smiling   first speaker  do we wait longer .    the meeting had not yet been formally called to order so that  strictly speaking  she could open the conversation  though another might have waited for shandess to speak first by right of his title .    shandess looked at her disarmingly  despite the slight breach in courtesy .   ordinarily we would not  speaker delarmi  but since the table meets precisely to hear speaker gendibal  it is suitable to stretch the rules .     where is he  first speaker .     that  speaker delarmi  i do not know .    delarmi looked about the rectangle of faces .  there was the first speaker and what should have been eleven other speakers .   only twelve .  through five centuries  the second foundation had expanded its powers and its duties  but all attempts to expand the table beyond twelve had failed .   twelve it had been after seldon s death  when the second first speaker  seldon himself had always been considered as having been the first of the line  had established it  and twelve it still was .   why twelve .  that number divided itself easily into groups of identical size .  it was small enough to consult as a whole and large enough to do work in subgroups .  more would have been too unwieldy  fewer  too inflexible .   so went the explanations .  in fact  no one knew why the number had been chosen or why it should be immutable .  but then  even the second foundation could find itself a slave to tradition .   it took delarmi only a flashing moment to have her mind twiddle the matter as she looked from face to face  and mind to mind  and then  sardonically  at the empty seat the junior seat .   she was satisfied that there was no sympathy at all with gendibal .  the young man  she had always felt  had all the charm of a centipede and was best treated as one .  so far  only his unquestioned ability and talent had kept anyone from openly proposing trial for expulsion .   only two speakers had been impeached but not convicted in the hemimillennial history of the second foundation .    the obvious contempt  however  of missing a meeting of the table was worse than many an offense and delarmi was pleased to sense that the mood for trial had moved forward rather more than a notch .   she said   first speaker  if you do not know the whereabouts of speaker gendibal  i would be pleased to tell you .     yes  speaker .     who among us does not know that this young man   she used no honorific in speaking of him  and it was something that everyone noted  of course   finds business among the hamish continually .  what that business might be  i do not ask  but he is among them now and his concern with them is clearly important enough to take precedence over this table .     i believe   said another of the speakers   that he merely walks or jogs as a form of physical exercise .    delarmi smiled again .  she enjoyed smiling .  it cost her nothing .   the university  the library  the palace  and the entire region surrounding these are ours .  it is small in comparison with the planet itself  but it contains room enough  i think  for physical exercise .   first speaker  might we not begin .    the first speaker sighed inwardly .  he had the full power to keep the table waiting or  indeed  to adjourn the meeting until a time when gendibal was present .   no first speaker could long function smoothly  however  without at least the passive support of the other speakers and it was never wise to irritate them .  even preem palver had occasionally been forced into cajolery to get his way .   besides  gendibal s absence was annoying  even to the first speaker .  the young speaker might as well learn he was not a law unto himself .   and now  as first speaker  he did speak first  saying   we will begin .  speaker gendibal has presented some startling deductions from prime radiant data .  he believes that there is some organization that is working to .  maintain the seldon plan more efficiently than we can and that it does so for its own purpose .  we must  in his view therefore  learn more about it out of self defense .  you all have been informed of this  and this meeting is to allow you all a chance to question speaker gendibal  in order that we may come to some conclusion as to future policy .    it was  in fact  even unnecessary to say this much .  shandess held his mind open  so they all knew .  speaking was a matter of courtesy .   delarmi looked about swiftly .  the other ten seemed content to allow her to take on the role of anti gendibal spokesperson .  she said   yet gendibal   again the omission of the honorific   does not know and cannot say what or who this other organization is .    she phrased it unmistakably as a statement  which skirted the edge of rudeness .  it was as much as to say  i can analyze your mind  you need not bother to explain .   the first speaker recognized the rudeness and made the swift decision to ignore it .   the fact that speaker gendibal   he punctiliously avoided the omission of the honorific and did not even point up the fact by stressing it   does not know and cannot say what the other organization is  does not mean it does not exist .  the people of the first foundation  through most of their history  knew virtually nothing about us and  in fact  know next to nothing about us now .  do you question our existence .     it does not follow   said delarmi   that because we are unknown and yet exist  that anything  in order to exist  need only be unknown .   and she laughed lightly .    true enough .  that is why speaker gendibal s assertion must be examined most carefully .  it is based on rigorous mathematical deduction  which i have gone over myself and which i urge you all to consider .  it is   he searched for a cast of mind that best expressed his views   not unconvincing .     and this first foundationer  golan trevize  who hovers in your mind but whom you do not mention .    another rudeness and this time the first speaker flushed a bit .    what of him .    the first speaker said   it is speaker gendibal s thought that this man  trevize  is the tool perhaps an unwitting one of this organization and that we must not ignore him .     if   said delarmi  sitting back in her chair and pushing her graying hair backward and out of her eyes   this organization whatever it is   exists and if it is dangerously powerful in its mental capabilities and is so hidden  is it likely to be maneuvering so openly by way of someone as noticeable as an exiled councilman of the first foundation .    the first speaker said gravely   one would think not .  and yet i have noticed something that is most disquieting .  i do not understand it .   almost involuntarily he buried the thought in his mind  ashamed that others might see it .   each of the speakers noted the mental action and  as was rigorously required  respected the shame .  delarmi did  too  but she did so impatiently .  she said  in accordance with the required formula   may we request that you let us know your thoughts  since we understand and forgive any shame you may feel .    the first speaker said   like you  i do not see on what grounds one should suppose councilman trevize to be a tool of the other organization  or what purpose he could possibly serve if he were .  yet speaker gendibal seems sure of it  and one cannot ignore the possible value of intuition in anyone who has qualified for speaker .  i therefore attempted to apply the plan to trevize .     to a single person .   said one of the speakers in low voiced  surprise  and then indicated his contrition at once for having accompanied the question with a thought that was clearly the equivalent of  what a fool .    to a single person   said the first speaker   and you are right .  what a fool i am .  i know very well that the plan cannot possibly apply to individuals  not even to small groups of individuals .  nevertheless  i was curious .  i extrapolated the interpersonal intersections far past the reasonable limits  but i did it in sixteen different ways and chose a region rather than a point .  i then made use of all the details we know about trevize   a councilman of the first foundation does not go completely unnoticed and of the foundation s mayor .  i then threw it all together  rather higgledy piggledy  i m afraid .   he paused .     well .   said delarmi .   i gather you  were the results surprising .     there weren t any results  as you might all expect   said the first speaker .   nothing can be done with a single individual  and yet and yet     and yet .     i have spent forty years analyzing results and i have grown used to obtaining a clear feeling of what the results would be before they were analyzed and i have rarely been mistaken .  in this case  even though there were no results  i developed the strong feeling that gendibal was right and that trevize should not be left to himself .     why not  first speaker .   asked delarmi  clearly taken aback at the strong feeling in the first speaker s mind .    i am ashamed   said the first speaker   that i have let myself be tempted into using the plan for a purpose for which it is not fit .  i am further ashamed now that i am allowing myself to be influenced by something that is purely intuitive .   yet i must  for i feel this very strongly .  if speaker gendibal is right if we are in danger from an unknown direction then i feel that when the time comes that our affairs are at a crisis  it will be trevize who will hold and play the deciding card .     on what basis do you feel this .   said delarmi  shocked .   first speaker shandess looked about the table miserably   i have no basis .  the psychohistorical mathematics produces nothing  but as i watched the interplay of relationships  it seemed to me that trevize is the key to everything .  attention must be paid to this young man .    gendibal knew that he would not get back in time to join the meeting of the table .  it might be that he would not get back at all .   he was held firmly and he tested desperately about him to see how he could best manage to force them to release him .   rufirant stood before him now  exultant .   be you ready now  scowler .  blow for blow  strike for strike  hamish fashion .  come then  art the smaller  strike then first .    gendibal said   will someone hold thee  then  as i be held .    rufirant said   let him go .  nah nah .  his arms alane .  leave arms free  but hold legs strong .  we want no dancing .    gendibal felt himself pinned to the ground .  his arms were free .    strike  scowler   said rufirant .   give us a blow .    and then gendibal s probing mind found something that answered   indignation  a sense of injustice and pity .  he had no choice  he would have to run the risk of outright strengthening and then improvising on the basis of there was no need .  he had not touched this new mind  yet it reacted as he would have wished .  precisely .   he suddenly became aware of a small figure stocky  with long  tangled black hair and arms thrust outward careening madly into his field of view and pushing madly at the hamish farmer .   the figure was that of a woman .  gendibal thought grimly that it was a measure of his tension and preoccupation that he had not noted this till his eyes told him so .    karoll rufirant .   she shrieked at the farmer .   art bully and coward .  strike for strike  hamish fashion .  you be two times yon scowler s size .  you ll be in more sore danger attacking me .  be there renown in pashing yon poor spalp .  there be shame  i m thinking .  it will be a fair heap of finger pointing and there ll be full saying   yon be rufirant  renowned baby smasher .   it ll be laughter  i m thinking  and no decent hamishman will be drinking with you and no decent hamishwoman will be ought with you .    rufirant was trying to stem the torrent  warding off the blows she was aiming at him  attempting weakly to answer with a placating   now  sura .  now  sura .    gendibal was aware that hands no longer grasped him  that rufirant no longer glared at him  that the minds of all were no longer concerned with him .   sura was not concerned with him  either  her fury was concentrated solely on rufirant .  gendibal  recovering  now looked to take measures to keep that fury alive and to strengthen the uneasy shame flooding rufirant s mind  and to do both so lightly and skillfully as to leave no mark .  again  there was no need .   the woman said   all of you back step .  look here .  if it be not sufficient that this karoll heap be like giant to this starveling  there must be five or six more of you ally friends to share in shame and go back to farm with glorious tale of dewing do in baby smashing .   i held the spalp s arm   you ll say   and giant rufirant block pashed him in face when he was not to back strike .   and you ll say   but i held his foot  so give me also glory .   and rufirant chunk will say   i could not have kiln on his lane  so my furrow mates pinned him and  with help of all six  i gloried on him .      but sura   said rufirant  almost whining     told scowler he might have first shrike .     and fearful you were of the mighty blows of his thin arms  not so  rufirant thickhead .  come .  let him go where he be going  and the rest of you to your homes back crawl  if so be those homes will still find a welcome making for you .  you had all best hope the grand deeds of this day be forgotten .  and they will not be  for i be spreading them far wide  if you do make me any the more fiercely raging than i be raging now .    they trooped off quietly  heads hanging  not looking back .   gendibal stared after them  then back at the woman .  she was dressed in blouse and trousers  with roughmade shoes on her feet .  her face was wet with perspiration and she breathed heavily .  her nose was rather large  her breasts heavy  as best gendibal could tell through the looseness of her blouse   and her bare arms muscular .   but then  the hamishwomen worked in the fields beside their men .   she was looking at him sternly  arms akimbo .   well  scowler  why be lagging .  go on to place of scowlers .  be you feared .  shall i company you .    gendibal could smell the perspiration on clothes that were clearly not freshly laundered  but under the circumstances it would be most discourteous to show any repulsion .    i thank you  miss sura     the name be novi   she said gruffly .   sura novi .  you may say novi .  it be unneeded to moresay .     i thank you  novi .  you have been very helpful .  you be welcome to company me  not for fear o    mine but for company pleasure in you .   and he bowed gracefully  as he might have bowed to one of the young women at the university .   novi flushed  seemed uncertain  and then tried to imitate his gesture .   pleasure be mine   she said  as though searching for words that would adequately express her pleasure and lend an air of culture .   they walked together .  gendibal knew well that each leisurely step made him the more unforgiveably late for the table meeting  but by now he had had a chance to think on the significance of what had taken place and he was icily content to let the lateness grow .   the university buildings were looming ahead of them when sura novi stopped and said hesitantly   master scowler .    apparently  gendibal thought  as she approached what she called the  place of scowlers   she grew mare polite .  he had a momentary urge to say   address you not yon poor spalp .    but that would embarrass her beyond reason .    yes  novi .     be it very fine like and rich in place of scowlers .     it s nice   said gendibal .    i once dreamed i be in place .  and and i be scowler .     someday   said gendibal politely   i ll show it thee .    her look at him showed plainly she didn t take it for mere politeness .  she said   i can write .  i be taught by schoolmaster .  if i write letter to thee   she tried to make it casual   how do i mark it so it come to thee .     just say   speaker s house  apartment      and it will come to me .  but i must go  novi .    he bowed again  and again she tried to imitate the action .  they moved off in opposite directions and gendibal promptly put her out of his mind .  he thought instead of the table meeting and  in particular  of speaker delora delarmi .  his thoughts were not gentle .     chapter eight  farmwoman    the speakers sat about the table  frozen in their mental shielding .  it was as though all with one accord had hidden their minds to avoid irrevocable insult to the first speaker after his statement concerning trevize .  surreptitiously they glanced toward delarmi and even that gave away much .  of them all  she was best known for her irreverence  even gendibal paid more lip service to convention .   delarmi was aware of the glances and she knew that she had no choice but to face up to this impossible situation .  in fact  she did not want to duck the issue .  in all the history of the second foundation  no first speaker had ever been impeached for misanalysis  and behind the term  which she had invented as cover up  was the unacknowledged incompetence  .  such impeachment now became possible .  she would not hang back .    first speaker .   she said softly  her thin  colorless lips more nearly invisible than usual in the general whiteness of her face .   you yourself say you have no basis for your opinion  that the psychohistorical mathematics show nothing do you ask us to base a crucial decision on a mystical feeling .    the first speaker looked up  his forehead corrugated .  he was aware of the universal shielding at the table .  he knew what it meant .  he said coldly   i do not hide the lack of evidence .  i present you with nothing falsely .  what i offer is the strongly intuitive feeling of a first speaker  one with decades of experience who has spent nearly a lifetime in the close analysis of the seldon plan .   he looked about him with a proud rigidity he rarely displayed  and one by one the mental shields softened and dropped .  delarmi s  when he turned to stare at her  was the last .   she said  with a disarming frankness that filled her mind as though nothing else had ever been there   i accept your statement  of course  first speaker .  nevertheless  i think you might perhaps want to reconsider .  as you think about it now  having already expressed shame at having to fall back on intuition  would you wish your remarks to be stricken from the record if  in your judgment they should be    and gendibal s voice cut in .   what are these remarks that should .  be stricken from the record .    every pair of eyes turned in unison .  had their shields not been up during the crucial moments before  they would have been aware of his approach long before he was at the door .    all shields up a moment ago .  all unaware of my entrance .   said gendibal sardonically .   what a commonplace meeting of the table we have here .  was no one on their guard for my coming .  or did you all fully expect that i would not arrive .    this outburst was a flagrant violation of all standards .  for gendibal to arrive late was bad enough .  for him to then enter unannounced was worse .  for him to speak before the first speaker had acknowledged his attendance was worst of all .   the first speaker turned to him .  all else was superceded .  the question of discipline came first .    speaker gendibal   he said   you are late .  you arrive unannounced .  you speak .  is there any reason why you should not be suspended from your seat for thirty days .     of course .  the move for suspension should not be considered until first we consider who it was that made it certain i would be late and why .   gendibal s words were cool and measured  but his mind clothed his thoughts with anger and he did not care who sensed it .   certainly delarmi sensed it .  she said forcefully   this man is mad .     mad .  this woman is mad to say so .  or aware of guilt .   first speaker  i address myself to you and move a point of personal privilege   said gendibal .    personal privilege of what nature  speaker .     first speaker  i accuse someone here of attempted murder .    the room exploded as every speaker rose to his or her feet in a simultaneous babble of words  expression  and mentality .   the first speaker raised his arms .  he cried   the speaker must have his chance to express his point of personal privilege .   he found himself forced to intensify his authority  mentally  in a manner most inappropriate to the place yet there was no choice .   the babble quieted .   gendibal waited unmoved until the silence was both audibly and mentally profound .  he said   on my way here  moving along a hamish road at a distance and approaching at a speed that would have easily assured my arrival in good time for the meeting  i was stopped by several farmers and narrowly escaped being beaten  perhaps being killed .  as it was  i was delayed and have but just arrived .  may i point out  to begin with  that i know of no instance since the great sack that a second foundationer has been spoken to disrespectfully let alone manhandled by one of these hamish people .     nor do i   said the first speaker .   delarmi cried out   second foundationers do not habitually walk alone in hamish territory .  you invite this by doing so .     it is true   said gendibal   that i habitually walk alone in hamish territory .  i have walked there hundreds of times in every direction .  yet i have never been accosted before .  others do not walk with the freedom that i do  but no one exiles himself from the world or imprisons himself in the university and no one has ever been accosted .  i recall occasions when delarmi   and then  as though remembering the honorific too late  he deliberately converted it into a deadly insult .   i mean to say  i recall when speakeress delarmi was in hamish territory  at one time or another  and yet she was not accosted .     perhaps   said delarmi  with eyes widened into a glare   because i did not speak to them first and because i maintained my distance .  because i behaved as though i deserved respect  i was accorded it .     strange   said gendibal   and i was about to say that it was because you presented a more formidable appearance than i did .  after all  few dare approach you even here .   but tell me  why should it be that of all times for interference  the hamish would choose this day to face me  when i am to attend an important meeting of the table .     if it were not because of your behavior  then it must  have been chance   said delarmi .   i have not heard that even all of seldon s mathematics has removed the role of chance from the galaxy   certainly not in the case of individual events .  or are you  too  speaking from intuitional inspiration .    there was a soft mental sigh from one or two speakers at this sideways thrust at the first speaker .     it was not my behavior .  it was not chance .  it was deliberate interference   said gendibal .    how can we know that .   asked the first speaker gently .  he could not help but soften toward gendibal as a result of delarmi s last remark .    my mind is open to you  first speaker .  i give you and all the table my memory of events .    the transfer took but a few moments .  the first speaker said   shocking .  you behaved very well  speaker  under circumstances of considerable pressure .  i agree that the hamish behavior is anomalous and warrants investigation .  in the meantime  please join our meeting     a moments  cut in delarmi .   how certain are we that the speaker s account is accurate .    gendibal s nostrils flared at the insult  but he retained his level composure .   my mind is open     i have known open minds that were not open .     i have no doubt of that  speaker   said gendibal   since you  like the rest of us  must keep your own mind under inspection at all times .  my mind  when open  however  is open .    the first speaker said   let us have no further     a point of personal privilege  first speaker  with apologies for the interruption   said delarmi .    personal privilege of what nature  speaker .     speaker gendibal has accused one of us of attempted murder  presumably by instigating the farmer to attack him .  as long as the accusation is not withdrawn  i must be viewed as a possible murderer  as would every person in this room including you  first speaker .    the first speaker said   would you withdraw the accusation  speaker gendibal .    gendibal took his seat and put his hands down upon its arms  gripping them tightly  as though taking ownership of it  and said   i will do so  as soon as someone explains why a hamish farmer  rallying several others  should deliberately set out to delay me on my way to this meeting .     a thousand reasons  perhaps   said the first speaker .   i repeat that this event will be investigated .  will you  for now  speaker gendibal  and in the interest of continuing the present discussion  withdraw your accusation .     i cannot  first speaker .  i spent long minutes trying  as delicately as i might  to search his mind for ways to alter his behavior without damage and failed .  his mind lacked the give it should have had .  his emotions were fixed  as though by an outside mind .    delarmi said with a sudden little smile   and you think one of us was the outside mind .  might it not have been your mysterious organization that is competing with us  that is more powerful than we are .     it might   said gendibai .    in that case  we who are not members of this organization that only you know of are not guilty and you should withdraw your accusation .  or can it be that you are accusing someone here of being under the control of this strange organization .  perhaps one of us here is not quite what he or she seems .     perhaps   said gendibal stolidly  quite aware that delarmi was feeding him rope with a noose at the end of it .    it might seem   said delarmi  reaching the noose and preparing to tighten it   that your dream of a secret  unknown  hidden  mysterious organization is a nightmare of paranoia .  it would ft in with your paranoid fantasy that hamish farmers are being influenced  that speakers are under hidden control .  i am willing  however  to follow this peculiar thought line of yours for a while longer .  which of us here  speaker  do you think is under control .  might it be me .    gendibal said   i would not think so  speaker .  if you were attempting to rid yourself of me in so indirect a manner  you would not so openly advertise your dislike for me .     a double double cross  perhaps .   said delarmi .  she was virtually purring .   that would be a common conclusion in a paranoid fantasy .     so it might be .  you are more experienced in such matters than i .     speaker lestim gianni interrupted hotly .   see here  speaker gendibal  if you are exonerating speaker delarmi  you are directing your accusations the more tightly at the rest of us .  what grounds would any of us have to delay your presence at this meeting  let alone wish you dead .    gendibal answered quickly  as though he had been waiting for the question .   when i entered  the point under discussion was the striking of remarks from the record  remarks made by the first speaker .  i was the only speaker not in a position to hear those remarks .  let me know what they were and i rather think i will tell you the motive for delaying me .    the first speaker said   i had stated and it was something to which speaker delarmi and others took serious exception that i had decided  on the basis of intuition and of a most inappropriate use of psychohistorical mathematics  that the entire future of the plan may rest on the exile of first foundationer golan trevize    gendibal said   what other speakers may think is up to them .  for my part  i agree with this hypothesis .  trevize is the key .  i find his sudden ejection by the first foundation too curious to be innocent .    delarmi said   would you care to say  speaker gendibal  that trevize is in the grip of this mystery organization or that the people who exiled him are .  is perhaps everyone and everything in their control except you and the first speaker and me  whom you have declared to be uncontrolled .    gendibal said   these ravings require no answer .  instead let me ask if there is any speaker here who would like to express agreement on this matter with the first speaker and myself .  you have read  i presume  the mathematical treatment that i have  with the first speaker s approval  circulated among you .    there was silence .    i repeat my request   said gendibal .   anyone .    there was silence .   gendibal said   first speaker  you now have the motive for delaying me .    the first speaker said   state it explicitly .     you have expressed the need to deal with trevize  with this first foundationer .  it represents an important initiative in policy and if the speakers had read my treatment  they would have known in a general way what was in the wind .  if  nevertheless  they had unanimously disagreed with you unanimously then  by traditional self limitation  you would have been unable to go forward .  if even one speaker backed you  then you would be able to implement this new policy .  i was the one speaker who would back yon  as anyone who had read my treatment would know  and it was necessary that i must  at all costs  be kept from the table .  that trick proved nearly successful  but i am now here and i back the first speaker .  i agree with him and he can  in accordance with tradition  disregard the disagreement of the ten other speakers .    delarmi struck the table with her fist .   the implication is that someone knew in advance what the first speaker would advise  knew in advance that speaker gendibal would support it and that all the rest would not that someone knew what he could not have known .  there is the further implication that this initiative is not to the liking of speaker gendibal s paranoia inspired organization and that they are fighting to prevent it and that  therefore  one or more of us is under the control of that organization     the implication is there   agreed gendibal .   your analysis is masterly .     whom do you accuse .   cried out delarmi .    no one .  i call upon the first speaker to take up the matter .  it is clear that there is someone in our organization who is working against us .  i suggest that everyone working for the second foundation should undergo a thorough mental analysis .  everyone  including the speakers themselves .  even including myself and the first speaker .    the meeting of the table broke up in greater confusion and greater excitement than any on record .   and when the first speaker finally spoke the phrase of adjournment  gendibal without speaking to anyone made his way back to his room .  he knew well that he had not one friend among the speakers  that even whatever support the first speaker could give him would be half hearted at best .   he could not tell whether he feared for himself or for the entire second foundation .  the taste of doom was sour in his mouth .   gendibal did not sleep well .  his waking thoughts and his sleeping dreams were alike engaged in quarreling with delora delarmi .  in one passage of one dream  there was even a confusion between her and the hamish farmer  rufirant  so that gendibal found himself facing an out of proportion delarmi advancing upon him with enormous fists and a sweet smile that revealed needlelike teeth .   he finally woke  later than usual  with no sensation of having rested and with the buzzer on his night table in muted action .  he turned over to bring his hand down upon the contact .    yes .  what is it .     speaker .   the voice was that of the floor proctor  rather less than suitably respectful .   a visitor wishes to speak to you     a visitor .   gendibal punched his appointment schedule and the screen showed nothing before noon .  he pushed the time button  it was    i a . m .  he said peevishly   who in space and time is it .     will not give a name  speaker .   then  with clear disapproval   one of these hamishers  speaker .  arrived at your invitation .   the last sentence was said with even clearer disapproval .    let him wait in the reception room till i come down .  it will take time .    gendibal did not hurry .  throughout the morning ablutions  he remained lost in thought .  that someone was using the hamish to hamper his movements made sense but he would like to know who that someone was .  and what was this new intrusion of the hamish into his very quarters .  a complicated trap of some sort .   how in the name of seldon would a hamish farmer get into the university .  what reason could he advance .  what reason could he really have .   for one fleeting moment  gendibal wondered if he ought to arm himself .  he decided against it almost at once  since he felt contemptuously certain of being able to control any single farmer on the university grounds without any danger to himself and without any unacceptable marking of a hamish mind .   gendibal decided he had been too strongly affected by the incident with karoll rufirant the day before .   was it the very farmer  by the way .  no longer under the influence  perhaps of whatever or whoever it washe might well have come to gendibal to apologize for what he had done and with apprehension of punishment .   but how would rufirant know where to go .  whom to approach .   gendibal swung down the corridor resolutely and entered the waiting room .  he stopped in astonishment  then fumed to the proctor  who was pretending to be busy in his glass walled cubicle .    proctor  you did not say the visitor was a woman .    the proctor said quietly   speaker  i said a hamisher .  you did not ask further .     minimal information  proctor .  i must remember that as one of your characteristics .    and he must check to see if the proctor was a  delarmi appointee .  and he must remember  from now on  to note the functionaries who surrounded him   lowlies  whom it was too easy to ignore from the height of his still new speakership .    are any of the conference rooms available .    the proctor said   number   is the only one available  speaker .  it will be free for three hours .   he glanced briefly at the hamishwoman  then at gendibal  with blank innocence .    we will use number    proctor  and i would advise you to mind your thoughts .   gendibal struck  not gently  and the proctor s shield closed far too slowly .  gendibal knew well it was beneath his dignity to manhandle a lesser mind  but a person who was incapable of shielding an unpleasant conjecture against a superior ought to learn not to indulge in one .  the proctor would have a mild headache for a few hours .  it was well deserved .   her name did not spring immediately to mind and gendibal was in no mood to delve deeper .  she could scarcely expect him to remember  in any case .   he said peevishly   you are     i be novi  master scowler   she said in what was almost a gasp .   my previous be sura  but i be called novi plain .     yes .  novi .  we met yesterday  i remember now .  i have not forgotten that you came to my defense .   he could not bring himself to use the hamish accent on the very university grounds .   now how did you get here .     master  you said i might write letter .  you said  it should say   speaker s house  apartment      i self bring it and i show the writing   my own writing  master .   she said it with a kind of bashful pride .   they ask   for whom be this writing .   i heared your calling when you said it to that oafish bane top  rufirant .  i say it be for stor gendibal  master scowler .     and they let you pass  novi .  didn t they ask to see the letter .     i be very frightened .  i think maybe they feel gentle sorry .  i said   scowler gendibal promise to show me place of scowlers   and they smile .  one of them at gate door say to other   and that not all he be show her .   and they show me where to go  and say not to go elseplace at all or i be thrown out moment wise .    gendibal reddened faintly .  by seldon  if he felt the need for hamish amusement  it would not be in so open a fashion and his choice would have been made more selectively .  he looked at the trantorian woman with an inward shake of his head .   she seemed quite young  younger perhaps than hard work had made her appear .  she could not be more than twenty five  at which age hamishwomen were usually already married .  she wore her dark hair in the braids that signified her to be unmarried virginal  in fact and he was not surprised .  her performance yesterday showed her to have enormous talent as a shrew and he doubted that a hamishman could easily be found who would dare be yoked to her tongue and her ready fist .  nor was her appearance much of an attraction .  though she had gone to pains to make herself look presentable  her face was angular and plain  her hands red and knobby .  what he could see of her figure seemed built for endurance rather than for grace .   her lower lip began to tremble under his scrutiny .  he could sense her embarrassment and fright quite plainly and felt pity .  she had  indeed  been of use to him yesterday and that was what counted .   he said  in an attempt to be genial and soothing   so you have come to see the uh place of scholars .    she opened her dark eyes wide  they were rather fine  and said   master  be not ired with me  but i come to be scowler own self .     you want to be a scholar .   gendibal was thunderstruck .   my good woman    he paused .  how on trantor could one explain to a completely unsophisticated farmwoman the level of intelligence  training  and mental stamina required to be what trantorians called a  scowler  .   but sura novi drove on fiercely .   i be a writer and a reader .  i have read whole books to end and from beginning  too .  and i have wish to be scowler .  i do not wish to be farmer s wife .  i be no person for farm .  i will not wed farmer or have farmer children .   she lifted her head and said proudly   i be asked .  many times .  i always say   nay .  politely  but  nay .     gendibal could see plainly enough that she was lying .  she had not been asked  but he kept his face straight .  he said   what will you do with your life if you do not marry .    novi brought her hand down on the table  palm flat .   i will be scowler .  i not be farmwoman .     what if i cannot make you a scholar .     then i be nothing and i wait to die .  i be nothing in life if i be not a scowler .    for a moment there was the impulse to search her mind and find out the extent of her motivation .  but it would be wrong to do so .  a speaker did not amuse one s self by rummaging through the helpless minds of others .  there was a code to the science and technique of mental control mentalics as to other professions .  or there should be .   he was suddenly regretful he had struck out at the proctor .    he said   why not be a farmwoman  novi .   with a little manipulation  he could make her content with that and manipulate some hamish lout into being happy to marry her and she to marry him .  it would do no harm .  it would be a kindness .   but it was against the law and thus unthinkable .   she said   i not be .  a farmer is a clod .  he works with earthlumps  and he becomes earth lump .  if i be farmwoman  i be earthlump  too .  i will be timeless to read and write  and i will forget .  my head   she put her hand to her temple   will grow sour and stale .  no .  a scowler be different .  thoughtful .    she meant by the word  gendibal noted   intelligent  rather than  considerate .      a scowler   she said   live with books and with with i forget what they be name said .   she made a gesture as though she were making some sort of vague manipulations that would have meant nothing to gendibal if he did not have her mind radiations to guide him .    microfilms   he said .   how do you know about microfilms .     in books  i read of many things   she said proudly .   gendibal could no longer fight off the desire to know more .  this was an unusual hamisher  he had never heard of one like this .  the hamish were never recruited  but if novi were younger  say ten years old  what a waste .  he would not disturb her  he would not disturb her in the least  but of what use was it to be a speaker if one could not observe unusual minds and learn from them .   he said   novi  i want you to sit there for a moment .  be very quiet .  do not say anything .  do not think of saying anything .  just think of falling asleep  do you understand .    her fright returned at once   why must   do this  master .     because i wish to think how you might become a scholar .    after all  no matter what she had read  there was no possible way in which she could know what being a  scholar  truly meant .  it was therefore necessary to find out what she thought a scholar was .   very carefully and with infinite delicacy he probed her mind  sensing without actually touching like placing one s hand on a polished metal surface without leaving fingerprints .  to her a scholar was someone who always read books .  she had not the slightest idea of why one read books .  for herself to be a scholar the picture in her mind was that of doing the labor she knew fetching  carrying  cooking  cleaning  following orders   but on the university grounds where books were available and where she would have time to read them and  very vaguely   to become learned .   what it amounted to was that she wanted to be a servant his servant .   gendibal frowned .  a hamishwoman servant and one who was plain  graceless  uneducated  barely literate .  unthinkable .   he would simply have to divert her .  there would have to be some way of adjusting her desires to make her content to be a farmwoman  some way that would leave no mark  some way about which even delarmi could not complain .    or had she been sent by delarmi .  was all this a complicated plan to lure him into tampering with a hamish mind  so that he might be caught and impeached .   ridiculous .  he was in danger of growing paranoid .  somewhere in the simple tendrils of her uncomplicated mind  a trickle of mental current needed to be diverted .  it would only take a tiny push .   it was against the letter of the law  but it would do no harm and no one would ever notice .   he paused .   back .  back .  back .   space .  he had almost missed it .   was he the victim of an illusion .   no .  now that his attention was drawn .  to it  he could make it out clearly .  there was the tiniest tendril disarrayed an abnormal disarray .  yet it was so delicate  so ramification free .   gendibal emerged from  . her mind .  he said gently   novi .    her eyes focused .  she said   yes  master .    gendibal said   you may work with me .  i will make you a scholar    joyfully  eyes blazing  she said   master    he detected it at once .  she was going to throw herself at his feet .  he put his hands on her shoulders and held her tightly .   don t move  novi .  stay where you are .   stay .    he might have been talking to a half trained animal .  when he could see the order had penetrated  he let her go .  he was conscious of the hard muscles along her upper arms .   he said   if you are to be a scholar  you must behave like one .  that means you will have to be always quiet  always soft spoken  always doing what i tell you to do .  and you must try to learn to talk as i do .  you will also have to meet other scholars .  will you be afraid .     i be not afeared   afraid  master  if you be with me     i wilt be with you .  but now  first  i must find you a room  arrange to have you assigned a lavatory  a place in the dining room  and clothes  too .  you will have to wear clothes more suitable to a scholar  novi .     these be all i   she began miserably .      we will supply others .    clearly he would have to get a woman to arrange for a new supply of clothing for novi .  he would also need someone to teach the hamisher the rudiments of personal hygiene .  after ail  though the clothes she wore were probably her best and though she had obviously spruced herself up  she still had a distinct odor that was faintly unpleasant .   and he would have to make sure that the relationship between them was understood .  it was always an open secret that the men  and women  too  of the second foundation made occasional forays among the hamish for their pleasure .  if there was no interference with hamish minds in the process  no one dreamed of making a fuss about it .  gendibal himself had never indulged in this  and he liked to think it was because he felt no need for sex that might be coarser and more highly spiced than was available at the university .  the women of the second foundation might be pallid in comparison to the hamish  but they were clean and their skins were smooth .   but even if the matter were misunderstood and there were sniggers at a speaker who net only turned to the hamish but brought one into his quarters  he would have to endure the embarrassment .  as it stood  this farmwoman  sura novi  was his key to victory in the inevitable forthcoming duel with speaker delarmi and the rest of the table .   gendibal did not see novi again till after dinnertime  at which time she was brought to him by the woman to whom he had endlessly explained the situation at least  the nonsexual character of the situation .  she had understood or  at least  did not dare show any indication of failure to understand  which was perhaps just as good .   novi stood before him now  bashful  proud  embarrassed  triumphant   all at once  in an incongruous mixture .   he said   you look very nice  novi .    the clothes they had given her fit surprisingly well and there was no question that she did not look at all ludicrous .  had they pinched in her waist .  lifted her breasts .  or had that just been not particularly noticeable in her farmwoman clothing .   her buttocks were prominent  but not displeasingly so .  her face  of course  remained plain  but when the tan of outdoor life faded and she learned how to care for her complexion  it would not look downright ugly .   by the old empire  that woman did think novi was to be his mistress .  she had tried to make her beautiful for him .   and then he thought  well  why not .   novi would have to face the speaker s table and the more attractive she seemed  the more easily he would be able to get his point across .   it was with this thought that the message from the first speaker reached him .  it had the kind of appropriateness that was common in a mentalic society .  it was called  more or less informally  the  coincidence effect .   if you think vaguely of someone when someone is thinking vaguely of you  there is a mutual  escalating stimulation which in a matter of seconds makes the two thoughts sharp  decisive  and  to all appearances  simultaneous .   it can be startling even to those who understand it intellectually  particularly if the preliminary vague thoughts were so dim on one side or the other  or both  as to have gone consciously unnoticed .    i can t be with you this evening  novi   said gendibal .   i have scholar work to do .  i will take you to your room .  there will be some books there and you can practice your reading .  i will show you how to use the signal if you need help with anything and i will see you tomorrow .    gendibal said politely   first speaker .    shandess merely nodded .  he looked dour and fully his age .  he looked as though he were a man who did not drink  but who could use a stiff one .  he said finally   i  called  you     no messenger .  i presumed from the direct  call  that it was important .     it is .  your quarry the first foundationer trevize     yes .     he is not coming to trantor .    gendibal did not look surprised .   why should he .  the information we received was that he was leaving with a professor of ancient history who was seeking earth .     yes  the legendary primal planet .  and that is why he should be coming to trantor .  after all  does the professor know where earth is .  do you .  do i .  can we be sure it exists at all  or ever existed .  surely they would have to come to this library to obtain the necessary information if it were to be obtained anywhere .  i have until this hour felt that the situation was not at crisis level that the first foundationer would come here and that we would  through him  learn what we need to know .     which would certainly be the reason he is not allowed to come here .     but where is he going  then .     we have not yet found out  i see .    the first speaker said pettishly   you seem calm about it .    gendibal said   i wonder if it is not better so .  you want him to come to trantor to keep him safe and use him as a source of information .  will he not  however  prove a source of more important information  involving others still more important than himself  if he goes where he wants to go and does what he wants to do provided we do not lose sight of him .     not enough .   said the first speaker .    you have persuaded me of the existence of this new enemy of ours and now i cannot rest .   worse  i have persuaded myself that we must secure trevize or we have lost everything .  i cannot rid myself of the feeling that he and nothing else is the key .    gendibal said intensely   whatever happens  we will not lose  first speaker .  that would only have been possible  if these anti mules  to use your phrase again  had continued to burrow beneath us unnoticed .  but we know they are there now .  we no longer work blind .  at the next meeting of the table  if we can work together  we shall begin the counterattack .    the first speaker said   it was not the matter of trevize that had me send out the call to you .  the subject came up first only because it seemed to me a personal defeat .  i had misanalyzed that aspect of the situation .  i was wrong to place personal pique above general policy and i apologize .  there is something else .     more serious  first speaker .     more serious  speaker gendibal .   the first speaker sighed and drummed his fingers on the desk while gendibal stood patiently before it and waited .   the first speaker finally said  in a mild way  as though that would ease the blow   at an emergency meeting of the table  initiated by speaker delarmi     without your consent  first speaker .     for what she wanted  she needed the consent of only three other speakers  not including myself .  at the emergency meeting that was then called  you were impeached  speaker gendibal .  you have been accused as being unworthy of the post of speaker and you must be tried .  this is the first time in over three centuries that a bill of impeachment has been carried out against a speaker    gendibal said  fighting to keep down any sign of anger   surely you did not vote for my impeachment yourself .     i did not  but i was alone .  the rest of the table was unanimous and the vote was ten to one for impeachment .  the requirement for impeachment  as you know  is eight votes including the first speaker or ten without him .     but t was not present .     you would not have been able to vote .     i might have spoken in my defense .     not at that stage .  the precedents are few  but clear .  your defense will be at the trial  which will come as soon as possible  naturally .    gendibal bowed his head in thought .  then he said   this does not concern me overmuch  first speaker .  your initial instinct  i think  was right .  the matter of trevize takes precedence .  may i suggest you delay the trial on that ground .    the first speaker held up his hand .   i don t blame you for not understanding the situation  speaker .  impeachment is so rare an event that i myself have been forced to look up the legal procedures involved .  nothing takes precedence .  we are forced to move directly to the trial  postponing everything else .    gendibal placed his fists on the desk and leaned toward the first speaker .   you are not serious .     it is the law .     the law can t be allowed to stand in the way of a clear and present danger .     to the table  speaker gendibal  you are the clear and present danger .   no  listen to me .  the law that is involved is based on the conviction that nothing can be more important than the possibility of corruption or the misuse of power on the part of a speaker .     but i am guilty of neither  first speaker  and you knew it .  this is a matter of a personal vendetta on the part of speaker delarmi .  if there is misuse of power  it is on her part .  my crime is that i have never labored to make myself popular i admit that much and i have paid too little attention to fools who are old enough to be senile but young enough to have power .     like myself  speaker .    gendibal sighed .   you see  i ve done it again .  i don t refer to you  first speaker .   very well  then  let us have an instant trial  then .  let us have it tomorrow .  better yet  tonight .  let us get it over with and then pass on to the matter of trevize .  we dare not wait .    the first speaker said   speaker gendibal .  i don t think you understand the situation .  we have had impeachments before not many  just two .  neither of those resulted in a conviction .  you  however  will be convicted .  you will then no longer be a member of the table and you will no longer have a say in public policy .  you will not  in fact  even have a vote at the annual meeting of the assembly .     and you will not act to prevent that .    i cannot .  i will be voted down unanimously .  i will then lie forced to resign  which i think is what the speakers would like to see .    and delarmi will become first speaker .     that is certainly a strong possibility .     but that must not be allowed to happen .     exactly .  which is why i will have to vote for your conviction .    gendibal drew a deep breath .   i still demand an instant trial .     you must have time to prepare your defense .     what defense .  they will listen to no defense .  instant trial .     the table must have time to prepare their case .     they have no case and will want none .  they have me convicted in their minds and will require nothing more .  in fact  they would rather convict me tomorrow than the day after and tonight rather than tomorrow .  put it to them .    the first speaker rose to his feet .  they faced each other across the desk .  the first speaker said   why are you in such a hurry .     the matter of trevize will not wait .     once you are convicted and i am rendered feeble in the face of a table united against me  what will have been accomplished .    gendibal said in an intense whisper   have no fears .  despite everything  i will not be convicted .      chapter nine  hyperspace    trevize said   are you ready  janov .    pelorat looked up from the book he was viewing and said   you mean  for the jump  old fellow .     for the hyperspatial jump .  yes .    pelorat swallowed .   now  you re sure that it will be in no way uncomfortable .  i know it is a silly thing to fear  but the thought of having myself reduced to incorporeal tachyons  which no one has ever seen or detected     come  janov  it s a perfected thing .  upon my honor .  the jump has been in use for twenty two thousand years  as you explained  and i ve never beard of a single fatality in hyperspace .  we might come out of hyperspace in an uncomfortable place  but then the accident would happen in space not while we are composed of tachyons .     small consolation  it seems to me .     we won t come out in error  either .  to tell you the truth  i was thinking of carrying it through without telling you  so that you would never know it had happened .  on the whole  though  i felt it would be better if you experienced it consciously  saw that it was no problem of any kind  and could forget it totally henceforward .     well   said pelorat dubiously .   i suppose you re right  but   honestly i m in no hurry .     i assure you     no no  old fellow  i accept your assurances unequivocally .  it s just that   did you ever read sanertestil matt .     of course .  i m not illiterate .     certainly .  certainly .  i should not have asked .  do you remember it .     neither am i an amnesiac .     i seem to have a talent for offending .  all i mean is that i keep thinking of the scenes where santerestil and his friend  ban  have gotten away from planet    and are lost in space .  i think of those perfectly hypnotic scenes among the stars  lazily moving along in deep silence  in changelessness  in  never believed it  you know .  i loved it and i was moved by it  but i never really believed it .  but now after i got used to just the notion of being in space  i m experiencing it and it s silly  i know but i don t want to give it up .  it s as though i m santerestil     and i m ban   said trevize with just an edge of impatience .    in a way .  the small scattering of dim stars out there are motionless  except our sun  of course  which must be shrinking but which we don t see .  the galaxy retains its dim majesty  unchanging .  space is silent and i have no distractions     except me .     except you .   but then  golan  dear chap  talking to you about earth and trying to teach you a bit of prehistory has its pleasures  too .  i don t want that to come to an end  either .     it won t .  not immediately  at any rate .  you don t suppose we ll take the jump and come through on the surface of a planet  do you .  we ll still be in space and the jump will have taken no measurable time at ail .  it may well be a week before we make surface of any kind  so do relax .     by surface  you surely don t mean gaia .  we may be nowhere near gaia when we come out of the jump .     i know that  janov  but we ll be in the right sector  if your information is correct .  if it isn t well    pelorat shook his head glumly .   how will being in the right sector help if we don t know gaia s co ordinates .    trevize said   janov  suppose you were on terminus  heading for the town of argyropol  and you didn t know where that town was except that it was somewhere on the isthmus .  once you were on the isthmus  what would you do .    pelorat waited cautiously  as though feeling there must be a terribly sophisticated answer expected of him .  finally giving up  he said   i suppose i d ask somebody .     exactly .  what else is there to do .   now  are you ready .     you mean  now .   pelorat scrambled to his feet  his pleasantly unemotional face coming as near as it might to a look of concern .   what am i supposed to do .  sit .  stand .  what .     time and space  pelorat  you don t do anything .  just come with me to my room so i can use the computer  then sit or stand or turn cartwheels whatever will make you most comfortable .  my suggestion is that you sit before the viewscreen and watch it .  it s sure to be interesting .  come .    they stepped along the short corridor to trevize s room and he seated himself at the computer .   would you like to do this  janov .   he asked suddenly .   i ll give you the figures and all you do is think them .  the computer will do the rest .    pelorat said   no thank you .  the computer doesn t work well with me  somehow .  i know you say i just need practice  but i don t believe that .  there s something about your mind  golan     don t be foolish .     no no .  that computer just seems to fit you .  you and it seem to be a single organism when you re hooked up .  when i m hooked up  there are two objects involved janov pelorat and a computer .  it s just not the same .     ridiculous   said trevize  but he was vaguely pleased at the thought and stroked the hand rests of the computer with loving fingertips .    so i d rather watch   said pelorat .   i mean  i d rather it didn t happen at all  but as long as it will  i d rather watch .   he fixed  .  his eyes anxiously on the viewscreen and on the foggy galaxy with the thin powdering of dim stars in the foreground .   let me know when it s about to happen .   slowly he backed against the wall and braced himself .   trevize smiled .  he placed his hands on the rests and felt the mental union .  it came more easily day by day  and more intimately  too  and however he might scoff at what pelorat said he actually felt it .  it seemed to him he scarcely needed to think of the co ordinates in any conscious way .  it almost seemed the computer knew what he wanted  without the conscious process of  telling .   it lifted the information out of his brain for itself .   but trevize  told  it and then asked for a two minute interval before the jump .    all right  janov .  we have two minutes                  just watch the viewscreen .    pelorat did  with a slight tightness about the corners of his mouth and with a holding of his breath .   trevize said softly                         z       o    with no perceptible motion  no perceptible sensation  the view on the screen changed .  there was a distinct thickening of the starfield and the galaxy vanished .   pelorat started and said   was that it .     was what it .  you flinched .  but that was your fault .  you felt nothing .  admit it .     i admit it .     then that s it .  way back when hyperspatial travel was relatively new   according to the books  anyway there would be a queer internal sensation and some people felt dizziness or nausea .  it was perhaps psychogenic  perhaps not .  in any case  with more and more experience with hyperspatiality and with better equipment  that decreased .  with a computer like the one on board this vessel  any effect is well below the threshold of sensation .  at least  i find it so .     and i do  too  i must admit .  where are we  golan .     just a step forward .  in the kalganian region .  there s a long way to go yet and before we make another move  we ll have to check the accuracy of the jump .     what bothers me is where s the galaxy .     all around us  janov .  we re weal inside it  now .  if we focus the viewscreen properly  we can see the more distant parts of it as a luminous band across the sky .     the milky way .   pelorat cried out joyfully .   almost every world describes it in their sky  but it s something we don t see on terminus .  show it to me  old fellow .    the viewscreen tilted  giving the effect of a swimming of the starfield across it  and then there was a thick  pearly luminosity nearly filling the field .  the screen followed it around  as it thinned  then swelled again .   trevize said   it s thicker in the direction of the center of the galaxy .  not as thick or as bright as it might be  however  because of the dark clouds in the spiral arms .  you see something like this from most inhabited worlds .     and from earth  too .     that s no distinction .  that would not be an identifying characteristic .     of course not .  but you know  you haven t studied the history of science  have you .     not really  though i ve picked up some of it  naturally .  still  if you have questions to ask  don t expect me to be an expert .     it s just that making this jump has put me in mind of something that has always puzzled me .  it s possible to work out a description of the universe in which hyperspatial travel is impossible and in which the speed of light traveling through a vacuum is the absolute maximum where speed is concerned .     certainly .     under those conditions  the geometry of the universe is such that it is impossible to make the trip we have just undertaken in less time than a ray of light would make it .  and if we did it at the speed of light  our experience of duration would not match that of the universe generally .  if this spot is  say  forty parsecs from terminus  then if we had gotten here at the speed of light  we would have felt no time lapse but on terminus and in the entire galaxy  about a hundred and thirty years would have passed .  now we have made a trip  not at the speed of light but at thousands of times the speed of light actually  and there has been no time advance anywhere .  at least  i hope not .    trevize said   don t expect me to give you the mathematics of the olanjen hyperspatial theory to you .  all i can say is that if you had traveled at the speed of light within normal space  time would indeed have advanced at the rate of   .    years per parsec  as you described .  the so called relativistic universe  which humanity has understood as far back as we can probe inter prehistory though that s your department  i think remains  and its laws have not been repealed .  in our hyperspatial jumps  however  we do something out side the conditions under which relativity operates and the rules are different .  hyperspatially the galaxy is a tiny object ideally a nondimensional dot and there are no relativistic effects at all .    in fact  in the mathematical formulations of cosmology  there are two symbols for the galaxy  gr for the  relativistic galaxy   where the speed of light is a maximum  and gh for the  hyperspatial galaxy   where speed does not really have a meaning .  hyperspatially the value of all speed is zero and we do not move with reference to space itself  speed is infinite .  i can t explain things a bit more than that .    oh  except that one of the beautiful catches in theoretical physics is to place a symbol or a value that has meaning in gr into an equation dealing with g   or vice versa and leave it there for a student to deal with .  the chances are enormous that the student falls into the trap and generally remains there  sweating and panting  with nothing seeming to work  till some kindly elder helps him out .  i was neatly caught that way  once .    pelorat considered that gravely for a while  then said in a perplexed sort of way   but which is the true galaxy .     either  depending on what you re doing .  if you re back on terminus  you can use a car to cover distance on land and a ship to cover distance across the sea .  conditions are different in every way  so which is the true terminus  the land or the sea .    pelorat nodded .   analogies are always risky   he said   but i d rather accept that one than risk my sanity by thinking about hyperspace any further .  i ll concentrate on what we re doing now .     look upon what we just did   said trevize   as our first stop toward earth .    and  he thought to himself  toward what else  i wonder .    well   said trevize .   i ve wasted a day .     oh .   pelorat looked up from his careful indexing .   in what way .    trevize spread his arms .   i didn t trust the computer .  i didn t dare to  so i checked our present position with the position we had aimed at in the jump .  the difference was not measurable .  there was no detectable error .     that s good  isn t it .     it s more than good .  it s unbelievable .  i ve never heard of such a thing .  i ve gone through jumps and i ve directed them  in all kinds of ways and with all kinds of devices .  in school  i had to work one out with a hand computer and then i sent off a hyper relay to check results .  naturally i couldn t send a real ship  since aside from the expense i could easily have placed it in the middle of a star at the other end .    i never did anything that bad  of course   trevize went on   but there would always be a sizable error .  there s always some error  even with experts .  there s got to be  since there are so many variables .  put it this way the geometry of space is too complicated to handle and hyperspace compounds all those complications with a complexity of its own that we can t even pretend to understand .  that s why we have to go by steps  instead of making one big jump from here to sayshell .  the errors would grow worse with distance .    pelorat said   but you said this computer didn t make an error .     it said it didn t make an error .  i directed it to check our actual position with our precalculated position  what is  against  what was asked for .   it said that the two were identical within its limits of measurement and i thought  what if it s lying .    until that moment  pelorat had held his printer in his hand .  he now put it down and looked shaken .   are you joking .  a computer can t lie .  unless you mean you thought it might be out of order .     no  that s not what i thought .  space .  i thought it was lying .  this computer is so advanced i can t think of it as anything but human   superhuman  maybe .  human enough to have pride and to lie  perhaps .  i gave it directions to work out a course through hyperspace to a position near sayshell planet  the capital of the sayshell union .  it did  and charted a course in twenty nine steps  which is arrogance of the worst sort .     why arrogance .     the error in the first jump makes the second jump that much less certain  and the added error then makes the third jump pretty wobbly and untrustworthy  and so on .  how do you calculate twenty nine steps all at once .  the twenty ninth could end up anywhere in the galaxy  anywhere at all .  so i directed it to make the first step only .  then we could check that before proceeding .     the cautious approach   said pelorat warmly .   i approve .     yes  but having made the first step  might the computer not feel wounded at my having mistrusted it .  would it then be forced to salve its pride by telling me there was no error at all when i asked it .  would it find it impossible to admit a mistake  to own up to imperfection .  if that were so  we might as well not have a computer .    pelorat s long and gentle face saddened .   what can we do in that case  golan .     we can do what i did waste a day .  i checked the position of several of the surrounding stars by the most primitive possible methods  telescopic observation  photography  and manual measurement .  i compared each actual position with the position expected if there had been no error .  the work of it took me all day and wore me down to nothing .     yes  but what happened .     i found two whopping errors and checked them over and found them in my calculations .  i had made the mistakes myself .  i corrected the calculations  then ran them through the computer from scratch just to see if it would come up with the same answers independently .  except that it worked them out to several more decimal places  it turned out that my figures were right and they showed that the computer had made no errors .  the computer may be an arrogant son of the mule  but it s got something to be arrogant about .    pelorat exhaled a long breath .   well  that s good .     yes indeed .  so i m going to let it take the other twenty eight steps .     all at once .  but     not all at once .  don t worry .  i haven t become a daredevil just yet .  it will do them one after the other but after each step it will check the surroundings and  if that is where it is supposed to be within tolerable limits  it can take the next one .  any time it finds the error too great and  believe me  i didn t set the limits generously at all it will have to stop and recalculate the remaining steps .         when are you going to do this .     when .  right now .   look  you re working on indexing your library     oh  but this is the chance to do it  golan .  i ve been meaning to do it for years  but something always seemed to get in the way .     i have no objections .  you go on and do it and don t worry .  concentrate on the indexing .  i ll take care of everything else .    pelorat shook his head .   don t be foolish .  i can t relax till this is over .  i m scared stiff .     i shouldn t have told you  then but i had to tell someone and you re the only one here .  let me explain frankly .  there s always the chance that we ll come to rest in a perfect position in interstellar space and that that will happen to be the precise position which a speeding meteoroid is occupying  or a mini black hole  and the ship is wrecked  and  we re dead .  such things could in theory   happen .    the chances are very small  however .  after all  you could be at home  janov   in your study and working on your films or in your bed sleeping and a meteroid could be streaking toward you through terminus s atmosphere and hit you right in the head and you d be dead .  but the chances are small .    in fact  the chance of intersecting the path of something fatal  but too small for the computer to know about  in the course of a hyperspatial jump is far  far smaller than that of berg hit by a meteor in your home .  i ve never heard of a ship being lost that way in all the history of hyperspatial travel .  any other type of risk like ending in the middle of a star is even smaller .    pelorat said   then why do you tell me all this  golan .    trevize paused  then bent his head in thought  and finally said   i don t know .   yes  i do .  what i suppose it is  is that however small the chance of catastrophe might be  i    enough people take enough chances  the catastrophe must happen eventually .  no matter how sure i am that nothing will go wrong  there s a small nagging voice inside me that says   maybe it will happen this time .   and it makes me feel guilty .   i guess that s it .  janov  if something goes wrong  forgive me .     but golan  my dear chap  if something goes wrong  we will both be dead instantly .  i will not be able to forgive  nor you to receive forgiveness .     i understand that  so forgive me now  will you .    pelorat smiled .   i don t know why  but this cheers me up .  there s something pleasantly humorous about it .  of course  golan  i ll forgive you .  there are plenty of myths about some form of afterlife in world literature and if there should happen to be such a place   about the same chance as landing on a mini black hole  i suppose  or less and we both turn up in the same one  then i will bear witness that you did your honest best and that my death should not be laid at your door .     thank you .  now i m relieved .  i m willing to take my chance  but i did not enjoy the thought of you taking my chance as well .    pelorat wrung the other s hand .   you know  golan  i ve only known you less than a week and i suppose i shouldn t make hasty judgments in these matters  but i think you re an excellent chap .   and now let s do it and get it over with .     absolutely .  all i have to do is touch that little contact .  the computer has its instructions and it s just waiting for me to say   starts  would you like to     never .  it s all yours .  it s your computer .     very well .  and it s my responsibility .  i m still trying to duck it  you see .  keep your eye on the screen .    with a remarkably steady hand and with his smile looking utterly genuine  trevize made contact .   there was a momentary pause and then the starfield changed and again and again .  the stars spread steadily thicker and brighter over the viewscreen .   pelorat was counting under his breath .  at      there was a halt  as though some piece of apparatus had jammed .   pelorat whispered  clearly afraid that any noise might jar the mechanism fatally .   what s wrong .  what s happened .    trevize shrugged .   i imagine it s recalculating .  some object in space is adding a perceptible bump to the general shape of the overall gravitational field some object not taken into account some uncharted dwarf star or rogue planet     dangerous .     since we re still alive  it s almost certainly not dangerous .  a planet could be a hundred million kilometers away and still introduce a large enough gravitational modification to require recalculation .  a dwarf star could be ten billion kilometers away and    the screen shifted again and trevize fell silent .  it shifted again and again  finally  when pelorat said   a    there was no further motion .   trevize consulted the computer .   we re here   he said .    i counted the first jump as  r .   and in this series i started with  z  that s twenty eight jumps altogether .  you said twenty nine .     the recalculation at jump i  probably saved us one jump .  i can check with the computer if you wish  but there s really no need .  we re in the vicinity of sayshell planet .  the computer says so and i don t doubt it .  if i were to orient the screen properly  we d see a nice  bright sun  but there s no point in placing a needless strain on its screening capacity .  saysheil planet is the fourth one out and it s about   .   million kilometers away from our present position  which is about as close as we want to be at a jump conclusion .  we can get there in three days two  if we hurry .    trevize drew a deep breath and tried to let the tension drain .    do you realize what this means  janov .   he said .   every ship i ve ever been in or heard of would have made those jumps with at least a day in between for painstaking calculation and re checking  even with a computer .  the trip would have taken nearly a month .    or perhaps two or three weeks  if they were willing to be reckless about it .  we did it in half an hour .  when every ship is equipped with a computer like this one    pelorat said   i wonder why the mayor  let us have a ship this advanced .  it must be incredibly expensive .     it s experimental   said trevize dryly .   maybe fine good woman was perfectly willing to have us try it out and see what deficiencies might develop .     are you serious .     don t get nervous .  after all  there s nothing to worry about .  we haven t found any deficiencies .  i wouldn t put it past her  though .  such a thing would put no great strain on her sense of humanity .  besides  she hasn t trusted us with offensive weapons and that cuts the expense considerably .    pelorat said thoughtfully   it s the computer i m thinking about .  it seems to be adjusted so well for you and it can t be adjusted that well for everyone .  it just barely works with me .     so much the better for us  that it works so well with one of us .     yes  but is that merely chance .     what else  janov .     surely the mayor knows you pretty well .     i think she does  the old battlecraft .     might she not have had a computer designed particularly for you .     i just wonder if we re not going where the computer wants to take us .    trevize stared .   you mean that while i m connected to the computer  it is the computer and not me who is in real charge .     i just wonder .     that is ridiculous .  paranoid .  come on  janov .    trevize turned back to the computer to focus sayshell planet on the screen and to plot a normal space course to it .   ridiculous .   but why had pelorat put the notion into his head .     chapter ten  table    two days had passed and gendibal found himself not so much heavyhearted as enraged .  there was no reason why there could not have been an immediate hearing .  had he been unprepared had he needed time they would have forced an immediate hearing on him  he was sure .   but since there was nothing more facing the second foundation than the greatest crisis since the mule  they wasted time and to no purpose but to irritate him .   they did irritate him and  by seldon  that would make his counterstroke the heavier .  he was determined on that .   he looked about him .  the anteroom was empty .  it had been like that for two days now .  he was a marked man  a speaker whom all knew would by means of an action unprecedented in the five century history of the second foundation soon lose his position .  he would be demoted to the ranks  demoted to the position of a second foundationer  plain and simple .   it was one thing  however and a very honored thing to be a second foundationer of the ranks  particularly if one held a respectable title  as gendibal might even after the impeachment .  it would be quite another thing to have once been a speaker and to have been demoted .   it won t happen though  thought gendibal savagely  even though for two days he had been avoided .  only sura novi treated him as before  but she was too nave to understand the situation .  to her  gendibal was still  master .    it irritated gendibal that he found a certain comfort in this .  he felt ashamed when he began to notice that his spirits rose when he noticed her gazing at him worshipfully .  was he becoming grateful for gifts that small .   a clerk emerged from the chamber to tell him that the table was ready for him and gendibal stalked in .  the clerk was one gendibai knew well  he was one who knew to the tiniest fraction the precise gradation of civility that each speaker deserved .  at the moment  that accorded gendibal was appallingly low .  even the clerk thought him as good as convicted .   they were all sitting about the table gravely  wearing the black robes of judgment .  first speaker shandess looked a bit uncomfortable  but he did not allow his face to crease into the smallest touch of friendliness .  delarmi   one of the three speakers who were women did not even look at him .   the first speaker said   speaker stor gendibal  you have been impeached for behaving in a manner unbecoming a speaker .  you have  before us all  accused the table vaguely and without evidence of treason and attempted murder .  you have implied that all second foundationers including the speakers and the first speaker require a thorough mental analysis to ascertain who among them are no longer to be trusted .  such behavior breaks the bonds of community  without which the second foundation cannot control an intricate and potentially hostile galaxy and without which they cannot build  with surety  a viable second empire .    since we have all witnessed those offenses  we will forego the presentation of a formal case for the prosecution .  we will therefore move directly to the next stage .  speaker stor gendibal  do you have a defense .    now delarmi still not looking at him allowed herself a small catlike smile .   gendibal said   if truth be considered a defense  i have one .  there are grounds for suspecting a breach of security .  that breach may involve the mental control o    one or more second foundationers not excluding members here present and this has created a deadly crisis for the second foundation .  if  indeed  you hasten this trial because you cannot waste time  you may all perhaps dimly recognize the seriousness of the crisis  but in that case  why have you wasted two days after i had formally requested an immediate trial .  i submit that it is this deadly crisis that has forced me to say what i have said .  i would have behaved in a manner unbecoming a speaker  had i not done so .     he but repeats the offense  first speaker   said delarmi softly .   gendibal s seat was further removed from the table than that of the others a clear demotion already .  he pushed it farther back  a  though he cared nothing for that  and rose .   he said   will you convict me now  out of hand  in defiance of law or may i present my defense in detail .    the first speaker said   this is not a lawless assemblage  speaker .  without much in fine way of precedent to guide us  we will lean in your direction  recognizing that if our too human abilities should cause us to deviate from absolute justice  it is better to allow the guilty to go free than to convict the innocent .  therefore  although the case before us is so grave that we may not lightly allow the guilty to go free  we will permit you to present your case in such manner as you wish and for as long as you require  until it is decided by unanimous vote  including my own   and he raised his voice at that phrase   that enough has been heard .    gendibal said   let me begin  then  by saying that golan trevize  the first foundationer who has been driven from terminus and whom the first speaker and i believe to be the knife edge of the gathering crisis has moved off in an unexpected direction .     point of information   said delarmi softly .   how does the speaker   the intonation clearly indicated that the word was not capitalized   know this .     i was informed of this by the first speaker   said gendibal   but i confirm it of my own knowledge .  under the circumstances  however  considering my suspicions concerning the level of the security of the chamber  i must be allowed to keep my sources of information secret .    the first speaker said   i will suspend judgment on that .  let us proceed without that item of information but if  in the judgment of the table  the information must be obtained  speaker gendibal will have to yield it .    delarmi said   if the speaker does not yield the information now  it is only fair to say that i assume he has an agent serving him an agent who is privately employed by him and who is not responsible to the table generally .  we cannot be sure that such an agent is obeying the rules o    behavior governing second foundation personnel .   the first speaker said with some displeasure   i see all the implications  speaker delarmi .  there is no need to spell them out for me .     i merely mention it for the record  first speaker  since this aggravates the offense and it is not an item mentioned in the bill of impeachment  which  i would like to say  has not been read in full and to which i move this item be added .     the clerk is directed to add the item   said the first speaker   and the precise wording will be adjusted at the appropriate time .   speaker gendibal   he  at least  capitalized   your defense is indeed a step backward .  continue .    gendibal said   not only has this trevize moved in an unexpected direction  but at an unprecedented speed .  my information  which the first speaker does not yet have  is that he has traveled nearly ten thousand parsecs in well under an hour .     in a single jump .   said one of the speakers incredulously .    in over two dozen jumps  one after the other  with virtually no time intervening   said gendibal   something that is even more difficult to imagine than a single jump .  even if he is now located  it will take time to follow him and  if he detects us and really means to flee us  we will not be able to overtake him .   and you spend your time in games of impeachment and allow two days to pass so that you might savor them the more .    the first speaker managed to mask his anguish .   please tell us  speaker gendibal  what you think the significance of this might be .     it is an indication  first speaker  of the technological advances that are being made by the first foundation  who are far more powerful now than they were in the time of preem palver .  we could not stand up against them if they found us and were free to act .    speaker delarmi rose to her feet .  she said   first speaker  our time is being wasted with irrelevancies .  we are not children to be frightened with tales by grandmother spacewarp .  it does not matter how impressive the machinery of the first foundation is when  in any crisis  their minds will be in our control .     what do you have to say to that  speaker gendibal .   asked the first speaker .     merely that we will come to the matter of minds in due course .  for the moment  i merely wish to stress the superior and increasing technological might of the first foundation .    the first speaker said   pass on to the next point  speaker gendibal .  your first point  i must tell you  does not impress me as very pertinent to the matter contained in the bill of impeachment .    there was a clear gesture of agreement from the table generally .   gendibal said   i pass on .  trevize has a companion in his present journey   he paused momentarily to consider pronunciation   one janov pelorat  a rather ineffectual scholar who has devoted his life to tracking down myths and legends concerning earth .     you know all this about him .  your hidden source  i presume .   said delarmi  who had settled into her role of prosecutor with a clear feeling of comfort .    yes  i know all this about him   said gendibal stolidly .   a few months ago  the mayor of terminus  an energetic and capable woman  grew interested in this scholar for no clear reason  and so i grew interested  too  as a matter of course .  nor have i kept this to myself .  all the information i have gained has been made available to the first speaker .     i bear witness to that   said the first speaker in a low voice .   an elderly speaker said   what is this earth .  is it the world of origin we keep coming across in fables .  the one they made a fuss about in old imperial times .    gendibal nodded .   in the tales of grandmother spacewarp  as speaker delarmi would say .   i suspect it was pelorat s dream to come to trantor to consult the galactic library  in order to find information concerning earth that he could not obtain in the interstellar library service available on terminus .    when he left terminus with trevize  he must have been under the impression that that dream was to be fulfilled .  certainly we were expecting the two and counted on having the opportunity to examine them to our own profit .  as it turns out and as you all know by now they are not coming .  they have turned off to some destination that is not yet clear and for some reason that is not yet known .    delarmi s round face looked positively cherubic as she said   and why is this disturbing .  we are no worse off for their absence  surely .  indeed  since they dismiss us so easily  we can deduce that the first foundation does not know the true nature of trantor and we can applaud the handiwork of preem palver .    gendibal said   if we thought no further  we might indeed come to such a comforting solution .  could if be  though  that the turnoff was not the result of any failure to see the importance of trantor .  could it be that the turnoff resulted from anxiety lest trantor  by examining these two men  see the importance of earth .    there was a stir about the table .    anyone   said delarmi coldly   can invent formidable sounding propositions and couch them in balanced sentences .  but do they make sense when you do invent them .  why should anyone care what we of the second foundation think of earth .  whether it is the true planet of origin  or whether it is a myth  or whether there is no one place of origin to begin with  is surely something that should interest only historians  anthropologists  and folk tale collectors  such as this pelorat of yours .  why us .     why indeed .   said gendibal .   how is it  then  that there are no references to earth in the library .    for the first time  something in the atmosphere that was other than hostility made itself felt about the table .   delarmi said   aren t there .    gendibal said quite calmly   when word first reached me that trevize and pelorat might be coming here in search of information concerning earth  i  as a matter of course  had our library computer make a listing of documents containing such information .  i was mildly interested when it turned up nothing .  not minor quantities .  not very little .   nothing .    but then you insisted i wait for two days before this hearing could take place  and at the same time  my curiosity was further piqued by the news that the first foundationers were not coming here after all .  i had to amuse myself somehow .  while the rest of you therefore were  as the saying goes  sipping wine while the house was falling  i went through some history books in my own possession .  i came across passages that specifically mentioned some of the investigations on the  origin question  in late imperial times .  particular documents both printed and filmed were referred to and quoted from .  i returned to the library and made a personal check for those documents .  i assure you there was nothing .    delarmi said   even if this is so  it need not be surprising .  if earth is indeed a myth     then i would find it in mythological references .  if it were a story of grandmother spacewarp  i would find it in the collected tales of grandmother spacewarp .  if it were a figment of the diseased mind  i would find it under psychopathology .  the fact is that something about earth exists or you would not all have heard of it and  indeed  immediately recognized it as the name of the putative planet of origin of the human species .  why  then  is there no reference to it in the library  anywhere .    delarmi was silent for a moment and another speaker interposed .  he was leonis cheng  a rather small man with an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutiae of the seldon plan and a rather myopic attitude toward the actual galaxy .  his eyes tended to blink rapidly when he spoke .   he said   it is well known that the empire in its final days attempted to create an imperial mystique by soft pedaling all interest in pre imperial times .    gendibal nodded .   soft pedaled is the precise term  speaker cheng .  that is not equivalent to destroying evidence .  as you should know better than anyone  another characteristic of imperial decay was a sudden interest in earlier and presumably better times .  i have just referred to the interest in the  origin question  in hari seldon s time .    cheng interrupted with a formidable clearing of the throat .   i know this very well  young man  and know far more of these social problems of imperial decay than you seem to think i do .  the process of  imperialization  overtook these dilettantish games concerning earth .  under cleon ii  during the empire s last resurgence  two centuries after seldon  imperialization reached its peak and all speculation on the question of earth came to an end .  there was even a directive in cleon   s time concerning this  referring to the interest in such things as  and i think i quote it correctly   stale and unproductive speculation that tends to undermine the people s love of the imperial throne .     gendibal smiled .   then it was in the time of cleon ii  speaker cheng  that you would place the destruction of all reference to earth .     i draw no conclusions .  i have simply stated what i have stated .     it is shrewd of you to draw no conclusions .  by cleon   s time  the empire may have been resurgent  but the university and library  at least  were in our hands or  at any rate  in those of our predecessors .  it would have been impossible for any material to be removed from the library without the speakers of the second foundation knowing it .  in fact  it would have been the speakers to whom the task would have had to be entrusted  though the dying empire would not have known that .    gendibal paused  but cheng  saying nothing  looked over the other s head .   gendibal said   it follows that the library could not have been emptied of material on earth during seldon s time  since the  origin question  was then an active preoccupation .  it could not have been emptied afterward because the second foundation was in charge .  yet the library is empty of it now .  how can this be .    delarmi broke in impatiently   you may stop weaving the dilemma  gendibal .  we see it .  what is it that you suggest as a solution .  that you have removed the documents yourself .     as usual  delarmi  you penetrate to the heart .   and gendibal bent his head to her in sardonic respect  at which she allowed herself a slight lifting of the lip  .   one solution is that the cleansing was done by a speaker of the second foundation  someone who would know how to use curators without leaving a memory behind  and computers without leaving a record behind    first speaker shandess turned red .   ridiculous  speaker gendibal .  i cannot imagine a speaker doing this .  what would the motivation be .  even if  for some reason  the material on earth were removed  why keep it from the rest of the table .  why risk a complete destruction of one s career by tampering with the library when the chances of its being discovered are so great .  besides  i don t think that even the most skillful speaker could perform the task without leaving a trace .     then it must be  first speaker  that you disagree with speaker delarmi in her suggestion that i did it    i certainly do   said the first speaker .   sometimes i doubt your judgment  but i have yet to consider you downright insane .     then it must never have happened  first speaker .  the material on earth must still be in the library  for we now seem to have eliminated all the possible ways in which it could have been removed and yet the material is not there .    delarmi said with an affectation of weariness   well well  let us finish .  again  what is it you suggest as a solution .  i am sure you think you have one .     if you are sure  speaker  we may all be sure as well .  my suggestion is that the library was cleansed by someone of the second foundation who was under the control of a subtle force from outside the second foundation .  the cleansing went unnoticed because that same force saw to it that it was not noticed .    delarmi laughed .   until you found out .  you the uncontrolled .  and uncontrollable .  if this mysterious force existed  how did you find out about the absence of material from the library .  why weren t you controlled .    gendibal said may feel  as we gravely   it s not a laughing matter  speaker .  they feel  that all tampering should be held to a minimum .  when my life was in danger a few days ago  i was more concerned with refraining from fiddling with a hamish mind than with protecting myself .  so it might be with these others as soon as they felt it was safe they ceased tampering .  that is the danger  the deadly danger .  the fact that i could find out what has happened may mean they no longer care that i do .  the fact that they no longer care may mean that they feel they have already won .  and we continue to play our games here .     but what aim do they have in all this .  what conceivable aim .   demanded delarmi  shuffling her feet and biting her lips .  she felt her power fading as the table grew more interested concerned  gendibal said   consider  the first foundation  with its enormous arsenal of physical power  is searching for earth .  they pretend to send out two exiles  hoping we will think that is all they are  but would they equip them with ships of unbelievable power ships that can move ten thousand parsecs in less than an hour if that was all that they were .    as for the second foundation  we have not been searching for earth and  clearly  steps have been taken without our knowledge to keep any information of earth away from us .  the first foundation is now so close to finding earth and we are so far from doing so  that    gendibal paused and delarmi said   that what .  finish your childish tale .  do you know anything or don t you .     i don t know everything  speaker .  i have not penetrated the total depth of the web that is encircling us  but i know the web is there .  i don t know what the significance of finding earth might be  but i am certain the second foundation is in enormous danger and  with it  the seldon plan and the future of all humanity .    delarmi rose to her feet .  she was not smiling and she spoke in a tense but tightly controlled voice .   trash .  first speaker  put an end to this .  what is at issue is the accused s behavior .  what he tells us is not only childish but irrelevant .  he cannot extenuate his behavior by building a cobwebbery of theories that makes sense only in his own mind .  i call for a vote on the matter now a unanimous vote for conviction .     wait   said gendibal sharply .   i have been told i would have an opportunity to defend myself  and there remains one more item one more .  let me present that  and you may proceed to a vote with no further objection from me .    the first speaker rubbed his eyes wearily .   you may continue  speaker gendibal .  let me point out to the table that the conviction of an impeached speaker is so weighty and  indeed  unprecedented an action that we dare not give the appearance of not allowing a full defense .  remember  too  that even if the verdict satisfies us  it may not satisfy those who come after us  and i cannot believe that a second foundationer of any level let alone the speakers of the table would not have a full appreciation of the importance of historical perspective .  let us so act that we can be certain of the approval of the speakers who will follow us in the coming centuries .    delarmi said bitterly   we run the risk  first speaker  of having posterity laugh at us for belaboring the obvious .  to continue the defense is your decision .    gendibal drew a deep breath .   in line with your decision  then  first speaker  i wish to call a witness a young woman i met three days ago and without whom i might not have reached the table meeting at all  instead of merely being late .     is the woman you speak of known to the table .   asked the first speaker .    no  first speaker .  she is native to this planet .    delarmi s eyes opened wide .   a hamishwoman .     indeed .  just so .    delarmi said   what have we to do with one of those .  nothing they say can be of any importance .  they don t exist .    gendibal s lips drew back tightly over his teeth in something that could not possibly have been mistaken for a smile .  he said sharply   physically all the hamish exist .  they are human beings and play their part in seldon s plan .  in their indirect protection of the second foundation  they play a crucial part .  i wish to dissociate myself from speaker delarmi s inhumanity and hope that her remark will be retained in the record and be considered hereafter as evidence for her possible unfitness for the position of speaker .   will the rest of the table agree with the speaker s incredible remark and deprive me of my witness .    the first speaker said   call your witness  speaker .    gendibal s lips relaxed into the normal expressionless features o    a speaker under pressure .  his mind was guarded and fenced in  but behind this protective barrier  he felt that the danger point had passed and that he had won .   sura novi looked strained .  her eyes were wide and her lower lip was faintly trembling .  her hands were slowly clenching and unclenching and her chest was heaving slightly .  her hair had been pulled back and braided into a bun  her sun darkened face twitched now and then .  her hands fumbled at the pleats of her long skirt .  she looked hastily around the table from speaker to speaker her wide eyes filled with awe .   they glanced back at her with varying degrees of contempt and discomfort .  delarmi kept her eyes well above the top of novi s head  oblivious to her presence .   carefully gendibal touched the skin of her mind  soothing and relaxing it .  he might have done the same by patting her hand or stroking her cheek  but here  under these circumstances  that was impossible  of course .   he said   first speaker  i am numbing this woman s conscious awareness so that her testimony wilt not be distorted by fear .  will you please observe will the rest of you  if you wish  join me and observe that i will  in no way  modify her mind .    novi had started back in terror at gendibal s voice  and gendibal was not surprised at that .  he realized that she had never heard second foundationers of high rank speak among themselves .  she had never experienced that odd swift combination of sound  tone  expression and thought .  the terror  however  faded as quickly as it came  as he gentled her mind .   a look of placidity crossed her face .    there is a chair behind you  novi   gendibal said .   please sit down .    novi curtsied in a small and clumsy manner and sat down  holding herself stiffly .   she talked quite clearly  but gendibal made her repeat when her hamish accent became too thick .  and because he kept his own speech formal in deference to the table  he occasionally had to repeat his own questions to her .   the tale of the fight between himself and rufirant was described quietly and well .   gendibal said   did you see all this yourself  novi .     nay  master  or i would have sooner stopped it .  rufirant be good fellow  but not quick in head .     but you described it all .  how is that possible if you did not see it all .    rufirant be telling me thereof  on questioning .  he be ashamed .     ashamed .  have you ever known him to behave in this manner in earlier times .     rufirant .  nay  master .  he be gentle  though he be large .  he be no fighter and he be afeared of scowlers .  he say often they are mighty and possessed of power .      why didn t he feel this way when he met me .     it be strange .  it be not understood .   she shook her head .   he be not his ain self .  i said to him   thou blubber head .  be it your place to assault scowler .   and he said   i know not how it happened .  it be like i am to one side  standing and watching not i .     speaker cheng interrupted .   first speaker  of what value is it to have this woman report what a man has told her .  is not the man available for questioning .    gendibal said   he is .  if  on completion of this woman s testimony  the table wishes to hear more evidence  i will be ready to call karoll rufirant my recent antagonist to the stand .  if not  the table can move directly to judgment when i am done with this witness .     very well   said the first speaker .   proceed with your witness .    gendibal said   and you  novi .  was it like you to interfere in a fight in this manner .    novi did not say anything for a moment .  a small frown appeared between her thick eyebrows and then disappeared .  she said   i know not .  i wish no harm to scowlers .  i be  driven  and without thought i inmiddled myself .   a pause  then .    i be do it over if need arise .    gendibal said   novi  you will sleep now .  you will think of nothing .  you will rest and you will not even dream .    novi mumbled for a moment .  her eyes closed and her head fell back against the headrest of her chair .   gendibal waited a moment  then said   first speaker  with respect  follow me into this woman s mind .  you will find it remarkably simple and symmetrical  which is fortunate  for what you will see might not have been visible otherwise .   here here .  do you observe .   if the rest of you will enter it will be easier if it is done one at a time .    there was a rising buzz about the table .   gendibal said   is there any doubt among you .    delarmi said   i doubt it  for   she paused on the brink of what was even for her unsayable .   gendibal said it for her .   you think i deliberately tampered with this mind in order to present false evidence .  you think  therefore  that i am capable of bringing about so delicate an adjustment one mental fiber clearly out of shape with nothing about it or its surroundings that is in the least disturbed .  if i could do that  what need would i have to deal with any of you in this manner .  why subject myself to the indignity of a trial .  why labor to convince you .  if i could do what is visible in this woman s mind  you would all be helpless before me unless you were well prepared .   the blunt fact is that none of you could manipulate a mind as this woman s has been manipulated .  neither can i .  yet it has been done .    he paused  looking at all the speakers in turn  then fixing his gaze on delarmi .  he spoke slowly .   now  if anything more is required  i will call in the hamish farmer  karoll rufirant  whom i have examined and whose mind has also been tampered with in this manner .     that will not be necessary   said the first speaker  who was wearing an appalled expression .   what we have seen is mindshaking .     in that case   said gendibal   may i rouse this hamishwoman and dismiss her .  i have arranged for there to be those outside who will see to her recovery .    when novi had left  directed by gendibal s gentle hold on her elbow  be said   let me quickly summarize .  minds can be and have been altered in ways that are beyond our power .  in this way  the curators themselves could have been influenced to remove earth material from the library without our knowledge or their own .  we see how it was arranged that i should be delayed in arriving at a meeting of the table .  i was threatened  i was rescued .  the result was that i was impeached .  the result of this apparently natural concatenation of events is that i may be removed from a position of power and the course of action which i champion and which threatens these people  whoever they are  may be negated .    delarmi leaned forward .  she was clearly shaken .   if this secret organization is so clever  how were you able to discover all this .    gendibai felt free to smile  now .   no credit to me   he said .   i lay no claim to expertise superior to that of other speakers  certainly not to the first speaker .  however  neither are these anti mules as the first speaker has rather engagingly called them infinitely wise or infinitely immune to circumstance .  perhaps they chose this particular hamishwoman as their instrument precisely because she needed very little adjustment .  she was  of her own character  sympathetic to what she calls  scholars   and admired them intensely .    but then  once this was over  her momentary contact with me strengthened her fantasy of becoming a  scholar  herself .  she came to me the next day with that purpose in mind .  curious at this peculiar ambition of hers  i studied her mind which i certainly would not otherwise have done and  more by accident than anything else  stumbled upon the adjustment and noted its significance .  had another woman been chosen one with a less natural pro scholar bias the anti mules might have had to labor more at the adjustment  but the consequences might well not have followed and i would have remained ignorant of all this .  the anti mules miscalculated or could not sufficiently allow for the unforseen .  that they can stumble so is heartening .    delarmi said   the first speaker and you call this organization  the  anti mules   i presume  because they seem to labor to keep tile galaxy in the  path of the .  seldon plan  rather than to disrupt it as the male himself did .  if the anti mines do this  why are they dangerous .     why should then labor  if not for some purpose .  we don t know what that purpose as .  a cynic might say that they intend to step in at some future time and thin the current in another direction  one tat mar please them far more than it would please ifs .  that is my own feeling  even though i do riot major in cynicism .  is speaker delarmi prepared to maintain  out of the love and trust that we all know form so great a part of her character  that these are cosmic altruists  doing our work for us  without dream of reward .    there was a gentle susurration of laughter about the table at this and gendibal knew that he had won .  and delarmi knew that she had lost  for there was a wash of rage that showed through her harsh mentalic control like a momentary ray of ruddy sunlight through a thick canopy of leaves .   gendibal said   when i first experienced the incident with the hamish farmer  i leaped to the conclusion that another speaker was behind it .  when i noted the adjustment of the hamishwoman s mind  i knew that i was right as to the plot but wrong as to the plotter .  i apologize for the misinterpretation and i plead the circumstances as an extenuation .    the first speaker said   i believe this may be construed as an apology   delarmi interrupted .  she was quite placid again her face was friendly  her voice downright saccharine .   with total respect  first speaker  if i may interrupt  let us drop this matter of impeachment .  at this moment  i would not vote for conviction and i imagine no one will .  i would even suggest the impeachment be stricken from the speaker s unblemished record .  speaker gendibal has exonerated himself ably .  i congratulate him on that and for uncovering a crisis that the rest of us might well have allowed to smolder on indefinitely  with incalculable results .  i offer the speaker my wholehearted apologies for my earlier hostility .    she virtually beamed at gendibal  who felt a reluctant admiration for the manner in which she shifted direction instantly in order to cut her losses .  he also felt that all this was but preliminary to an attack from a new direction .   he was certain that what was coming would not be pleasant .   when she exerted herself to be charming  speaker delora delarmi had a way of dominating the speaker s table .  her voice grew soft  her smile indulgent  her eyes sparkling  all of her sweet .  no one cared to interrupt her and everyone waited for the blow to fall .   she said   thanks to speaker gendibal  i think we all now understand what we must do .  we do not see the anti mules  we know nothing about them  except for their fugitive touches on the minds of people right here in the stronghold of the second foundation itself .  we do not know what the power center of the first foundation is planning .  we may face an alliance of the anti mules and the first foundation .  we don   t know .      we do know that this golan trevize and his companion  whose name escapes me at the moment  are going we know not where    and that the first speaker and gendibal feel that trevize holds the key to the outcome of this great crisis .  what  then  are we to do .  clearly we must find out everything we can about trevize  where he is going  what he is thinking  what his purpose may be  or  indeed  whether he has any destination  any thought  any purpose  whether he might not  in fact  be a mere tool of a force greater than he .      gendibal said     he is under observation .      delarmi pursed her lips in an indulgent smile .     by whom .  by one of our outworld agents .  are such agents to be expected to stand against those with the powers we have seen demonstrated here .  surely not .  in the mule   s time  and later on  too  the second foundation did not hesitate to send out   and even to sacrifice   volunteers from among the best we had  since nothing less would do .  when it was necessary to restore the seldon plan  preem palver himself scoured the galaxy as a trantorian trader in order to bring back that girl  arkady .  we cannot sit here and wait  now  when the crisis may be greater than in either previous case .  we cannot rely on minor functionaries   watchers and messenger boys .      gendibal said     surely you are not suggesting that the first speaker leave trantor at this time .      delarmi said     certainly not .  we need him badly here .  on the other hand  there is you  speaker gendibal .  it is you who have correctly sensed and weighed the crisis .  it is you who detected the subtle outside interference with the library and with hamish minds .  it is you who have maintained your views against the united opposition of the table   and won .  no one here has seen as clearly as you have and no one can be trusted  as you can  to continue to see clearly .  it is you who must  in my opinion  go out to confront the enemy .  may i have the sense of the table .      there was no formal vote needed to reveal that sense .  each speaker felt the minds of the others and it was clear to a suddenly appalled gendibal that  at the moment of his victory and delarmi   s defeat  this formidable woman was managing to send him irrevocably into exile on a task that might occupy him for some indefinite period  while she remained behind to control the table and  therefore  the second foundation and  therefore  the galaxy   sending all alike  perhaps  to their doom .   and if gendibal in exile should  somehow  manage to gather the information that would enable the second foundation to avert the gathering crisis  it would be delarmi who would have the credit for having arranged it  and his success would but confirm her power .  the quicker gendibal would be  the more efficiently he succeeded  the more surely he would confirm her power .   it was a beautiful maneuver  an unbelievable recovery .   and so clearly was she dominating the table even now that she was virtually usurping the first speaker   s role .  gendibal   s thought to that effect was overtaken by the rage he sensed from the first speaker .   he turned .  the first speaker was making no effort to hide his anger   and it soon was clear that another internal crisis was building to replace the one that had been resolved .   quindor shandess  the twenty fifth first speaker  had no extraordinary illusions about himself .   he knew he was not one of those few dynamic first speakers who had illuminated the five century long history of the second foundation   but then  he didn   t have to be .  he controlled the table in a quiet period of galactic prosperity and it was not a time for dynamism .  it had seemed to be a time to play a holding game and he had been the man for this role .  his predecessor had chosen him for that reason .      you are not an adventurer  you are a scholar     the twenty fourth first speaker had said .     you will preserve the plan  where an adventurer might ruin it .  preserve .  let that be the key word for your table .      he had tried  but it had meant a passive first speakership and this had been  on occasion  interpreted as weakness .  there had been recurrent rumors that he meant to resign and there had been open intrigue to assure the succession in one direction or another .   there was no doubt in shandess   s mind that delarmi had been a leader in the fight .  she was the strongest personality at the table and even gendibal  with all the fire and folly of youth  retreated before her  as he was doing right now .   but  by seldon  passive he might be  or even weak  but there was one prerogative of the first speaker that not one in the line had ever given up  and neither would he do so .   he rose to speak and at once there was a hush about the table .     when the first speaker rose to speak  there could be no interruptions .  even delarmi or gendibal would not dare to interrupt .   he said     speakers .  i agree that we face a dangerous crisis and that we must take strong measures .  it is i who should go out to meet the enemy .  speaker delarmi  with the gentleness that characterizes her  excuses me from the task by stating that i am needed here .  the truth  however  is that i am needed neither here nor there .  i grow old  i grow weary .  there has long been expectation i would someday resign and perhaps i ought to .  when this crisis is successfully surmounted  i shall resign .      but  of course  it is the privilege of the first speaker to choose his successor .  i am going to do so now .  there is one speaker who has long dominated the proceedings of the table  one speaker who  by force of personality  has  often supplied the leadership that i could not .  you all know i am speaking of speaker delarmi .      he paused  then said     you alone  speaker gendibal  are registering disapproval .  may i ask why .     he sat down  so that gendibal might have the right to answer .      i do not disapprove  first speaker     said gendibal in a low voice .     it is your prerogative to choose your successor .         and so i will .     when you return   having succeeded in initiating the process that will put an end to this crisis   it will be time for my resignation .  my successor will then be directly in charge of conducting whatever policies may be required to carry on and complete that process .     do you have anything to say  speaker gendibal .      gendibal said quietly     when you make speaker delarmi your successor  first speaker  i hope you will see fit to advise her to        the first speaker interrupted him roughly .     i have spoken of speaker delarmi  but i have not named her as my successor .  now what do you have to say .         my apologies  first speaker .  i should have said  assuming you  make speaker delarmi your successor upon my return from this mission  would you see fit to advise her to           nor will i make her my successor in the future  under any conditions .  now what do you have to say .     the first speaker was unable to make this announcement without a stab of satisfaction at the blow he was delivering to delarmi .  he could not have done it in a more humiliating fashion .      well  speaker gendibal     he said     what do you have to say .         that i am confused .      the first speaker rose again .  he said     speaker delarmi has dominated and led  but that is not all that is needed for the post of first speaker .  speaker gendibal has seen what we have not seen .  he has faced the united hostility of the table  and forced it to rethink matters  and has dragged it into agreement with him .  i have my suspicions as to the motivation of speaker delarmi in placing the responsibility of the pursuit of golan trevize on the shoulders of speaker gendibal  but that is where the burden belongs .  i know he will succeed   i trust my intuition in this   and when he returns  speaker gendibal will become the twenty sixth first speaker .      he sat down abruptly and each speaker began to make clear his opinion in a bedlam of sound  tone  thought  and expression .  the first speaker paid no attention to the cacophony  but stared indifferently before him .  now that it was done  he realized   with some surprise   the great comfort there was in laying down the mantle of responsibility .  he should have done it before this   but he couldn   t have .   it was not till now that he had found his obvious successor .   and then  somehow  his mind caught that of delarmi and he looked up at her .   by seldon .  she was calm and smiling .  her desperate disappointment did not show   she had not given up .  he wondered if he had played into her hands .     what was there left for her to do .   debra delarmi would freely have shown her desperation and disappointment  if that would have proven of any use whatever .   it would have given her a great deal of satisfaction to strike out at that senile fool who controlled the table or at that juvenile idiot  with whom fortune had conspired   but satisfaction wasn   t what she wanted .  she wanted something more .   she wanted to be first speaker .   and while there was a card left to play  she would play it .   she smiled gently  and managed to lift her hand as though she were about to speak  and then held the pose just long enough to insure that when she did speak  all would be not merely normal  but radiantly quiet .   she said     first speaker  as speaker gendibal said earlier  i do not disapprove .  it is your prerogative to choose your successor .  if i speak now  it is in order that i may contribute   i hope   to the success of what has now become speaker gendibal   s mission .  may i explain my thoughts  first speaker .         do so     said the first speaker curtly .  she was entirely too smooth  too pliant  it seemed to him .   delarmi bent her head gravely .  she no longer smiled .  she said     we have ships .  they are not as technologically magnificent as those of the first foundation  but they will carry speaker gendibal he knows how to pilot one  i believe  as do we all .  we have our representatives on every major planet in the galaxy  and he will be welcomed everywhere .  moreover  he can defend himself against even these anti mules  now that  he is thoroughly aware of the danger .  even when we were unaware  i suspect they have preferred to work through the lower classes and even the hamish farmers .  we will  of course  thoroughly inspect the minds of all the second foundationers  including the speakers  but i am sure they have remained inviolate .  the anti mules did not dare interfere with us .      nevertheless  there is no reason why speaker gendibal should risk more than he must .  he is not intending to engage in derring do and it will be best if his mission is to some extent disguised   if he takes them unaware .  it will be useful if he goes in the role of a hamish trader .  preem palver  we all know  went off into the galaxy as a supposed trader .      the first speaker said     preem palver had a specific purpose in doing so  speaker gendibal has not .  if it appears a disguise of some sort is necessary  i am sure he will be ingenious enough to adopt one .         with respect  first speaker  i wish to point out a subtle disguise .  preem palver  you will remember  took with him his wife and companion of many years .  nothing so thoroughly established the rustic  nature of his character as the fact that he was traveling with his wife .  it allayed all suspicion .      gendibal said     i have no wife .  i have had companions  but none who would now volunteer to assume the marital role .         this is well known  speaker gendibal     said delarmi     but then people will take the role for granted if any woman is with you .  surely some volunteer can be found .  and if you feel the need to be able to present documentary evidence  that can be provided .  i think a woman should come with you .      for a moment  gendibal was breathless .  surely she did not mean    could it be a ploy to achieve a share in the success .  could she be playing for a joint   or rotating   occupation of the first speakership .   gendibal said grimly     i am flattered that speaker delarmi should feel that she        and delarmi broke into an open laugh and looked at gendibal with what was almost true affection .  he had fallen into the trap and looked foolish for having done so .  the table would not forget that .   she said     speaker gendibal  i would not have the impertinence to attempt to share in this task .  it is yours and yours alone  as the post of first speaker will be yours and yours alone .  i would not have thought you wanted me with you .  really  speaker  at my age  i no longer think of myself as a charmer        there were smiles around the table and even the first speaker tried to hide one .   gendibal felt the stroke and labored not to compound the loss by failing to match her lightness .  it was labor lost .   he said  as unsavagely as he could     then what is it you would suggest .  it was not in my thoughts  i assure you  that you would wish to accompany me .  you are at your best at the table and not in the hurly burly of galactic affairs  i know .         i agree  speaker gendibal  i agree     said delarmi .     my suggestion  however  refers back to your role as hamish trader .  to make it indisputably authentic  what better companion need you ask but a hamishwoman .         a hamishwoman .     for a second time in rapid succession  gendibal was caught by surprise and the table enjoyed it .      the hamishwoman     delarmi went on .     the one who saved you from a beating .  the one who gazes at you worshipfully .  the one  whose mind you probed and who then  quite unwittingly  saved you a second time from considerably more than a beating .  i suggest you take her .      gendibal   s impulse was to refuse  but he knew that she expected that .  it would mean more enjoyment for the table .  it was clear now that the first speaker  anxious to strike out at delarmi  had made a mistake by naming gendibal his successor   or  at the very least  that delarmi had quickly converted it into one .   gendibal was the youngest of the speakers .  he had angered the table and had then avoided conviction by them .  in a very real way  he had humiliated them .  none could see him as the heir apparent without resentment .   that would have been hard enough to overcome  but now they would remember how easily delarmi had twitched him into ridicule and how much they had enjoyed it .  she would use that to convince them  all too easily  that he lacked the age and experience for the role of first speaker .  their united pressure would force the first speaker into changing his decision while gendibal was off on his mission .  or  if the first speaker held fast  gendibal would eventually find himself with an office that would be forever helpless in the face of united opposition .   he saw it all in an instant and was able to answer as though with out hesitation .    he said     speaker delarmi  i admire your insight .  i had thought to surprise you all .  it was indeed my intention to take the hamishwoman  though not quite for the very good reason you suggest .  it was for her mind that i wished to take her with me .  you have all examined that mind .  you saw it for what it was  surprisingly intelligent but  more than that  clear  simple  utterly without guile .  no touch upon it by others would go unnoticed  as i   m sure you all concluded .      i wonder if it occurred to you  then  speaker delarmi  that she would serve as an excellent early warning system .  i would detect the first symptomatic presence of mentalism by way of her mind  earlier  i think  than by way of mine .      there was a kind of astonished silence at that  and he said  lightly .     ah  none of you saw that .  well well  not important .  and i will take my leave now .  there   s no time to lose .         wait     said delarmi  her initiative lost a third time .     what do you intend to do .      gendibal said with a small shrug .     why go into details .  the less the table knows  the less the anti mules are likely to attempt to disturb it .      he said it as though the safety of the table was his prime concern .  he filled his mind with that  and let it show .   it would flatter them .  more than that  the satisfaction it would bring might keep them from wondering whether  in fact  gendibal knew exactly what it was he intended to do .   the first speaker spoke to gendibal alone that evening .      you were right     he said .     i could not help brushing below the surface of your mind .  i saw you considered the announcement a mistake and it was .  it was my eagerness to wipe that eternal smile off her face and to strike back at the casual way in which she so frequently usurps my role .      gendibal said gently     it might have been better if you had told me privately and had then waited for my return to go further .         that would not have allowed me to strike out at her .     poor motivation for a first speaker  i know .         this won   t stop her  first speaker .  she will still intrigue for the post and perhaps with good reason .  i   m sure there are some who would argue that i should have refused your nomination .  it would not be hard to argue that speaker delarmi has the best mind at the table and would make the best first speaker .         the best mind at the table  not away from it     grumbled shandess .     she recognizes no real enemies  except for other speakers .  she ought never to have been made a speaker in the first place .     see here  shall i forbid you to take the hamishwoman .  she maneuvered you into that  i know .         no no  the reason i advanced for taking her is a true one .  she will be an early warning system and i am grateful to speaker delarmi for pushing me into realizing that .  the woman will prove very useful  i   m convinced .         good  then .  by the way  i wasn   t lying  either .  i am truly certain that you will accomplish whatever is needed to end this crisis   if you can trust my intuition .         i think i can trust it  for i agree with you .  i promise you that  whatever happens  i will return better than i receive .  i will come back to be first speaker  whatever the anti mules   or speaker delarmi   can do .      gendibal studied his own satisfaction even as he spoke .  why was he so pleased  so insistent  on this one ship venture into space .  ambition  of course .  preem palver had once done just this sort of thing     and he was going to show that stor gendibal could do it  too .  no one could withhold the first speakership from him after that .  and yet was there more than ambition .  the lure of combat .  the generalized desire for excitement in one who had been confined to a hidden patch on a backward planet all his adult life .     he didn   t entirely know  but he knew he was desperately intent on going .     chapter eleven  sayshell    janov pelorat watched  for the first time in his life  as the bright star graduated into an orb after what trevize had called a    micro jump .     the fourth planet   the habitable one and their immediate destination  sayshell   then grew in size and prominence more slowly   over a period of days .   a map of the planet had been produced by the computer and was displayed on a portable screening device  which pelorat held in his lap .   trevize   with the aplomb of someone who had  in his time  touched down upon several dozen worlds   said     don   t start watching too hard too soon  janov .  we have to go through the entry station first and that can be tedious .      pelorat looked up .     surely that   s just a formality .         it is .  but it can still be tedious .         but it   s peacetime .         of course .  that means we   ll be passed through .  first  though  there   s a little matter of the ecological balance .  every planet has its own and they don   t want it upset .  so they make a natural point of checking the ship for undesirable organisms  or infections .  it   s a reasonable precaution .         we don   t have such things  it seems to me .         no  we don   t and they   ll find that out .  remember  too  that sayshell is not a member of the foundation federation  so there   s certain to be some leaning over backward to demonstrate their independence .      a small ship came out to inspect them and a sayshellian customs  official boarded .  trevize was brisk  not having forgotten his military days .      the far star  out of terminus     he said .     ship   s papers .  unarmed .  private vessel .  my passport .  there is one passenger .  his passport .  we are tourists .      the customs official wore a garish uniform in which crimson was the dominating color .  cheeks and upper lip were smooth shaven  but he wore a short beard parted in such a way that tufts thrust out to both sides of his chin .  he said     foundation ship .      he pronounced it    foundaysun sip     but trevize was careful neither to correct him nor to smile .  there were as many varieties of dialects to galactic standard as there were planets  and you just spoke your own .  as long as there was cross comprehension  it didn   t matter .      yes  sir     said trevize .     foundation ship .  privately owned .         very nice .     your lading  if you please .         my what .         your lading .  what are you carrying .         ah  my cargo .  here is the itemized list .  personal property only .  we are not here to trade .  as i told you  we are simply tourists .      the customs official looked about curiously .     this is rather an elaborate vessel for tourists .         not by foundation standards     said trevize with a display of good humor .     and i   m well off and can afford this .         are you suggesting that i might be richified .     the official looked at him briefly  then looked away .   trevize hesitated a moment in order to interpret the meaning of the word  then another moment to decide his course of action .  he said     no  it is not my intention to bribe you .  i have no reason to bribe you   and you don   t look like the kind of person who could be bribed  if that were my intention .  you can look over the ship  if you wish .         no need     said the official  putting away his pocket recorder .     you have already been examined for specific contraband infection and have passed .  the ship has been assigned a radio wavelength that will serve as an approach beam .      he left .  the whole procedure had taken fifteen minutes .   pelorat said in a low voice .     could he have made trouble .  did he really expect a bribe .      trevize shrugged .     tipping the customs man is as old as the galaxy and i would have done it readily if he had made a second try for it .  as it is   well  i presume he prefers not to take  a chance with a foundation ship  and a fancy one  at that .  the old mayor  bless her cross grained hide  said the name of the foundation would protect us wherever we went and she wasn   t wrong .     it could have taken a great deal longer .         why .  he seemed to find out what he wanted to know .         yes  but he was courteous enough to check us by remote radioscanning .  if he had wished  he could have gone over the ship with a hand machine and taken hours .  he could have put us both in a field hospital and kept us days .         what .  my dear fellow .         don   t get excited .  he didn   t do it .  i thought he might  but he didn   t .  which means we   re free to land .  i   d like to go down gravitically   which could take us fifteen minutes   but i don   t know where the permitted landing sites might be and i don   t want to cause trouble .  that means we   ll have to follow the radio beam    which will take hours   as we spiral down through the atmosphere .      pelorat looked cheerful .     but that   s excellent  golan .  will we be going slowly enough to watch the terrain .     he held up his portable viewscreen with the map spread out on it at low magnification .      after a fashion .  we   d have to get beneath the cloud deck  and we   ll be moving at a few kilometers per second .  it won   t be ballooning through the atmosphere  but you   ll spot the planetography .         excellent .  excellent .      trevize said thoughtfully     i   m wondering  though  if we   ll be on sayshell planet long enough to make it worth our while to adjust the ship   s clock to local time .         it depends on what we plan to do  i suppose .  what do you think we   ll be doing  golan .         our job is to find gaia and i don   t know how long that will take .      pelorat said     we can adjust our wrist strips and leave the ship   s clock as is .         good enough     said trevize .  he looked down at the planet spreading broadly beneath them .     no use waiting any longer .  i   ll adjust the computer to our assigned radio beam and it can use the gravities to mimic conventional flight .  so .     let   s go down  janov  and see what we can find .      he stared at the planet thoughtfully as the ship began to move on its smoothly adjusted gravitational potential curve .   trevize had never been in the sayshell union  but he knew that over the last century it had been steadfastly unfriendly to the foundation .  he was surprised   and a little dismayed   they had gotten through customs so quickly .   it didn   t seem reasonable .   the customs official   s name was jogoroth sobhaddartha and he had been serving on the station on and off for half his life .   he didn   t mind the life  for it gave him a chance   one month out of three   to view his books  to listen to his music  and to be away from his wife and growing son .   of course  during the last two years the current head of customs had been a dreamer  which was irritating .  there is no one so insufferable as a person who gives no other excuse for a peculiar action than saying he had been directed to it in a dream .   personally sobhaddartha decided he believed none of it  though he was careful not to say so aloud  since most people on sayshell rather disapproved of antipsychic doubts .  to become known as a materialist might put his forthcoming pension at risk .   he stroked the two tufts of hair at his chin  one with his right hand and the other with his left  cleared his throat rather loudly  and then  with inappropriate casualness  said     was that the ship  head .      the head  who bore the equally sayshellian name of namarath godhisavatta  was concerned with a matter involving some computer born data and did not look up .     what ship .     he said .      the far star .  the foundation ship .  the one i just sent past .  the one that was holographed from every angle .  was that the one you dreamed of .      godhisavatta looked up now .  he was a small man  with eyes that were almost black and that were surrounded by fine wrinkles that had not been produced by any penchant for smiling .  he said     why do you ask .      sobhaddartha straightened up and allowed his dark and luxuriant eyebrows to approach each other .     they said they were tourists  but  i   ve never seen a ship like that before and my own opinion is they   re foundation agents .        godhisavatta sat back in his chair .     see here  my man  try as i might i cannot recall asking for your opinion .         but head  i consider it my patriotic duty to point out that        godhisavatta crossed his arms over his chest and stared hard at the underling  who  though much the more impressive in physical stature and bearing  allowed himself to droop and take on a somehow bedraggled appearance under the gaze of his superior .   godhisavatta said     my man  if you know what is good for you  you will do your job without comment   or i   ll see to it that there will be no pension when you retire  which will be soon if i hear any more on a subject that does not concern you .      in a low voice  sobhaddartha said     yes  sir .     then  with a suspicious degree of subservience in his voice  he added     is it within the range of my duties  sir  to report that a second ship is in range of our screens .         consider it reported     godhisavatta said irritably  returning to his work .      with     said sobhaddartha even more humbly     characteristics very similar to the one i just sent through .      godhisavatta placed his hands on the desk and lifted himself to his feet .     a second one .      sobhaddartha smiled inwardly .  that sanguinary person born of an irregular union  he was referring to the head  had clearly not dreamed of two ships .  he said     apparently  sir .  i will now return to my post and await orders and i hope  sir           yes .      sobhaddartha could not resist  pension risk notwithstanding .     and i hope  sir  we didn   t send the wrong one through .      the far star moved rapidly across the face of sayshell planet and pelorat watched with fascination .  the cloud layer was thinner and more scattered than upon terminus and  precisely as the map showed  the land surfaces were more compact and extensive   including broader desert areas  to judge by the rusty color of much of the continental expanse .   there were no signs of anything living .  it seemed a world of sterile desert  gray plain  of endless wrinkles that might have represented mountainous areas  and  of course  of ocean .      it looks lifeless     muttered pelorat .      you don   t expect to see any life signs at this height     said trevize .     as we get lower  you   ll see the land turn green in patches .  before that  in fact  you   ll see the twinkling landscape on the nightside .  human beings have a penchant for lighting their worlds when darkness falls  i   ve never heard of a world that   s an exception to that rule .  in other words  the first sign of life you   ll see will not only be human but technological .      pelorat said thoughtfully     human beings are diurnal in nature  after all .  it seems to me that among the very first tasks of a developing technology would be the conversion of night to day .  in fact  if a world lacked technology and developed one  you ought to be able to follow the progress of technological development by the increase in light upon the darkened surface .  how long would it take  do you suppose  to go from uniform darkness to uniform light .      trevize laughed .     you have odd thoughts  but i suppose that comes from being a mythologist .  i don   t think a world would ever achieve a uniform glow .  night light would follow the pattern of population density  so that the continents would spark in knots and strings .  even trantor at its height  when it was one huge structure  let light escape that structure only at scattered points .      the land turned green as trevize had predicted and  on the last circling of the globe  he pointed out markings that he said were cities .     it   s not a very urban world .  i   ve never been in the sayshell union before  but according to the information the computer gives me  they tend to cling to the past .  technology  in the eyes of all the galaxy  has been associated with the foundation  and wherever the foundation is unpopular  there is a tendency to cling to the past    except  of course  as far as weapons of war are concerned .  i assure you sayshell is quite modern in that respect .         dear me  golan  this is not going to be unpleasant  is it .  we are foundationers  after all  and being in enemy territory           it   s not enemy territory  janov .  they   ll be perfectly polite  never fear .  the foundation just isn   t popular  that   s all .  sayshell is not part of the foundation federation .  therefore  because they   re proud of their independence and because they don   t like to remember that they are much weaker than the foundation and remain independent only because we   re willing to let them remain so  they indulge in the luxury of disliking us .           i fear it will still be unpleasant  then     said pelorat despondently .     not at all     said trevize .     come on  janov .  i   m talking about the official attitude of the sayshellian government .  the individual people on the planet are just people  and if we   re pleasant and don   t act as though we   re lords of the galaxy  they   ll be pleasant  too .  we   re not coming to sayshell in order to establish foundation mastery .  we   re just tourists  asking the kind of questions about sayshell that any tourist would ask .      and we can have a little legitimate relaxation  too  if the situation permits .  there   s nothing wrong with staying here a few days and experiencing what they have to offer .  they may have an interesting culture  interesting scenery  interesting food  and   if all else fails   interesting women .  we have money to spend .      pelorat frowned     oh  my dear chap .         come on     said trevize .     you   re not that old .  wouldn   t you be interested .         i don   t say there wasn   t a time when i played that role properly  but surely this isn   t the time for it .  we have a mission .  we want to reach gaia .  i have nothing against a good time   i really don   t   but if we start involving ourselves  it might be difficult to pull free .     he shook his head and said mildly     i think you feared that i might have too good a time at the galactic library on trantor and would be unable to pull free .  surely  what the library is to me  an attractive dark eyed damsel   or five or six   might be to you .      trevize said     i   m not a rakehell  janov  but i have no intention of being ascetic  either .  very well  i promise you we   ll get on with this business of gaia  but if something pleasant comes my way  there   s no reason in the galaxy i ought not to respond normally .         if you   ll just put gaia first           i will .  just remember  though  don   t tell anyone we   re from the foundation .  they   ll know we are  because we   ve got foundation credits and we speak with strong terminus accents  but if we say nothing about it  they can pretend we are placeless strangers and be friendly .  if we make a point of being foundationers  they will speak politely enough  but they will tell us nothing  show us nothing  take us nowhere  and leave us strictly alone .      pelorat sighed .     i will never understand people .         there   s nothing to it .  all you have to do is take a close look at  yourself and you will understand everyone else .  we   re in no way different ourselves .  how would seldon have worked out his plan    and i don   t care how subtle his mathematics was   if he didn   t understand people  and how could he have done that if people weren   t easy to understand .  you show me someone who can   t understand people and i   ll show you someone who has built up a false image of himself   no offense intended .         none taken .  i   m willing to admit i   m inexperienced and that i   ve spent a rather self centered and constricted life .  it may be that i   ve never really taken a good look at myself  so i   ll let you be my guide and adviser where people are concerned .         good .  then take my advice now and just watch the scenery .  we   ll be landing soon and i assure you you   ll feel nothing .  the computer and i will take care of everything .         golan  don   t be annoyed .  if a young woman should           forget it .  just let me take care of the landing .      pelorat turned to look at the world at the end of the ship   s contracting spiral .  it would be the first foreign world upon which he would ever stand .  this thought somehow filled him with foreboding  despite the fact that all the millions of inhabited planets in the galaxy had been colonized by people who had not been born upon them .   all but one  he thought with a shudder of trepidation delight .   the spaceport was not large by foundation standards  but it was well kept .  trevize watched the far star moved into a berth and locked in place .  they were given an elaborate coded receipt .   pelorat said in a low voice     do we just leave it here .      trevize nodded and placed his hand on the other   s shoulder in reassurance .     don   t worry     he said in an equally low voice .   they stepped into the ground car they had rented and trevize plugged in the map of the city  whose towers he could see on the horizon .      sayshell city     he said     the capital of the planet .  city   planet     star   all named sayshell .         i   m worried about the ship     insisted pelorat .      nothing to worry about     said trevize .     we   ll be back tonight   because it will be our sleeping quarters if we have to stay here more than a few hours .  you have to understand  too  that there   s an interstellar code of spaceport ethics that   as far as i  know   has never been broken  even in wartime .  spaceships that come in peace are inviolate .  if that were not so  no one would be safe and trade would be impossible .  any world on which that code was broken would be boycotted by the space pilots of the galaxy .  i assure you  no world would risk that .  besides           besides .         well  besides  i   ve arranged with the computer that anyone who doesn   t look and sound like one of us will be killed if he   or she    tries to board the ship .  i   ve taken the liberty of explaining that to the port commander .  i told him very politely that i would love to turn off that particular facility out of deference to the reputation that the sayshell city spaceport holds for absolute integrity and security   throughout the galaxy  i said   but the ship is a new model and i didn   t know how to turn it off .         he didn   t believe that  surely .         of course not .  but he had to pretend he did  as otherwise he would have no choice but to be insulted .  and since there would be nothing he could do about that  being insulted would only lead to humiliation .  and since he didn   t want that  the simplest path to follow was to believe what i said .         and that   s another example of how people are .         yes .  you   ll get used to this .         how do you know this ground car isn   t bugged .         i thought it might be .  so when they offered me one  i took another one at random .  if they   re all bugged   well  what have we been saying that   s so terrible .      pelorat looked unhappy .     i don   t know how to say this .  it seems rather impolite to complain  but i don   t like the way it smells .  there   s an   odor .         in the ground car .         well  in the spaceport  to begin with .  i suppose that   s the way spaceports smell  but the ground car carries the odor with it .  could we open the windows .      trevize laughed .     i suppose i could figure out which portion of the control panel will do that trick  but it won   t help .  this planet stinks .  is it very bad .         it   s not very strong  but it   s noticeable   and somewhat repulsive .  does the whole world smell this way .         i keep forgetting you   ve never been on another world .  every inhabited world has its own odor .  it   s the general vegetation  mostly  though i suppose the animals and even the human beings contribute .  and as far as i know  nobody ever likes the smell of any world when he first lands on it .  but you   ll get used to it  janov .  in a few hours  i promise you won   t notice .         surely you don   t mean that all worlds smell like this .         no .  as i said  each has its own .  if we really paid attention or if our noses were a little keener   like those of anacreonian dogs   we could probably tell which world we were on with one sniff .  when i first entered the navy i could never eat the first day on a new world  then i learned the old spacer trick of sniffing a handkerchief with the world scent on it during the landing .  by the time you get out into the open world  you don   t smell it .  and after a while  you get hardened to the whole thing  you just learn to disregard it .     the worst of it is returning home  in fact .         why .         do you think terminus doesn   t smell .         are you telling me it does .         of course it does .  once you get acclimated to the smell of another world  such as sayshell  you   ll be surprised at the stench of terminus .  in the old days  whenever the locks opened on terminus after a sizable tour of duty  all the crew would call out     back home to the crap .         pelorat looked revolted .   the towers of the city were perceptibly closer  but pelorat kept his eyes fixed on their immediate surroundings .  there were other ground cars moving in both directions and an occasional air car above  but pelorat was studying the trees .   he said     the plant life seems strange .  do you suppose any of it is indigenous .         i doubt it     said trevize absently .  he was studying the map and attempting to adjust the programming of the car   s computer .     there   s not much in the way of indigenous life on any human planet .  settlers always imported their own plants and animals    either at the time of settling or not too long afterward .         it seems strange  though .         you don   t expect the same varieties from world to world  janov .   i was once told that the encyclopedia galactica people put out an atlas of varieties which ran to eighty seven fat computer discs and was incomplete even so   and outdated anyway  by the time it was finished .      the ground car moved on and the outskirts of the city gaped and engulfed them .  pelorat shivered slightly     i don   t think much of their city architecture .         to each his own     said trevize with the indifference of the seasoned space traveler .      where are we going  by the way .         well     said trevize with a certain exasperation     i   m trying to get the computer to guide this thing to the tourist center .  i hope the computer knows the one way streets and the traffic regulations  because i don   t .         what do we do there  golan .         to begin with  we   re tourists  so that   s the place where we   d naturally go  and we want to be as inconspicuous and natural as we can .  and secondly  where would you go to get information on gaia .      pelorat said     to a university   or an anthropological society   or a museum    certainly not to a tourist center .         well  you   re wrong .  at the tourist center  we will be intellectual types who are eager to have a listing of the universities in the city and the museums and so on .  we   ll decide where to go to first and there we may find the proper people to consult concerning ancient history  galactography  mythology  anthropology  or anything else you can think of .     but the whole thing starts at the tourist center .      pelorat was silent and the ground car moved on in a tortuous manner as it joined and became part of the traffic pattern .  they plunged into a sub road and drove past signs that might have represented directions and traffic instructions but were in a style of lettering that made them all but unreadable .   fortunately the ground car behaved as though it knew the way  and when it stopped and drew itself into a parking spot  there was a sign that said  sayshell out world milieu in the same difficult printing  and under it  sayshell tourist center in straightforward  easy to read galactic standard lettering .   they walked into the building  which was not as large as the fa  ade had led them to believe .  ft was certainly not busy inside .   there were a series of waiting booths  one of which was occupied by a man reading the news strips emerging from a small ejector  another contained two women who seemed to be playing some intricate game with cards and tiles .  behind a counter too large for him  with winking computer controls that seemed far too complex for him  was a bored looking sayshellian functionary wearing what looked like a multicolored checkerboard .   pelorat stared and whispered     this is certainly a world of extroverted garb .         yes     said trevize     i noticed .  still  fashions change from world to world and even from region to region within a world sometimes .  and they change with time .  fifty years ago  everyone on sayshell might have worn black  for all we know .  take it as it comes  janov .         i suppose i   ll have to     said pelorat     but i prefer our own fashions .  at least  they   re not an assault upon the optic nerve .         because so many of us are gray on gray .  that offends some people .  i   ve heard it referred to as    dressing in dirt .     then too  it   s foundation colorlessness that probably keeps these people in their rainbows   just to emphasize their independence .  it   s all what you   re accustomed to  anyway .     come on  janov .      the two headed toward the counter and  as they did so  the man in the booth forsook his news items  rose  and came to meet them  smiling as he did so .  his clothing was in shades of gray .   trevize didn   t look in his direction at first  but when he did he stopped dead .   he took a deep breath     by the galaxy    my friend  the traitor .        chapter twelve  agent    munn li compor  councilman of terminus  looked uncertain as he extended his right hand to trevize .   trevize looked at the hand sternly and did not take it .  he said  apparently to open air     i am in no position to create a situation in which i may find myself arrested for disturbing the peace on a foreign planet  but i will do so anyway if this individual comes a step closer .      compor stopped abruptly  hesitated  and finally said in a low voice after glancing uncertainly at pelorat     am i to have a chance to talk .  to explain .  will you listen .      pelorat looked from one to the other with a slight frown on his long face .  he said     what   s all this  golan .  have we come to this far world and at once met someone you know .      trevize   s eyes remained firmly fixed on compor  but he twisted his body slightly to make it clear that he was talking to pelorat .  trevize said     this   human being   we would judge that much from his shape   was once a friend of mine on terminus .  as is my habit with my friends  i trusted him .  i told him my views  which were perhaps not the kind that should have received a general airing .  he told them to the authorities in great detail  apparently  and did not take the trouble to tell me he had done so .  for that reason  i walked neatly into a trap and now i find myself in exile .  and now this   human being   wishes to be recognized as a friend .      he turned to compor full on and brushed his fingers through his hair  succeeding only in disarranging the curls further .     see here  you .  i do have a question for you .  what are you doing here .  of all the worlds in the galaxy on which you could be  why are you on this one .  and why now .      compor   s hand  which had remained outstretched throughout trevize   s speech  now fell to his side and the smile left his face .  the air of self confidence  which was ordinarily so much a part of him  was gone and in its absence he looked younger than his thirty four years and a bit woebegone .     i   ll explain     he said     but only from the start .      trevize looked about briefly .     here .  you really want to talk about it here .  in a public place .  you want me to knock you down here after i   ve listened to enough of your lies .      compor lifted both hands now  palms facing each other .     it   s the safest place  believe me .     and then  checking himself and realizing what the other was about to say  added hurriedly     or don   t believe me  it doesn   t matter .  i   m telling the truth .  i   ve been on the planet several hours longer than you and i   ve checked it out .  this is some particular day they have here on sayshell .  it   s a day for meditation  for some reason .  almost everyone is at home   or should be .     you see how empty this place is .  you don   t suppose it   s like this every day .      pelorat nodded and said     i was wondering why it was so empty  at that .     he leaned toward trevize   s ear and whispered     why not let him talk  golan .  he looks miserable  poor chap  and he may be trying to apologize .  it seems unfair not to give him the chance to do so .       trevize said     dr .  pelorat seems anxious to hear you .  i   m willing to oblige him  but you   ll oblige me if you   re brief about it .  this may be a good day on which to lose my temper .  if everyone is meditating  any disturbance i cause may not produce the guardians of the law .  i may not be so lucky tomorrow .  why waste an opportunity .      compor said in a strained voice     look  if you want to take a poke at me  do so .  i won   t even defend myself  see .  go ahead  hit me   but listen .         go ahead and talk  then .  i   ll listen for a while .         in the first place  golan           address me as trevize  please .  i am not on first name terms with you .         in the first place  trevize  you did too good a job convincing me of your views           you hid that well .  i could have sworn you were amused by me .         i tried to be amused to hide from myself the fact that you were being extremely disturbing .     look  let us sit down up against the wall .  even if the place is empty  some few may come in and i don   t think we ought to be needlessly conspicuous .      slowly the three men walked most of the length of the large room .  compor was smiling tentatively again  but remained carefully at more than arm   s length from trevize .   they sat each on a seat that gave as their weight was placed upon it and molded itself into the shape of their hips and buttocks .  pelorat looked surprised and made as though to stand up .      relax  professor     said compor .     i   ve been through this already .  they   re in advance of us in some ways .  it   s a world that believes in small comforts .      he turned to trevize  placing one arm over the back of his chair and speaking easily now .     you disturbed me .  you made me feel the second foundation did exist  and that was deeply upsetting .  consider the consequences if they did .  wasn   t it likely that they might take care of you somehow .  remove you as a menace .  and if i behaved as though i believed you  i might be removed as well .  do you see my point .         i see a coward .         what good would it do to be storybook brave .     said compor warmly  his blue eyes widening in indignation .     can you or i stand up to an organization capable of molding our minds and emotions .  the only way we could fight effectively would be to hide our knowledge to begin with .         so you hid it and were safe .     yet you didn   t hide it from mayor branno  did you .  quite a risk there .         yes .  but i thought that was worth it .  just talking between ourselves might do nothing more than get ourselves mentally controlled     or our memories erased altogether .  if i told the mayor  on the other hand    she knew my father well  you know .  my father and i were immigrants from smyrno and the mayor had a grandmother who           yes yes     said trevize impatiently     and several generations farther back you can trace ancestry to the sirius sector .  you   ve told all that to everyone you know .  get on with it  compor .         well  i had her ear .  if i could convince the mayor that there was danger  using your arguments  the federation might take some action .  we   re not as helpless as we were in the days of the mule and    at the worst   this dangerous knowledge would be spread more widely and we ourselves would not be in as much specific danger .      trevize said sardonically     endanger the foundation  but keep ourselves safe .  that   s good patriotic stuff .         that would be at the worst .  i was counting on the best .     his forehead had become a little damp .  he seemed to be straining against trevize   s immovable contempt .      and you didn   t tell me of this clever plan of yours  did you .         no  i didn   t and i   m sorry about that  trevize .  the mayor ordered me not to .  she said she wanted to know everything you knew but that you were the sort of person who would freeze if you knew that your remarks were being passed on .         how right she was .         i didn   t know   i couldn   t guess   i had no way of conceiving that she was planning to arrest you and throw you off the planet .         she was waiting for the right political moment  when my status as councilman would not protect me .  you didn   t foresee that .         how could i .  you yourself did not .         had i known that she knew my views  i would have .     compor said with a sudden trace of insolence     that   s easy enough to say   in hindsight .         and what is it you want of me here .  now that you have a bit of hindsight  too .         to make up for all this .  to make up for the harm i unwittingly     unwittingly   did you .         goodness     said trevize dryly .     how kind of you .  but you haven   t answered my original question .  how did you come to be here .  how do you happen to be on the very planet i am on .      compor said     there   s no complicated answer necessary for that .  i followed you .         through hyperspace .  with my ship making jumps in series .     compor shook his head .     no mystery .  i have the same kind of a ship you do  with the same kind of computer .  you know i   ve always had this trick of being able to guess in which direction through hyperspace a ship would go .  it   s not usually a very good guess and i   m wrong two times out of three  but with the computer i   m much better .  and you hesitated quite a bit at the start and gave me a chance to evaluate the direction and speed in which you were going before entering hyperspace .  i fed the data   together with my own intuitive extrapolations   into the computer and it did the rest .         and you actually got to the city ahead of me .         yes .  you didn   t use gravitics and i did .  i guessed you would come to the capital city  so i went straight down  while you       compor made a short spiral motion with his finger as though it were a ship riding a directional beam .      you took a chance on a run in with sayshellian officialdom .         well       compor   s face broke into a smile that lent it an undeniable charm and trevize felt himself almost warming to him .  compor said     i   m not a coward at all times and in all things .      trevize steeled himself .     how did you happen to get a ship like mine .         in precisely the same way you got a ship like yours .  the old lady    mayor branno   assigned it to me .         why .         i   m being entirely frank with you .  my assignment was to follow you .  the mayor wanted to know where you were going and what you would be doing .         and you   ve been reporting faithfully to her  i suppose .     or have you been faithless to the mayor also .         i reported to her .  i had no choice  actually .  she placed a hyperrelay on board ship  which i wasn   t supposed to find  but which i did find .         well .         unfortunately it   s hooked up so that i can   t remove it without immobilizing the vessel .  at least  there   s no way i can remove it .  consequently she knows where i am   and she knows where you are .         suppose you hadn   t been able to follow me .  then she wouldn   t have known where i was .  had you thought of that .         of course i did .  i thought of just reporting i had lost you   but she wouldn   t have believed me  would she .  and i wouldn   t have been able to get back to terminus for who knows how long .  and i   m not like you  trevize .  i   m not a carefree person without attachments .  i have a wife on terminus   a pregnant wife   and i want to get back to her .  you can afford to think only of yourself .  i can   t .     besides  i   ve come to warn you .  by seldon  i   m trying to do that and you won   t listen .  you keep talking about other things .         i   m not impressed by your sudden concern for me .  what can you warn me against .  it seems to me that you are the only thing i need be warned about .  you betray me  and now you follow me in order to betray me again .  no one else is doing me any harm .      compor said earnestly     forget the dramatics  man .  trevize  you   re a lightning rod .  you   ve been sent out to draw second foundation response   if there is such a thing as the second foundation .  i have an intuitive sense for things other than hyperspatial pursuit and i   m sure that   s what she   s planning .  if you try to find the second foundation  they   ll become aware of it and they   ll act against you .  if they do  they are very likely to tip their hand .  and when they do  mayor branno will go for them .         a pity your famous intuition wasn   t working when branno was planning my arrest .      compor flushed and muttered     you know it doesn   t always work .         and now it tells you she   s planning to attack the second foundation .  she wouldn   t dare .         i think she would .  but that   s not the point .  the point is that right now she is throwing you out as bait .         so .         so by all the black holes in space  don   t search for the second foundation .  she won   t care if you   re killed in the search  but i care .  i feel responsible for this and i care .         i   m touched     said trevize coldly     but as it happens i have another task on hand at the moment .         you have .         pelorat and i are on the track of earth  the planet that some think was the original home of the human race .  aren   t we  janov .      pelorat nodded his head .     yes  it   s a purely scientific matter and a long standing interest of mine .      compor looked blank for a moment .  then     looking for earth .  but why .         to study it     said pelorat .     as the one world on which human beings developed   presumably from lower forms of life  instead of  as on all others  merely arriving ready made   it should be a fascinating study in uniqueness .         and     said trevize     as a world where  just possibly  i may learn more of the second foundation .     just possibly .      compor said     but there isn   t any earth .  didn   t you know that .         no earth .     pelorat looked utterly blank  as he always did when  he was preparing to be stubborn .     are you saying there was no planet on which the human species originated .         oh no .  of course  there was an earth .  there   s no question of that .  but there isn   t any earth now .  no inhabited earth .  it   s gone .      pelorat said  unmoved     there are tales           hold on  janov     said trevize .     tell me  compor  how do you know this .         what do you mean  how .  it   s my heritage .  i trace my ancestry from the sirius sector  if i may repeat that fact without boring you .  we know all about earth out there .  it exists in that sector  which means it   s not part of the foundation federation  so apparently no one on terminus bothers with it .  but that   s where earth is  just the same .         that is one suggestion  yes     said pelorat .     there was considerable enthusiasm for that    sirius alternative     as they called it  in the days of the empire .      compor said vehemently .     it   s not an alternative .  it   s a fact .      pelorat said     what would you say if i told you i know of many different places in the galaxy that are called earth   or were called earth   by the people who lived in its stellar neighborhood .         but this is the real thing     said compor .     the sirius sector is the longest inhabited portion of the galaxy .  everyone knows that .         the sirians claim it  certainly     said pelorat  unmoved .   compor looked frustrated .     i tell you        but trevize said     tell us what happened to earth .  you say it   s not inhabited any longer .  why not .         radioactivity .  the whole planetary surface is radioactive because of nuclear reactions that went out of control  or nuclear explosions    i   m not sure   and now no life is possible there .      the three stared at each other for a while and then compor felt it necessary to repeat .  he said     i tell you  there   s no earth .  there   s no use looking for it .      janov pelorat   s face was  for once  not expressionless .  it was not that there was passion in it   or any of the more unstable emotions .  it was that his eyes had narrowed   and that a kind of fierce intensity had filled every plane of his face .   he said  and his voice lacked any trace of its usual tentative quality     how did you say you know all this .         i told you     said compor .     it   s my heritage .         don   t be silly  young man .  you are a councilman .  that means you must be born on one of the federation worlds   smyrno  i think you said earlier .         that   s right .         well then  what heritage are you talking about .  are you telling me that you possess sirian genes that fill you with inborn knowledge of the sirian myths concerning earth .      compor looked taken aback .     no  of course not .         then what are you talking about .      compor paused and seemed to gather his thoughts .  he said quietly     my family has old books of sirian history .  an external heritage  not an internal one .  it   s not something we talk about outside  especially if one is intent on political advancement .  trevize seems to think i am  but  believe me  i mention it only to good friends .      there was a trace of bitterness in his voice .     theoretically all foundation citizens are alike  but those from the old worlds of the federation are more alike than those from the newer ones   and those that trace from worlds outside the federation are least alike of all .  but  never mind that .  aside from the books  i once visited the old worlds .  trevize   hey  there        trevize had wandered off toward one end of the room  looking out a triangular window .  it served to let in a view of the sky and to diminish the view of the city   more light and more privacy .  trevize stretched upward to look down .   he returned through the empty room .     interesting window design     he said .     you called me  councilman .         yes .  remember the postcollegiate tour i took .         after graduation .  i remember very well .  we were pals .  pals forever .  foundation of trust .  two against the world .  you went off on your tour .  i joined the navy  full of patriotism .  somehow i didn   t think i wanted to tour with you   some instinct told me not to .  i wish the instinct had stayed with me .      compor did not rise to the bait .  he said     i visited comporellon .  family tradition said that my ancestors had come from there   at least on my father   s side .  we were of the ruling family in ancient times before the empire absorbed us  and my name is derived from  the world   or so the family tradition has it .  we had an old  poetic name for the star comporellon circled   epsilon eridani .         what does that mean .     asked pelorat .   compor shook his head .     i don   t know that it has any meaning .  just tradition .  they live with a great deal of tradition .  it   s an old world .  they have long  detailed records of earth   s history  but no one talks about it much .  they   re superstitious about it .  every time they mention the word  they lift up both hands with first and second fingers crossed to ward off misfortune .         did you tell this to anyone when you came back .         of course not .  who would be interested .  and i wasn   t going to force the tale on anyone .  no  thank you .  i had a political career to develop and the last thing i want is to stress my foreign origin .         what about the satellite .  describe earth   s satellite     said pelorat sharply .   compor looked astonished .     i don   t know anything about that .         does it have one .         i don   t recall reading or hearing about it .  but i   m sure if you   ll consult the comporellonian records  you can find out .         but you know nothing .         not about the satellite .  not that i recall .         huh .  how did earth come to be radioactive .      compor shook his head and said nothing .   pelorat said     think .  you must have heard something .         it was seven years ago  professor .  i didn   t know then you   d be questioning me about it now .  there was some sort of legend   they considered it history           what was the legend .         earth was radioactive ostracized and mistreated by the empire  its population dwindling   and it was going to destroy the empire somehow .         one dying world was going to destroy the whole empire .     interposed trevize .   compor said defensively     i said it was a legend .  i don   t know the details .  bel arvardan was involved in the tale  i know .             who was he .     asked trevize .      a historical character .  i looked him up .  he was an honest to galaxy archaeologist back in the early days of the empire and he maintained that earth was in the sirius sector .         i   ve heard the name     said pelorat .      he   s a folk hero in comporellon .  look  if you want to know these things   go to comporellon .  it   s no use hanging around here .      pelorat said     just how did they say earth planned to destroy the empire .         don   t know .     a certain sullenness was entering compor   s voice .      did the radiation have anything to do with it .         don   t know .  there were tales of some mind expander developed on earth   a synapsifier or something .         did it create superminds .     said pelorat in deepest tones of incredulity .      i don   t think so .  what i chiefly remember is that it didn   t work .  people became bright and died young .      trevize said     it was probably a morality myth .  if you ask for too much  you lose even that which you have .      pelorat turned on trevize in annoyance .     what do you know of morality myths .      trevize raised his eyebrows .     your field may not be my field  janov  but that doesn   t mean i   m totally ignorant .         what else do you remember about what you call the synapsifier  councilman compor .     asked pelorat .      nothing  and i won   t submit to any further cross examination .  look  i followed you on orders from the mayor .  i was not ordered to make personal contact with you .  i have done so only to warn you that you were followed and to tell you that you had been sent out to serve the mayor   s purposes  whatever those might be .  there was nothing else i should have discussed with you  but you surprised me by suddenly bringing up the matter of earth .  well  let me repeat   whatever there has existed there in the past   bel arvardan  the synapsifier  whatever   that has nothing to do with what exists now .  i   ll tell you again  earth is a dead world .  i strongly advise you to go to comporellon  where you   ll find out everything you want to know .  just get away from here .         and  of course  you will dutifully tell the mayor that we   re going to comporellon   and you   ll follow us to make sure .  or maybe the mayor knows already .  i imagine she has carefully instructed and rehearsed you in every word you have spoken to us here because  for her own purposes  it   s in comporellon that she wants us .  right .      compor   s face paled .  he rose to his feet and almost stuttered in  his effort to control his voice .     i   ve tried to explain .  i   ve tried to be helpful .  i shouldn   t have tried .  you can drop yourself into a black hole  trevize .      he turned on his heel and walked away briskly without looking back .   pelorat seemed a bit stunned .     that was rather tactless of you  golan  old fellow .  i could have gotten more out of him .         no  you couldn   t     said trevize gravely .     you could not have gotten one thing out of him that he was not ready to let you have .  janov  you don   t know what he is    until today  i didn   t know what he is .      pelorat hesitated to disturb trevize .  trevize sat motionless in his chair  deep in thought .   finally pelorat said     are we just sitting here all night  golan .      trevize started .     no  you   re quite right .  we   ll be better off with people around us .  come .      pelorat rose .  he said     there won   t be people around us .  compor said this was some sort of meditation day .         is that what he said .  was there traffic when we came along the road in our ground car .         yes  some .         quite a bit  i thought .  and then  when we entered the city  was it empty .         not particularly .     still  you   ve got to admit that this place has been empty .         yes  it has .  i noticed that particularly .     but come  janov  i   m hungry .  there   s got to be someplace to eat and we can afford to find something good .  at any rate  we can find a place in which we can try some interesting sayshellian novelty or  if we lose our nerve  good standard galactic fare .     come  once we   re safely surrounded  i   ll tell you what i think really happened here .      trevize leaned back with a pleasant feeling of renewal .  the restaurant was not expensive by terminus standards  but it was certainly novel .  it was heated  in part  by an open fire over which food was prepared .  meat tended to be served in bite sized portions   in a variety of pungent sauces   which were picked up by fingers that were protected from grease and heat by smooth  green leaves that were cold  damp  and had a vaguely minty taste .   it was one leaf to each meat bit and the whole was taken into the mouth .  the waiter had carefully explained how it had to be done .  apparently accustomed to off planet guests  he had smiled paternally as trevize and pelorat gingerly scooped at the steaming bits of meat  and was clearly delighted at the foreigners    relief at finding that the leaves kept the fingers cool and cooled the meat  too  as one chewed .   trevize said     delicious .     and eventually ordered a second helping .  so did pelorat .   they sat over a spongy  vaguely sweet dessert and a cup of coffee that had a caramelized flavor at which they shook dubious heads .  they added syrup  at which the waiter shook his head .   pelorat said     well  what happened back there at the tourist center .         you mean with compor .         was there anything else there we might discuss .      trevize looked about .  they were in a deep alcove and had a certain limited privacy  but the restaurant was crowded and the natural hum of noise was a perfect cover .   he said in a low voice     isn   t it strange that he followed us to sayshell .         he said he had this intuitive ability .         yes  he was all collegiate champion at hypertracking .  i never questioned that till today .  i quite see that you might be able to judge where someone was going to jump by how he prepared for it if you had a certain developed skill at it  certain reflexes   but i don   t see how a tracker can judge a jump series .  you prepare only for the first one  the computer does all the others .  the tracker can judge that first one  but by what magic can he guess what   s in the computer   s vitals .         but he did it  golan .         he certainly did     said trevize     and the only possible way i can imagine him doing so is by knowing in advance where we were going to go .  by knowing  not judging .      pelorat considered that .     quite impossible  my boy .  how could he  know .  we didn   t decide on our destination till after we were on board the far star .         i know that .     and what about this day of meditation .         compor didn   t lie to us .  the waiter said it was a day of meditation when we came in here and asked him .         yes  he did  but he said the restaurant wasn   t closed .  in fact  what he said was     sayshell city isn   t the backwoods .  it doesn   t close down .     people meditate  in other words  but not in the big town  where everyone is sophisticated and there   s no place for small town piety .  so there   s traffic and it   s busy   perhaps not quite as busy as on ordinary days   but busy .         but  golan  no one came into the tourist center while we were there .  i was aware of that .  not one person entered .         i noticed that  too .  i even went to the window at one point and looked out and saw clearly that the streets around the center had a good scattering of people on foot and in vehicles   and yet not one person entered .  the day of meditation made a good cover .  we would not have questioned the fortunate privacy we had if i simply hadn   t made up my mind not to trust that son of two strangers .      pelorat said     what is the significance of all this  then .         i think it   s simple  janov .  we have here someone who knows where we   re going as soon as we do  even though he and we are in separate spaceships  and we also have here someone who can keep a public building empty when it is surrounded by people in order that we might talk in convenient privacy .         would you have me believe he can perform miracles .         certainly .  if it so happens that compor is an agent of the second foundation and can control minds  if he can read yours and mine in a distant spaceship  if he can influence his way through a customs station at once  if he can land gravitically  with no border patrol outraged at his defiance of the radio beams  and if he can influence minds in such a way as to keep people from entering a building he doesn   t want entered .      by all the stars     trevize went on with a marked air of grievance     i can even follow this back to graduation .  i didn   t go on the tour with him .  i remember not wanting to .  wasn   t that a matter of his influence .  he had to be alone .  where was he really going .      pelorat pushed away the dishes before him  as though he wanted to clear a space about himself in order to have room to think .  it seemed to be a gesture that signaled the busboy robot  a self moving table that stopped near them and waited while they placed their dishes and cutlery upon it .   when they were alone  pelorat said     but that   s mad .  nothing has happened that could not have happened naturally .  once you get it into your head that somebody is controlling events  you can interpret everything in that light and find no reasonable certainty anywhere .  come on  old fellow  it   s all circumstantial and a matter of interpretation .  don   t yield to paranoia .         i   m not going to yield to complacency  either .         well  let us look at this logically .  suppose he was an agent of the second foundation .  why would he run the risk of rousing our suspicions by keeping the tourist center empty .  what did he say that was so important that a few people at a distance   who would have been wrapped in their own concerns anyway   would have made a difference .         there   s an easy answer to that  janov .  he would have to keep our minds under close observation and he wanted no interference from other minds .  no static .  no chance of confusion .         again  just your interpretation .  what was so important about his conversation with us .  it would make sense to suppose  as he himself insisted  that he met us only in order to explain what he had done  to apologize for it  and to warn us of the trouble that might await us .  why would we have to look further than that .      the small card receptacle at the farther rim of the table glittered unobtrusively and the figures representing the cost of the meal flashed briefly .  trevize groped beneath his sash for his credit card which  with its foundation imprint  was good anywhere in the galaxy   or anywhere a foundation citizen was likely to go .  he inserted it in the appropriate slot .  it took a moment to complete the transaction and trevize  with native caution  checked on the remaining balance before returning it to its pocket .   he looked about casually to make sure there was no undesirable interest in him on the faces of any of the few who still sat in the restaurant and then said     why look further than that .  why look further .  that was not all he talked about .  he talked about earth .  he told us it was dead and urged us very strongly to go to comporellon .  shall we go .         it   s something i   ve been considering  golan     admitted pelorat .      just leave here .         we can come back after we check out the sirius sector .         it doesn   t occur to you that his whole purpose in seeing us was to deflect us from sayshell and get us out of here .  get us anywhere but here .         why .         i don   t know .  see here  they expected us to go to trantor .  that was what you wanted to do and maybe that   s what they counted on us doing .  i messed things up by insisting we go to sayshell  which is the last thing they wanted  and so now they have to get us out of here .      pelorat looked distinctly unhappy .     but golan  you are just making statements .  why don   t they want us on sayshell .         i don   t know  janov .  but it   s enough for me that they want us out .  i   m staying here .  i   m not going to leave .         but   but    look  golan  if the second foundation wanted us to leave  wouldn   t they just influence our minds to make us want to leave .  why bother reasoning with us .         now that you bring up the point  haven   t they done that in your case  professor .     and trevize   s eyes narrowed in sudden suspicion .     don   t you want to leave .      pelorat looked at trevize in surprise .     i just think there   s some sense to it .         of course you would  if you   ve been influenced .         but i haven   t been           of course you would swear you hadn   t been if you had been .      pelorat said     if you box me in this way  there is no way of disproving your bare assertion .  what are you going to do .         i will remain in sayshell .  and you   ll stay here  too .  you can   t navigate the ship without me  so if compor has influenced you  he has influenced the wrong one .         very well  golan .  we   ll stay in sayshell until we have independent reasons to leave .  the worst thing we can do  after all   worse than either staying or going   is to fall out with each other .  come  old chap  if i had been influenced  would i be able to change my mind and go along with you cheerfully  as i plan to do now .      trevize thought for a moment and then  as though with an inner shake  smiled and held out his hand .     agreed  janov .  now let   s get back to the ship and make another start tomorrow .     if we can think of one .      munn li compor did not remember when he had been recruited .  for one thing  he had been a child at the time  for another  the agents of the second foundation were meticulous in removing their traces as far as that was possible .   compor was an    observer    and  to a second foundationer  he was instantly recognizable as such .   it meant that compor was acquainted with mentalics and could converse with second foundationers in their own fashion to a degree  but he was in the lowest rank of the hierarchy .  he could catch glimpses of minds  but he could not adjust them .  the education he had received had never gone that far .  he was an observer  not a doer .   it made him second class at best  but he did not mind   much .  he knew his importance in the scheme of things .   during the early centuries of the second foundation  it had underestimated the task before it .  it had imagined that its handful of members could monitor the entire galaxy and that seldon   s plan  to be maintained  would require only the most occasional  the lightest touch  here and there .   the mule had stripped them of these delusions .  coming from nowhere  he had caught the second foundation  and  of course  the first   though that didn   t matter  utterly by surprise and had left them helpless .  it took five years before a counterattack could be organized  and then only at the cost of a number of lives .   with palver a full recovery was made  again at a distressing cost  and he finally took the appropriate measures .  the operations of the second foundation  he decided  must be enormously expanded without at the same time increasing the chances of detection unduly  so he instituted the corps of observers .   compor did not know how many observers were in the galaxy or even how many there were on terminus .  it was not his business to know .  ideally there should be no detectable connection between any two observers  so that the loss of one would not entail the loss of any other .  all connections were with the upper echelons on trantor .   it was compor   s ambition to go to trantor someday .  though he thought it extremely unlikely  he knew that occasionally an observer  might be brought to trantor and promoted  but that was rare .  the qualities that made for a good observer were not those that pointed toward the table .   there was gendibal  for instance  who was four years younger than compor .  he must have been recruited as a boy  just as compor was  but he had been taken directly to trantor and was now a speaker .  compor had no illusions as to why that should be .  he had been much in contact with gendibal of late and he had experienced the power of that young man   s mind .  he could not have stood up against it for a second .   compor was not often conscious of a lowly status .  there was almost never occasion to consider it .  after all  as in the case of other observers  he imagined  it was only lowly by the standards of trantor .  on their own non trantorian worlds  in their own nonmentalic societies  it was easy for observers to obtain high status .   compor  for instance  had never had trouble getting into good schools or finding good company .  he had been able to use his mentalics in a simple way to enhance his natural intuitive ability  that natural ability had been why he had been recruited in the first place  he was sure  and  in this way  to prove himself a star at hyperspatial pursuit .  he became a hero at college and this set his foot on the first rung of a political career .  once this present crisis was over  there was no telling how much farther he might advance .   if the crisis resolved itself successfully  as surely it would  would it not be recalled that it was compor who had first noted trevize    not as a human being  anyone could have done that  but as a mind .   he had encountered trevize in college and had seen him  at first  only as a jovial and quick witted companion .  one morning  however  he had stirred sluggishly out of slumber and  in the stream of consciousness that accompanied the never never land of half sleep  he felt what a pity it was that trevize had never been recruited .   trevize couldn   t have been recruited  of course  since he was terminus born and not  like compor  a native of another world .  and even with that aside  it was too late .  only the quite young are plastic enough to receive an education into mentalics  the painful introduction of that art   it was more than a science   into adult brains  set rustily in their mold  was a thing of the first two generations after seldon only .   but then  if trevize had been ineligible for recruiting in the first place and had outlived the possibility in the second  what had roused compor   s concern over the matter .   on their next meeting  compor had penetrated trevize   s mind deeply and discovered what it was that must have initially disturbed him .  trevize   s mind had characteristics that did not fit the rules he had been taught .  over and over  it eluded him .  as he followed its workings  he found gaps    no  they couldn   t be actual gaps   actual leaps of nonexistence .  they were places where trevize   s manner of mind dove too deeply to be followed .   compor had no way of determining what this meant  but he watched trevize   s behavior in the light of what he had discovered and he began to suspect that trevize had an uncanny ability to reach right conclusions from what would seem to be insufficient data .   did this have something to do with the gaps .  surely this was a matter for mentalism beyond his own powers   for the table itself  perhaps .  he had the uneasy feeling that trevize   s powers of decision were unknown  in their full  to the man himself  and that he might be able to    to do what .  compor   s knowledge did not suffice .  he could almost see the meaning of what trevize possessed   but not quite .  there was only the intuitive conclusion   or perhaps just a guess    that trevize might be  potentially  a person of the utmost importance .   he had to take the chance that this might be so and to risk seeming to be less than qualified for his post .  after all  if he were correct    he was not sure  looking back on it  how he had managed to find the courage to continue his efforts .  he could not penetrate the administrative barriers that ringed the table .  he had all but reconciled himself to a broken reputation .  he had worked himself down  despairingly  to the most junior member of the table and  finally  stor gendibal had responded to his call .   gendibal had listened patiently and from that time on there had been a special relationship between them .  it was on gendibal   s behalf that compor had maintained his relationship with trevize and on gendibal   s direction that he had carefully set up the situation that had resulted in trevize   s exile .  and it was through gendibal  that compor might yet  he was beginning to hope  achieve his dream of promotion to trantor .   all preparations  however  had been designed to send trevize to trantor .  trevize   s refusal to do this had taken compor entirely by surprise and  compor thought  had been unforeseen by gendibal as well .   at any rate  gendibal was hurrying to the spot  and to compor  that deepened the sense of crisis .   compor sent out his hypersignal .   gendibal was roused from his sleep by the touch on his mind .  it was effective and not in the least disturbing .  since it affected the arousal center directly  he simply awoke .   he sat up in bed  the sheet falling from his well shaped and smoothly muscular torso .  he had recognized the touch  the differences were as distinctive to mentalists as were voices to those who communicated primarily by sound .   gendibal sent out the standard signal  asking if a small delay were possible  and the    no emergency    call returned .   without undue haste  then  gendibal attended to the morning routine .  he was still in the ship   s shower   with the used water draining into the recycling mechanisms   when he made contact again .      compor .         yes  speaker .         have you spoken with trevize and the other one .         pelorat .  janov pelorat .  yes  speaker .         good .  give me another five minutes and i   ll arrange visuals .     he passed sura novi on his way to the controls .  she looked at him questioningly and made as though to speak  but he placed a finger on his lips and she subsided at once .  gendibal still felt a bit uncomfortable at the intensity of adoration respect in her mind  but it was coming to be a comfortingly normal part of his environment somehow .   he had hooked a small tendril of his mind to hers and there would now be no way to affect his mind without affecting hers .  the simplicity of her mind  and there was an enormous aesthetic plea   sure to be found in contemplating its unadorned symmetry  gendibal couldn   t help thinking  made it impossible for any extraneous mind field to exist in their neighborhood without detection .  he felt a surge of gratitude for the courteous impulse that had moved him that moment they had stood together outside the university  and that had led her to come to him precisely when she could be most useful .   he said     compor .         yes  speaker .         relax  please .  i must study your mind .  no offense is intended .         as you wish  speaker .  may i ask the purpose .         to make certain you are untouched .      compor said     i know you have political adversaries at the table  speaker  but surely none of them           do not speculate  compor .  relax .     yes  you are untouched .  now  if you will co operate with me  we will establish visual contact .      what followed was  in the ordinary sense of the word  an illusion  since no one but someone who was aided by the mentalic power of a well trained second foundationer would have been able to detect anything at all  either by the senses or by any physical detecting device .   it was the building up of a  face and its appearance from the contours of a mind  and even the best mentalist could succeed in producing only a shadowy and somewhat uncertain figure .  compor   s face was there in mid space  as though it were seen through a thin but shifting curtain of gauze  and gendibal knew that his own face appeared in an identical manner in front of compor .   by physical hyperwave  communication could have been established through images so clear that speakers who were a thousand parsecs apart might judge themselves to be face to face .  gendibal   s ship was equipped for the purpose .   there were  however  advantages to the mentalist vision .  the chief was that it could not be tapped by any device known to the first foundation .  nor  for that matter  could one second foundationer tap the mentalist vision of another .  the play of mind might be followed  but not the delicate change of facial expression that gave the communication its finer points .   as for the anti mules    well  the purity of novi   s mind was sufficient to assure him that none were about .   he said     tell me precisely  compor  the talk you had with trevize and with this pelorat .  precisely  to the level of mind .         of course  speaker     said compor .   it didn   t take long .  the combination of sound  expression  and mentalism compressed matters considerably  despite the fact that there was far more to tell at the level of mind than if there had been a mere parroting of speech .   gendibal watched intently .  there was little redundancy  if any  in mentalist vision .  in true vision  or even in physical hypervision across the parsecs  one saw enormously more in the way of information bits than was absolutely necessary for comprehension and one could miss a great deal without losing anything significant .   through the gauze of mentalist vision  however  one bought absolute security at the price of losing the luxury of being able to miss bits .  every bit was significant .   there were always horror tales that passed from instructor to student on trantor  tales that were designed to impress on the young the importance of concentration .  the most often repeated was certainly the least reliable .  it told of the first report on the progress of the mule before he had taken over kalgan   of the minor official who received the report and who had no more than the impression of a horselike animal because he did not see or understand the small flick that signified    personal name .     the official therefore decided that the whole thing was too unimportant to pass on to trantor .  by the time the next message came  it was too late to take immediate action and five more bitter years had to pass .   the event had almost certainly never happened  but that didn   t matter .  it was a dramatic story and it served to motivate every student into the habit of intent concentration .  gendibal remembered his own student days when he made an error in reception that seemed  in his own mind  to be both insignificant and understandable .  his teacher   old kendast  a tyrant to the roots of his cerebellum   had simply sneered and said     a horselike animal  cub gendibal .     and that had been enough to make him collapse in shame .   compor finished .   gendibal said     your estimate  please  of trevize   s reaction .  you know him better than i do  better than anyone does .      compor said     it was clear enough .  the mentalic indications were unmistakable .  he thinks my words and actions represent my extreme anxiety to have him go to trantor or to the sirius sector or to any place but where  in fact  he is actually going .  it meant  in my opinion  that he would remain firmly where he was .  the fact that i attached great importance to his shifting his position  in short  forced him to give it the same importance  and since he feels his own interests to be diametrically opposed to mine  he will deliberately act against what he interprets to be my wish .         you are certain of that .         quite certain .      gendibal considered this and decided that compor was correct .  he said     i am satisfied .  you have done well .  your tale of earth   s radioactive destruction was cleverly chosen to help produce the proper reaction without the need for direct manipulation of the mind .  commendable .      compor seemed to struggle with himself a short moment .     speaker     he said     i cannot accept your praise .  i did not invent the tale .  it is true .  there really is a planet called earth in the sirius sector and it really is considered to be the original home of humanity .  it was radioactive  either to begin with or eventually  and this grew worse till the planet died .  there was indeed a mind enhancing invention that came to nothing .  all this is considered history on the home planet of my ancestors .         so .  interesting .     said gendibal with no obvious conviction .     and better yet .  to know when a truth will do is admirable  since no nontruth can be presented with the same sincerity .  palver once said     the closer to the truth  the better the lie  and the truth itself  when it can be used  is the best lie .      compor said     there is one thing more to say .  in following instructions to keep trevize in the sayshell sector until you arrived    and to do so at all costs   i had to go so far in my efforts that it is clear that he suspects me of being under the influence of the second foundation .      gendibal nodded .     that  i think  is unavoidable under the circumstances .  his monomania on the subject would be sufficient to have him see second foundation even where it was not .  we must simply take that into account .         speaker  if it is absolutely necessary that trevize stay where he is until you can reach him  it would simplify matters if i came to meet you  took you aboard my ship  and brought you back .  it would take less than a day           no  observer     said gendibal sharply .     you will not do this .  the people on terminus know where you are .  you have a hyper relay on your ship which you cannot remove  have you not .         yes  speaker .         and if terminus knows you have landed on sayshell  their ambassador on sayshell knows of it   and the ambassador knows also that trevize has landed .  your hyper relay will tell terminus that you have left for a specific point hundreds of parsecs away and returned  and the ambassador will inform them that trevize has  however  remained in the sector .  from this  how much will the people at terminus guess .  the mayor of terminus is  by all accounts  a shrewd woman and the last thing we want to do is to alarm her by presenting her with an obscure puzzle .  we don   t want her to lead a section of her fleet here .  the chances of that are  in any case  uncomfortably high .      compor said     with respect  speaker    what reason do we have to fear a fleet if we can control a commander .         however little reason there might be  there is still less reason to fear if the fleet is not here .  you stay where you are  observer .     when i reach you  i will join you on your ship and then           and then  speaker .         why  and then i will take over .      gendibal sat in place after he dismantled the mentalist vision    and stayed there for long minutes   considering .   during this long trip to sayshell  unavoidably long in this ship of his which could in no way match the technological advancement of the products of the first foundation  he had gone over every single report on trevize .  the reports had stretched over nearly a decade .   seen as a whole and in the light of recent events  there was no longer any doubt trevize would have been a marvelous recruit for the second foundation  if the policy of never touching the terminus born had not been in place since palver   s time .   there was no telling how many recruits of highest quality had been lost to the second foundation over the centuries .  there was no way of evaluating every one of the quadrillions of human beings populating the galaxy .  none of them was likely to have had more promise than trevize  however  and certainly none could have been in a more sensitive spot .   gendibal shook his head slightly .  trevize should never have been overlooked  terminus born or not .     and credit to observer compor for seeing it  even after the years had distorted him .   trevize was of no use to them now  of course .  he was too old for the molding  but he still had that inborn intuition  that ability to guess a solution on the basis of totally inadequate information  and something   something    old shandess   who  despite being past his prime  was first speaker and had  on the whole  been a good one   saw something there  even without the correlated data and the reasoning that gendibal had worked out in the course of this trip .  trevize  shandess had thought  was the key to the crisis .      why was trevize here at sayshell .     what was he planning .  what was he doing .   and he couldn   t be touched .  of that gendibal was sure .  until it was known precisely what trevize   s role was  it would be totally wrong to try to modify him in any way .  with the anti mules    whoever they were   whatever they might be   in the field  a wrong move with respect to trevize  trevize  above all  might explode a wholly unexpected micro sun in their faces .   he felt a mind hovering about his own and absently brushed at it as he might at one of the more annoying trantorian insects    though with mind rather than hand .  he felt the instant wash of other pain and looked up .   sura novi had her palm to her furrowed brow .     your pardon  master  i be struck with sudden head anguish .      gendibal was instantly contrite .     i   m sorry  novi .  i wasn   t thinking or i was thinking too intently .     instantly   and gently   he smoothed the ruffled mind tendrils .   novi smiled with sudden brightness .     it passed with sudden vanishing .  the kind sound of your words  master  works well upon me .      gendibal said     coed .  is something wrong .  why are you here .     he forbore to enter her mind in greater detail in order to find out for himself .  more and more  he felt a reluctance to invade her privacy .   novi hesitated .  she leaned toward him slightly .     i be concerned .  you were looking at nothing and making sounds and your face was  twitching .  i stayed there  stick frozen  afeared you were declining    ill   and unknowing what to do .         it was nothing  novi .  you are not to fear .     he patted her nearer hand .     there is nothing to fear .  do you understand .      fear   or any strong emotion   twisted and spoiled the symmetry of her mind somewhat .  he preferred it calm and peaceful and happy  but he hesitated at the thought of adjusting it into that position by outer influence .  she had felt the previous adjustment to be the effect of his words and it seemed to him that he preferred it that way .   he said     novi  why don   t i call you sura .      she looked up at him in sudden woe .     oh  master  do not do so .         but rufirant did so on that day that we met .  i know you well enough now           i know well he did so  master .  it be how a man speak to girl who have no man  no betrothed  who is   not complete .  you say her previous .  it is more honorable for me if you say    novi    and i be proud that you say so .  and if i have not man now  i have master and i be pleased .  i hope it be not offensive to you to say    novi .         it certainly isn   t  novi .      and her mind was beautifully smooth at that and gendibal was pleased .  too pleased .  ought he to be so pleased .   a little shamefacedly  he remembered that the mule was supposed to have been affected in this manner by that woman of the first foundation  bayta darell  to his own undoing .   this  of course  was different .  this hamishwoman was his defense against alien minds and he wanted her to serve that purpose most efficiently .   no  that was not true    his function as a speaker would be compromised if he ceased to understand his own mind or  worse  if he deliberately misconstrued it to avoid the truth .  the truth was that it pleased him when she was calm and peaceful and happy endogenously   without his interference   and that it pleased him simply because she pleased him  and  he thought defiantly  there was nothing wrong with that .   he said     sit down  novi .      she did so  balancing herself precariously at the edge of the chair and sitting as far away as the confines of the room allowed .  her mind was flooded with respect .   he said     when you saw me making sounds  novi  i was speaking at a long distance  scholar fashion .      novi said sadly  her eyes cast down     i see  master  that there be much to scowler fashion i understand not and imagine not .  it be difficult mountain high art .  i be ashamed to have come to you to be made scowler .  how is it  master  you did not be laugh me .      gendibal said     it is no shame to aspire to something even if it is beyond your reach .  you are now too old to be made a scholar after my fashion  but you are never too old to learn more than you already know and to become able to do more than you already can .  i will teach you something about this ship .  by the time we reach our destination  you will know quite a bit about it .      he felt delighted .  why not .  he was deliberately turning his back on the stereotype of the hamish people .  what right  in any case  had the heterogeneous group of the second foundation to set up such a stereotype .  the young produced by them were only occasionally suited to become high level second foundationers themselves .  the children of speakers almost never qualified to be speakers .  there were the three generations of linguesters three centuries ago  but there was always the suspicion that the middle speaker of that series did not really belong .  and if that were true  who were the people of the university to place themselves on so high a pedestal .   he watched novi   s eyes glisten and was pleased that they did .   she said     i try hard to learn all you teach me  master .         i   m sure you will     he said   and then hesitated .  it occurred to him that  in his conversation with compor  he had in no way indicated at any time that he was not alone .  there was no hint of a companion .   a woman could be taken for granted  perhaps  at least  compor would no doubt not be surprised .     but a hamishwoman .   for a moment  despite anything gendibal could do  the stereotype reigned supreme and he found himself glad that compor had never been on trantor and would not recognize novi as a hamishwoman .   he shook it off .  it didn   t matter if compor knew or knew not or if anyone did .  gendibal was a speaker of the second foundation and he could do as he pleased within the constraints of the seldon plan   and no one could interfere .   novi said     master  once we reach our destination  will we part .      he looked at her and said  with perhaps more force than he intended     we will not be separated  novi .      and the hamishwoman smiled shyly and looked for all the galaxy as though she might have been   any woman .     chapter thirteen  university    pelorat wrinkled his nose when he and trevize re entered the far star .   trevize shrugged .     the human body is a powerful dispenser of odors .  recycling never works instantaneously and artificial scents merely overlay   they do not replace .         and i suppose no two ships smell quite alike  once they   ve been occupied for a period of time by different people .         that   s right  but did you smell sayshell planet after the first hour .         no     admitted pelorat .      well  you won   t smell this after a while  either .  in fact  if you live in the ship long enough  you   ll welcome the odor that greets you on your return as signifying home .  and by the way  if you become a galactic rover after this  janov  you   ll have to learn that it is impolite to comment on the odor of any ship or  for that matter  any world to those who live on that ship or world .  between us  of course  it is all right .         as a matter of fact  golan  the funny thing is i do consider the far star home .  at least it   s foundation made .     pelorat smiled .     you know  i never considered myself a patriot .  i like to think i recognize only humanity as my nation  but i must say that being away from the foundation fills my heart with love for it .      trevize was making his bed .     you   re not very far from the foundation  you know .  the sayshell union is almost surrounded by federation territory .  we have an ambassador and an enormous presence here  from consuls on down .  the sayshellians like to oppose us in words  but they are usually very cautious about doing anything that gives us displeasure .     janov  do turn in .  we got nowhere today and we have to do better tomorrow .      still  there was no difficulty in hearing between the two rooms  however  and when the ship was dark  pelorat  tossing restlessly  finally said in a not very loud voice     golan .         yes .         you   re not sleeping .         not while you   re talking .         we did get somewhere today .  your friend  compor           ex friend     growled trevize .      whatever his status  he talked about earth and told us something i hadn   t come across in my researches before .  radioactivity .      trevize lifted himself to one elbow .     look  golan  if earth is really dead  that doesn   t mean we return home .  i still want to find gaia .      pelorat made a puffing noise with his mouth as though he were blowing away feathers .     my dear chap  of course .  so do i .  nor do i think earth is dead .  compor may have been telling what he felt was the truth  but there   s scarcely a sector in the galaxy that doesn   t have some tale or other that would place the origin of humanity on some local world .  and they almost invariably call it earth or some closely equivalent name .      we call it    globocentrism    in anthropology .  people have a tendency to take it for granted that they are better than their neighbors  that their culture is older and superior to that of other worlds  that what is good in other worlds has been borrowed from them  while what is bad is distorted or perverted in the borrowing or invented elsewhere .  and the tendency is to equate superiority in quality with superiority in duration .  if they cannot reasonably maintain their own planet to be earth or its equivalent   and the beginnings of the human species   they almost always do the best they can by placing earth in their own sector  even when they cannot locate it exactly .      trevize said     and you   re telling me that compor was just following the common habit when he said earth existed in the sirius sector .     still  the sirius sector does have a long history  so every world in it should be well known and it should be easy to check the matter  even without going there .      pelorat chuckled .     even if you were to show that no world in the sirius sector could possibly be earth  that wouldn   t help .  you underestimate the depths to which mysticism can bury rationality  golan .  there are at least half a dozen sectors in the galaxy where respectable scholars repeat  with every appearance of solemnity and with no trace of a smile  local tales that earth   or whatever they choose to call it   is located in hyperspace and cannot be reached  except by accident .         and do they say anyone has ever reached it by accident .         there are always tales and there is always a patriotic refusal to disbelieve  even though the tales are never in the least credible and are never believed by anyone not of the world that produces them .         then  janov  let   s not believe them ourselves .  let   s enter our own private hyperspace of sleep .         but  golan  it   s this business of earth   s radioactivity that interests me .  to me  that seems to bear the mark of truth   or a kind of truth .         what do you mean  a kind of truth .         well  a world that is radioactive would be a world in which hard radiation would be present in higher concentration than is usual .  the rate of mutation would be higher on such a world and evolution would proceed more quickly   and more diversely .  i told you  if you remember  that among the points on which almost all the tales agree is that life on earth was incredibly diverse  millions of species of all kinds of life .  it is this diversity of life   this explosive development   that might have brought intelligence to the earth  and then the surge outward into the galaxy .  if earth were for some reason radioactive   that is  more radioactive than other planets   that might account for everything else about earth that is   or was    unique .      trevize was silent for a moment .  then     in the first place  we have no reason to believe compor was telling the truth .  he may well have been lying freely in order to induce us to leave this place and go chasing madly off to sirius .  i believe that   s exactly what he was doing .  and even if he were telling the truth  what he said was that there was so much radioactivity that life became impossible .      pelorat made the blowing gesture again .     there wasn   t too much radioactivity to allow life to develop on earth and it is easier for life to maintain itself   once established   than to develop in the first place .  granted  then  that life was established and maintained on earth .  therefore the level of radioactivity could not have been incompatible with life to begin with and it could only have fallen off with time .  there is nothing that can raise the level .         nuclear explosions .     suggested trevize .      what would that have to do with it .         i mean  suppose nuclear explosions took place on earth .         on earth   s surface .  impossible .  there   s no record in the history of the galaxy of any society being so foolish as to use nuclear explosions as a weapon of war .  we would never have survived .  during the trigellian insurrections  when both sides were reduced to starvation and desperation and when jendippurus khoratt suggested the initiation of a fusion reaction in           he was hanged by the sailors of his own fleet .  i know galactic history .  i was thinking of accident .         there   s no record of accidents of that sort that are capable of significantly raising the intensity of radioactivity of a planet  generally .     he sighed .     i suppose that when we get around to it  we   ll have to go to the sirius sector and do a little prospecting there .         someday  perhaps  we will .  but for now           yes  yes  i   ll stop talking .      he did and trevize lay in the dark for nearly an hour considering whether he had attracted too much attention already and whether it might not be wise to go to the sirius sector and then return to gaia when attention   everyone   s attention   was elsewhere .   he had arrived at no clear decision by the time he fell asleep .  his dreams were troubled .   they did not arrive back in the city till midmorning .  the tourist center was quite crowded this time  but they managed to obtain the necessary directions to a reference library  where in turn they received instruction in the use of the local models of data gathering computers .   they went carefully through the museums and universities  beginning with those that were nearest  and checked out whatever information was available on anthropologists  archaeologists  and ancient historians .   pelorat said     ah .         ah .     said trevize with some asperity .     ah  what .         this name  quintesetz .  it seems familiar .         you know him .         no  of course not  but i may have read papers of his .  back at the ship  where i have my reference collection           we   re not going back  janov .  if the name is familiar  that   s a starting point .  if he can   t help us  he will undoubtedly be able to direct us further .     he rose to his feet .     let   s find a way of getting to sayshell university .  and since there will be nobody there at lunchtime  let   s eat first .      it was not till late afternoon that they had made their way out to the university  worked their way through its maze  and found themselves in an anteroom  waiting for a young woman who had gone off in search of information and who might   or might not   lead them to quintesetz .      i wonder     said pelorat uneasily     how much longer we   ll have to wait .  it must be getting toward the close of the schoolday .      and  as though that were a cue  the young lady whom they had last seen half an hour before  walked rapidly toward them  her shoes glinting red and violet and striking the ground with a sharp musical tone as she walked .  the pitch varied with the speed and force of her steps .   pelorat winced .  he supposed that each world had its own ways of assaulting the senses  just as each had its own smell .  he wondered if  now that he no longer noticed the smell  he might also learn not to notice the cacophony of fashionable young women when they walked .   she came to pelorat and stopped .     may i have your full name  professor .         it   s janov pelorat  miss .         your home planet .      trevize began to lift one hand as though to enjoin silence  but pelorat  either not seeing or not regarding  said     terminus .      the young woman smiled broadly  and looked pleased .     when i told professor quintesetz that a professor pelorat was inquiring for him  he said he would see you if you were janov pelorat of terminus  but not otherwise .      pelorat blinked rapidly .     you   you mean  he   s heard of me .         it certainly seems so .      and  almost creakily  pelorat managed a smile as he turned to trevize .     he   s heard of me .  i honestly didn   t think    i mean  i   ve written very few papers and i didn   t think that anyone       he shook his head .     they weren   t really important .         well then     said trevize  smiling himself     stop hugging yourself in an ecstasy of self underestimation and let   s go .     he turned to the woman .     i presume  miss  there   s some sort of transportation to take us to him .         it   s within walking distance .  we won   t even have to leave the building complex and i   ll be glad to take you there .     are both of you from terminus .     and off she went .   the two men followed and trevize said  with a trace of annoyance     yes  we are .  does that make a difference .         oh no  of course not .  there are people on sayshell that don   t like foundationers  you know  but here at the university  we   re more cosmopolitan than that .  live and let live is what i always say .  i mean  foundationers are people  too .  you know what i mean .         yes  i know what you mean .  lots of us say that sayshellians are people .         that   s just the way it should be .  i   ve never seen terminus .  it must be a big city .         actually it isn   t     said trevize matter of factly .     i suspect it   s smaller than sayshell city .         you   re tweaking my finger     she said .     it   s the capital of the foundation federation  isn   t it .  i mean  there isn   t another terminus  is there .         no  there   s only one terminus  as far as i know  and that   s where we   re from   the capital of the foundation federation .         well then  it must be an enormous city .     and you   re coming all the way here to see the professor .  we   re very proud of him  you know .  he   s considered the biggest authority in the whole galaxy .         really .     said trevize .     on what .      her eyes opened wide again     you are a teaser .  he knows more about ancient history than   than i know about my own family .     and she continued to walk on ahead on her musical feet .   one can only be called a teaser and a finger tweaker so often without developing an actual impulse in that direction .  trevize smiled and said     the professor knows all about earth  i suppose .         earth .     she stopped at an office door and looked at them blankly .      you know .  the world where humanity got its start .         oh  you mean the planet that was first .  i guess so .  i guess he should know all about it .  after all  it   s located in the sayshell sector .  everyone knows that .     this is his office .  let me signal him .         no  don   t     said trevize .     not for just a minute .  tell me about earth .         actually i never heard anyone call it earth .  i suppose that   s a foundation word .  we call it gaia  here .      trevize cast a swift look at pelorat .     oh .  and where is it located .         nowhere .  it   s in hyperspace and there   s no way anyone can get to it .  when i was a little girl  my grandmother said that gaia was once in real space  but it was so disgusted at the           crimes and stupidities of human beings     muttered pelorat     that  out of shame  it left space and refused to have anything more to do with the human beings it had sent out into the galaxy .         you know the story  then .  see .     a girlfriend of mine says it   s superstition .  well  i   ll tell her .  if it   s good enough for professors from the foundation        a glittering section of lettering on the smoky glass of the door read  sotayn quintesetz abt in the hard to read sayshellian calligraphy   and under it was printed  in the same fashion  department of ancient history .   the woman placed her finger on a smooth metal circle .  there was no sound  but the smokiness of the glass turned a milky white for a moment and a soft voice said  in an abstracted sort of way     identify yourself  please .         janov pelorat of terminus     said pelorat     with golan trevize of the same world .     the door swung open at once .   the man who stood up  walked around his desk  and advanced to meet them was tall and well into middle age .  he was light brown in skin color and his hair  which was set in crisp curls over his head  was iron gray .  he held out his hand in greeting and his voice was soft and low .     i am s . q .  i am delighted to meet you  professors .      trevize said     i don   t own an academic title .  i merely accompany professor pelorat .  you may call me simply trevize .  i am pleased to meet you  professor abt .      quintesetz held up one hand in clear embarrassment .     no no .  abt is merely a foolish title of some sort that has no significance outside of sayshell .  ignore it  please  and call me s . q .  we tend to use initials in ordinary social intercourse on sayshell .  i   m so pleased to meet two of you when i had been expecting but one .      he seemed to hesitate a moment  then extended his right hand after wiping it unobtrusively on his trousers .   trevize took it  wondering what the proper sayshellian manner of greeting was .   quintesetz said     please sit down .  i   m afraid you   ll find these chairs to be lifeless ones  but i  for one  don   t want my chairs to hug me .  it   s all the fashion for chairs to hug you nowadays  but i prefer a hug to mean something  hey .      trevize smiled and said     who would not .  your name  sq .   seems to be of the rim worlds and not sayshellian .  i apologize if the remark is impertinent .         i don   t mind .  my family traces back  in part  to askone .  five generations back  my great great grandparents left askone when foundation domination grew too heavy .      pelorat said     and we are foundationers .  our apologies .      quintesetz waved his hand genially     i don   t hold a grudge across a stretch of five generations .  not that such things haven   t been done  more   s the pity .  would you like to have something to eat .  to drink .  would you like music in the background .         if you don   t mind     said pelorat     i   d be willing to get right to business  if sayshellian ways would permit .         sayshellian ways are not a barrier to that  i assure you .     you have no idea how remarkable this is  dr .  pelorat .  it was only about two weeks ago that i came across your article on origin myths in the archaeological review and it struck me as a remarkable synthesis    all too brief .      pelorat flushed with pleasure .     how delighted i am that you have read it .  i had to condense it  of course  since the review would not print a full study .  i have been planning to do a treatise on the subject .         i wish you would .  in any case  as soon as i had read it  i had this desire to see you .  i even had the notion of visiting terminus in order to do so  though that would have been hard to arrange           why so .     asked trevize .   quintesetz looked embarrassed .     i   m sorry to say that sayshell is not eager to join the foundation federation and rather discourages any social communication with the foundation .  we   ve a tradition of neutralism  you see .  even the mule didn   t bother us  except to extort from us a specific statement of neutrality .  for that reason  any application for permission to visit foundation territory generally    and particularly terminus   is viewed with suspicion  although a scholar such as myself  intent on academic business  would probably obtain his passport in the end .     but none of that was necessary  you have come to me .  i can scarcely believe it .  i ask myself  why .  have you heard of me  as i have heard of you .      pelorat said     i know your work  s . q .   and in my records i have abstracts of your papers .  it is why i have come to you .  i am exploring both the matter of earth  which is the reputed planet of origin of the human species  and the early period of the exploration and settlement of the galaxy .  in particular  i have come here to inquire as to the founding of sayshell .         from your paper     said quintesetz     i presume you are interested in myths and legends .         even more in history   actual facts   if such exist .  myths and legends  otherwise .      quintesetz rose and walked rapidly back and forth the length of his office  paused to stare at pelorat  then walked again .   trevize said impatiently     well  sir .      quintesetz said     odd .  really odd .  it was only yesterday        pelorat said     what was only yesterday .      quintesetz said     i told you  dr .  pelorat   may i call you j . p .   by the way .  i find using a full length name rather unnatural        please do .         i told you  j . p .   that i had admired your paper and that i had wanted to see you .  the reason i wanted to see you was that you clearly had an extensive collection of legends concerning the beginnings of the worlds and yet didn   t have ours .  in other words  i wanted to see you in order to tell you precisely what you have come to see me to find out .         what has this to do with yesterday  s . q .  .     asked trevize .      we have legends .  a legend .  an important one to our society  for it has become our central mystery           mystery .     said trevize .      i don   t mean a puzzle or anything of that sort .  that  i believe  would be the usual meaning of the word in galactic standard .  there   s a specialized meaning here .  it means    something secret     something only certain adepts know the full meaning of  something not to be spoken of to outsiders .     and yesterday was the day .         the day of what  s . q .  .     asked trevize  slightly exaggerating his air of patience .      yesterday was the day of flight .         ah     said trevize     a day of meditation and quiet  when everyone is supposed to remain at home .         something like that  in theory  except that in the larger cities  the more sophisticated regions  there is little observance in the older fashion .     but you know about it  i see .      pelorat  who had grown uneasy at trevize   s annoyed tone  put in hastily     we heard a little of it  having arrived yesterday .         of all days     said trevize sarcastically .     see here  s . q .  as i said  i   m not an academic  but i have a question .  you said you were speaking of a central mystery  meaning it was not to be spoken of to outsiders .  why  then  are you speaking of it to us .  we are outsiders .         so you are .  but i   m not an observer of the day and the depth of my superstition in this matter is slight at best .  j . p .    s paper  however  reinforced a feeling i have had for a long time .  a myth or legend is simply not made up out of a vacuum .  nothing is or can be .  somehow there is a kernel of truth behind it  however distorted that might be  and i would like the truth behind our legend of the day of flight .      trevize said     is it safe to talk about it .      quintesetz shrugged .     not entirely  i suppose .  the conservative elements among our population would be horrified .  however  they don   t control the government and haven   t for a century .  the secularists are strong and would be stronger still  if the conservatives didn   t take advantage of our   if you   ll excuse me   anti foundation bias .  then  too  since i am discussing the matter out of my scholarly interest in ancient history  the league of academicians will support me strongly  in case of need .         in that case     said pelorat     would you tell us about your central mystery  sq .  .         yes  but let me make sure we won   t be interrupted or  for that matter  overheard .  even if one must stare the bull in the face  one needn   t slap its muzzle  as the saying goes .      he flicked a pattern on the work face of an instrument on his desk and said     we   re incommunicado now .         are you sure you   re not bugged .     asked trevize .      bugged .         tapped .  eavesdropped .     subjected to a device that will have you under observation   visual or auditory or both .      quintesetz looked shocked .     not here on sayshell .      trevize shrugged .     if you say so .         please go on  sq .      said pelorat .   quintesetz pursed his lips  leaned back in his chair  which gave slightly under the pressure  and put the tips of his fingers together .  he seemed to be speculating as to just how to begin .   he said     do you know what a robot is .         a robot .     said pelorat .     no .      quintesetz looked in the direction of trevize  who shook his head slowly .      you know what a computer is  however .         of course     said trevize impatiently .      well then  a mobile computerized tool           is a mobile computerized tool .     trevize was still impatient .     there are endless varieties and i don   t know of any generalized term for it except mobile computerized tool .            that looks exactly like a human being is a robot .     s . q .  completed his definition with equanimity .     the distinction of a robot is that it is humaniform .         why humaniform .     asked pelorat in honest amazement .     i   m not sure .  it   s a remarkably inefficient form for a tool  i grant you  but i   m just repeating the legend .     robot    is an old word from no recognizable language  though our scholars say it bears the connotation of    work .         i can   t think of any word     said trevize skeptically     that sounds even vaguely like    robot    and that has any connection with    work .         nothing in galactic  certainly     said quintesetz     but that   s what they say .      pelorat said     it may have been reverse etymology .  these objects were used for work  and so the word was said to mean    work .        in any case  why do you tell us this .         because it is a firmly fixed tradition here on sayshell that when earth was a single world and the galaxy lay all uninhabited before it  robots were invented and devised .  there were then two sorts of human beings  natural and invented  flesh and metal  biological and mechanical  complex and simple        quintesetz came to a halt and said with a rueful laugh     i   m sorry .  it is impossible to talk about robots without quoting from the book of flight .  the people of earth devised robots   and i need say no more .  that   s plain enough .         and why did they devise robots .     asked trevize .   quintesetz shrugged .     who can tell at this distance in time .  perhaps they were few in numbers and needed help  particularly in the great task of exploring and populating the galaxy .      trevize said     that   s a reasonable suggestion .  once the galaxy was colonized  the robots would no longer be needed .  certainly there are no humanoid mobile computerized tools in the galaxy today .         in any case     said quintesetz     the story is as follows   if i may vastly simplify and leave out many poetic ornamentations which  frankly  i don   t accept  though the general population does or pretends to .  around earth  there grew up colony worlds circling neighboring stars and these colony worlds were far richer in robots than was earth itself .  there was more use for robots on raw  new worlds .  earth  in fact  retreated  wished no more robots  and rebelled against them .         what happened .     asked pelorat .      the outer worlds were the stronger .  with the help of their robots  the children defeated and controlled earth   the mother .  pardon me  but i can   t help slipping into quotation .  but there were those from earth who fled their world   with better ships and stronger modes of hyperspatial travel .  they fled to far distant stars and worlds  far beyond the closer worlds earlier colonized .  new colonies were founded   without robots   in which human beings could live freely .  those were the times of flight  so called  and the day upon which the first earthmen reached the sayshell sector    this very planet  in fact   is the day of flight  celebrated annually for many thousands of years .      pelorat said     my dear chap  what you are saying  then  is that sayshell was founded directly from earth .      quintesetz thought and hesitated for a moment .  then he said     that is the official belief .         obviously     said trevize     you don   t accept it .         it seems to me       quintesetz began and then burst out     oh  great stars and small planets  i don   t .  it is entirely too unlikely  but it   s official dogma and however secularized the government has become  lip service to that  at least  is essential .     still  to the point .  in your article  j . p .   there is no indication that you   re aware of this story   of robots and of two waves of colonization  a lesser one with robots and a greater one without .         i certainly was not     said pelorat .     i hear it now for the first time and  my dear sq .   i am eternally grateful to you for making this known to me .  i am astonished that no hint of this has appeared in any of the writings           it shows     said quintesetz     how effective our social system is .  it   s our sayshellian secret   our great mystery .         perhaps     said trevize dryly .     yet the second wave of colonization   the robotless wave   must have moved out in all directions .  why is it only on sayshell that this great secret exists .      quintesetz said     it may exist elsewhere and be just as secret .  our own conservatives believe that only sayshell was settled from earth and that all the rest of the galaxy was settled from sayshell .  that  of course  is probably nonsense .      pelorat said     these subsidiary puzzles can be worked out in time .  now that i have the starting point  i can seek out similar information on other worlds .  what counts is that i have discovered the question to ask and a good question is  of course  the key by which infinite answers can be educed .  how fortunate that i        trevize said     yes  janov  but the good sq .  has not told us the whole story  surely .  what happened to the older colonies and their robots .  do your traditions say .         not in detail  but in essence .  human and humanoid cannot live together  apparently .  the worlds with robots died .  they were not viable .         and earth .         humans left it and settled here and presumably  though the conservatives would disagree  on other planets as well .         surely not every human being left earth .  the planet was not deserted .         presumably not .  i don   t know .      trevize said abruptly     was it left radioactive .      quintesetz looked astonished .     radioactive .        that   s what i   m asking .         not to my knowledge .  i never heard of such a thing .      trevize put a knuckle to his teeth and considered .  finally he said     s . q .   it   s getting late and we have trespassed sufficiently on your time  perhaps .      pelorat made a motion as though he were about to protest  but trevize   s hand was on the other   s knee and his grip tightened   so pelorat  looking disturbed  subsided .    quintesetz said     i was delighted to be of use .         you have been and if there   s anything we can do in exchange  name it .      quintesetz laughed gently .     if the good j . p .  will be so kind as to refrain from mentioning my name in connection with any writing he does on our mystery  that will be sufficient repayment .      pelorat said eagerly     you would be able to get the credit you deserve   and perhaps be more appreciated   if you were allowed to visit terminus and even  perhaps  remain there as a visiting scholar at our university for an extended period .  we might arrange that .  sayshell might not like the federation  but they might not like refusing a direct request that you be allowed to come to terminus to attend  let us say  a colloquium on some aspect of ancient history .      the sayshellian half rose .     are you saying you can pull strings to arrange that .      trevize said     why  i hadn   t thought of it  but j . p .  is perfectly right .  that would be feasible   if we tried .  and  of course  the more grateful you make us  the harder we will try .      quintesetz paused  then frowned .     what do you mean  sir .         all you have to do is tell us about gaia  s . q .      said trevize .  and all the light in quintesetz   s face died .   quintesetz looked down at his desk .  his hand stroked absent mindedly at his short  tightly curled hair .  then he looked at trevize and pursed his lips tightly .  it was as though he were determined not to speak .   trevize lifted his eyebrows and waited and finally quintesetz said in a strangled sort of way     it is getting indeed late   quite glemmering .      until then he had spoken in good galactic  but now his words took on a strange shape as though the sayshellian mode of speech were pushing past his classical education .      glemmering  s . q .  .         it is nearly full night .      trevize nodded .     i am thoughtless .  and i am hungry  too .  could you please join us for an evening meal  s . q .   at our expense .  we could then  perhaps  continue our discussion   about gaia .      quintesetz rose heavily to his feet .  he was taller than either of the two men from terminus  but he was older and pudgier and his height did not lend him the appearance of strength .  he seemed more weary than when they had arrived .   he blinked at them and said     i forget my hospitality .  you are outworlders and it would not be fitting that you entertain me .  come to my home .  it is on campus and not far and  if you wish to carry on a conversation  i can do so in a more relaxed manner there than here .  my only regret     he seemed a little uneasy     is that i can offer you only a limited meal .  my wife and i are vegetarians and if you are meat eating  i can only express my apologies and regrets .      trevize said     j . p .  and i will be quite content to forego our carnivorous natures for one meal .  your conversation will more than make up for it   i hope .         i can promise you an interesting meal  whatever the conversation     said quintesetz     if your taste should run to our sayshellian spices .  my wife and i have made a rare study of such things .         i look forward to any exoticism you choose to supply  s . q .      said trevize coolly  though pelorat looked a little nervous at the prospect .   quintesetz led the way .  the three left the room and walked down an apparently endless corridor  with the sayshellian greeting students and colleagues now and then  but making no attempt to introduce his companions .  trevize was uneasily aware that others stared curiously at his sash  which happened to be one of his gray ones .  a subdued color was not something that was de rigueur in campus clothing  apparently .   finally they stepped through the door and out into the open .  it  was indeed dark and a little cool  with trees bulking in the distance and a rather rank stand of grass on either side of the walkway .   pelorat came to a halt   with his back to the glimmer of lights that came from the building they had just left and from the glows that lined the walks of the campus .  he looked straight upward .      beautiful .     he said .     there is a famous phrase in a verse by one of our better poets that speaks of    the speckle shine of sayshell   s soaring sky .      trevize gazed appreciately and said in a low voice     vie are from terminus  s . q .   and my friend  at least  has seen no other skies .  on terminus  we see only the smooth dim fog of the galaxy and a few barely visible stars .  you would appreciate your own sky even more  had you lived with ours .      quintesetz said gravely     we appreciate it to the full  i assure you .  it   s not so much that we are in an uncrowded area of the galaxy  but that the distribution of stars is remarkably even .  i don   t think that you will find  anywhere in the galaxy  first magnitude stars so generally distributed .     and yet not too many  either .  i have seen the skies of worlds that are inside the outer reaches of a globular cluster and there you will see too many bright stars .  it spoils the darkness of the night sky and reduces the splendor considerably .         i quite agree with that     said trevize .      now i wonder     said quintesetz     if you see that almost regular pentagon of almost equally bright stars .  the five sisters  we call them .  it   s in that direction  just above the line of trees .  do you see it .         i see it     said trevize .     very attractive .         yes     said quintesetz .     it   s supposed to symbolize success in love    and there   s no love letter that doesn   t end in a pentagon of dots to indicate a desire to make love .  each of the five stars stands for a different stage in the process and there are famous poems which have vied with each other in making each stage as explicitly erotic as possible .  in my younger days  i attempted versifying on the subject myself and i wouldn   t have thought that the time would come when i would grow so indifferent to the five sisters  though i suppose it   s the common fate .     do you see the dim star just about in the center of the five sisters .         that     said quintesetz     is supposed to represent unrequited love .  there is a legend that the star was once as bright as the rest  but faded with grief .     and he walked on rapidly .   the dinner  trevize had been forced to admit to himself  was delightful .  there was endless variety and the spicing and dressing were subtle but effective .   trevize said     all these vegetables   which have been a pleasure to eat  by the way   are part of the galactic dietary  are they not  sq .  .         yes  of course .         i presume  though  that there are indigenous forms of life  too .         of course .  sayshell planet was an oxygen world when the first settlers arrived  so it had to be life bearing .  and we have preserved some of the indigenous life  you may be sure .  we have quite extensive natural parks in which both the flora and the fauna of old sayshell survive .      pelorat said sadly     there you are in advance of us  s . q .  there was little land life on terminus when human beings arrived and i   m afraid that for a long time no concerted effort was made to preserve the sea life  which had produced the oxygen that made terminus habitable .  terminus has an ecology now that is purely galactic in nature .         sayshell     said quintesetz  with a smile of modest pride     has a long and steady record of life valuing .      and trevize chose that moment to say     when we left your office  sq .   i believe it was your intention to feed us dinner and then tell us about gaia .      quintesetz   s wife  a friendly woman   plump and quite dark  who had said little during the meal   looked up in astonishment  rose  and left the room without a word .      my wife     said quintesetz uneasily     is quite a conservative  i   m afraid  and is a bit uneasy at the mention of   the world .  please excuse her .  but why do you ask about it .         because it is important for j . p .    s work  i   m afraid .         but why do you ask it of me .  we were discussing earth  robots  the founding of sayshell .  what has all this to do with   what you ask .         perhaps nothing  and yet there are so many oddnesses about the matter .  why is your wife uneasy at the mention of gaia .  why are you uneasy .  some talk of it easily enough .  we have been told only today that gaia is earth itself and that it has disappeared into hyperspace because of the evil done by human beings .      a look of pain crossed quintesetz   s face .     who told you that gibberish .         someone i met here at the university .         that   s just superstition .         then it   s not part of the central dogma of your legends concerning the flight .         no  of course not .  it   s just a fable that arose among the ordinary  uneducated people .         are you sure .     asked trevize coldly .   quintesetz sat back in his chair and stared at the remnant of the meal before him .     come into the living room     he said .     my wife will not allow this room to be cleared and set to rights while we are here and discussing   this .         are you sure it is just a fable .     repeated trevize  once they had seated themselves in another room  before a window that bellied upward and inward to give a clear view of sayshell   s remarkable night sky .  the lights within the room glimmered down to avoid competition and quintesetz   s dark countenance melted into the shadow .   quintesetz said     aren   t you sure .  do you think that any world can dissolve into hyperspace .  you must understand that the average person has only the vaguest notion of what hyperspace is .         the truth is     said trevize     that i myself have only the vaguest notion of what hyperspace is and i   ve been through it hundreds of times .         let me speak realities  then .  i assure you that earth   wherever it is   is not located within the borders of the sayshell union and that the world you mentioned is not earth .         but even if you don   t know where earth is  s . q .   you ought to know where the world i mentioned is .  it is certainly within the borders of the sayshell union .  we know that much  eh  pelorat .      pelorat  who had been listening stolidly  started at being suddenly addressed and said     if it comes to that  golan  i know where it is .      trevize turned to look at him .     since when  janov .         since earlier this evening  my dear golan .  you showed us the  five sisters  s . q .   on our way from your office to your house .  you pointed out a dim star at the center of the pentagon .  i   m positive that   s gaia .      quintesetz hesitated   his face  hidden in the dimness  was beyond any chance of interpretation .  finally he said     well  that   s what our astronomers tell us   privately .  it is a planet that circles that star .      trevize gazed contemplatively at pelorat  but the expression on the professor   s face was unreadable .  trevize turned to quintesetz     then tell us about that star .  do you have its co ordinates .         i .  no .     he was almost violent in his denial .     i have no stellar co ordinates here .  you can get it from our astronomy department  though i imagine not without trouble .  no travel to that star is permitted .         why not .  it   s within your territory  isn   t it .         spaciographically  yes .  politically  no .      trevize waited for something more to be said .  when that didn   t come  he rose .     professor quintesetz     he said formally     i am not a policeman  soldier  diplomat  or thug .  i am not here to force information out of you .  instead  i shall  against my will  go to our ambassador .  surely  you must understand that it is not i  for my own personal interest  that request this information .  this is foundation business and i don   t want to make an interstellar incident out of this .  i don   t think the sayshell union would want to  either .      quintesetz said uncertainly     what is this foundation business .         that   s not something i can discuss with you .  if gaia is not something you can discuss with me  then we will transfer it all to the government level and  under the circumstances  it may be the worse for sayshell .  sayshell has kept its independence of the federation and i have no objection to that .  i have no reason to wish sayshell ill and i do not wish to approach our ambassador .  in fact  i will harm my own career in doing so  for i am under strict instruction to get this information without making a government matter of it .  please tell me  then  if there is some firm reason why you cannot discuss gaia .  will you be arrested or otherwise punished  if you speak .  will you tell me plainly that i have no choice but to go to the ambassadorial height .         no no     said quintesetz  who sounded utterly confused .     i know nothing about government matters .  we simply don   t speak of that world .         superstition .         well  yes .  superstition .     skies of sayshell  in what way am i better than that foolish person who told you that gaia was in hyperspace   or than my wife who won   t even stay in a room where gaia is mentioned and who may even have left the house for fear it will be smashed by           lightning .         by some stroke from afar .  and i  even i  hesitate to pronounce the name .  gaia .  gaia .  the syllables do not hurt .  i am unharmed .  yet i hesitate .     but please believe me when i say that i honestly don   t know the co ordinates for gaia   s star .  i can try to help you get it  if that will help  but let me tell you that we don   t discuss the world here in the union .  we keep hands and minds off it .  i can tell you what little is known   really known  rather than supposed   and i doubt that you can learn anything more anywhere in these worlds of the union .      we know gaia is an ancient world and there are some who think it is the oldest world in this sector of the galaxy  but we are not certain .  patriotism tells us sayshell planet is the oldest  fear tells us gaia planet is .  the only way of combining the two is to suppose that gaia is earth  since it is known that sayshell was settled by earthpeople .      most historians think   among themselves   that gaia planet was founded independently .  they think it is not a colony of any world of our union and that the union was not colonized by gaia .  there is no consensus on comparative age  whether gaia was settled before or after sayshell was .      trevize said     so far  what you know is nothing  since every possible alternative is believed by someone or other .      quintesetz nodded ruefully .     it would seem so .  it was comparatively late in our history that we became conscious of the existence of gaia .  we had been preoccupied at first in forming the union  then in fighting off the galactic empire  then in trying to find our proper role as an imperial province and in limiting the power of the viceroys .      it wasn   t till the days of imperial weakness were far advanced that one of the later viceroys  who was under very weak central control by then  came to realize that gaia existed and seemed to maintain its independence from the sayshellian province and even from the empire itself .  it simply kept to itself in isolation and secrecy  so that virtually nothing was known about it  anymore than is now known .  the viceroy decided to take it over .  we have no details what happened  but his expedition was broken and few ships returned .  in those days  of course  the ships were neither very good nor very well led .      sayshell itself rejoiced at the defeat of the viceroy  who was considered an imperial oppressor  and the debacle led almost directly to the re establishment of our independence .  the sayshell union snapped its ties with the empire and we still celebrate the anniversary of that event as union day .  almost out of gratitude we left gaia alone for nearly a century  but the time came when we were strong enough to begin to think of a little imperialistic expansion of our own .  why not take over gaia .  why not at least establish a customs union .  we sent out a fleet and it was broken  too .      thereafter  we confined ourselves to an occasional attempt at trade   attempts that were invariably unsuccessful .  gaia remained in firm isolation and never   to anyone   s knowledge   made the slightest attempt to trade or communicate with any other world .  it certainly never made the slightest hostile move against anyone in any direction .  and then        quintesetz turned up the light by touching a control in the arm of his chair .  in the light  quintesetz   s face took on a clearly sardonic expression .  he went on     since you are citizens of the foundation  you perhaps remember the mule .      trevize flushed .  in five centuries of existence  the foundation had been conquered only once .  the conquest had been only temporary and had not seriously interfered with its climb toward second empire  but surely no one who resented the foundation and wished to puncture its self satisfaction would fail to mention the mule  its one conqueror .  and it was likely  thought trevize  that quintesetz had raised the level of light in order that he might see foundational self satisfaction punctured .   he said     yes  we of the foundation remember the mule .         the mule     said quintesetz     ruled an empire for a while  one that was as large as the federation now controlled by the foundation .  he did not  however  rule us .  he left us in peace .  he passed through sayshell at one time  however .  we signed a declaration of neutrality and a statement of friendship .  he asked nothing more .  we were the only ones of whom he asked nothing more in the days before illness called a halt to his expansion and forced him to wait for death .  he was not an unreasonable man  you know .  he did not use unreasonable force  he was not bloody  and he ruled humanely .         it was just that he was a conqueror     said trevize sarcastically .      like the foundation     said quintesetz .   trevize  with no ready answer  said irritably     do you have more to say about gaia .         just a statement that the mule made .  according to the account of the historic meeting between the mule and president kallo of the union  the mule is described as having put his signature to the document with a flourish and to have said     you are neutral even toward gaia by this document  which is fortunate for you .  even i will not approach gaia .      trevize shook his head .     why should he .  sayshell was eager to pledge neutrality and gaia had no record of ever troubling anyone .  the mule was planning the conquest of the entire galaxy at the time  so why delay for trifles .  time enough to turn on sayshell and gaia  when that was done .         perhaps  perhaps     said quintesetz     but according to one witness at the time  a person we tend to believe  the mule put down his pen as he said     even i will not approach gaia .     his voice then dropped and  in a whisper not meant to be heard  he added    again .         not meant to be heard  you say .  then how was it he was heard .         because his pen rolled off the table when he put it down and a sayshellian automatically approached and bent to pick it up .  his ear was close to the mule   s mouth when the word    again    was spoken and he heard it .  he said nothing until after the mule   s death .         how can you prove it was not an invention .         the man   s life is not the kind that makes it probable he would invent something of this kind .  his report is accepted .         and if it is .         the mule was never in   or anywhere near   the sayshell union except on this one occasion  at least after he appeared on the galactic scene .  if he had ever been on gaia  it had to be before he appeared on the galactic scene .         well .         well  where was the mule born .         i don   t think anyone knows     said trevize .      in the sayshell union  there is a strong feeling he was born on gaia .         because of that one word .         only partly .  the mule could not be defeated because he had strange mental powers .  gaia cannot be defeated either .         gaia has not been defeated as yet .  that does not necessarily prove it cannot be .         even the mule would not approach .  search the records of his overlordship .  see if any region other than the sayshell union was so gingerly treated .  and do you know that no one who has ever gone to gaia for the purpose of peaceful trade has ever returned .  why do you suppose we know so little about it .      trevize said     your attitude seems much like superstition .         call it what you will .  since the time of the mule  we have wiped gaia out of our thinking .  we don   t want it to think of us .  we only feel safe if we pretend it isn   t there .  it may be that the government has itself secretly initiated and encouraged the legend that gaia has disappeared into hyperspace in the hope that people will forget that there is a real star of that name .         you think that gaia is a world of mules  then .         it may be .  i advise you  for your good  not to go there .  if you do  you will never return .  if the foundation interferes with gaia  it will show less intelligence than the mule did .  you might tell your ambassador that .      trevize said     get me the co ordinates and i will be off your world at once .  i will reach gaia and i will return .      quintesetz said     i will get you the co ordinates .  the astronomy department works nights  of course  and i will get it for you now  if i can .     but let me suggest once more that you make no attempt to reach gaia .      trevize said     i intend to make that attempt .      and quintesetz said heavily     then you intend suicide .        chapter fourteen  forward .     janov pelorat looked out at the dim landscape in the graying dawn with an odd mixture of regret and uncertainty .      we aren   t staying long enough  golan .  it seems a pleasant and interesting world .  i would like to learn more about it .      trevize looked up from the computer with a wry smile .     you don   t think i would like to .  we had three proper meals on the planet   totally different and each excellent .  i   d like more .  and the only women we saw  we saw briefly   and some of them looked quite enticing  for   well  for what i   ve got in mind .      pelorat wrinkled his nose slightly .     oh  my dear chap .  those cowbells they call shoes  and all wrapped around in clashing colors  and whatever do they do to their eyelashes .  did you notice their eyelashes .         you might just as well believe i noticed everything  janov .  what you object to is superficial .  they can easily be persuaded to wash their faces and  at the proper time  off come the shoes and the colors .      pelorat said     i   ll take your word for that  janov .  however  i was thinking more of investigating the matter of earth further .     what we   ve been told about earth  thus far  is so unsatisfactory  so contradictory   radiation according to one person  robots according to another .         death in either case .         true     said pelorat reluctantly     but it may be that one is true and not the other  or that both are true to some extent  or that neither is true .  surely  janov  when you hear tales that simply shroud matters in thickening mists of doubt  surely you must feel the itch to explore  to find out .         i do     said golan .     by every dwarf star in the galaxy  i do .  the problem at hand  however  is gaia .  once that is straightened out  we can go to earth  or come back here to sayshell for a more extended stay .  but first  gaia .      pelorat nodded     the problem at hand .  if we accept what quintesetz told us  death is waiting for us on gaia .  ought we to be going .      trevize said     i ask myself that .  are you afraid .      pelorat hesitated as though he were probing his own feelings .  then he said in a quite simple and matter of fact manner .     yes .  terribly .      trevize sat back in his chair and swiveled to face the other .  he said  just as quietly and matter of factly     janov  there   s no reason for you to chance this .  say the word and i   ll let you off on sayshell with your personal belongings and with half our credits .  i   ll pick you up when i return and it will be on to sirius sector  if you wish  and earth  if that   s where it is .  if i don   t return  the foundation people on sayshell will see to it that you get back to terminus .  no hard feelings if you stay behind  old friend .      pelorat   s eyes blinked rapidly and his lips pressed together for a few moments .  then he said  rather huskily     old friend .  we   ve known each other what .  a week or so .  isn   t it strange that i   m going to refuse to leave the ship .  i am afraid  but i want to remain with you .      trevize moved his hands in a gesture of uncertainty .     but why .  i honestly don   t ask it of you .         i   m not sure why  but i ask it of myself .  it   s   it   s    golan  i have faith in you .  it seems to me you always know what you   re doing .  i wanted to go to trantor where probably   as i now see    nothing would have happened .  you insisted on gaia and gaia must somehow be a raw nerve in the galaxy .  things seem to happen in connection with it .  and if that   s not enough  golan  i watched you force quintesetz to give you the information about gaia .  that was such a skillful bluff .  i was lost in admiration .         you have faith in me  then .      pelorat said     yes  i do .      trevize put his hand on the other   s upper arm and seemed  for a moment  to be searching for words .  finally he said     janov  will you forgive me in advance if my judgment is wrong  and if you in one way or another meet with   whatever unpleasant may be awaiting us .      pelorat said     oh  my dear fellow  why do you ask .  i make the decision freely for my reasons  not yours .  and  please   let us leave quickly .  i don   t trust my cowardice not to seize me by the throat and shame me for the rest of my life .         as you say  janov     said trevize .     we   ll leave at the earliest moment the computer will permit .  this time  we   ll be moving gravitically   straight up   as soon as we can be assured the atmosphere above is clear of other ships .  and as the surrounding atmosphere grows less and less dense  we   ll put on more and more speed .  well within the hour  we   ll be in open space .         good     pelorat said and pinched the tip off a plastic coffee container .  the opened orifice almost at once began steaming .  pelorat put the nipple to his mouth and sipped  allowing just enough air to enter his mouth to cool the coffee to a bearable temperature .   trevize grinned .     you   ve learned how to use those things beautifully .  you   re a space veteran  janov .      pelorat stared at the plastic container for a moment and said     now that we have ships that can adjust a gravitational field at will  surely we can use ordinary containers  can   t we .         of course  but you   re not going to get space people to give up their space centered apparatus .  how is a space rat going to put distance between himself and surface worms if he uses an openmouthed cup .  see those rings on the walls and ceilings .  those have been traditional in spacecraft for twenty thousand years and more  but they   re absolutely useless in a gravitic ship .  yet they   re there and i   ll bet the entire ship to a cup of coffee that your space rat will pretend he   s being squashed into asphyxiation on takeoff and will then sway back and forth from those rings as though he   s under zero gray when its gee one   normal grav  that is   on both occasions .         you   re joking .         well  maybe a little  but there   s always social inertia to everything   even technological advance .  those useless wall rings are there and the cups they supply us have nipples .      pelorat nodded thoughtfully and continued to sip at his coffee .  finally he said     and when do we take off .      trevize laughed heartily and said     got you .  i began talking about wall rings and you never noticed that we were taking off right at that time .  we   re a mile high right now .         you don   t mean it .         look out .      pelorat did and then said     but i never felt a thing .         you   re not supposed to .         aren   t we breaking the regulations .  surely we ought to have followed a radio beacon in an upward spiral  as we did in a downward spiral on landing .         no reason to  janov .  no one will stop us .  no one at all .         coming down  you said           that was different .  they weren   t anxious to see us arrive  but they   re ecstatic to see us go .         why do you say that  golan .  the only person who talked to us about gaia was quintesetz and he begged us not to go .         don   t you believe it  janov .  that was for form .  he made sure we   d go to gaia .     janov  you admired the way i bluffed the information out of quintesetz .  i   m sorry  but i don   t deserve the admiration .  if i had done nothing at all  he would have offered the information .  if i had tried to plug my ears  he would have shouted it at me .         why do you say that  golan .  that   s crazy .         paranoid .  yes  i know .     trevize turned to the computer and extended his sense intently .  he said     we   re not being stopped .  no ships in interfering distance  no warning messages of any kind .      again he swiveled in the direction of pelorat .  he said     tell me  janov  how did you find out about gaia .  you knew about gaia while we were still on terminus .  you knew it was in the sayshell sector .  you knew the name was  somehow  a form of earth .  where did you hear all this .      pelorat seemed to stiffen .  he said     if i were back in my office on terminus  i might consult my files .  i have not brought everything with me   certainly not the dates on which i first encountered this piece of data or that .         well  think about it     said trevize grimly .     consider that the sayshellians themselves are close mouthed about the matter .  they are so reluctant to talk about gaia as it really is that they actually encourage a superstition that has the common people of the sector believing that no such planet exists in ordinary space .  in fact  i can tell you something else .  watch this .      trevize swung to the computer  his fingers sweeping across the direction hand rests with the ease and grace of long practice .  when he placed his hands on the manuals  he welcomed their warm touch and enclosure .  he felt  as always  a bit of his will oozing outward .   he said     this is the computer   s galactic map  as it existed within its memory banks before we landed on sayshell .  i am going to show you that portion of the map that represents the night sky of sayshell as we saw it this past night .      the room darkened and a representation of a night sky sprang out onto the screen .   pelorat said in a low voice     as beautiful as we saw it on sayshell .         more beautiful     said trevize  impatiently .     there is no atmospheric interference of any kind  no clouds  no absorption at the horizon .  but wait  let me make an adjustment     the view shifted steadily  giving the two the uncomfortable impression that it was they who were moving .  pelorat instinctively took hold of the arms of his chair to steady himself .      there .     said trevize .     do you recognize that .         of course .  those are the five sisters   the pentagon of stars that quintesetz pointed out .  it is unmistakable .         yes indeed .  but where is gaia .      pelorat blinked .  there was no dim star at the center .      it   s not there     he said .      that   s right .  it   s not there .  and that   s because its location is not included in the data banks of the computer .  since it passes the bounds of likelihood that those data banks were deliberately made incomplete in this respect for our benefit  i conclude that to the foundation gaiactographers who designed those data banks   and who had tremendous quantities of information at their disposal    gaia was unknown .         do you suppose if we had gone to trantor       began pelorat .      i suspect we would have found no data on gaia there  either .  its existence is kept a secret by the sayshellians   and even more so  i suspect  by the gaians themselves .  you yourself said a few days ago it was not entirely uncommon that some worlds deliberately stayed out of sight to avoid taxation or outside interference .         usually     said pelorat     when mapmakers and statisticians come across such a world  they are found to exist in thinly populated sections of the galaxy .  it   s isolation that makes it possible for them to hide .  gaia is not isolated .         that   s right .  that   s another of the things that makes it unusual .  so let   s leave this map on the screen so that you and i might continue to ponder the ignorance of our gaiactographers   and let me ask you again    in view of this ignorance on the part of the most knowledgeable of people  how did you come to hear of gaia .         i have been gathering data on earth myths  earth legends  and earth histories for over thirty years  my good golan .  without my complete records  how could i possibly           we can begin somewhere  janov .  did you learn about it in  say  the first fifteen years of your research or in the last fifteen .         oh .  well  if we   re going to be that broad  it was later on .         you can do better than that .  suppose i suggest that you learned of gaia only in the last couple of years .      trevize peered in pelorat   s direction  felt the absence of any ability to read an unseen expression in the dimness  and raised the light level of the room a bit .  the glory of the representation of the night sky on the screen dimmed in proportion .  pelorat   s expression was stony and revealed nothing .      well .     said trevize .      i   m thinking     said pelorat mildly .     you may be right .  i wouldn   t swear to it .  when i wrote jimbor of ledbet university  i didn   t mention gaia  though in that case it would have been appropriate to do so  and that was in   let   s see   in      and that was three years ago .  i think you   re right  golan .         and how did you come upon it .     asked trevize .     in a communication .  a book .  a scientific paper .  some ancient song .  how .     come on .      pelorat sat back and crossed his arms .  he fell into deep thought and didn   t move .  trevize said nothing and waited .   finally pelorat said     in a private communication .     but it   s no use asking me from whom  my dear chap .  i don   t remember .      trevize moved his hands over his sash .  they felt clammy as he continued his efforts to elicit information without too clearly forcing words into the other   s mouth .  he said     from a historian .  from an expert in mythology .  from a gaiactographer .         no use .  i cannot match a name to the communication .         because  perhaps  there was none .         oh no .  that scarcely seems possible .         why .  would you have rejected an anonymous communication .         i suppose not .         did you ever receive any .         once in a long while .  in recent years  i had become well known in certain academic circles as a collector of particular types of myths and legends and some of my correspondents were occasionally kind enough to forward material they had picked up from nonacademic sources .  sometimes these might not be attributed to anyone in particular .      trevize said     yes  but did you ever receive anonymous information directly  and not by way of some academic correspondent .         that sometimes happened   but very rarely .         and can you be certain that this was not so in the case of gaia .         such anonymous communications took place so rarely that i should think i would remember if it had happened in this case .  still  i can   t say certainly that the information was not of anonymous origin .  mind  though  that   s not to say that i did receive the information from an anonymous source .         i realize that .  but it remains a possibility  doesn   t it .      pelorat said  very reluctantly     i suppose it does .  but what   s all this about .         i   m not finished     said trevize peremptorily .     where did you get the information from   anonymous or not .  what world .      pelorat shrugged .     come now  i haven   t the slightest idea .         could it possibly have been from sayshell .         i told you .  i don   t know .         i   m suggesting you did get it from sayshell .         you can suggest all you wish  but that does not necessarily make it so .         no .  when quintesetz pointed out the dim star at the center of the five sisters  you knew at once it was gaia .  you said so later on to quintesetz  identifying it before he did .  do you remember .         yes  of course .         how was that possible .  how did you recognize at once that the dim star was gaia .         because in the material i had on gaia  it was rarely referred to by that name .  euphemisms were common  many different ones .  one of the euphemisms  several times repeated  was    the little brother of the five sisters .     another was    the pentagon   s center    and sometimes it was called    o pentagon .     when quintesetz pointed out the five sisters and the central star  the allusions came irresistibly to mind .         you never mentioned those allusions to me earlier .         i didn   t know what they meant and i didn   t think it would have been important to discuss the matter with you  who were a       pelorat hesitated .      a nonspecialist .         you realize  i hope  that the pentagon of the five sisters is an entirely relative form .         what do you mean .      trevize laughed affectionately .     you surface worm .  do you think the sky has an objective shape of its own .  that the stars are nailed in place .  the pentagon has the shape it has from the surface of the worlds of the planetary system to which sayshell planet belongs    and from there only .  from a planet circling any other star  the appearance of the five sisters is different .  they are seen from a different angle  for one thing .  for another  the five stars of the pentagon are at different distances from sayshell and  seen from other angles  there could be no visible relationship among them at all .  one or two stars might be in one half of the sky  the others in the other half .  see here        trevize darkened the room again and leaned over the computer .     there are eighty six populated planetary systems making up the sayshell union .  let us keep gaia   or the spot where gaia ought to be   in place     as he said that  a small red circle appeared in the center of the pentagon of the five sisters     and shift to the skies as seen from any of the other eighty six worlds taken at random .      the sky shifted and pelorat blinked .  the small red circle remained at the center of the screen  but the five sisters had disappeared .  there were bright stars in the neighborhood but no tight pentagon .  again the sky shifted  and again  and again .  it went on shifting .  the red circle remained in place always  but at no time did a small pentagon of equally bright stars appear .  sometimes what might be a distorted pentagon of stars   unequally bright   appeared  but nothing like the beautiful asterism quintesetz had pointed out .      had enough .     said trevize .     i assure you  the five sisters can never be seen exactly as we have seen it from any populated world but the worlds of the sayshell planetary system .      pelorat said     the sayshellian view might have been exported to other planets .  there were many proverbs in imperial times   some of which linger into our own  in fact   that are trantor centered .         with sayshell as secretive about gaia as we know it to be .  and why should worlds outside the sayshell union be interested .  why would they care about a    little brother of the five sisters    if there were nothing in the skies at which to point .         maybe you   re right .         then don   t you see that your original information must have come from sayshell itself .  not just from somewhere in the union  but precisely from the planetary system to which the capital world of the union belongs .      pelorat shook his head .     you make it sound as though it must  but it   s not something i remember .  i simply don   t .         nevertheless  you do see the force of my argument  don   t you .         yes  i do .         next    when do you suppose the legend could have originated .         anytime .  i should suppose it developed far back in the imperial era .  it has the feel of an ancient           you are wrong  janov .  the five sisters are moderately close to sayshell planet  which is why they   re so bright .  four of them have high proper motions in consequence and no two are part of a family  so that they move in different directions .  watch what happens as i shift the map backward in time slowly .      again the red circle that marked the site of gaia remained in place  but the pentagon slowly fell apart  as four of the stars drifted in different directions and the fifth shifted slightly .      look at that  janov     said trevize .     would you say that was a regular pentagon .         clearly lopsided     said pelorat .      and is gaia at the center .         no  it   s well to the side .         very well .  that is how the asterism looked one hundred and fifty years ago .  one and a half centuries  that   s all .     the material you received concerning    the pentagon   s center    and so on made no real sense till this century anywhere  not even in sayshell .  the material you received had to originate in sayshell and sometime in this century  perhaps in the last decade .  and you got it  even though sayshell is so close mouthed about gaia .      trevize put the lights on  turned the star map off  and sat there staring sternly at pelorat .   pelorat said     i   m confused .  what   s this about .         you tell me .  consider .  somehow i got the idea into my head that the second foundation still existed .  i was giving a talk during my election campaign .  i started a bit of emotional byplay designed to squeeze votes out of the undecided with a dramatic    if the second foundation still existed       and later that day i thought to myself  what if it did still exist .  i began reading history books and within a week  i was convinced .  there was no real evidence  but i have always felt that i had the knack of snatching the right conclusion out of a welter of speculation .  this time  though        trevize brooded a bit  then went on .     and look at what has happened since .  of all people  i chose compor as my confidant and he betrayed me .  whereupon mayor branno had me arrested and sent into exile .  why into exile  rather than just having me imprisoned  or trying to threaten me into silence .  and why in a very late model ship which gives me extraordinary powers of jumping through the galaxy .  and why  of all things  does she insist i take you and suggest that i help you search for earth .      and why was i so certain that we should not go to trantor .  i was convinced you had a better target for our investigations and at once you come up with the mystery world of gaia  concerning which  as it now turns out  you gained information under very puzzling circumstances .      we go to sayshell   the first natural stop   and at once we encounter compor  who gives us a circumstantial story about earth and its death .  he then assures us its location is in the sirius sector and urges us to go there .      pelorat said     there you are .  you seem to be implying that all circumstances are forcing us toward gaia  but  as you say  compor tried to persuade us to go elsewhere .         and in response  i was determined to continue on our original line of investigation out of my sheer distrust for the man .  don   t you suppose that that was what he might have been counting on .  he may have deliberately told us to go elsewhere just to keep us from doing so .         that   s mere romance     muttered pelorat .      is it .  let   s go on .  we get in touch with quintesetz simply because he was handy           not at all     said pelorat .     i recognized his name .         it seemed familiar to you .  you had never read anything he had written   that you could recall .  why was it familiar to you .     in any case  it turned out he had read a paper of yours and was overwhelmed by it   and how likely was that .  you yourself admit your work is not widely known .      what   s more  the young lady leading us to him quite gratuitously mentions gaia and goes on to tell us it is in hyperspace  as though to be sure we keep it in mind .  when we ask quintesetz about it  he behaves as though he doesn   t want to talk about it  but he doesn   t throw us out   even though i am rather rude to him .  he takes us to his home instead and  on the way there  goes to the trouble of pointing out the five sisters .  he even makes sure we note the dim star at the center .  why .  is not all this an extraordinary concatenation of coincidence .      pelorat said     if you list it like that           list it any way you please     said trevize .     i don   t believe in extraordinary concatenations of coincidence .         what does all this mean  then .  that we are being maneuvered to gaia .         by whom .      trevize said     surely there can be no question about that .  who is capable of adjusting minds  of giving gentle nudges to this one or that  of managing to divert progress in this direction or that .         you   re going to tell me it   s the second foundation .         well  what have we been told about gaia .  it is untouchable .  fleets that move against it are destroyed .  people who reach it do not return .  even the mule didn   t dare move against it   and the mule  in fact  was probably born there .  surely it seems that gaia is the second foundation   and finding that  after all  is my ultimate goal .   pelorat shook his head .     but according to some historians  the second foundation stopped the mule .  how could he have been one of them .         a renegade  i suppose .         but why should we be so relentlessly maneuvered toward the second foundation by the second foundation .      trevize   s eyes were unfocused  his brow furrowed .  he said     let   s reason it out .  it has always seemed important to the second foundation that as little information as possible about it should be available to the galaxy .  ideally it wants its very existence to remain unknown .  we know that much about them .  for a hundred twenty years  the second foundation was thought to be extinct and that must have suited them right down to the galactic core .  yet when i began to suspect that they did exist  they did nothing .  compor knew .  they might have used him to shut me up one way or another     had me killed  even .  yet they did nothing .      pelorat said     they had you arrested  if you want to blame that on the second foundation .  according to what you told me  that resulted in the people of terminus not knowing about your views .  the people of the second foundation accomplished that much without violence and they may be devotees of salvor hardin   s remark that    violence is the last refuge of the incompetent .         but keeping it from the people of terminus accomplishes nothing .  mayor branno knows my view and   at the very least   must wonder if i am correct .  so now  you see  it is too late for them to harm us .  if they had gotten rid of me to begin with  they would be in the clear .  if they had left me alone altogether  they might have still remained in the clear  for they might have maneuvered terminus into believing i was an eccentric  perhaps a madman .  the prospective ruin of my political career might even have forced me into silence as soon as i saw what the announcement of my beliefs would mean .      and now it is too late for them to do anything .  mayor branno was suspicious enough of the situation to send compor after me and    having no faith in him either  being wiser than i was   she placed a hyper relay on compor   s ship .  in consequence  she knows we are on sayshell .  and last night  while you were sleeping  i had our computer place a message directly into the computer of the foundation ambassador here on sayshell  explaining that we were on our way to gaia .  i took the trouble of giving its co ordinates  too .  if the second foundation does anything to us now  i am certain that branno will have the matter investigated   and the concentrated attention of the foundation must surely be what they don   t want .         would they care about attracting the foundation   s attention  if they are so powerful .         yes     said trevize forcefully .     they lie hidden because  in some ways  they must be weak and because the foundation is technologically advanced perhaps beyond even what seldon himself might have foreseen .  the very quiet  even stealthy  way in which they   ve been maneuvering us to their world would seem to show their eager desire to do nothing that will attract attention .  and if so  then they have already lost  at least in part   for they   ve attracted attention and i doubt they can do anything to reverse the situation .      pelorat said     but why do they go through all this .  why do they ruin themselves   if your analysis is correct   by angling for us across the galaxy .  what is it they want of us .      trevize stared at pelorat and flushed .     janov     he said     i have a feeling about this .  i have this gift of coming to a correct conclusion on the basis of almost nothing .  there   s a kind of sureness about me that tells me when i   m right   and i   m sure now .  there   s something i have that they want   and want enough to risk their very existence for .  i don   t know what it can be  but i   ve got to find out  because if i   ve got it and if it   s that powerful  then i want to be able to use it for what i feel is right .     he shrugged slightly .     do you still want to come along with me  old friend  now that you see how much a madman i am .      pelorat said     i told you i had faith in you .  i still do .      and trevize laughed with enormous relief .     marvelous .  because another feeling i have is that you are  for some reason  also essential to this whole thing .  in that case  janov  we move on to gaia  full speed .  forward .      mayor harla branno looked distinctly older than her sixty two years .  she did not always look older  but she did now .  she had been sufficiently wrapped up in thought to forget to avoid the mirror and had seen her image on her way into the map room .  so she was aware of the haggardness of her appearance .   she sighed .  it drained the life out of one .  five years a mayor and for twelve years before that the real power behind two figureheads .  all of it had been quiet  all of it successful  all of it   draining .  how would it have been  she wondered  if there had been strain   failure    disaster .   not so bad for her personally  she suddenly decided .  action would have been invigorating .  it was the horrible knowledge that nothing but drift was possible that had worn her out .   it was the seldon plan that was successful and it was the second foundation that made sure it would continue to be .  she  as the strong hand at the helm of the foundation  actually the first foundation  but no one on terminus ever thought of adding the adjective  merely rode the crest .   history would say little or nothing about her .  she merely sat at the controls of a spaceship  while the spaceship was maneuvered from without .   even indbur iii  who had presided over the foundation   s catastrophic fall to the mule  had done something .  he had  at least  collapsed .   for mayor branno there would be nothing .   unless this golan trevize  this thoughtless councilman  this lightning rod  made it possible    she looked at the map thoughtfully .  it was not the kind of structure produced by a modern computer .  it was  rather  a three dimensional cluster of lights that pictured the galaxy holographically in midair .  though it could not be made to move  to turn  to expand  or to contract  one could move about it and see it from any angle .   a large section of the galaxy  perhaps a third of the whole  excluding the core  which was a    no life   s land     turned red when she touched a contact .  that was the foundation federation  the more than seven million inhabited worlds ruled by the council and by herself   the seven million inhabited worlds who voted for and were represented in the house of worlds  which debated matters of minor importance  and then voted on them  and never  by any chance  dealt with anything of major importance .   another contact and a faint pink jutted outward from the edges of the federation  here and there .  spheres of influence .  this was not foundation territory  but the regions  though nominally independent  would never dream of resistance to any foundation move .   there was no question in her mind that no power in the galaxy could oppose the foundation  not even the second foundation  if one but knew where it was   that the foundation could  at will  reach out its fleet of modern ships and simply set up the second empire .   but only five centuries had passed since the beginning of the plan .  the plan called for ten centuries before the second empire could be set up and the second foundation would make sure the plan would hold .  the mayor shook her sad  gray head .  if the foundation acted now  it would somehow fail .  though its ships were irresistible  action now would fail .   unless trevize  the lightning rod  drew the lightning of the second foundation   and the lightning could be traced back to its source .   she looked about .  where was kodell .  this was no time for him to be late .   it was as though her thought had called him  for he came striding in  smiling cheerfully  looking more grandfatherly than ever with his gray white mustache and tanned complexion .  grandfatherly  but not old .  to be sure  he was eight years younger than she was .   how was it he showed no marks of strain .  did not fifteen years as director of security leave its scar .   kodell nodded slowly in the formal greeting that was necessary in initiating a discussion with the mayor .  it was a tradition that had existed since the bad days of the indburs .  almost everything had changed  but etiquette least of all .   he said     sorry i   m late  mayor  but your arrest of councilman trevize is finally beginning to make its way through the anesthetized skin of the council .         oh .     said the mayor phlegmatically .     are we in for a palace revolution .         not the least chance .  we   re in control .  but there   ll be noise .         let them make noise .  it will make them feel better  and i   i shall stay out of the way .  i can count  i suppose  on general public opinion .         i think you can .  especially away from terminus .  no one outside terminus cares what happens to a stray councilman .         i do .         ah .  more news .         liono     said the mayor     i want to know about sayshell .         i   m not a two legged history book     said liono kodell  smiling .      i don   t want history .  i want the truth .  why is sayshell independent .     look at it .     she pointed to the red of the foundation on the holographic map and there  well into the inner spirals  was an in pocketing of white .   branno said     we   ve got it almost encapsulated   almost sucked in   yet it   s white .  our map doesn   t even show it as a loyal ally inpink .      kodell shrugged .     it   s not officially a loyal ally  but it never bothers us .  it is neutral .         all right .  see this  then .     another touch at the controls .  the red sprang out distinctly further .  it covered nearly half the galaxy .     that     said mayor branno     was the mule   s realm at the time of his death .  if you   ll peer in among the red  you   ll find the sayshell union  completely surrounded this time  but still white .  it is the only enclave left free by the mule .         it was neutral then  too .         the mule had no great respect for neutrality .         he seems to have had  in this case .         seems to have had .  what has sayshell got .      kodell said     nothing .  believe me  mayor  she is ours any time we want her .         is she .  yet somehow she isn   t ours .         there   s no need to want her .      branno sat back in her chair and  with a sweep of her arm over the controls  turned the galaxy dark .     i think we now want her .         pardon  mayor .         liono  i sent that foolish councilman into space as a lightning rod .  i felt that the second foundation would see him as a greater danger than he was and see the foundation itself as the lesser danger .  the lightning would strike him and reveal its origin to us .         yes  mayor .         my intention was that he go to the decayed ruins of trantor to fumble through what   if anything   was left of its library and search for the earth .  that   s the world  you remember  that these wearisome mystics tell us was the site of origin of humanity  as though that matters  even in the unlikely case it is true .  the second  foundation couldn   t possibly have believed that was really what he was after and they would have moved to find out what he was really looking for .         but he didn   t go to trantor .         no .  quite unexpectedly  he has gone to sayshell .  why .         i don   t know .  but please forgive an old bloodhound whose duty it is to suspect everything and tell me how you know he and this pelorat have gone to sayshell .  i know that compor reports it  but how far can we trust compor .         the hyper relay tells us that compor   s ship has indeed landed on sayshell planet .         undoubtedly  but how do you know that trevize and pelorat have .  compor may have gone to sayshell for his own reasons and may not know   or care   where the others are .         the fact is  that our ambassador on sayshell has informed us of the arrival of the ship on which we placed trevize and pelorat .  i am not ready to believe the ship arrived at sayshell without them .  what is more  compor reports having talked to them and  if he cannot be trusted  we have other reports placing them at sayshell university  where they consulted with a historian of no particular note .         none of this     said kodell mildly     has reached me .      branno sniffed .     do not feel stepped on .  i am dealing with this personally and the information has now reached you   with not much in the way of delay  either .  the latest news   just received   is from the ambassador .  our lightning rod is moving on .  he stayed on sayshell planet two days  then left .  he is heading for another planetary system  he says  some ten parsecs away .  he gave the name and the galactic co ordinates of his destination to the ambassador  who passed them on to us .         is there anything corroborative from compor .         compor   s message that trevize and pelorat have left sayshell came even before the ambassador   s message .  compor has not yet determined where trevize is going .  presumably he will follow .      kodell said     we are missing the why   s of the situation .     he popped a pastille into his mouth and sucked at it meditatively .     why did trevize go to sayshell .  why did he leave .         the question that intrigues me most is  where .  where is trevize going .         you did say  mayor  did you not  that he gave the name and coordinates of his destination to the ambassador .  are you implying that he lied to the ambassador .  or that the ambassador is lying to us .         even assuming everyone told the truth all round and that no one made any errors  there is a name that interests me .  trevize told the ambassador he was going to gaia .  that   s c a i a .  trevize was careful to spell it .      kodell said     gaia .  i never heard of it .         indeed .  that   s not strange .     branno pointed to the spot in the air where the map had been .     upon the map in this room  i can set up  at a moment   s notice  every star   supposedly   around which there circles an inhabited world and many prominent stars with uninhabited systems .  over thirty million stars can be marked out   if i handle the controls properly   in single units  in pairs  in clusters .  i can mark them out in any of five different colors  one at a time  or all together .  what i cannot do is locate gaia on the map .  as far as the map is concerned  gaia does not exist .      kodell said     for every star the map shows  there are ten thousand it doesn   t show .         granted  but the stars it doesn   t show lack inhabited planets and why would trevize want to go to an uninhabited planet .         have you tried the central computer .  it has all three hundred billion galactic stars listed .         i   ve been told it has  but does it .  we know very well  you and    that there are thousands of inhabited planets that have escaped listing on any of our maps   not only on the one in this room  but even on the central computer .  gaia is apparently one of them .      kodell   s voice remained calm  even coaxing .     mayor  there may well be nothing at all to be concerned about .  trevize may be off on a wild goose chase or he may be lying to us and there is no star called gaia   and no star at all at the co ordinates he gave us .  he is trying to throw us off his scent  now that he has met compor and perhaps guesses he is being traced .         how will this throw us off the scent .  compor will still follow .  no  liono  i have another possibility in mind  one with far greater potentiality for trouble .  listen to me        she paused and said     this room is shielded  liono .  understand that .  we cannot be overheard by anyone  so please feel free to speak .  and i will speak freely  as well .      this gaia is located  if we accept the information  ten parsecs from sayshell planet and is therefore part of the sayshell union .  the sayshell union is a well explored portion of the galaxy .  all its star systems   inhabited or not inhabited   are recorded and the inhabited ones are known in detail .  gaia is the one exception .  inhabited or not  none have heard of it  it is present in no map .  add to this that the sayshell union maintains a peculiar state of independence with respect to the foundation federation  and did so even with respect to the mule   s former realm .  it has been independent since the fall of the galactic empire .         what of all this .     asked kodell cautiously .      surely the two points i have made must be connected .  sayshell incorporates a planetary system that is totally unknown and sayshell is untouchable .  the two cannot be independent .  whatever gaia is  it protects itself .  it sees to it that there is no knowledge of its existence outside its immediate surroundings and it protects those surroundings so that outsiders cannot take over .         you are telling me  mayor  that gaia is the seat of the second foundation .         i am telling you that gaia deserves inspection .         may i mention an odd point that might be difficult to explain by this theory .         please do .         if gaia is the second foundation and if  for centuries  it has protected itself physically against intruders  protecting all of the sayshell union as a broad  deep shield for itself  and if it has even prevented knowledge of itself leaking into the galaxy   then why has all that protection suddenly vanished .  trevize and pelorat leave terminus and  even though you had advised them to go to trantor  they go immediately and without hesitation to sayshell and now to gaia .  what is more  you can think of gaia and speculate on it .  why are you not somehow prevented from doing so .      mayor branno did not answer for a long time .  her head was bent and her gray hair gleamed dully in the light .  then she said     because i think councilman trevize has somehow upset things .  he has done something   or is doing something   that is in some way endangering the seldon plan .         that surely is impossible  mayor .         i suppose everything and everyone has its flaws .  even hari seldon was not perfect  surely .  somewhere the plan has a flaw and  trevize has stumbled upon it  perhaps without even knowing that he has .  we must know what is happening and we must be on the spot .      finally kodell looked grave .     don   t make decisions on your own  mayor .  we don   t want to move without adequate consideration .         don   t take me for an idiot  liono .  i   m not going to make war .  i   m not going to land an expeditionary force on gaia .  i just want to be on the spot   or near it  if you prefer .  liono  find out for me   i hate talking to a war office that is as ridiculously hidebound as one is sure to be after one hundred and twenty years of peace  but you don   t seem to mind   just how many warships are stationed close to sayshell .  can we make their movements seem routine and not like a mobilization .         in these piping times of peace  there are not many ships in the vicinity  i am sure .  but i will find out .         even two or three will be sufficient  especially if one is of the supernova class .         what do you want to do with them .         i want them to nudge as close to sayshell as they can   without creating an incident   and i want them sufficiently close to each other to offer mutual support .         what   s all this intended for .         flexibility .  i want to be able to strike if i have to .         against the second foundation .  if gaia can keep itself isolated and untouchable against the mule  it can surely withstand a few ships now .      branno said  with the gleam of battle in her eyes     my friend  i told you that nothing and no one is perfect  not even hari seldon .  in setting up his plan  he could not help being a person of his times .  he was a mathematician of the days of the dying empire  when technology was moribund .  it followed that he could not have made sufficient allowance in his plan for technological advance .  gravities  for instance  is a whole new direction of advance he could not possibly have guessed at .  and there are other advances  too .      gaia might also have advanced .         in isolation .  come .  there are ten quadrillion human beings within the foundation federation  from among whom contributors to technological advance can step forward .  a single isolated world can do nothing in comparison .  our ships will advance and i will be with them .         pardon me  mayor .  what was that .         i will be going myself to the ships that will gather at the borders of sayshell .  i wish to see the situation for myself .      kodell   s mouth fell open for a moment .  he swallowed and made a distinct noise as he did so .     mayor  that is   not wise .     if ever a man clearly intended a stronger remark  kodell did .      wise or not     said branno violently     i will do it .  i am tired of terminus and of its endless political battles  its infighting  its alliances and counteralliances  its betrayals and renewals .  i   ve had seventeen years at the center of it and i want to do something else    anything else .  out there     she waved her hand in a direction taken at random     the whole history of the galaxy may be changing and i want to take part in the process .         you know nothing about such things  mayor .         who does  liono .     she rose stiffly to her feet .     as soon as you bring me the information i need on the ships and as soon as i can make arrangements for carrying on with the foolish business at home  i will go .     and  liono  don   t try to maneuver me out of this decision in any way or i   ll wipe out our long friendship in a stroke and break you .  i can still do that .      kodell nodded .     i know you can  mayor  but before you decide  may i ask you to reconsider the power of seldon   s plan .  what you intend may be suicide .         i have no fears on that score  liono .  it was wrong with respect to the mule  whom it could not anticipate   and a failure to anticipate at one time implies the possibility of failure at another .      kodell sighed .     well then  if you are really determined  i will support you to the best of my ability and with complete loyalty .         good .  i warn you once again that you had better mean that remark with all your heart .  and with that in mind  liono  let us move on to gaia .  forward .        chapter fifteen  gaia s    sura novi now stepped into the control room of the small and rather old fashioned ship that was carrying stor gendibal and herself across the parsecs in deliberate jumps .   she had clearly been in the compact cleaning room  where oils  warm air  and a minimum of water freshened her body .  she had a robe wrapped about her and was holding it tightly to herself in an agony of modesty .  her hair was dry but tangled .   she said in a low voice     master .      gendibal looked up from his charts and from his computer .     yes  novi .         i be sorrow laden       she paused and then said slowly     i am very sorry to bother you  master     then she slipped again     but i be loss ridden for my clothing .         your clothing .     gendibal stared at her blankly for a moment and then rose to his feet in an access of contrition .     novi  i forgot .  they needed cleaning and they   re in the detergent hamper .  they   re cleaned  dried  folded  all set .  i should have taken them out and placed them in clear sight .  i forgot .         i did not like to   to        she looked down at herself     offend .         you don   t offend     said gendibal cheerily .     look  i promise you that when this is over i shall see to it that you have a great deal of clothing   new and in the latest fashion .  we left in a hurry and it never occurred to me to bring a supply  but really  novi  there are only the two of us and we   ll be together for some time in very close quarters and it   s needless to be   to be   so concerned   about       he gestured vaguely  became aware of the horrified look in her eyes  and thought  well  she   s only a country girl after all and has her standards  probably wouldn   t object to improprieties of all kinds   but with her clothes on .   then he felt ashamed of himself and was glad that she was no    scholar    who could sense his thoughts .  he said     shall i get your clothes for you .         oh no  master .  it be not for you    i know where they are .      he next saw her properly dressed and with her hair combed .  there was a distinct shyness about her .     i am ashamed  master  to have behaved so improper   ly .  i should have found them for myself .         no matter     said gendibal .     you are doing very well with your galactic  novi .  you are picking up the language of scholars very quickly .      novi smiled suddenly .  her teeth were somewhat uneven  but that scarcely detracted from the manner in which her face brightened and grew almost sweet under praise  thought gendibal .  he told himself that it was for that reason that he rather liked to praise her .   the hamish will think little of me when i am back home     she said .     they will say i be   am a word chopper .  that is what they call someone who speaks   odd .  they do not like such .         i doubt that you will be going back to the hamish  novi     said gendibal .     i am sure there will continue to be a place for you in the complex   with the scholars  that is   when this is over .         i would like that  master .         i don   t suppose you would care to call me    speaker gendibal    or just    no  i see you wouldn   t     he said  responding to her look of scandalized objection .     oh well .         it would not be fitting  master .     but may i ask when this will be over .      gendibal shook his head .     i scarcely know .  right now  i must merely get to a particular place as quickly as i can .  this ship  which is a very good ship for its kind  is slow and    as quickly as i can    is not very quick .  you see     he gestured at the computer and the charts     i must work out ways to get across large stretches of space  but the computer is limited in its abilities and i am not very skillful .         must you be there quickly because there is danger  master .         what makes you think there is danger  novi .         because i watch you sometimes when i don   t think you see me and your face looks   i do not know the word .  not afeared   i mean  frightened   and not bad expecting  either .         apprehensive     muttered gendibal .      you look   concerned .  is that the word .         it depends .  what do you mean by concerned  novi .         i means you look as though you are saying to yourself     what am i going to do next in this great trouble .      gendibal looked astonished .     that is    concerned     but do you see that in my face  novi .  back in the place of scholars  i am extremely careful that no one should see anything in my face  but i did think that  alone in space   except for you   i could relax and let it sit around in its underwear  so to speak .     i   m sorry .  that has embarrassed you .  .  what i   m trying to say is that if you   re so perceptive  i shall have to be more careful .  every once in a while i have to relearn the lesson that even nonmentalics can make shrewd guesses .      novi looked blank .     i don   t understand  master .         i   m talking to myself  novi .  don   t be concerned .     see  there   s that word again .         but is there danger .         there   s a problem  novi .  i do not know what i shall find when i reach sayshell   that is the place to which we are going .  i may find myself in a situation of great difficulty .         does that not mean danger .         no  because i will be able to handle it .         how can you tell this .         because i am a   scholar .  and i am the best of them .  there is nothing in the galaxy i cannot handle .         master     and something very like agony twisted novi   s face     i do not wish to offensify   i mean  give offense   and make you angry .  i have seen you with that oafish rufirant and you were in danger then   and he was only a hamish farmer .  now i do not know what awaits you   and you do not  either .      gendibal felt chagrined     are you afraid  novi .         not for myself  master .  i fear   i am afraid   for you .         you can say     i fear     muttered gendibal .     that is good galactic  too .      for a moment he was engaged in thought .  then he looked up  took sura novi   s rather coarse hands in his  and said     novi  i don   t want you to fear anything .  let me explain .  you know how you could tell there was or rather might be   danger from the look on my face   almost as though you could read my thoughts .         yes .         i can read thoughts better than you can .  that is what scholars learn to do and i am a very good scholar .      novi   s eyes widened and her hand pulled loose from his .  she seemed to be holding her breath .     you can read my thoughts .      gendibal held up a finger hurriedly .     i don   t  novi .  i don   t read your thoughts  except when i must .  i do not read your thoughts .       he knew that  in a practical sense  he was lying .  it was impossible to be with sura novi and not understand the general tenor of some of her thoughts .  one scarcely needed to be a second foundationer for that .  gendibal felt himself to be on the edge of blushing .  but even from a hamishwoman  such an attitude was flattering .      and yet she had to be reassured out of common humanity      he said     i can also change the way people think .  i can make people feel hurt .  i can        but novi was shaking her head .     how can you do all that  master .  rufirant           forget rufirant     said gendibal testily .     i could have stopped him in a moment .  i could have made him fall to the ground .  i could have made all the hamish       he stopped suddenly and felt uneasily that he was boasting  that he was trying to impress this provincial woman .  and she was shaking her head still .      master     she said     you are trying to make me not afraid  but i am not afraid except for you  so there is no need .  i know you are a great scholar and can make this ship fly through space where it seems to me that no person could do aught but   i mean  anything but   be lost .  and you use machines i cannot understand   and that no hamish person could understand .  but you need not tell me of these powers of mind  which surely cannot be so  since all the things you say you could have done to rufirant  you did not do  though you were in danger .      gendibal pressed his lips together .  leave it at that  he thought .  if the woman insists she is not afraid for herself  let it go at that .  yet he did not want her to think of him as a weakling and braggart .  he simply did not .   he said     if i did nothing to rufirant  it was because i did not wish to .  we scholars must never do anything to the hamish .  we are guests on your world .  do you understand that .         you are our masters .  that is what we always say .      for a moment gendibal was diverted .     how is it  then  that this rufirant attacked me .         i do not know     she said simply .     i don   t think he knew .  he must have been mind wandering   uh  out of his mind .      gendibal grunted .     in any case  we do not harm the hamish .  if i had been forced to stop him by   hurting him  i might have been poorly thought of by the other scholars and might perhaps have lost my position .  but to save myself being badly hurt  i might have had to handle him just a small bit   the smallest possible .      novi drooped .     then i need not have come rushing in like a great fool myself .         you did exactly right     said gendibal .     i have just said i would have done ill to have hurt him .  you made it unnecessary to do so .  you stopped him and that was well done .  i am grateful .      she smiled again   blissfully .     i see  then  why you have been so kind to me .         i was grateful  of course     said gendibal  a little flustered     but the important thing is that you must understand there is no danger .  i can handle an army of ordinary people .  any scholar can    especially the important ones   and i told you i am the best of all of them .  there is no one in the galaxy who can stand against me .         if you say so  master  i am sure of it .         i do say so .  now  are you afraid for me .         no  master  except    master  is it only our scholars who can read minds and    are there other scholars  other places  who can oppose you .      for a moment gendibal was staggered .  the woman had an astonishing gift of penetration .   it was necessary to lie .  he said     there are none .         but there are so many stars in the sky .  i once tried to count them and couldn   t .  if there are as many worlds of people as there are stars  wouldn   t some of them be scholars .  besides the scholars on our own world  i mean .         what if there are .         they would not be as strong as i am .         what if they leap upon you suddenly before you are aware .         they cannot do that .  if any strange scholar were to approach  i would know at once .  i would know it long before he could harm me .         could you run .         i would not have to run .     but     anticipating her objection     if  i had to  i could be in a new ship soon   better than any in the galaxy .  they would not catch me .         might they not change your thoughts and make you stay .         no .         there might be many of them .  you are but one .         as soon as they are there  long before they can imagine it would be possible  i would know they were there and i would leave .  our whole world of scholars would then turn against them and they would not stand .  and they would know that  so they would not dare do anything against me .  in fact  they would not want me to know of them at all   and yet i will .         because you are so much better than they .     said novi  her face shining with a doubtful pride .   gendibal could not resist .  her native intelligence  her quick understanding was such that it was simple joy to be with her .  that softvoiced monster  speaker debra delarmi  had done him an incredible favor when she had forced this hamish farmwoman upon him .   he said     no  novi  not because i am better than they  although i am .  it is because i have you with me .         i .         exactly  novi .  had you guessed that .         no  master     she said  wondering .     what is it i could do .         it is your mind .     he held up his hand at once .     i am not reading your thoughts .  i see merely the outline of your mind and it is a smooth outline  an unusually smooth outline .      she put her hand to her forehead .     because i am unlearned  master .  because i am so foolish .         no  dear .     he did not notice the manner of address .     it is because you are honest and possess no guile  because you are truthful and speak your mind  because you are warm of heart and   and other things .  if other scholars send out anything to touch our minds    yours and mine   the touch will be instantly visible on the smoothness of your mind .  i will be aware of that even before i would be aware of a touch on my own mind   and i will then have time for counteractive strategy  that is  to fight it off .      there was a silence for long moments after that .  gendibal realized that it was not just happiness in novi   s eyes  but exultation and pride  too .  she said softly     and you took me with you for that reason .      gendibal nodded .     that was an important reason .  yes .      her voice sank to a whisper .     how can i help as much as possible  master .      he said .     remain calm .  don   t be afraid .  and just   just stay as you are .      she said     i will stay as i am .  and i will stand between you and danger  as i did in the case of rufirant .      she left the room and gendibal looked after her .   it was strange how much there was to her .  how could so simple a creature hold such complexity .  the smoothness of her mind structure had  beneath it  enormous intelligence  understanding  and courage .  what more could he ask of anyone .   somehow  he caught an image of sura novi   who was not a speaker  not even a second foundationer  not even educated    grimly at his side  playing a vital auxiliary role in the drama that was coming .   yet he could not see the details clearly .     he could not yet see precisely what it was that awaited them .      a single jump     muttered trevize     and there it is .         gaia .     asked pelorat  looking over trevize   s shoulder at the screen .      gaia   s sun     said trevize .     call it gaia s  if you like  to avoid confusion .  gaiactographers do that sometimes .         and where is gaia itself  then .  or do we call it gaia p   for planet .         gaia would be sufficient for the planet .  we can   t see gaia yet  however .  planets aren   t as easy to see as stars are and we   re still a hundred microparsecs away from gaia s .  notice that it   s only a star  even though a very bright one .  we   re not close enough for it to show as a disc .     and don   t stare at it directly  janov .  it   s still bright enough to damage the retina .  i   ll throw in a filter  once i   m through with my observations .  then you can stare .         how much is a hundred microparsecs in units which a mythologist can understand  golan .         three billion kilometers  about twenty times the distance of terminus from our own sun .  does that help .         enormously .     but shouldn   t we get closer .         no .     trevize looked up in surprise .     not right away .  after what we   ve heard about gaia  why should we rush .  it   s one thing to have guts  it   s another to be crazy .  let   s take a look first .         at what  golan .  you said we can   t see gaia yet .         not at a glance  no .  but we have telescopic viewers and we have an excellent computer for rapid analysis .  we can certainly study gaia s  to begin with  and we can perhaps make a few other observations .     relax  janov    he reached out and slapped the other   s shoulder with an avuncular flourish .   after a pause trevize said     gaia s is a single star or  if it has a companion  that companion is much farther away from it than we are at the present moment and it is  at best  a red dwarf  which means we need not be concerned with it .  gaia s is a g  star  which means it is perfectly capable of having a habitable planet  and that   s good .  if it were an a or an m  we would have to turn around and leave right now .      pelorat said     i may be only a mythologist  but couldn   t we have determined the spectral class of gaia s from sayshell .         we could and we did  janov  but it never hurts to check at closer quarters .     gaia s has a planetary system  which is no surprise .  there are two gas giants in view and one of them is nice and large   if the computer   s distance estimate is accurate .  there could easily be another on the other side of the star and therefore not easily detectable  since we happen   by chance   to be somewhat close to the planetary plane .  i can   t make out anything in the inner regions  which is also no surprise .         is that bad .         not really .  it   s expected .  the habitable planets would be of rock and metal and would be much smaller than the gas giants and much closer to the star  if they   re to be warm enough   and on both counts they would be much harder to see from out here .  it means we   ll have to get in considerably closer in order to probe the area within four microparsecs of gaia s .         i   m ready .         i   m not .  we   ll make the jump tomorrow .         why tomorrow .         why not .  let   s give them a day to come out and get us   and for us to get away  perhaps  if we spot them coming and don   t like what we see .      it was a slow and cautious process .  during the day that passed  trevize grimly directed the calculation of several different approaches and tried to choose between them .  lacking hard data  he could depend only on intuition  which unfortunately told him nothing .  he lacked that    sureness    he sometimes experienced .   eventually he punched in directions for a jump that moved them far out of the planetary plane .      that will give us a better view of the region as a whole     he said     since we will see the planets in every part of their orbit at maximum apparent distance from the sun .  and they   whoever they may be   might not be quite as watchful over regions outside the plane .     i hope .      they were now as close to gaia s as the nearest and largest of the gas giants was and they were nearly half a billion kilometers from it .  trevize placed it under full magnification on the screen for pelorat   s benefit .  it was an impressive sight  even if the three sparse and narrow rings of debris were left out of account .      it has the usual train of satellites     said trevize     but at this distance from gaia s  we know that none of them are habitable .  nor are any of them settled by    human beings who survive  let us say  under a glass dome or under other strictly artificial conditions .         how can you tell .         there   s no radio noise with characteristics that point them out as of intelligent origin .  of course     he added  qualifying his statement at once     it is conceivable that a scientific outpost might go to great pains to shield its radio signals and the gas giant produces radio noise that could mask what i was looking for .  still  our radio reception is delicate and our computer is an extraordinarily good one .  i   d say the chance of human occupation of those satellites is extremely small .         does that mean there   s no gaia .         no .  but it does mean that if there is a gaia  it hasn   t bothered to settle those satellites .  perhaps it lacks the capacity to do so   or the interest .         well  is there a gaia .         patience  janov .  patience .      trevize considered the sky with a seemingly endless supply of patience .  he stopped at one point to say     frankly  the fact that they haven   t come out to pounce on us is disheartening  in a way .  surely  if they had the capacities they were described as having  they would have reacted to us by now .         it   s conceivable  i suppose     said pelorat glumly     that the whole thing is a fantasy .         call it a myth  janov     said trevize with a wry smile     and it will be right up your alley .  still  there   s a planet moving through the ecosphere  which means it might be habitable .  i   ll want to observe it for at least a day .         why .         to make sure it   s habitable  for one thing .         you just said it was in the ecosphere  golan .         yes  at the moment it is .  but its orbit could be very eccentric  and could eventually carry it within a microparsec of the star  or out to fifteen microparsecs  or both .  we   ll have to determine and compare the planet   s distance from gaia s with its orbital speed   and it would help to note the direction of its motion .      another day .      the orbit is nearly circular     trevize said finally     which means that habitability becomes a much safer bet .  yet no one   s coming out to get us even now .  we   ll have to try a closer look .      pelorat said     why does it take so long to arrange a jump .  you   re just taking little ones .         listen to the man .  little jumps are harder to control than big ones .  is it easier to pick up a rock or a fine grain of sand .  besides  gaia s is nearby and space is sharply curved .  that complicates the calculations even for the computer .  even a mythologist should see that .      pelorat grunted .   trevize said     you can see the planet with the unaided eye now .  right there .  see it .  the period of rotation is about twenty two galactic hours and the axial inclination is twelve degrees .  it is practically a textbook example of a habitable planet and it is life bearing .         how can you tell .         there are substantial quantities of free oxygen in the atmosphere .  you can   t have that without well established vegetation .         what about intelligent life .         that depends on the analysis of radio wave radiation .  of course  there could be intelligent life that has abandoned technology  i suppose  but that seems very unlikely .         there have been cases of that     said pelorat .      i   ll take your word for it .  that   s your department .  however  it   s not likely that there would be nothing but pastoral survivors on a planet that frightened off the mule .      pelorat said     does it have a satellite .         yes  it does     said trevize casually .      how big .     pelorat said in a voice that was suddenly choking .     can   t tell for sure .  perhaps a hundred kilometers across .        dear me     said pelorat wistfully .     i wish i had some worthier set of expletives on instant call  my dear chap  but there was just that one little chance           you mean  if it had a giant satellite  it might be earth itself .         yes  but it clearly isn   t .         well  if compor is right  earth wouldn   t be in this galactic region  anyway .  it would be over sirius way .     really  janov  i   m sorry .         oh well .         look  we   ll wait  and risk one more small jump .  if we find no signs of intelligent life  then it should be safe to land   except that there will then be no reason to land  will there .      after the next jump  trevize said in an astonished voice     that does it  janov .  it   s gaia  all right .  at least  it possesses a technological civilization .         can you tell that from the radio waves .         better than that .  there   s a space station circling the planet .  do you see that .      there was an object on display on the viewscreen .  to pelorat   s unaccustomed eye  it didn   t seem very remarkable  but trevize said     artificial  metallic  and a radio source .         what do we do now .         nothing  for a while .  at this stage of technology  they cannot fail to detect us .  if  after a while  they do nothing  i will beam a radio message at them .  if they still do nothing  i will approach cautiously .         what if they do do something .         it will depend on the    something .     if i don   t like it  then i   ll have to take advantage of the fact that it is very unlikely that they have anything that can match the facility with which this ship can make a jump .         you mean we   ll leave .         like a hyperspatial missile .         but we   ll leave no wiser than we came .         not at all .  at the very least we   ll know that gaia exists  that it has a working technology  and that it   s done something to scare us .         but  golan  let   s not be too easily scared .         now  janov  i know that you want nothing more in the galaxy than to learn about earth at any cost  but please remember that i don   t share your monomania .  we are in an unarmed ship and those people down there have been isolated for centuries .  suppose they have never heard of the foundation and don   t know enough to be respectful of it .  or suppose this is the second foundation and once we   re in their grip   if they   re annoyed with us   we may never be the same again .  do you want them to wipe your mind clear and find you are no longer a mythologist and know nothing about any legends whatever .      pelorat looked grim .     if you put it that way    but what do we do once we leave .         simple .  we get back to terminus with the news .     or as near to terminus as the old woman will allow .  then we might return to gaia once again   more quickly and without all this inching along    and we return with an armed ship or an armed fleet .  things may well be different then .      they waited .  it had grown to be a routine .  they had spent far more time waiting in the approaches to gaia than they had spent in all the flight from terminus to sayshell .   trevize set the computer to automatic alarm and was even nonchalant enough to doze in his padded chair .   this meant he woke with a start when the alarm chimed .  pelorat came into trevize   s room  just as startled .  he bad been interrupted while shaving .      have we received a message .     asked pelorat .      no     said trevize energetically .     we   re moving .         moving .  where .         toward the space station .         why is that .         i don   t know .  the motors are on and the computer doesn   t respond to me   but we   re moving .     janov  we   ve been seized .  we   ve come a little too close to gaia .        chapter sixteen  convergence    when stor gendibal finally made out compor   s ship on his viewscreen  it seemed like the end of an incredibly long journey .  yet  of course  it was not the end  but merely the beginning .  the journey from trantor to sayshell had been nothing but prologue .   novi looked awed .     is that another ship of space  master .         spaceship  novi .  it is .  it   s the one we have been striving to reach .  it is a larger ship than this one   and a better one .  it can move through space so quickly that if it fled from us  this ship could not possibly catch it or even follow it .         faster than a ship of the masters .     sura novi seemed appalled by the thought .   gendibal shrugged .     i may be  as you say  a master  but i am not a master in all things .  we scholars do not have ships like these  nor do we have many of the material devices that the owners of those ships have .         but how can scholars lack such things  master .         because we are masters in what is important .  the material advances that these others have are trifles .      novi   s brows bent together in thought .     it seems to me that to go so quickly that a master cannot follow is no trifle .  who are these people who are wonder having   who have such things .      gendibal was amused .     they call themselves the foundation .  have you ever heard of the foundation .       he caught himself wondering what the hamish knew or did not know of the galaxy and why it never occurred to the speakers to wonder about such things .     or was it only he who had never wondered about such things   only he who assumed that the hamish cared for nothing more than grubbing in the soil .    novi shook her head thoughtfully .     i have never heard of it  master .  when the schoolmaster taught me letter lore   how to read  i mean   he told me there were many other worlds and told me the names of some .  he said our hamish world had the proper name of trantor and that it once ruled all the worlds .  he said trantor was covered with gleaming iron and had an emperor who was an allmaster .      her eyes looked up at gendibal with a shy merriment .     i unbelieve most of it  though .  there are many stories the wordspinners tell in the meeting halls in the time of longer nights .  when i was a small girl  i believed them all  but as i grew older  i found that many of them were not true .  i believe very few now  perhaps none .  even schoolmasters tell unbelievables .         just the same  novi  that particular story of the schoolmaster is true   but it was long ago .  trantor was indeed covered by metal and had indeed an emperor who ruled all the galaxy .  now  however  it is the people of the foundation who will someday rule all the worlds .  they grow stronger all the time .         they will rule all  master .         not immediately .  in five hundred years .         and they will master the masters as well .         no  no .  they will rule the worlds .  we will rule them   for their safety and the safety of all the worlds .      novi was frowning again .  she said     master  do these people of the foundation have many of these remarkable ships .         i imagine so  novi .         and other things that are very   astonishing .         they have powerful weapons of all kinds .         then  master  can they not take all the worlds now .         no  they cannot .  it is not yet time .         but why can they not .  would the masters stop them .         we wouldn   t have to  novi .  even if we did nothing  they could not take all the worlds .         but what would stop them .         you see     began gendibal     there is a plan that a wise man once devised        he stopped  smiled slightly  and shook his head .     it is hard to explain  novi .  another time  perhaps .  in fact  when you see what will  happen before we ever see trantor again  you may even understand without my explaining .         what will happen  master .         i am not sure  novi .  but all will happen well .      he turned away and prepared to make contact with compor .  and  as he did so  he could not quite keep an inner thought from saying  at least i hope so .   he was instantly angry with himself  for he knew the source of that foolish and weakening drift of thought .  it was the picture of the elaborate and enormous foundation might in the shape of compor   s ship and it was his chagrin at novi   s open admiration of it .   stupid .  how could he let himself compare the possession of mere strength and power with the possession of the ability to guide events .  it was what generations of speakers had called    the fallacy of the hand at the throat .      to think that he was not yet immune to its allures .   munn li compor was not in the least sure as to how he ought to comport himself .  for most of his life  he had had the vision of allpowerful speakers existing just beyond his circle of experience    speakers  with whom he was occasionally in contact and who had  in their mysterious grip  the whole of humanity .   of them all  it had been stor gendibal to whom  in recent years  he had turned for direction .  it was not even a voice he had encountered most times  but a mere presence in his mind   hyperspeech without a hyper relay .   in this respect  the second foundation had gone far beyond the foundation .  without material device  but just by the educated and advanced power of the mind alone  they could reach across the par .  sees in a manner that could not be tapped  could not be infringed upon .  it was an invisible  indetectable network that held all the worlds fast through the mediation of a relatively few dedicated individuals .   compor had  more than once  experienced a kind of uplifting at the thought of his role .  how small the band of which he was one  how enormous an influence they exerted .     and how secret it all was .  even his wife knew nothing of his hidden life .   and it was the speakers who held the strings   and this one speaker  this gendibal  who might  compor thought  be the next first speaker  the more than emperor of a more than empire .   now gendibal was here  in a ship of trantor  and compor fought to stifle his disappointment at not having such a meeting take place on trantor itself .   could that be a ship of trantor .  any of the early traders who had carried the foundation   s wares through a hostile galaxy would have had a better ship than that .  no wonder it had taken the speaker so long to cover the distance from trantor to sayshell .   it was not even equipped with a unidock mechanism that would have welded the two ships into one when the crosstransfer of personnel was desired .  even the contemptible sayshellian fleet was equipped with it .  instead  the speaker had to match velocities and then cast a tether across the gap and swing along it  as in imperial days .   that was it  thought compor gloomily  unable to repress the feeling .  the ship was no more than an old fashioned imperial vessel    and a small one at that .   two figures were moving across the tether   one of them so clumsily that it was clear it had never attempted to maneuver through  space before .    finally they were on board and removed their space suits .  speaker stor gendibal was of moderate height and of unimpressive appearance  he was not large and powerful  nor did he exude an air of learning .  his dark  deep set eyes were the only indication of his wisdom .  but now the speaker looked about with a clear indication of being in awe himself .   the other was a woman as tall as gendibal  plain in appearance .  her mouth was open in astonishment as she looked about .   moving across the tether had not been an entirely unpleasant experience for gendibal .  he was not a spaceman   no second foundationer was   but neither was he a complete surface worm  for no second foundationer was allowed to be that .  the possible need for space flight was  after all  always looming above them  though every second foundationer hoped the need would arise only infrequently .   preem palver   the extent of whose space travels was legendary    had once said  ruefully  that the measure of the success of a speaker was the fewness of the times he was compelled to move through space in order to assure the success of the plan .    gendibal had had to use a tether three times before .  this was his fourth use and even if he had felt tension over the matter  it would have disappeared in his concern for sura novi .  he needed no mentalics to see that stepping into nothingness had totally upset her .      i be afeared  master     she said when he explained what would have to be done .     it be naughtness into which i will make footstep .     if nothing else  her sudden descent into thick hamish dialect showed the extent of her disturbance .   gendibal said gently     i cannot leave you on board this ship  novi  for i will be going into the other and i must have you with me .  there is no danger  for your space suit will protect you from all harm and there is no place for you to fall to .  even if you lose your grip on the tether  you will remain nearly where you are and i will be within arm   s reach so that i can gather you in .  come  novi  show me that you are brave enough   as well as bright enough   to become a scholar .      she made no further objection and gendibal  unwilling to do anything that might disturb the smoothness of her mind set  nevertheless managed to inject a soothing touch upon the surface of her mind .      you can still speak to me     he said  after they were each enclosed in a space suit .     i can hear you if you think hard .  think the words hard and clearly  one by one .  you can hear me now  can   t you .         yes  master     she said .   he could see her lips move through the transparent faceplate and he said     say it without moving your lips  novi .  there is no radio in the kind of suits that scholars have .  it is all done with the mind .      her lips did not move and her look grew more anxious  can you hear me  master .   perfectly well  thought gendibal   and his lips did not move either  do you hear me .   i do  master .   then come with me and do as i do .   they moved across .  gendibal knew the theory of it  even if he could handle the practice only moderately well .  the trick was to  keep one   s legs extended and together and to swing them from the hips alone .  that kept the center of gravity moving in a straight line as the arms swung forward in steady alternation .  he had explained this to sura novi and  without turning to look at her  he studied the stance of her body from the set of the motor areas of her brain .   for a first timer  she did very well  almost as well as gendibal was managing to do .  she repressed her own tensions and she followed directions .  gendibal found himself  once again  very pleased with her .   she was  however  clearly glad to be on board ship again   and so was gendibal .  he looked about as he removed his space suit and was rather dumbfounded at the luxury and style of the equipment .  he recognized almost nothing and his heart sank at the thought that he might have very little time to learn how to handle it all .  he might have to transfer expertise directly from the man already on board  something that was never quite as satisfactory as true learning .   then he concentrated on compor .  compor was tall and lean  a few years older than himself  rather handsome in a slightly weak way  with tightly waved hair of a startling buttery yellow .   and it was clear to gendibal that this person was disappointed in  and even contemptuous of  the speaker he was now meeting for the first time .  what was more  he was entirely unsuccessful in hiding the fact .   gendibal did not mind such things  on the whole .  compor was not a trantorian   nor a full second foundationer   and he clearly had his illusions .  even the most superficial scan of his mind showed that .  among these was the illusion that true power was necessarily related to the appearance of power .  he might  of course  keep his illusions as long as they did not interfere with what gendibal needed  but at the present moment  this particular illusion did so interfere .   what gendibal did was the mentalic equivalent of a snap of the fingers .  compor staggered slightly under the impress of a sharp but fleeting pain .  there was an impress of enforced concentration that puckered the skin of his thought and left the man with the awareness of a casual but awesome power that could be utilized if the speaker chose .   compor was left with a vast respect for gendibal .   gendibal said pleasantly     i am merely attracting your attention  compor  my friend .  please let me know the present whereabouts of your friend  golan trevize  and his friend  janov pelorat .      compor said hesitantly     shall i speak in the presence of the woman  speaker .         the woman  compor  is an extension of myself .  there is no reason  therefore  why you should not speak openly .         as you say  speaker .  trevize and pelorat are now approaching a planet known as gaia .         so you said in your last communication the other day .  surely they have already landed on gaia and perhaps left again .  they did not stay long on sayshell planet .         they had not yet landed during the time i followed them  speaker .  they were approaching the planet with great caution  pausing substantial periods between micro jumps .  it is clear to me they have no information about the planet they are approaching and therefore hesitate .         do you have information  compor .         i have none  speaker     said compor     or at least my ship   s computer has none .         this computer .     gendibal   s eyes fell upon the control panel and he asked in sudden hope     can it aid usefully in running the ship .         it can run the ship completely  speaker .  one need merely think into it .      gendibal felt suddenly uneasy .     the foundation has gone that far .         yes  but clumsily .  the computer does not work well .  i must repeat my thoughts several times and even then i get but minimal information .      gendibal said     i may be able to do better than that .         i am sure of it  speaker     said compor respectfully .      but never mind that for the moment .  why does it have no information on gaia .         i do not know  speaker .  it claims to have   as far as a computer may be said to be able to claim   records on every human inhabited planet in the galaxy .         it cannot have more information than has been fed into it and if those who did the feeding thought they had records of all such planets when  in actual fact  they had not  then the computer would labor under the same misapprehension .  correct .         certainly  speaker .         did you inquire at sayshell .         speaker     said compor uneasily     there are people who speak of  gaia on sayshell  but what they say is valueless .  clearly superstition .  the tale they tell is that gaia is a powerful world that held off even the mule .         is that what they say  indeed .     said gendibal  suppressing excitement .     were you so sure that this was superstition that you asked for no details .         no  speaker .  i asked a great deal  but what i have just told you is all that anyone can say .  they can speak on the subject at great length  but when they have done so  all that it boils down to is what i have just said .         apparently     said gendibal     that is what trevize has heard  too  and he goes to gaia for some reason connected with that   to tap this great power  perhaps .  and he does so cautiously  for perhaps he also fears this great power .         that is certainly possible  speaker .         and yet you did not follow .         i did follow  speaker  long enough to make sure he was indeed making for gaia .  i then returned here to the outskirts of the gaian system .         why .         three reasons  speaker .  first  you were about to arrive and i wanted to meet you at least partway and bring you aboard at the earliest moment  as you had directed .  since my ship has a hyperrelay on board  i could not move too far away from trevize and pelorat without rousing suspicion on terminus  but i judged i could risk moving this far .  second  when it was clear that trevize was approaching gaia planet very slowly  i judged there would be time enough for me to move toward you and hasten our meeting without being overtaken by events  especially since you would be more competent than i to follow him to the planet itself and to handle any emergency that might arise .         quite true .  and the third reason .         since our last communication  speaker  something has happened that i did not expect and do not understand .  i felt that   for that reason  too   i had better hasten our meeting as soon as i dared .         and this event that you did not expect and do not understand .         ships of the foundation fleet are approaching the sayshellian frontier .  my computer has picked up this information from sayshellian news broadcasts .  at least five advanced ships are in the flotilla and these have enough power to overwhelm sayshell .      gendibal did not answer at once  for it would not do to show that he had not expected such a move   or that he didn   t understand it .  so  after a moment  he said negligently     do you suppose that this has something to do with trevize   s movement toward gaia .         it certainly came immediately afterward   and if b follows a  then there is at least a possibility that a caused b     said compor .      well then  it seems we all converge upon gaia   trevize  and i  and the first foundation .     come  you acted well  compor     said gendibal     and here is what we will now do .  first  you will show me how this computer works and  through that  how the ship may be handled .  i am sure that will not take long .      after that  you will get into my ship  since by then i will have impressed on your mind how to handle it .  you will have no trouble maneuvering it  although i must tell you  as you have no doubt guessed from its appearance  that you will find it primitive indeed .  once you are in control of the ship  you will keep it here and wait for me .         how long  speaker .         until i come for you .  i do not expect to be gone long enough for you to be in danger of running out of supplies  but if i am unduly delayed  you may find your way to some inhabited planet of the sayshell union and wait there .  wherever you are  i will find you .         as you say  speaker .         and do not be alarmed .  i can handle this mysterious gaia and  if need be  the five ships of the foundation as well .      littoral thoobing had been the foundation   s ambassador to sayshell for seven years .  he rather liked the position .   tall and rather stout  he wore a thick brown mustache at a time when the predominant fashion  both in the foundation and in sayshell  was smooth shaven .  he had a strongly lined countenance  though he was only fifty four   and was much given to a schooled indifference .  his attitude toward his work was not easily seen .   still  he rather liked the position .  it kept him away from the hurly burly of polities on terminus   something he appreciated    and it gave him the chance to live the life of a sayshellian sybarite and to support his wife and daughter in the style to which they had become addicted .  he didn   t want his life disturbed .   on the other hand  he rather disliked liono kodell  perhaps because kodell also sported a mustache  though one which was smaller  shorter  and grayish white .  in the old days  they had been the only two people in prominent public life who had worn one and there had been rather a competition between them over the matter .  now  thought thoobing  there was none  kodell   s was contemptible .   kodell had been director of security when thoobing was still on terminus  dreaming of opposing harla branno in the race for mayor  until he had been bought off with the ambassadorship .  branno had done it for her own sake  of course  but he had ended up owing her goodwill for that .   but not to kodell  somehow .  perhaps it was because of kodell   s determined cheerfulness   the manner in which he was always such a friendly person   even after he had decided on just exactly the manner in which your throat was to be cut .   now he sat there in hyperspatial image  cheerful as ever  brimming over with bonhomie .  his actual body was  of course  back on terminus  which spared thoobing the necessity of offering him any physical sign of hospitality .      kodell     he said .     i want those ships withdrawn .      kodell smiled sunnily .     why  so do i  but the old lady has made up her mind .         you   ve been known to persuade her out of this or that .         on occasion .  perhaps .  when she wanted to be persuaded .  this time she doesn   t want to be .     thoobing  do your job .  keep sayshell calm .         i   m not thinking about sayshell  kodell .  i   m thinking about the foundation .         so are we all .         kodell  don   t fence .  i want you to listen to me .         gladly  but these are hectic times on terminus and i will not listen to you forever .         i will be as brief as i can be   when discussing the possibility of the foundation   s destruction .  if this hyperspatial line is not being tapped  i will speak openly .         it is not being tapped .         then let me go on .  i have received a message some days ago from one golan trevize .  i recall a trevize in my own political days  a commissioner of transportation .         the young man   s uncle     kodell said .      ah  then you know the trevize who sent the message to me .  according to the information i have since gathered  he was a councilman who  after the recent successful resolution of a seldon crisis  was arrested and sent into exile .         exactly .         i don   t believe it .         what is it that you don   t believe .         that he was sent into exile .         why not .         when in history has any citizen of the foundation been sent into exile .     demanded thoobing .     he is arrested or not arrested .  if he is arrested  he is tried or not tried .  if he is tried  he is convicted or not convicted .  if he is convicted  he is fined  demoted  disgraced  imprisoned  or executed .  no one is sent into exile .         there is always a first time .         nonsense .  in an advanced naval vessel .  what fool can fail to see that he is on a special mission for your old woman .  whom can she possibly expect to deceive .         what would the mission be .         supposedly to find the planet gaia .      some of the cheerfulness left kodell   s face .  an unaccustomed hardness entered his eyes .  he said     i know that you feel no overwhelming impulse to believe my statements  mr .  ambassador  but i make a special plea that you believe me in this one case .  neither the mayor nor i had ever heard of gaia at the time that trevize was sent into exile .  we have heard of gaia  for the first time  just the other day .  if you believe that  this conversation may continue .         i will suspend my tendency toward skepticism long enough to accept that  director  though it is difficult to do so .         it is quite true  mr .  ambassador  and if i have suddenly adopted a formal note to my statements it is because when this is done  you will find that you have questions to answer and that you will not find the occasion joyful .  you speak as though gaia is a world familiar to you .  how is it that you know something we did not know .  is it not your duty to see to it that we know everything that you know about the political unit to which you are assigned .      thoobing said softly     gaia is not part of the sayshell union .  it  in fact  probably does not exist .  am i to transmit to terminus all the fairy tales that the superstitious lower orders of sayshell tell of gaia .  some of them say that gaia is located in hyperspace .  according to others  it is a world that supernaturally protects sayshell .  according to still others  it sent forth the mule to prey on the galaxy .  if you are planning to tell the sayshellian government that trevize has been sent out to find gaia and that five advanced ships of the foundation navy have been sent out to back him in this search  they will never believe you .  the people may believe fairy tales about gaia  but the government does not   and they will not be convinced that the foundation does .  they will feel that you intend to force sayshell into the foundation federation .         and what if we do plan that .         it would be fatal .  come  kodell  in the five century history of the foundation  when have we fought a war of conquest .  we have fought wars to prevent our own conquest   and failed once   but no war has ended with an extension of our territory .  accessions to the federation have been through peaceful agreements .  we have been joined by those who saw benefits in joining .         isn   t it possible that sayshell may see benefits in joining .         they will never do so while our ships remain on their borders .  withdraw them .         it can   t be done .         kodell  sayshell is a marvelous advertisement for the benevolence of the foundation federation .  it is nearly enclosed by our territory  it is in an utterly vulnerable position  and yet until now it has been safe  has gone its own way  has even been able to maintain an anti foundation foreign policy freely .  how better can we show the galaxy that we force no one  that we come in friendship to all .     if we take over sayshell  we take that which  in essence  we already have .  after all  we dominate it economically   if quietly .  but if we take it over by military force  we advertise to all the galaxy that we have become expansionist .         and if i tell you that we are really interested only in gaia .         then i will believe it no more than the sayshell union will .  this man  trevize  sends me a message that he is on his way to gaia and asks me to transmit it to terminus .  against my better judgment  i do so because i must and  almost before the hyperspatial line is cool  the foundation navy is in motion .  how will you get to gaia  without penetrating sayshellian space .         my dear thoobing  surely you are not listening to yourself .  did  you not tell me just a few minutes ago that gaia  if it exists at all  is not part of the sayshell union .  and i presume you know that hyperspace is free to all and is part of no world   s territory .  how then can sayshell complain if we move from foundation territory  where our ships stand right now   through hyperspace  into gaian territory  and never in the process occupy a single cubic centimeter of sayshellian territory .         sayshell will not interpret events like that  kodell .  gaia  if it exists at all  is totally enclosed by the sayshell union  even if it is not a political part of it  and there are precedents that make such enclaves virtual parts of the enclosing territory  as far as enemy warships are concerned .         ours are not enemy warships .  we are at peace with sayshell .         i tell you that sayshell may declare war .  they won   t expect to win such a war through military superiority  but the fact is  war will set off a wave of anti foundation activity throughout the galaxy .  the new expansionist policies of the foundation will encourage the growth of alliances against us .  some of the members of the federation will begin to rethink their ties to us .  we may well lose the war through internal disarray and we will then certainly reverse the process of growth that has served the foundation so well for five hundred years .         come  come  thoobing     said kodell indifferently     you speak as though five hundred years is nothing  as though we are still the foundation of salvor hardin   s time  fighting the pocket kingdom of anacreon .  we are far stronger now than the galactic empire ever was at its very height .  a squadron of our ships could defeat the entire galactic navy  occupy any galactic sector  and never know it had been in a fight .         we are not fighting the galactic empire .  we fight planets and sectors of our own time .         who have not advanced as we have .  we could gather in all the galaxy now .         according to the seldon plan  we can   t do that for another five hundred years .         the seldon plan underestimates the speed of technological advance .  we can do it now .     understand me  i don   t say we will do it now or even should do it now .  i merely say we can do it now .         kodell  you have lived all your life on terminus .  you don   t know  the galaxy .  our navy and our technology can beat down the armed forces of other worlds  but we cannot yet govern an entire rebellions  hate ridden galaxy   and that is what it will be if we take it by force .  withdraw the ships .         it can   t be done  thoobing .  consider    what if gaia is not a myth .      thoobing paused  scanning the other   s face as though anxious to read his mind .     a world in hyperspace not a myth .         a world in hyperspace is superstition  but even superstitions may be built around kernels of truth .  this man  trevize  who was exiled  speaks of it as though it were a real world in real space .  what if he is right .         nonsense .  i don   t believe it .         no .  believe it for just a moment .  a real world that has lent sayshell safety against the mule and against the foundation .         but you refute yourself .  how is gaia keeping the sayshellians safe from the foundation .  are we not sending ships against it .         not against it  but against gaia  which is so mysteriously unknown   which is so careful to avoid notice that while it is in real space it somehow convinces its neighbor worlds that it is in hyperspace   and which even manages to remain outside the computerized data of the best and most unabridged of galactic maps .         it must be a most unusual world  then  for it must be able to manipulate minds .             and did you not say a moment ago that one sayshellian tale is that gaia sent forth the mule to prey upon the galaxy .  and could not the mule manipulate minds .         and is gaia a world of mules  then .         are you sure it might not be .         why not a world of a reborn second foundation  in that case .         why not indeed .  should it not be investigated .      thoobing grew sober .  he had been smiling scornfully during the last exchanges  but now he lowered his head and stared up from under his eyebrows .     if you are serious  is such an investigation not dangerous .         is it .         you answer my questions with other questions because you have no reasonable answers .  of what use will ships be against mules or second foundationers .  is it not likely  in fact  that if they exist they are luring you into destruction .  see here  you tell me that the  foundation can establish its empire now  even though the seldon plan has reached only its midway point  and i have warned you that you would be racing too far ahead and that the intricacies of the plan would slow you down by force .  perhaps  if gaia exists and is what you say it is  all this is a device to bring about that slowdown .  do voluntarily now what you may soon be constrained to do .  do peacefully and without bloodshed now what you may be forced to do by woeful disaster .  withdraw the ships .         it can   t be done .  in fact  thoobing  mayor branno herself plans to join the ships  and scoutships have already flitted through hyperspace to what is supposedly gaian territory .      thoobing   s eyes bulged .     there will surely be war  i tell you .         you are our ambassador .  prevent that .  give the sayshellians whatever assurances they need .  deny any ill will on our part .  tell them  if you have to  that it will pay them to sit quietly and wait for gaia to destroy us .  say anything you want to  but keep them quiet .      he paused  searching thoobing   s stunned expression  and said     really  that   s all .  as far as i know  no foundation ship will land on any world of the sayshell union or penetrate any point in real space that is part of that union .  however  any sayshellian ship that attempts to challenge us outside union territory   and therefore inside foundation territory   will promptly be reduced to dust .  make that perfectly clear  too  and keep the sayshellians quiet .  you will be held to strict account if you fail .  you have had an easy job so far  thoobing  but hard times are upon you and the next few weeks decide all .  fail us and no place in the galaxy will be safe for you .      there was neither merriment nor friendliness in kodell   s face as contact was broken and as his image disappeared .   thoobing stared open mouthed at the place where he had been .   golan trevize clutched at his hair as though he were trying  by feel  to judge the condition of his thinking .  he said to pelorat abruptly     what is your state of mind .         state of mind .     said pelorat blankly .      yes .  here we are  trapped   with our ship under outside control and being drawn inexorably to a world we know nothing about .  do you feel panic .      pelorat   s long face registered a certain melancholia .     no     he said .      i don   t feel joyful .  i do feel a little apprehensive  but i   m not panicky .         neither am i .  isn   t that odd .  why aren   t we more upset than we are .         this is something we expected  golan .  something like this .      trevize turned to the screen .  it remained firmly focused on the space station .  it was larger now  which meant they were closer .   it seemed to him that it was not an impressive space station in design .  there was nothing to it that bespoke superscience .  in fact  it seemed a bit primitive .     yet it had the ship in its grip .   he said     i   m being very analytical  janov .  cool .     i like to think that i am not a coward and that i can behave well under pressure  but i tend to flatter myself .  everyone does .  i should be jumping up and down right now and sweating a little .  we may have expected something  but that doesn   t change the fact that we are helpless and that we may be killed .      pelorat said     i don   t think so  golan .  if the gaians could take over the ship at a distance  couldn   t they kill us at a distance .  if we   re still alive           but we   re not altogether untouched .  we   re too calm  i tell you .  i think they   ve tranquilized us .         why .         to keep us in good shape mentally  i think .  it   s possible they wish to question us .  after that  they may kill us .         if they are rational enough to want to question us  they may be rational enough not to kill us for no good reason .      trevize leaned back in his chair  it bent back at least   they hadn   t deprived the chair of its functioning  and placed his feet on the desk where ordinarily his hands made contact with the computer .  he said     they may be quite ingenious enough to work up what they consider a good reason .     still  if they   ve touched our minds  it hasn   t been by much .  if it were the mule  for instance  he would have made us eager to go   exalted  exultant  every fiber of ourselves crying out for arrival there .     he pointed to the space station .     do you feel that way  janov .         certainly not .         you see that i   m still in a state where i can indulge in cool  analytical reasoning .  very odd .  or can i tell .  am i in a panic  incoherent  mad   and merely under the illusion that i am indulging in cool  analytical reasoning .      pelorat shrugged .     you seem sane to me .  perhaps i am as insane as you and am under the same illusion  but that sort of argument gets us nowhere .  all humanity could share a common insanity and be immersed in a common illusion while living in a common chaos .  that can   t be disproved  but we have no choice but to follow our senses .     and then  abruptly  he said     in fact  i   ve been doing some reasoning myself .         yes .         well  we talk about gaia as a world of mules  possibly  or as the second foundation reborn .  has it occurred to you that a third alternative exists  one that is more reasonable than either of the first two .         what third alternative .      pelorat   s eyes seemed concentrating inward .  he did not look at trevize and his voice was low and thoughtful .     we have a world    gaia   that has done its best  over an indefinite period of time  to maintain a strict isolation .  it has in no way attempted to establish contact with any other world   not even the nearby worlds of the sayshell union .  it has an advanced science  in some ways  if the stories of their destruction of fleets is true and certainly their ability to control us right now bespeaks it   and yet they have made no attempt to expand their power .  they ask only to be left alone .      trevize narrowed his eyes .     so .         it   s all very inhuman .  the more than twenty thousand years of human history in space has been an uninterrupted tale of expansion and attempted expansion .  just about every known world that can be inhabited is inhabited .  nearly every world has been quarreled over in the process and nearly every world has jostled each of its neighbors at one time or another .  if gaia is so inhuman as to be so different in this respect  it may be because it really is   inhuman .      trevize shook his head .     impossible .         why impossible .     said pelorat warmly .     i   ve told you what a puzzle it is that the human race is the only evolved intelligence in the galaxy .  what if it isn   t .  might there not be one more   on one planet   that lacked the human expansionist drive .  in fact     pelorat grew more excited     what if there are a million intelligences in the galaxy  but only one that is expansionist   ourselves .  the others would all remain at home  unobtrusive  hidden           ridiculous .     said trevize .     we   d come across them .  we   d land on their worlds .  they would come in all types and stages of technology and most of them would be unable to stop us .  but we   ve never come across any of them .  space .  we   ve never even come across the ruins or relies of a nonhuman civilization  have we .  you   re the historian  so you tell me .  have we .      pelorat shook his head .     we haven   t .     but golan  there could be one .  this one .         i don   t believe it .  you say the name is gaia  which is some ancient dialectical version of the name    earth .     how can that be nonhuman .         the name    gaia    is given the planet by human beings   and who knows why .  the resemblance to an ancient word might be coincidental .     come to think of it  the very fact that we   ve been lured to gaia   as you explained in great detail some time ago   and are now being drawn in against our will is an argument in favor of the nonhumanity of the gaians .         why .  what has that to do with nonhumanity .         they   re curious about us   about humans .      trevize said     janov  you   re mad .  they   ve been living in a galaxy surrounded by humans for thousands of years .  why should they be curious right now .  why not long before .  and if right now  why us .  if they want to study human beings and human culture  why not the sayshell worlds .  why would they reach all the way to terminus for us .         they may be interested in the foundation .         nonsense     said trevize violently .     janov  you want a nonhuman intelligence and you will have one .  right now  i think that if you thought you were going to encounter nonhumans  you wouldn   t worry about having been captured  about being helpless  about being killed even   if they but gave you a little time to sate your curiosity .      pelorat began to stutter an indignant negative  then stopped  drew a deep breath  and said     well  you may be right  golan  but i   ll hold to my belief for a while just the same .  i don   t think we   ll have to wait very long to see who   s right .     look .      he pointed to the screen .  trevize   who had  in his excitement  ceased watching   now looked back .     what is it .     he said .      isn   t that a ship taking off from the station .         it   s something     admitted trevize reluctantly .     i can   t make out the details yet and i can   t magnify the view any further .  it   s at maximum magnification .     after awhile he said     it seems to be approaching us and i suppose it   s a ship .  shall we make a bet .         what sort of bet .      trevize said sardonically     if we ever get back to terminus  let   s have a big dinner for ourselves and any guests we each care to invite  up to  say  four   and it will be on me if that ship approaching us carries nonhumans and on you if it carries humans .         i   m willing     said pelorat .      done  then     and trevize peered at the screen  trying to make out details and wondering if any details could reasonably be expected to give away  beyond question  the nonhumanity  or humanity  of the beings on board .   branno   s iron gray hair lay immaculately in place and she might have been in the mayoral palace  considering her equanimity .  she showed no sign that she was deep in space for only the second time in her life .   and the first time   when she accompanied her parents on a holiday tour to kalgan   could scarcely count .  she had been only three at the time .    she said to kodell with a certain weary heaviness     it is thoobing   s job  after all  to express his opinion and to warn me .  very well  he has warned me .  i don   t hold it against him .      kodell  who had boarded the mayor   s ship in order to speak to her without the psychological difficulty of imaging  said     he   s been at his post too long .  he   s beginning to think like a sayshellian .         that   s the occupational hazard of an ambassadorship  liono .  let us wait till this is over and we   ll give him a long sabbatical and then send him on to another assignment elsewhere .  he   s a capable man .      after all  he did have the wit to forward trevize   s message without delay .      kodell smiled briefly .     yes  he told me he did it against his better judgment .     i do so because i must    he said .  you see  madam mayor  he had to  even against his better judgment  because as soon as trevize entered the space of the sayshell union  i informed ambassador thoobing to forward  at once  any and all information concerning him .         oh .     mayor branno turned in her seat to see his face more clearly .     and what made you do that .         elementary considerations  actually .  trevize was using a latemodel foundation naval vessel and the sayshellians would be bound to notice that .  he   s an undiplomatic young jackass and they would be bound to notice that .  therefore  he might get into trouble   and if there   s one thing a foundationer knows  it is that if he gets into trouble anywhere in the galaxy  he can cry out for the nearest foundation representative .  personally i wouldn   t mind seeing trevize in trouble   it might help him grow up and that would do him a great deal of good   but you   ve sent him out as your lightning rod and i wanted you to be able to estimate the nature of any lightning that might strike  so i made sure that the nearest foundation representative would keep watch over him  that   s all .         i see .  well  i understand now why thoobing reacted so strenuously .  i had sent him a similar warning .  since he heard from us both independently  one can scarcely blame him for thinking that the approach of a few foundation vessels might mean a great deal more than it actually does .     how is it  liono  you did not consult me on the matter before sending the warning .      kodell said coolly     if i involved you in everything i do  you would have no time to be mayor .  how is it that you did not inform me of your intention .      branno said sourly     if i informed you of all my intentions  liono  you would know far too much .     but it is a small matter  and so is thoobing   s alarm  and  for that matter  so is any fit that the sayshellians throw .  i am more interested in trevize .         our scouts have located compor .  he is following trevize and both are moving very cautiously toward gaia .         i have the full reports of those scouts  liono .  apparently both trevize and compor are taking gaia seriously .         everyone sneers at the superstitions concerning gaia  madam mayor  but everyone thinks     yet what if       even ambassador thoobing manages to be a little uneasy about it .  it could be a very shrewd policy on the part of the sayshellians .  a kind of protective coloration .  if one spreads stories of a mysterious and invincible world  people will shy away not only from the world  but from any other worlds close by   such as the sayshell union .         you think that is why the mule turned away from sayshell .         possibly .         surely you don   t think the foundation has held its hand from sayshell because of gaia  when there is no record that we have ever heard of the world .         i admit there   s no mention of gaia in our archives  but neither is there any other reasonable explanation for our moderation with respect to the sayshell union .         let us hope  then  that the sayshellian government  despite thoobing   s opinion to the contrary  has convinced itself   even just a little bit of gaia   s might and of its deadly nature .         why so .         because then the sayshell union will raise no objections to our moving toward gaia .  the more they resent that movement  the more they will persuade themselves that it should be permitted so that gaia will swallow us .  the lesson  they will imagine  will be a salutary one and will not be lost on future invaders .         yet what if they should be right in such a belief  mayor .  what if gaia is deadly .      branno smiled .     you raise the    yet what if       yourself  do you  liono .         i must raise all possibilities  mayor .  it is my job .         if gaia is deadly  trevize will be taken by them .  that is his job as my lightning rod .  and so may compor  i hope .         you hope .  why .         because it will make them overconfident  which should be useful to us .  they will underestimate our power and be the easier to handle .         but what if it is we who are overconfident .         we are not     said branno flatly .      these gaians   whatever they are   may be something we have no concept of and cannot properly estimate the danger of .  i merely suggest that  mayor  because even that possibility should be weighed .         indeed .  why does such a notion fall into your head  liono .         because i think you feel that  at the worst  gaia is the second foundation .  i suspect you think they are the second foundation .  however  sayshell has an interesting history  even under the empire .  sayshell alone had a measure of self rule .  sayshell alone was spared some of the worst taxations under the so called    bad emperors .     in short  sayshell seems to have had the protection of gaia  even in imperial times .         well then .         but the second foundation was brought into existence by hari seldon at the same time our foundation was .  the second foundation did not exist in imperial times   and gaia did .  gaia  therefore   is not the second foundation .  it is something else   and  just possibly  something worse .         i don   t propose to be terrified by the unknown  liono .  there are only two possible sources of danger   physical weapons and mental weapons   and we are fully prepared for both .     you get back to your ship and keep the units on the sayshellian outskirts .  this ship will move toward gaia alone  but will stay in contact with you at all times and will expect you to come to us in one jump  if necessary .     go  liono  and get that perturbed look off your face .         one last question .  are you sure you know what you   re doing .         i do     she said grimly .     i  too  have studied the history of sayshell and have seen that gaia cannot be the second foundation  but  as i told you  i have the full report of the scouts and from that           yes .         well  i know where the second foundation is located and we will take care of both  liono .  we will take care of gaia first and then trantor .        chapter seventeen  gaia    it took hours for the skip from the space station to reach the vicinity of the far star   very long hours for trevize to endure .   had the situation been normal  trevize would have tried to signal and would have expected a response .  if there had been no response  he would have taken evasive action .   since he was unarmed and there had been no response  there was nothing to do but wait .  the computer would not respond to any direction he could give it that involved anything outside the ship .   internally  at least  everything worked well .  the life support systems were in perfect order  so that he and pelorat were physically comfortable .  somehow  that didn   t help .  life dragged on and the uncertainty of what was to come was wearing him down .  he noticed with irritation that pelorat seemed calm .  as though to make it worse  while trevize felt no sense of hunger at all  pelorat opened a small container of chicken bits  which on opening had rapidly and automatically warmed itself .  now he was eating it methodically .   trevize said irritably     space  janov .  that stinks .      pelorat looked startled and sniffed at the container .     it smells all right to me  golan .      trevize shook his head .     don   t mind me .  i   m just upset .  but do use a fork .  your fingers will smell of chicken all day .      pelorat looked at his fingers with surprise .     sorry .  i didn   t notice .  i was thinking of something else .      trevize said sarcastically     would you care to guess at what type of nonhumans the creatures on the approaching ship must be .     he was ashamed that he was less calm than pelorat was .  he was a navy veteran  though he had never seen battle  of course  and pelorat was a historian .  yet his companion sat there quietly .   pelorat said     it would be impossible to imagine what direction evolution would take under conditions differing from those of earth .  the possibilities may not be infinite  but they would be so vast that they might as well be .  however  i can predict that they are not senselessly violent and they will treat us in a civilized fashion .  if that wasn   t true  we would be dead by now .         at least you can still reason  janov  my friend   you can still be tranquil .  my nerves seem to be forcing their way through whatever tranquilization they have put us under .  i have an extraordinary desire to stand up and pace .  why doesn   t that blasted ship arrive .      pelorat said     i am a man of passivity  golan .  i have spent my life doubled over records while waiting for other records to arrive .  i do nothing but wait .  you are a man of action and you are in deep pain when action is impossible .      trevize felt some of his tension leave .  he muttered     i underestimate your good sense  janov .         no  you don   t     said pelorat placidly     but even a na  ve academic can sometimes make sense out of life .         and even the cleverest politician can sometimes fail to do so .         i didn   t say that  golan .           no  but i did .     so let me become active .  i can still observe .  the approaching ship is close enough to seem distinctly primitive .         seem .      trevize said     if it   s the product of nonhuman minds and hands  what may seem primitive may  in actual fact  be merely nonhuman .         do you think it might be a nonhuman artifact .     asked pelorat  his face reddening slightly .      i can   t tell .  i suspect that artifacts  however much they may vary from culture to culture  are never quite as plastic as products of genetic differences might be .         that   s just a guess on your part .  all we know are different cultures .  we don   t know different intelligent species and therefore have no way of judging how different artifacts might be .         fish  dolphins  penguins  squids  even the ambiflexes  which are not of earthly origin   assuming the others are   all solve the problem of motion through a viscous medium by streamlining  so that their appearances are not as different as their genetic makeup might lead one to believe .  it might be so with artifacts .         the squid   s tentacles and the ambiflex   s helical vibrators     responded pelorat     are enormously different from each other  and from the fins  flippers  and limbs of vertebrates .  it might be so with artifacts .         in any case     said trevize     i feel better .  talking nonsense with you  janov  quiets my nerves .  and i suspect we   ll know what we   re getting into soon  too .  the ship is not going to be able to dock with ours and whatever is on it will come across on an old fashioned tether   or we will somehow be urged to cross to it on one   since the unilock will be useless .     unless some nonhuman will use some other system altogether .         how big is the ship .         without being able to use the ship   s computer to calculate the distance of the ship by radar  we can   t possibly know the size .      a tether snaked out toward the far star .   trevize said     either there   s a human aboard or nonhumans use the same device .  perhaps nothing but a tether can possibly work .         they might use a tube     said pelorat     or a horizontal ladder .         those are inflexible things .  it would be far too complicated to try to make contact with those .  you need something that combines strength and flexibility .      the tether made a dull clang on the far star as the solid hull  and consequently the air within  was set to vibrating .  there was the usual slithering as the other ship made the fine adjustments of speed required to bring the two into a common velocity .  the tether was motionless relative to both .   a black dot appeared on the hull of the other ship and expanded like the pupil of an eye .   trevize grunted .     an expanding diaphragm  instead of a sliding panel .         nonhuman .         not necessarily  i suppose .  but interesting .      a figure emerged .   pelorat   s lips tightened for a moment and then he said in a disappointed voice     too bad .  human .         not necessarily     said trevize calmly .     all we can make out is that there seem to be five projections .  that could be a head  two arms  and two legs   but it might not be .     wait .         what .         it moves more rapidly and smoothly than i expected .     ah .         what .         there   s some sort of propulsion .  it   s not rocketry  as nearly as i can tell  but neither is it hand over hand .  still  not necessarily human .      there seemed an incredibly long wait despite the quick approach of the figure along the tether  but there was finally the noise of contact .   trevize said     it   s coming in  whatever it is .  my impulse is to tackle it the minute it appears .     he balled a fist .      i think we had better relax     said pelorat .     it may be stronger than we .  it can control our minds .  there are surely others on the ship .  we had better wait till we know more about what we are facing .         you grow more and more sensible by the minute  janov     said trevize     and i  less and less .      they could hear the airlock moving into action and finally the figure appeared inside the ship .      about normal size     muttered pelorat .     the space suit could fit a human being .         i never saw or heard of such a design  but it doesn   t fall outside the limits of human manufacture  it seems to me .     it doesn   t say anything .      the space suited figure stood before them and a forelimb rose to the rounded helmet  which   if it were made of glass   possessed oneway transparency only .  nothing could be seen inside .   the limb touched something with a quick motion that trevize did not clearly make out and the helmet was at once detached from the rest of the suit .  it lifted off .   what was exposed was the face of a young and undeniably pretty woman .   pelorat   s expressionless face did what it could to look stupefied .  he said hesitantly     are you human .      the woman   s eyebrows shot up and her lips pouted .  there was no way of telling from the action whether she was faced with a strange language and did not understand or whether she understood and wondered at the question .   her hand moved quickly to the left side of her suit  which opened in one piece as though it were on a set of hinges .  she stepped out and the suit remained standing without content for a moment .  then  with a soft sigh that seemed almost human  it collapsed .   she looked even younger  now that she had stepped out .  her clothing was loose and translucent  with the skimpy items beneath visible as shadows .  the outer robe reached to her knees .   she was small breasted and narrow waisted  with hips rounded and full .  her thighs  which were seen in shadow  were generous  but her legs narrowed to graceful ankles .  her hair was dark and shoulderlength  her eyes brown and large  her lips full and slightly asymmetric .   she looked down at herself and then solved the problem of her understanding of the language by saying     don   t i look human .      she spoke galactic standard with just a trifle of hesitation  as though she were straining a bit to get the pronunciation quite right .   pelorat nodded and said with a small smile     i can   t deny it .  quite human .  delightfully human .      the young woman spread her arms as though inviting closer examination .     i should hope so  gentleman .  men have died for this body .         i would rather live for it     said pelorat  finding a vein of gallantry which faintly surprised him .      good choice     said the woman solemnly .     once this body is attained  all sighs become sighs of ecstasy .      she laughed and pelorat laughed with her .   trevize  whose forehead had puckered into a frown through this exchange  rapped out     how old are you .      the woman seemed to shrink a little .     twenty three    gentleman .         why have you come .  what is your purpose here .         i have come to escort you to gaia .     her command of galactic standard was slipping slightly and her vowels tended to round into diphthongs .  she made    come    sound like    comb    and    gaia    like    gay uh .         a girl to escort us .      the woman drew herself up and suddenly she had the bearing of one in charge .     i     she said     am gaia  as well as another .  it was my stint on the station .         your stint .  were you the only one on board .      proudly .     i was all that was needed .        and is it empty now .         i am no longer on it  gentleman  but it is not empty .  it is there .         it .  to what do you refer .         to the station .  it is gaia .  it doesn   t need me .  it holds your ship .         then what are you doing on the station .         it is my stint .      pelorat had taken trevize by the sleeve and had been shaken off .  he tried again .     golan     he said in an urgent half whisper .     don   t shout at her .  she   s only a girl .  let me deal with this .      trevize shook his head angrily  but pelorat said     young woman  what is your name .      the woman smiled with sudden sunniness  as though responding to the softer tone .  she said     bliss .         bliss .     said pelorat .     a very nice name .  surely that   s not all there is .         of course not .  a fine thing it would be to have one syllable .  it would be duplicated on every section and we wouldn   t tell one from another  so that the men would be dying for the wrong body .  bussenobiarella is my name in full .         now that   s a mouthful .          what .  seven syllables .  that   s not much .  i have friends with fifteen syllables in their names and they never get done trying combinations for the friend name .  i   ve stuck with bliss now ever since i turned fifteen .  my mother called me    nobby     if you can imagine such a thing .         in galactic standard     bliss    means    ecstasy    or    extreme happiness        said pelorat .      in gaian language  too .  it   s not very different from standard  and    ecstasy    is the impression i intend to convey .         my name is janov pelorat .         i know that .  and this other gentleman   the shouter   is golan trevize .  we received word from sayshell .      trevize said at once  his eyes narrow     how did you receive word .      bliss turned to look at him and said calmly     i didn   t .  gaia did .      pelorat said     miss bliss  may my partner and myself speak privately for a moment .         yes  certainly  but we have to get on with it  you know .         i won   t take long .     he pulled hard at trevize   s elbow and was reluctantly followed into the other room .   trevize said in a whisper     what   s all this .  i   m sure she can hear us in here .  she can probably read our minds  blast the creature .         whether she can or can   t  we need a bit of psychological isolation for just a moment .  look  old chap  leave her alone .  there   s nothing we can do  and there   s no use taking that out on her .  there   s probably nothing she can do either .  she   s just a messenger girl .  actually  as long as she   s on board  we   re probably safe  they wouldn   t have put her on board if they intended to destroy the ship .  keep bullying and perhaps they will destroy it   and us   after they take her off .         i don   t like being helpless     said trevize grumpily .      who does .  but acting like a bully doesn   t make you less helpless .  it just makes you a helpless bully .  oh  my dear chap  i don   t mean to be bullying you like this and you must forgive me if i   m excessively critical of you  but the girl is not to be blamed .         janov  she   s young enough to be your youngest daughter .      pelorat straightened .     all the more reason to treat her gently .  nor do i know what you imply by the statement .      trevize thought a moment  then his face cleared .     very well .  you   re right .  i   m wrong .  it is irritating  though  to have them send a girl .  they might have sent a military officer  for instance  and given us a sense of some value  so to speak .  just a girl .  and she keeps placing responsibility on gaia .         she   s probably referring to a ruler who takes the name of the planet as an honorific   or else she   s referring to the planetary council .  we   ll find out  but probably not by direct questioning .         men have died for her body .     said trevize .     huh .     she   s bottom heavy .         no one is asking you to die for it  golan     said pelorat gently .     come .  allow her a sense of self mockery .  i consider it amusing and good natured  myself .      they found bliss at the computer  bending down and staring at its component parts with her hands behind her back as though she feared touching it .   she looked up as they entered  ducking their heads under the low lintel .     this is an amazing ship     she said .     i don   t understand half of what i see  but if you   re going to give me a greeting present  this is it .  it   s beautiful .  it makes my ship look awful .      her face took on a look of ardent curiosity .     are you really from the foundation .         how do you know about the foundation .     asked pelorat .      we learn about it in school .  mostly because of the mule .         why because of the mule  bliss .         he   s one of us  gentle    what syllable of your name may i use  gentleman .      pelorat said     either jan or pel .  which do you prefer .         he   s one of us  pel     said bliss with a comradely smile .     he was born on gaia  but no one seems to know where exactly .      trevize said     i imagine he   s a gaian hero  bliss  eh .     he had become determinedly  almost aggressively  friendly and cast a placating glance in pelorat   s direction .     call me trev     he added .      oh no     she said at once .     he   s a criminal .  he left gaia without permission  and no one should do that .  no one knows how he did it .  but he left  and i guess that   s why he came to a bad end .  the foundation beat him in the end .         the second foundation .     said trevize .      is there more than one .  i suppose if i thought about it i would know  but i   m not interested in history  really .  the way i look at it is  i   m interested in what gaia thinks best .  if history just goes past me  it   s because there are enough historians or that i   m not well adapted to it .  i   m probably being trained as a space technician myself .  i keep being assigned to stints like this and i seem to like it and it stands to reason i wouldn   t like it if        she was speaking rapidly  almost breathlessly  and trevize had to make an effort to insert a sentence .     who   s gaia .      bliss looked puzzled at that .     just gaia .     please  pel and trev  let   s get on with it .  we   ve got to get to the surface .         we   re going there  aren   t we .         yes  but slowly .  gaia feels you can move much more rapidly if you use the potential of your ship .  would you do that .         we could     said trevize grimly .     but if i get the control of the ship back  wouldn   t i be more likely to zoom off in the opposite direction .      bliss laughed .     you   re funny .  of course  you can   t go in any direction gaia doesn   t want you to go .  but you can go faster in the direction gaia does want you to go .  see .         we see     said trevize     and i   ll try to control my sense of humor .  where do i land on the surface .         it doesn   t matter .  you just head downward and you   ll land at the right place .  gain will see to that .      pelorat said     and will you stay with us  bliss  and see that we are treated well .         i suppose i can do that .  let   s see now  the usual fee for my services   i mean that kind of services   can be entered on my balancecard .         and the other kind of services .      bliss giggled .     you   re a nice old man .     pelorat winced .   bliss reacted to the swoop down to gaia with a na  ve excitement .  she said     there   s no feeling of acceleration .         it   s a gravitic drive     said pelorat .     everything accelerates together  ourselves included  so we don   t feel anything .         but how does it work  pel .      pelorat shrugged .     i think trev knows     he said     but i don   t think he   s really in a mood to talk about it .      trevize had dropped down gaia   s gravity well almost recklessly .  the ship responded to his direction  as bliss had warned him  in a partial manner .  an attempt to cross the lines of gravitic force obliquely was accepted   but only with a certain hesitation .  an attempt to rise upward was utterly ignored .   the ship was still not his .   pelorat said mildly     aren   t you going downward rather rapidly  golan .      trevize  with a kind of flatness to his voice  attempting to avoid anger  more for pelorat   s sake  than anything else  said     the young lady says that gaia will take care of us .      bliss said     surely  pel .  gaia wouldn   t let this ship do anything that wasn   t safe .  is there anything to eat on board .         yes indeed     said pelorat .     what would you like .         no meat  pel     said bliss in a businesslike way     but i   ll take fish or eggs  along with any vegetables you might have .         some of the food we have is sayshellian  bliss     said pelorat .     i   m not sure i know what   s in it  but you might like it .         well  i   ll taste some     said bliss dubiously .      are the people on gaia vegetarian .     asked pelorat .      a lot are .     bliss nodded her head vigorously .     it depends on what nutrients the body needs in particular cases .  lately i haven   t been hungry for meat  so i suppose i don   t need any .  and i haven   t been aching for anything sweet .  cheese tastes good  and shrimp .  i think i probably need to lose weight .     she slapped her right buttock with a resounding noise .     i need to lose five or six pounds right here .         i don   t see why     said pelorat .     it gives you something comfortable to sit on .      bliss twisted to look down at her rear as best she might .     oh well  it doesn   t matter .  weight goes up or down as it ought .  i shouldn   t concern myself .      trevize was silent because he was struggling with the far star .  he had hesitated a bit too long for orbit and the lower limits of the planetary exosphere were now screaming past the ship .  little by little  the ship was escaping from his control altogether .  it was as though something else had learned to handle the gravitic engines .  the far star  acting apparently by itself  curved upward into thinner air and slowed rapidly .  it then took up a path on its own that brought it into a gentle downward curve .   bliss had ignored the edgy sound of air resistance and sniffed delicately at the steam rising from the container .  she said     it must be all right  pd  because if it weren   t  it wouldn   t smell right and i wouldn   t want to eat it .     she put a slim finger into it and then licked at the finger .     you guessed correctly  pd .  it   s shrimp or something like it .  good .      with a gesture of dissatisfaction  trevize abandoned the computer .      young woman     he said  as though seeing her for the first time .      my name is bliss     said bliss firmly .      bliss  then .  you knew our names .         yes  trev .         how did you know them .         it was important that i know them  in order for me to do my job .  so i knew them .         do you know who munn li compor is .         i would   if it were important for me to know who he is .  since i do not know who he is  mr .  compor is not coming here .  for that  matter     she paused a moment     no one is coming here but you two .         we   ll see .      he was looking down .  it was a cloudy planet .  there wasn   t a solid layer of cloud  but it was a broken layer that was remarkably evenly scattered and offered no clear view of any part of the planetary surface .   he switched to microwave and the radarscope glittered .  the surface was almost an image of the sky .  it seemed a world of islands    rather like terminus  but more so .  none of the islands was very large and none was very isolated .  it was something of an approach to a planetary archipelago .  the ship   s orbit was well inclined to the equatorial plane  but he saw no sign of ice caps .   neither were there the unmistakable marks of uneven population distribution  as would be expected  for instance  in the illumination of the night side .      will i be coming down near the capital city  bliss .     asked trevize .   bliss said indifferently     gaia will put you down somewhere convenient .         i   d prefer a big city .         do you mean a large people grouping .         yes .         it   s up to gaia .      the ship continued its downward path and trevize tried to find amusement in guessing on which island it would land .   whichever it might be  it appeared they would be landing within the hour .   the ship landed in a quiet  almost feathery manner  without a moment of jarring  without one anomalous gravitational effect .  they stepped out  one by one  first bliss  then pelorat  and finally trevize .   the weather was comparable to early summer at terminus city .  there was a mild breeze and with what seemed to be a late morning sun shining brightly down from a mottled sky .  the ground was green underfoot and in one direction there were the serried rows of  trees that bespoke an orchard  while in the other there was the distant line of seashore .   there was the low hum of what might have been insect life  a flash of bird   or some small flying creature   above and to one side  and the clack clack of what might have been some farm instrument .   pelorat was the first to speak and he mentioned nothing he either saw or heard .  instead  he drew in his breath raspingly and said     ah  it smells good  like fresh made applesauce .      trevize said     that   s probably an apple orchard we   re looking at and  for all we know  they   re making applesauce .         on your ship  on the other hand     said bliss     it smelled like    well  it smelled terrible .         you didn   t complain when you were on it     growled trevize .      i had to be polite .  i was a guest on your ship .         what   s wrong with staying polite .         i   m on my own world now .  you   re the guest .  you be polite .      pelorat said     she   s probably right about the smell  golan .  is there any way of airing out the ship .         yes     said trevize with a snap .     it can be done   if this little creature can assure us that the ship will not be disturbed .  she has already shown us she can exert unusual power over the ship .      bliss drew herself up to her full height .     i   m not exactly little and if leaving your ship alone is what it takes to get it cleaned up  i assure you leaving it alone will be a pleasure .         and then can we be taken to whoever it is that you speak of as gaia .     said trevize .   bliss looked amused .     i don   t know if you   re going to believe this  trev .  i   m gaia .      trevize stared .  he had often heard the phrase    collect one   s thoughts    used metaphorically .  for the first time in his life  he felt as though he were engaged in the process literally .  finally he said     you .         yes .  and the ground .  and those trees .  and that rabbit over there in the grass .  and the man you can see through the trees .  the whole planet and everything on it is gaia .  we   re all individuals   we   re all separate organisms   but we all share an overall consciousness .  the inanimate planet does so least of all  the various forms of life to a varying degree  and human beings most of all   but we all share .      pelorat said     i think  trevize  that she means gaia is some sort of group consciousness .      trevize nodded .     i gathered that .     in that case  bliss  who runs this world .      bliss said     it runs itself .  those trees grow in rank and file of their own accord .  they multiply only to the extent that is needed to replace those that for any reason die .  human beings harvest the apples that are needed  other animals  including insects  eat their share    and only their share .         the insects know what their share is  do they .     said trevize .      yes  they do   in a way .  it rains when it is necessary and occasionally it rains rather hard when that is necessary   and occasionally there   s a siege of dry weather when that is necessary .         and the rain knows what to do  does it .         yes  it does     said bliss very seriously .     in your own body  don   t all the different cells know what to do .  when to grow and when to stop growing .  when to form certain substances and when not to    and when they form them  just how much to form  neither more nor less .  each cell is  to a certain extent  an independent chemical factory  but all draw from a common fund of raw materials brought to it by a common transportation system  all deliver wastes into common channels  and all contribute to an overall group consciousness .      pelorat said with a certain enthusiasm     but that   s remarkable .  you are saying that the planet is a superorganism and that you are a cell of that superorganism .         i   m making an analogy  not an identity .  we are the analog of cells  but we are not identical with cells   do you understand .         in what way     said trevize     are you not cells .         we are ourselves made up of cells and have a group consciousness  as far as cells are concerned .  this group consciousness  this consciousness of an individual organism   a human being  in my case           with a body men die for .         exactly .  my consciousness is far advanced beyond that of any individual cell   incredibly far advanced .  the fact that we  in turn  are part of a still greater group consciousness on a higher level does not reduce us to the level of cells .  i remain a human being   but above us is a group consciousness as far beyond my grasp as my consciousness is beyond that of one of the muscle cells of my biceps .      trevize said     surely someone ordered our ship to be taken .         no  not someone .  gaia ordered it .  all of us ordered it .         the trees and the ground  too  bliss .         they contributed very little  but they contributed .  look  if a musician writes a symphony  do you ask which particular cell in his body ordered the symphony written and supervised its construction .      pelorat said     and  i  . take it  the group mind  so to speak  of the group consciousness is much stronger than an individual mind  just as a muscle is much stronger than an individual muscle cell .  consequently gaia can capture our ship at a distance by controlling our computer  even though no individual mind on the planet could have done so .         you understand perfectly  pel     said bliss .      and i understand it  too     said trevize .     it is not that hard to understand .  but what do you want of us .  we have not come to attack you .  we have come seeking information .  why have you seized us .         to talk to you .         you might have talked to us on the ship .      bliss shook her head gravely     i am not the one to do it .         aren   t you part of the group mind .         yes  but i cannot fly like a bird  buzz like an insect  or grow as tall as a tree .  i do what it is best for me to do and it is not best that i give you the information   though the knowledge could easily be assigned to me .         who decided not to assign it to you .         we all did .         who will give us the information .         and who is dom .         well     said bliss .     his full name is endomandiovizamarondeyaso   and so on .  different people call him different syllables at different times  but i know him as dom and i think you two will use that syllable as well .  he probably has a larger share of gaia than anyone on the planet and he lives on this island .  he asked to see you and it was allowed .         who allowed it .     asked trevize   and answered himself at once     yes  i know  you all did .      bliss nodded .   pelorat said     when will we be seeing dom  bliss .         right away .  if you follow me  i   ll take you to him now  pel .  and you  too  of course  trev .         and will you leave  then .     asked pelorat .      you don   t want me to  pel .         actually  no .         there you are     said bliss as they followed her along a smoothly paved road that skirted the orchard .     men grow addicted to me on short order .  even dignified elderly men are overcome with boyish ardor .      pelorat laughed .     i wouldn   t count on much boyish ardor  bliss  but if i had it i could do worse than have it on your account  i think .      bliss said     oh  don   t discount your boyish ardor .  i work wonders .      trevize said impatiently     once we get to where we   re going  how long will we have to wait for this dom .         he will be waiting for you .  after all  dom through gaia has worked for years to bring you here .      trevize stopped in midstep and looked quickly at pelorat  who quietly mouthed  you were right .   bliss  who was looking straight ahead  said calmly     i know  trev  that you have suspected that i we gaia was interested in you .            i we gaia    .     said pelorat softly .   she turned to smile at him .     we have a whole complex of different pronouns to express the shades of individuality that exist on gaia .  i could explain them to you  but till then    i we gaia    gets across what i mean in a groping sort of way .     please move on  trev .  dom is waiting and i don   t wish to force your legs to move against your will .  it is an uncomfortable feeling if you   re not used to it .      trevize moved on .  his glance at bliss was compounded of the deepest suspicion .   dom was an elderly man .  he recited the two hundred and fiftythree syllables of his name in a musical flowing of tone and emphasis .      in a way     he said     it is a brief biography of myself .  it tells the hearer   or reader  or senser   who i am  what part i have played in the whole  what i have accomplished .  for fifty years and more  however  i have been satisfied to be referred to as dom .  when there are other doms at issue  i can be called domandio   and in my various professional relationships other variants are used .  once a gaian year    on my birthday   my full name is recited in mind  as i have just recited it for you in voice .  it is very effective  but it is personally embarrassing .      he was tall and thin   almost to the point of emaciation .  his deep set eyes sparkled with anomalous youth  though he moved rather slowly .  his jutting nose was thin and long and flared at the nostrils .  his hands  prominently veined though they were  showed no signs of arthritic disability .  he wore a long robe that was as gray as his hair .  it descended to his ankles and his sandals left his toes bare .   trevize said     how old are you  sir .         please address me as dom  trev .  to use other modes of address induces formality and inhibits the free exchange of ideas between you and me .  in galactic standard years  i am just past ninety three  but the real celebration will come not very many months from now  when i reach the ninetieth anniversary of my birth in gaian years .         i would not have guessed you at more than seventy five  s   dom     said trevize .      by gaian standards i am not remarkable  either in years or in appearance of years  trev .     but come  have we eaten .      pelorat looked down at his plate  on which perceptible remnants of a most unremarkable and indifferently prepared meal remained  and said in a diffident manner     dom  may i attempt to ask an embarrassing question .  of course  if it   s offensive  you will please say so  and i will withdraw it .         go ahead     said dom  smiling .     i am anxious to explain to you anything about gaia which arouses your curiosity .         why .     said trevize at once .      because you are honored guests    may i have pel   s question .      pelorat said     since all things on gaia share in the group consciousness  how is it that you   one element of the group   can eat this  which was clearly another element .         true .  but all things recycle .  we must eat and everything we can eat  plant as well as animal   even the inanimate seasonings   are part of gaia .  but  then  you see  nothing is killed for pleasure or sport  nothing is killed with unnecessary pain .  and i   m afraid we make no attempt to glorify our meal preparations  for no gaian would eat except that one must .  you did not enjoy this meal  pel .  trev .  well  meals are not to enjoy .      then  too  what is eaten remains  after all  part of the planetary consciousness .  insofar as portions of it are incorporated into my body  it will participate in a larger share of the total consciousness .  when i die  i  too  will be eaten   even if only by decay bacteria    and i will then participate in a far smaller share of the total .  but someday  parts of me will be parts of other human beings  parts of many .      pelorat said     a sort of transmigration of souls .         of what  pel .         i speak of an old myth that is current on some worlds .         ah  i don   t know of it .  you must tell me on some occasion .      trevize said     but your individual consciousness   whatever it is about you that is dom   will never fully reassemble .         no  of course not .  but does that matter .  i will still be part of gaia and that is what counts .  there are mystics among us who wonder if we should take measures to develop group memories of past existences  but the sense of gaia is that this cannot be done in any practical way and would serve no useful purpose .  it would merely blur present consciousness .     of course  as conditions change  the sense of gaia may change  too  but i find no chance of that in the foreseeable future .         why must you die  dom .     asked trevize .     look at you in your nineties .  could not the group consciousness        for the first time  dom frowned .     never     he said .     i can contribute only so much .  each new individual is a reshuffling of molecules and genes into something new .  new talents  new abilities  new contributions to gaia .  we must have them   and the only way we can is to make room .  i have done more than most  but even i have my limit and it is approaching .  there is no more desire to live past one   s time than to die before it .      and then  as if realizing he had lent a suddenly somber note to the evening  he rose and stretched his arms out to the two .     come  trev   pel   let us move into my studio where i can show you some of my personal art objects .  you won   t blame an old man for his little vanities  i hope .      he led the way into another room where  on a small circular table  there were a group of smoky lenses connected in pairs .      these     said dom     are participations i have designed .  i am not one of the masters  but i specialize in inanimates  which few of the masters bother with .      pelorat said     may i pick one up .  are they fragile .         no no .  bounce them on the floor if you like .     or perhaps you had better not .  concussion could dull the sharpness of the vision .         how are they used  dom .         you put them over your eyes .  they   ll cling .  they do not transmit light .  quite the contrary .  they obscure light that might otherwise distract you   though the sensations do reach your brain by way of the optic nerve .  essentially your consciousness is sharpened and is allowed to participate in other facets of gaia .  in other words  if you look at that wall  you will experience that wall as it appears to itself .         fascinating     muttered pelorat .     may i try that .         certainly  pel .  you may take one at random .  each is a different construct that shows the wall   or any other inanimate object you look at   in a different aspect of the object   s consciousness .      pelorat placed one pair over his eyes and they clung there at once .  he started at the touch and then remained motionless for a long time .   dom said     when you are through  place your hands on either side of the participation and press them toward each other .  it will come right off .      pelorat did so  blinked his eyes rapidly  then rubbed them .   dom said     what did you experience .      pelorat said     it   s hard to describe .  the wall seemed to twinkle and glisten and  at times  it seemed to turn fluid .  it seemed to have ribs and changing symmetries .  i   i   m sorry  dom  but i did not find it attractive .      dom sighed .     you do not participate in gaia  so you would not see what we see .  i had rather feared that .  too bad .  i assure you that although these participations are enjoyed primarily for their aesthetic value  they have their practical uses  too .  a happy wall is a long lived wall  a practical wall  a useful wall .         a happy wall .     said trevize  smiling slightly .   dom said     there is a dim sensation that a wall experiences that is analogous to what    happy    means to us .  a wall is happy when it is well designed  when it rests firmly on its foundation  when its symmetry balances its parts and produces no unpleasant stresses .  good design can be worked out on the mathematical principles of mechanics  but the use of a proper participation can fine tune it down to virtually atomic dimensions .  no sculptor can possibly produce a  first class work of art here on gaia without a well crafted participation and the ones i produce of this particular type are considered excellent   if i do say so myself .      animate participations  which are not my field     and dom was going on with the kind of excitement one expects in someone riding his hobby     give us  by analogy  a direct experience of ecological balance .  the ecological balance on gaia is rather simple  as it is on all worlds  but here  at least  we have the hope of making it more complex and thus enriching the total consciousness enormously .      trevize held up his hand in order to forestall pelorat and wave him into silence .  he said     how do you know that a planet can bear a more complex ecological balance if they all have simple ones .         ah     said dom  his eyes twinkling shrewdly     you are testing the old man .  you know as well as i do that the original home of humanity  earth  had an enormously complex ecological balance .  it is only the secondary worlds   the derived worlds   that are simple .      pelorat would not be kept silent .     but that is the problem i have set myself in life .  why was it only earth that bore a complex ecology .  what distinguished it from other worlds .  why did millions upon millions of other worlds in the galaxy   worlds that were capable of bearing life   develop only an undistinguished vegetation  together with small and unintelligent animal life forms .      dom said     we have a tale about that   a fable  perhaps .  i cannot vouch for its authenticity .  in fact  on the face of it  it sounds like fiction .      it was at this point that bliss   who had not participated in the meal   entered  smiling at pelorat .  she was wearing a silvery blouse  very sheer .   pelorat rose at once .     i thought you had left us .         not at all .  i had reports to make out  work to do .  may i join you now  dom .      dom had also risen  though trevize remained seated  .     you are entirely welcome and you ravish these aged eyes .         it is for your ravishment that i put on this blouse .  pel is above such things and trev dislikes them .      pelorat said     if you think i am above such things  bliss  i may surprise you someday .         what a delightful surprise that would be     bliss said  and sat down .  the two men did as well .     please don   t let me interrupt you .      dom said     i was about to tell our guests the story of eternity .     to understand it  you must first understand that there are many different universes that can exist   virtually an infinite number .  every single event that takes place can take place or not take place  or can take place in this fashion or in that fashion  and each of an enormous number of alternatives will result in a future course of events that are distinct to at least some degree .      bliss might not have come in just now  or she might have been with us a little earlier  or much earlier  or having come in now  she might have worn a different blouse  or even in this blouse  she might not have smiled roguishly at elderly men as is her kindhearted custom .  in each of these alternatives   or in each of a very large number of other alternatives of this one event   the universe would have taken a different track thereafter  and so on for every other variation of every other event  however minor .      trevize stirred restlessly .     i believe this is a common speculation in quantum mechanics   a very ancient one  in fact .         ah  you   ve heard of it .  but let us go on .  imagine it is possible for human beings to freeze all the infinite number of universes  to step from one to another at will  and to choose which one should be made    real      whatever that word means in this connection .      trevize said     i hear your words and can even imagine the concept you describe  but i cannot make myself believe that anything like this could ever happen .          nor i  on the whole     said dom     which is why i say that it would all seem to be a fable .  nevertheless  the fable states that there were those who could step out of time and examine the endless strands of potential reality .  these people were called the eternals and when they were out of time they were said to be in eternity .      it was their task to choose a reality that would be most suitable to humanity .  they modified endlessly   and the story goes into great detail  for i must tell you that it has been written in the form of an epic of inordinate length .  eventually they found  so it is said  a universe in which earth was the only planet in the entire galaxy on which could be found a complex ecological system  together with the development of an intelligent species capable of working out a high technology .      that  they decided  was the situation in which humanity could be most secure .  they froze that strand of events as reality and then ceased operations .  now we live in a galaxy that has been settled by human beings only  and  to a large extent  by the plants  animals  and microscopic life that they carry with them   voluntarily or inadvertently   from planet to planet and which usually overwhelm the indigenous life .      somewhere in the dim mists of probability there are other realities in which the galaxy is host to many intelligences  but they are unreachable .  we in our reality are alone .  from every action and every event in our reality  there are new branches that set off  with only one in each separate case being a continuation of reality  so that there are vast numbers of potential universes   perhaps an infinite number   stemming from ours  but all of them are presumably alike in containing the one intelligence galaxy in which we live .     or perhaps i should say that all but a vanishingly small percentage are alike in this way  for it is dangerous to rule out anything where the possibilities approach the infinite .      he stopped  shrugged slightly  and added     at least  that   s the story .  it dates back to before the founding of gaia .  i don   t vouch for its truth .      the three others had listened intently .  bliss nodded her head  as though it were something she had heard before and she were checking the accuracy of dom   s account .   pelorat reacted with a silent solemnity for the better part of a minute and then balled his fist and brought it down upon the arm of his chair .      no     he said is a strangled tone     that affects nothing .  there   s no way of demonstrating the truth of the story by observation or by reason  so it can   t ever be anything but a piece of speculation  but aside from that    suppose it   s true .  the universe we live in is still one in which only earth has developed a rich life and an intelligent species  so that in this universe   whether it is the all in all or only one out of an infinite number of possibilities   there must be something unique in the nature of the planet earth .  we should still want to know what that uniqueness is .      in the silence that followed  it was trevize who finally stirred and shook his head .      no  janov     he said     that   s not the way it works .  let us say that the chances are one in a billion trillion   one in io     that out of the billion of habitable planets in the galaxy only earth    through the workings of sheer chance   would happen to develop a rich ecology and  eventually  intelligence .  if that is so  then one in      of the various strands of potential realities would represent  such a galaxy and the eternals picked it .  we live  therefore  in a universe in which earth is the only planet to develop a complex ecology  an intelligent species  a high technology   not because there is something special about earth  but because simply by chance it developed on earth and nowhere else .      i suppose  in fact     trevize went on thoughtfully     that there are strands of reality in which only gaia has developed an intelligent species  or only sayshell  or only terminus  or only some planet which in this reality happens to bear no life at all .  and all of these very special cases are a vanishingly small percentage of the total number of realities in which there is more than one intelligent species in the galaxy .     i suppose that if the eternals had looked long enough they would have found a potential strand of reality in which every single habitable planet had developed an intelligent species .      pelorat said     might you not also argue that a reality had been found in which earth was for some reason not as it was in other strands  but specially suited in some way for the development of intelligence .  in fact  you can go further and say that a reality had been found in which the whole galaxy was not as it was in other strands  but was somehow in such a state of development that only earth could produce intelligence .      trevize said     you might argue so  but i would suppose that my version makes more sense .         that   s a purely subjective decision  of course       began pelorat with some heat  but dom interrupted  saying    this is logic chopping .  come  let us not spoil what is proving  at least for me  a pleasant and leisurely evening .      pelorat endeavored to relax and to allow his heat to drain away .  he smiled finally and said     as you say  dom .      trevize  who had been casting glances at bliss  who sat with mocking demurity  hands in her lap  now said     and how did this world come to be  dom .  gaia  with its group consciousness .      dom   s old head leaned back and he laughed in a high pitched manner .  his face crinkled as he said     fables again .  i think about that sometimes  when i read what records we have on human history .  no matter how carefully records are kept and filed and computerized  they grow fuzzy with time .  stories grow by accretion .  tales accumulate   like dust .  the longer the time lapse  the dustier the history   until it degenerates into fables .      pelorat said     we historians are familiar with the process  dom .  there is a certain preference for the fable .     the falsely dramatic drives out the truly dull     said liebel gennerat about fifteen centuries ago .  it   s called gennerat   s law now .         is it .     said dom .     and i thought the notion was a cynical invention of my own .  well  gennerat   s law fills our past history with glamour and uncertainty .     do you know what a robot is .         we found out on sayshell     said trevize dryly .      you saw one .         no .  we were asked the question and  when we answered in the negative  it was explained to us .         i understand .     humanity once lived with robots  you know  but it didn   t work well .         so we were told .         the robots were deeply indoctrinated with what are called the three laws of robotics  which date back into prehistory .  there are several versions of what those three laws might have been .  the orthodox view has the following reading        a robot may not harm a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law     a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .         as robots grew more intelligent and versatile  they interpreted these laws  especially the all overriding first  more and more generously and assumed  to a greater and greater degree  the role of protector of humanity .  the protection stifled people and grew unbearable .      the robots were entirely kind .  their labors were clearly humane and were meant entirely for the benefit of all   which somehow made them all the more unbearable .      every robotic advance made the situation worse .  robots were developed with telepathic capacity  but that meant that even human thought could be monitored  so that human behavior became still more dependent on robotic oversight .      again robots grew steadily more like human beings in appearance  but they were unmistakably robots in behavior and being humanoid made them more repulsive .  so  of course  it had to come to an end .         why    of course    .     asked pelorat  who had been listening intently .   dom said     it   s a matter of following the logic to the bitter end .  eventually the robots grew advanced enough to become just sufficiently human to appreciate why human beings should resent being deprived of everything human in the name of their own good .  in the long run  the robots were forced to decide that humanity might be better off caring for themselves  however carelessly and ineffectively .      therefore  it is said  it was the robots who established eternity somehow and became the eternals .  they located a reality in which they felt that human beings could be as secure as possible   alone in the galaxy .  then  having done what they could to guard us and in order to fulfill the first law in the truest sense  the robots of their own accord ceased to function and ever since we have been human beings   advancing  however we can  alone .      dom paused .  he looked from trevize to pelorat  and then said     well  do you believe all that .      trevize shook his head slowly .     no .  there is nothing like this in any historical record i have ever heard of .  how about you  janov .      pelorat said     there are myths that are similar in some ways .         come  janov  there are myths that would match anything that any of us can make up  given sufficiently ingenious interpretation .  i   m talking about history   reliable records .         oh well .  nothing there  as far as i know .      dom said     i   m not surprised .  before the robots withdrew  many parties of human beings left to colonize robotless worlds in deeper space  in order to take their own measures for freedom .  they came particularly from overcrowded earth  with its long history of resistance to robots .  the new worlds were founded fresh and they did not even want to remember their bitter humiliation as children under robot nursemaids .  they kept no records of it and they forgot .      trevize said     this is unlikely .      pelorat turned to him .     no  golan .  it   s not at all unlikely .  societies create their own history and tend to wipe out lowly beginnings  either by forgetting them or inventing totally fictitious heroic rescues .  the imperial government made attempts to suppress knowledge of the pre imperial past in order to strengthen the mystic aura of eternal rule .  then  too  there are almost no records of the days  before hyperspatial travel   and you know that the very existence of earth is unknown to most people today .      trevize said     you can   t have it both ways  janov .  if the galaxy has forgotten the robots  how is it that gaia remembers .      bliss intervened with a sudden lilt of soprano laughter .     we   re different .         yes .     said trevize .     in what way .      dom said     now  bliss  leave this to me .  we are different  men of terminus .  of all the refugee groups fleeing from robotic domination  we who eventually reached gaia  following in the track of others who reached sayshell  were the only ones who had learned the craft of telepathy from the robots .      it is a craft  you know .  it is inherent in the human mind  but it must be developed in a very subtle and difficult manner .  it takes many generations to reach its full potential  but once well begun  it feeds on itself .  we have been at it for over twenty thousand years and the sense of gaia is that full potential has even now not been reached .  it was long ago that our development of telepathy made us aware of group consciousness   first only of human beings  then animals  then plants  and finally  not many centuries ago  the inanimate structure of the planet itself .      because we traced this back to the robots  we did not forget them .  we considered them not our nursemaids but our teachers .  we felt they had opened our mind to something we would never for one moment want them closed to .  we remember them with gratitude .      trevize said     but just as once you were children to the robots  now you are children to the group consciousness .  have you not lost humanity now  as you had then .         it is different  trev .  what we do now is our own choice   our own choice .  that is what counts .  it is not forced on us from outside  but is developed from the inside .  it is something we never forget .  and we are different in another way  too .  we are unique in the galaxy .  there is no world like gaia .         how can you be sure .         we would know  trev .  we would detect a world consciousness such as ours even at the other end of the galaxy .  we can detect the beginnings of such a consciousness in your second foundation  for instance  though not until two centuries ago .         at the time of the mule .         yes .  one of ours .     dom looked grim .     he was an aberrant and he left us .  we were na  ve enough to think that was not possible  so we did not act in time to stop him .  then  when we turned our attention to the outside worlds  we became aware of what you call the second foundation and we left it to them .      trevize stared blankly for several moments  then muttered     there go our history books .     he shook his head and said in a louder tone of voice     that was rather cowardly of gaia  wasn   t it  to do so .     said trevize .     he was your responsibility .         you are right .  but once we finally turned our eyes upon the galaxy  we saw what until then we had been blind to  so that the tragedy of the mule proved a life saving matter to us .  it was then that we recognized that eventually a dangerous crisis would come upon us .  and it has   but not before we were able to take measures  thanks to the incident of the mule .         what sort of crisis .         one that threatens us with destruction .         i can   t believe that .  you held off the empire  the mule  and sayshell .  you have a group consciousness that can pluck a ship out of space at a distance of millions of kilometers .  what can you have to fear .     look at bliss .  she doesn   t look the least bit perturbed .  she doesn   t think there   s a crisis .      bliss had placed one shapely leg over the arm of the chair and wriggled her toes at him .     of course i   m not worried  trev .  you   ll handle it .      trev said forcefully     me .      dom said     gaia has brought you here by means of a hundred gentle manipulations .  it is you who must face our crisis .      trev stared at him and slowly his face turned from stupefaction into gathering rage .     me .     why  in all of space  me .  i have nothing to do with this .         nevertheless  trev     said dom with an almost hypnotic calmness     you .  only you .  in all of space  only you .        chapter eighteen  collision    stor gendebal was edging toward gaia almost as cautiously as trevize had   and now that its star was a perceptible disc and could be viewed only through strong filters  he paused to consider .   sura novi sat to one side  looking up at him now and then in a timorous manner .   she said softly     master .         what is it  novi .     he asked abstractedly .      are you unhappy .      he looked up at her quickly .     no .  concerned .  remember that word .  i am trying to decide whether to move in quickly or to wait longer .  shall i be very brave  novi .         i think you are very brave all times  master .         to be very brave is sometimes to be foolish .      novi smiled .     how can a master scholar be foolish .     that is a sun  is it not  master .     she pointed to the screen .   gendibal nodded .   novi said  after an irresolute pause     is it the sun that shines on trantor .  is it the hamish sun .      gendibal said     no  novi .  it is a far different sun .  there are many suns  billions of them .         ah .  i had known this with my head .  i could not make myself believe  however .  how is it  master  that one can know with the head    and yet not believe .      gendibal smiled faintly     in your head  novi       he began and  automatically  as he said that  he found himself in her head .  he stroked it gently  as he always did  when he found himself there    just a soothing touch of mental tendrils to keep her calm and untroubled   and he would then have left again  as he always did  had not something drawn him back .   what he sensed was indescribable in any but mentalic terms but  metaphorically  novi   s brain glowed .  it was the faintest possible glow .   it would not be there except for the existence of a mentalic field imposed from without   a mentalic field of an intensity so small that the finest receiving function of gendibal   s own well trained mind could just barely detect it  even against the utter smoothness of novi   s mentalic structure .   he said sharply     novi  how do you feel .      her eyes opened wide .     i feel well  master .         are you dizzy  confused .  close your eyes and sit absolutely still until i say     now .      obediently she closed her eyes .  carefully gendibal brushed away all extraneous sensations from her mind  quieted her thought  soothed her emotions  stroked   stroked    he left nothing but the glow and it was so faint that he could almost persuade himself it was not there .      now     he said and novi opened her eyes .      how do you feel  novi .         very calm  master .  rested .      it was clearly too feeble for it to have any noticeable effect on her .  he turned to the computer and wrestled with it .  he had to admit to himself that he and the computer did not mesh very well together .  perhaps it was because he was too used to using his mind directly to be able to work through an intermediary .  but he was looking for a ship  not a mind  and the initial search could be done more efficiently with the help of the computer .   and he found the sort of ship he suspected might be present .  it was half a million kilometers away and it was much like his own in design  but it was much larger and more elaborate .   once it was located with the computer   s help  gendibal could allow his mind to take over directly .  he sent it outward   tightbeamed   and with it felt  or the mentalic equivalent of    felt     the ship  inside and out .   he then sent his mind toward the planet gaia  approaching it more closely by several millions of kilometers of space   and withdrew .  neither process was sufficient in itself to tell him  unmistakably  which   if either   was the source of the field .   he said     novi  i would like you to sit next to me for what is to follow .         master  is there danger .         you are not to be in any way concerned  novi .  i will see to it that you are safe and secure .         master  i am not concerned that i be safe and secure .  if there is danger  i want to be able to help you .      gendibal softened .  he said     novi  you have already helped .  because of you  i became aware of a very small thing it was important to be aware of .  without you  i might have blundered rather deeply into a bog and might have had to pull out only through a great deal of trouble .         have i done this with my mind  master  as you once explained .     asked novi  astonished .      quite so  novi .  no instrument could have been more sensitive .  my own mind is not  it is too full of complexity .      delight filled novi   s face .     i am so grateful i can help .      gendibal smiled and nodded   and then subsided into the somber knowledge that he would need other help as well .  something childish within him objected .  the job was his   his alone .   yet it could not be his alone .  the odds were climbing     on trantor  quindor shandess felt the responsibility of first speakerhood resting upon him with a suffocating weight .  since gendibal   s ship had vanished into the darkness beyond the atmosphere  he had called no meetings of the table .  he had been lost in his own thoughts .   had it been wise to allow gendibal to go off on his own .  gendibal was brilliant  but not so brilliant that it left no room for overconfidence .  gendibal   s great fault was arrogance  as shandess   s own great fault  he thought bitterly  was the weariness of age .   over and over again  it occurred to him that the precedent of preem palver  flitting over the galaxy to set things right  was a dangerous one .  could anyone else be a preem palver .  even gendibal .  and palver had had his wife with him .   to be sure  gendibal had this hamishwoman  but she was of no consequence .  palver   s wife had been a speaker in her own right .   shandess felt himself aging from day to day as he waited for word  from gendibal   and with each day that word did not come  he felt an increasing tension .   it should have been a fleet of ships  a flotilla    no .  the table would not have allowed it .   and yet       when the call finally came  he was asleep   an exhausted sleep  that was bringing him no relief .  the night had been windy and he had had trouble falling asleep to begin with .  like a child  he had imagined voices in the wind .   his last thoughts before falling into an exhausted slumber had been a wistful building of the fancy of resignation  a wish be could do so together with the knowledge he could not  for at this moment delarmi would succeed him .   and then the call came and he sat up in bed  instantly awake .      you are well .     he said .      perfectly well  first speaker     said gendibal .     should we have visual connection for more condensed communication .         later  perhaps     said shandess .     first  what is the situation .     gendibal spoke carefully  for he sensed the other   s recent arousal and he perceived a deep weariness .  he said     i am in the neighborhood of an inhabited planet called gaia  whose existence is not hinted at in any of the galactic records  as far as i know .         the world of those who have been working to perfect the plan .  the anti mules .         possibly  first speaker .  there is the reason to think so .  first  the ship bearing trevize and pelorat has moved far in toward gaia and has probably landed there .  second  there is  in space  about half a million kilometers from me  a first foundation warship .         there cannot be this much interest for no reason .         first speaker  this may not be independent interest .  i am here only because i am following trevize   and the warship may be here for the same reason .  it remains only to be asked why trevize is here .         do you plan to follow him in toward the planet  speaker .         i had considered that a possibility  but something has come up .  i am now a hundred million kilometers from gaia and i sense in the space about me a mentalic field   a homogeneous one that is excessively faint .  i would not have been aware of it at all  but for the focusing effect of the mind of the hainishwoman .  it is an unusual mind  i agreed to take her with me for that very purpose .         you were right  then  in supposing it would be so    did speaker delarmi know this  do you think .         when she urged me to take the woman .  i scarcely think so   but i gladly took advantage of it  first speaker .         i am pleased that you did .  is it your opinion  speaker gendibal  that the planet is the focus of the field .         to ascertain that  i would have to take measurements at widely spaced points in order to see if there is a general spherical symmetry to the field .  my unidirectional mental probe made this seem likely but not certain .  yet it would not be wise to investigate further in the presence of the first foundation warship .         surely it is no threat .         it may be .  i cannot as yet be sure that it is not itself the focus of the field  first speaker .         but they           first speaker  with respect  allow me to interrupt .  we do not know what technological advances the first foundation has made .  they are acting with a strange self confidence and may have unpleasant surprises for us .  it must be decided whether they have learned to handle mentalics by means of some of their devices .  in short  first speaker  i am facing either a warship of mentalics or a planet of them .      if it is the warship  then the mentalics may be far too weak to immobilize me  but they might be enough to slow me   and the purely physical weapons on the warship may then suffice to destroy me .  on the other hand  if it is the planet that is the focus  then to have the field detectable at such a distance could mean enormous intensity at the surface   more than even i can handle .      in either case  it will be necessary to set up a network   a total network   in which  at need  the full resources of trantor can be placed at my disposal .      the first speaker hesitated .     a total network .  this has never been used  never even suggested   except in the time of the mule .         this crisis may well be even greater than that of the mule  first speaker .         i do not know that the table would agree .         i do not think you should ask them to agree  first speaker .  you should invoke a state of emergency .         what excuse can i give .         tell them what i have told you  first speaker .         speaker delarmi will say that you are an incompetent coward  driven to madness by your own fears .      gendibal paused before answering .  then he said     i imagine she will say something like that  first speaker  but let her say whatever she likes and i will survive it .  what is at stake now is not my pride or self love but the actual existence of the second foundation .      harla branno smiled grimly  her lined face setting more deeply into its fleshy crags .  she said     i think we can push on with it .  i   m ready for them .      kodell said     do you still feel sure you know what you   re doing .         if i were as mad as you pretend you think i am  liono  would you have insisted on remaining on this ship with me .      kodell shrugged and said     probably .  i would then be here on the off chance  madam mayor  that i might stop you  divert you  at least slow you  before you went too far .  and  of course  if you   re not mad           yes .          why  then i wouldn   t want to have the histories of the future give you all the mention .  let them state that i was here with you and wonder  perhaps  to whom the credit really belongs  eh  mayor .         clever  liono  clever   but quite futile .  i was the power behind the throne through too many mayoralties for anyone to believe i would permit such a phenomenon in my own administration .         we shall see .         no  we won   t  for such historical judgments will come after we are dead .  however  i have no fears .  not about my place in history and not about that     and she pointed to the screen .      compor   s ship     said kodell .      compor   s ship  true     said branno     but without compor aboard .  one of our scoutships observed the changeover .  compor   s ship was stopped by another .  two people from the other ship boarded that one and compor later moved off and entered the other .      branno rubbed her hands .     trevize fulfilled his role perfectly .  i  cast him out into space in order that he might serve as lightning rod and so he did .  he drew the lightning .  the ship that stopped compor was second foundation .         how can you be sure of that  i wonder .     said kodell  taking out his pipe and slowly beginning to pack it with tobacco .      because i always wondered if compor might not be under second foundation control .  his life was too smooth .  things always broke right for him   and he was such an expert at hyperspatial tracking .  his betrayal of trevize might easily have been the simple politics of an ambitious man   but he did it with such unnecessary thoroughness  as though there were more than personal ambition to it .         all guesswork  mayor .         the guesswork stopped when he followed trevize through multiple jumps as easily as if there had been but one .         he had the computer to help  mayor .      but branno leaned her head back and laughed .     my dear liono  you are so busy devising intricate plots that you forget the efficacy of simple procedures .  i sent compor to follow trevize  not because i needed to have trevize followed .  what need was there for that .  trevize  however much he might want to keep his movements secret  could not help but call attention to himself in any non foundation world he visited .  his advanced foundation vessel   his strong terminus accent   his foundation credits   would automatically surround him with a glow of notoriety .  and in case of any emergency  he would automatically turn to foundation officials for help  as he did on sayshell  where we knew all that he did as soon as he did it    and quite independently of compor .      no     she went on thoughtfully     compor was sent out to test compor .  and that succeeded  for we gave him a defective computer quite deliberately  not one that was defective enough to make the ship unmaneuverable  but certainly one that was insufficiently agile to aid him in following a multiple jump .  yet compor managed that without trouble .         i see there   s a great deal you don   t tell me  mayor  until you decide you ought to .         i only keep those matters from you  liono  that it will not hurt you not to know .  i admire you and i use you  but there are sharp limits to my trust  as there is in yours for me   and please don   t bother to deny it .         i won   t     said kodell dryly     and someday  mayor  i will take the liberty of reminding you of that .     meanwhile  is there anything else that i ought to know now .  what is the nature of the ship that stopped them .  surely  if compor is second foundation  so was that ship .         it is always a pleasure to speak to you  liono .  you see things quickly .  the second foundation  you see  doesn   t bother to hide its tracks .  it has defenses that it relies on to make those tracks invisible  even when they are not .  it would never occur to a second foundationer to use a ship of alien manufacture  even if they knew how neatly we could identify the origin of a ship from the pattern of its energy use .  they could always remove that knowledge from any mind that had gained it  so why bother taking the trouble to hide .  well  our scout ship was able to determine the origin of the ship that approached compor within minutes of sighting it .         and now the second foundation will wipe that knowledge from our minds  i suppose .         if they can     said branno     but they may find that things have changed .      kodell said     earlier you said you knew where the second foundation was .  you would take care of gaia first  then trantor .  i deduce from this that the other ship was of trantorian origin .         you suppose correctly .  are you surprised .      kodell shook his head slowly .     not in hindsight .  ebling mis  toran darell and bayta darell were all on trantor during the period when the mule was stopped .  arkady darell  bayta   s granddaughter  was born on trantor and was on trantor again when the second foundation was itself supposedly stopped .  in her account of events  there is a preem palver who played a key role  appearing at convenient times  and he was a trantorian trader .  i should think it was obvious that the second foundation was on trantor  where  incidentally  hari seldon himself lived at the time he founded both foundations .         quite obvious  except that no one ever suggested the possibility .  the second foundation saw to that .  it is what i meant when i said they didn   t have to cover their tracks  when they could so easily arrange to have no one look in the direction of those tracks   or wipe out the memory of those tracks after they had been seen .      kodell said     in that case  let us not look too quickly in the direction in which they may simply be wanting us to look .  how is it  do  you suppose  that trevize was able to decide the second foundation existed .  why didn   t the second foundation stop him .      branno held up her gnarled fingers and counted on them .     first  trevize is a very unusual man who  for all his obstreperous inability to use caution  has something about him that i have not been able to penetrate .  he may be a special case .  second  the second foundation was not entirely ignorant .  compor was on trevize   s tail at once and reported him to me .  i was relied on to stop trevize without the second foundation having to risk open involvement .  third  when i didn   t quite react as expected   no execution  no imprisonment  no memory erasure  no psychic probe of his brain   when i merely sent him out into space  the second foundation went further .  they made the direct move of sending one of their own ships after him .      and she added with tight lipped pleasure     oh  excellent lightning rod .      kodell said     and our next move .       we are going to challenge that second foundationer we now face .  in fact  we   re moving toward him rather sedately right now .      gendibal and novi sat together  side by side  watching the screen .   novi was frightened .  to gendibal  that was quite apparent  as was the fact that she was desperately trying to fight off that fright .  nor could gendibal do anything to help her in her struggle  for he did not think it wise to touch her mind at this moment  lest he obscure the response she displayed to the feeble mentalic field that surrounded them .   the foundation warship was approaching slowly   but deliberately .  it was a large warship  with a crew of perhaps as many as six  judging from past experience with foundation ships .  her weapons  gendibal was certain  would be sufficient in themselves to hold off and  if necessary  wipe out a fleet made up of every ship available to the second foundation   if those ships had to rely on physical force alone .   as it was  the advance of the warship  even against a single ship manned by a second foundationer  allowed certain conclusions to be drawn .  even if the ship possessed mentalic ability  it would not be likely to advance into the teeth of the second foundation in this manner .  more likely  it was advancing out of ignorance   and this might exist in any of several degrees .   it could mean that the captain of the warship was not aware that compor had been replaced  or   if aware   did not know the replacement was a second foundationer  or perhaps was not even aware what a second foundationer might be .   or  and gendibal intended to consider everything  what if the ship did possess mentalic force and  nevertheless  advanced in this self confident manner .  that could only mean it was under the control of a megalomaniac or that it possessed powers far beyond any that gendibal could bring himself to consider possible .   but what he considered possible was not the final judgment    carefully he sensed novi   s mind .  novi could not sense mentalic fields consciously  whereas gendibal  of course  could   yet gendibal   s mind could not do so as delicately or detect as feeble a mental field as could novi   s .  this was a paradox that would have to be studied in future and might produce fruit that would in the long run prove of far greater importance than the immediate problem of an approaching spaceship .   gendibal had grasped the possibility of this  intuitively  when he first became aware of the unusual smoothness and symmetry of novi   s mind   and he felt a somber pride in this intuitive ability he possessed .  speakers had always been proud of their intuitive powers  but how much was this the product of their inability to measure fields by straightforward physical methods and their failure  therefore  to understand what it was that they really did .  it was easy to cover up ignorance by the mystical word    intuition .     and how much of this ignorance of theirs might arise from their underestimation of the importance of physics as compared to mentalics .   and how much of that was blind pride .  when he became first speaker  gendibal thought  this would change .  there would have to be some narrowing of the physical gap between the foundations .  the second foundation could not face forever the possibility of destruction any time the mentalic monopoly slipped even slightly .      indeed  the monopoly might be slipping now .  perhaps the first foundation had advanced or there was an alliance between the first foundation and the anti mules .   that thought occurred to him now for the first time and he shivered .    his thoughts on the subject slipped through his mind with a rapidity common to a speaker   and while he was thinking  he also  remained sensitively aware of the glow in novi   s mind  the response to the gently pervasive mentalic field about them .  it was not growing stronger as the foundation warship drew nearer .   this was not  in itself  an absolute indication that the warship was not equipped with mentalics .  it was well known that the mentalic field did not obey the inverse square law .  it did not grow stronger precisely as the square of the extent to which distance between emitter and receiver lessened .  it differed in this way from the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields .  still  although mentalic fields varied less with distance than the various physical fields did  it was not altogether insensitive to distance  either .  the response of novi   s mind should show a detectable increase as the warship approached   some increase .    how was it that no second foundationer in five centuries   from hari seldon on   had ever thought of working out a mathematical relationship between mentalic intensity and distance .  this shrugging off of physics must and would stop  gendibal silently vowed .    if the warship possessed mentalics and if it felt quite certain it was approaching a second foundationer  would it not increase the intensity of its field to maximum before advancing .  and in that case  would not novi   s mind surely register an increased response of some kind .      yet it did not .   confidently gendibal eliminated the possibility that the warship possessed mentalics .  it was advancing out of ignorance and  as a menace  it could be downgraded .   the mentalic field  of course  still existed  but it had to originate on gaia .  this was disturbing enough  but the immediate problem was the ship .  let that be eliminated and he could then turn his attention to the world of the anti mules .   he waited .  the warship would make some move or it would come close enough for him to feel confident that he could pass over to an effective offense .   the warship still approached   quite rapidly now   and still did nothing .  finally gendibal calculated that the strength of his push would be sufficient .  there would be no pain  scarcely any discomfort    all those on board would merely find that the large muscles of their backs and limbs would respond but sluggishly to their desires .   gendibal narrowed the mentalic field controlled by his mind .  it intensified and leaped across the gap between the ships at the speed of light .   the two ships were close enough to make hyperspatial contact   with its inevitable loss of precision   unnecessary .    and gendibal then fell back in numbed surprise .   the foundation warship was possessed of an efficient mentalic shield that gained in density in proportion as his own field gained in intensity .     the warship was not approaching out of ignorance after all   and it had an unexpected if passive weapon .      ah     said branno .     he has attempted an attack  liono .  see .      the needle on the psychometer moved and trembled in its irregular rise .   the development of the mentalic shield had occupied foundation scientists for a hundred and twenty years in the most secret of all scientific projects  except perhaps for hari seldon   s lone development of psychohistorical analysis .  five generations of human beings had labored in the gradual improvement of a device backed by no satisfactory theory .   but no advance would have been possible without the invention of the psychometer that could act as a guide  indicating the direction and amount of advance at every stage .  no one could explain how it worked  yet all indications were that it measured the immeasurable and gave numbers to the indescribable .  branno had the feeling  shared by some of the scientists themselves  that if ever the foundation could explain the workings of the psychometer  they would be the equal of the second foundation in mind control .   but that was for the future .  at present  the shield would have to be enough  backed as it was by an overwhelming preponderance in physical weapons .   branno sent out the message  delivered in a male voice from which all overtones of emotion had been removed  till it was flat and deadly .      calling the ship bright star and its occupants .  you have forcibly taken a ship of the navy of the foundation federation in an act of piracy .  you are directed to surrender the ship and yourselves at once or face attack .      the answer came in natural voice     mayor branno of terminus  i know you are on the ship .  the bright star was not taken by piratical action .  i was freely invited on board by its legal captain  munn li compor of terminus .  i ask a period of truce that we may discuss matters of importance to each of us alike .      kodell whispered to branno     let me do the speaking  mayor .      she raised her arm contemptuously     the responsibility is mine  liono .      adjusting the transmitter  she spoke in tones scarcely less forceful and unemotional than the artificial voice that had spoken before      man of the second foundation  understand your position .  if you do not surrender forthwith  we can blow your ship out of space in the time it takes light to travel from our ship to yours   and we are ready to do that .  nor will we lose by doing this  for you have no knowledge for which we need keep you alive .  we know you are from trantor and  once we have dealt with you  we will be ready to deal with trantor .  we are willing to allow you a period in which to have your say  but since you cannot have much of worth to tell us  we are not prepared to listen long .         in that case     said gendibal     let me speak quickly and to the point .  your shield is not perfect and cannot be .  you have overestimated it and underestimated me .  i can handle your mind and control it .  not as easily  perhaps  as if there were no shield  but easily enough .  the instant you attempt to use any weapon  i will strike you   and there is this for you to understand  without a shield  i can handle your mind smoothly and do it no harm .  with the shield  however  i must smash through  which i can do  and i will be unable then to handle you either smoothly or deftly .  your mind will be as smashed as the shield and the effect will be irreversible .  in other words  you cannot stop me and i  on the other hand  can stop you by being forced to do worse than killing you .  i will leave you a mindless hulk .  do you wish to risk that .      branno said     you know you cannot do as you say .         do you  then  wish to risk the consequences i have described .     asked gendibal with an air of cool indifference .   kodell leaned over and whispered     for seldon   s sake  mayor        gendibal said  not exactly at once  for it took light   and everything at light speed   a little over one second to travel from one vessel to the other      i follow your thoughts  kodell .  no need to whisper .  i also follow the mayor   s thoughts .  she is irresolute  so you have no need to panic just yet .  and the mere fact that i know this is ample evidence that your shield leaks .         it can be strengthened     said the mayor defiantly .      so can my mentalic force     said gendibal .      but i sit here at my ease  consuming merely physical energy to maintain the shield  and i have enough to maintain that shield for very long periods of time .  you must use mentalic energy to penetrate the shield and you will tire .         i am not tired     said gendibal .     at the present moment  neither of you is capable of giving any order to any member of the crew of your ship or to any crewman on any other ship .  i can manage so much without any harm to you  but do not make any unusual effort to escape this control  for if i match that by increasing my own force  as i will have to do  you will be damaged as i have said .         i will wait     said branno  placing her hands in her lap with every sign of solid patience .     you will tire and when you do  the orders that will go out will not be to destroy you  for you will then be harmless .  the orders will be to send the main foundation fleet against trantor .  if you wish to save your world   surrender .  a second orgy of destruction will not leave your organization untouched  as the first one did at the time of the great sack .         don   t you see that if i feel myself tiring  mayor  which i won   t  i can save my world very simply by destroying you before my strength to do so is gone .         you won   t do that .  your main task is to maintain the seldon plan .  to destroy the mayor of terminus and thus to strike a blow at the prestige and confidence of the first foundation  producing a staggering setback to its power and encouraging its enemies everywhere  will produce such a disruption to the plan that it will be almost as bad for you as the destruction of trantor .  you might as well surrender .         are you willing to gamble on my reluctance to destroy you .      branno   s chest heaved as she took a deep breath and let it out slowly .  she then said firmly     yes .      kodell  sitting at her side  paled .   gendibal stared at the figure of branno  superimposed upon the volume of room just in front of the wall .  it was a little flickery and hazy thanks to the interference of the shield .  the man next to her was almost featureless with haze  for gendibal had no energy to waste on him .  he had to concentrate on the mayor .   to be sure  she had no image of him in return .  she had no way of knowing that he too had a companion  for instance .  she could make no judgment from his expressions  from his body language .  in this respect  she was at a disadvantage .   everything he had said was true .  he could smash her at the cost of an enormous expenditure of mentalic force   and in so doing  he could scarcely avoid disrupting her mind irreparably .   yet everything she had said was true as well .  destroying her would damage the plan as much as the mule himself had damaged it .  indeed  the new damage might be more serious  since it was now later in the game and there would be less time to retrieve the misstep .   worse still  there was gaia  which was still an unknown quantity    with its mentalic field remaining at the faint and tantalizing edge of detection .   for a moment  he touched novi   s mind to make sure that the flow was still there .  it was  and it was unchanged .   she could not have sensed that touch in any way  but she turned to him and in an awed whisper said     master  there is a faint mist there .  is it to that you talk .      she must have sensed the mist through the small connection between their two minds .  gendibal put a finger to his lips .     have no fear  novi .  close your eyes and rest .      he raised his voice .     mayor branno  your gamble is a good one in this respect .  i do not wish to destroy you at once  since i think that if i explain something to you  you will listen to reason and there will then be no need to destroy in either direction .      suppose  mayor  that you win out and that i surrender .  what follows .  in an orgy of self confidence and in undue reliance on your mentalic shield  you and your successors will attempt to spread your power over the galaxy with undue haste .  in doing so  you will actually postpone the establishment of the second empire  because you will also destroy the seldon plan .      branno said     i am not surprised that you do not wish to destroy me at once and i think that  as you sit there  you will be forced to realize that you do not dare to destroy me at all .      gendibal said     do not deceive yourself with self congratulatory folly .  listen to me .  the majority of the galaxy is still non foundation and  to a great extent  anti foundation .  there are even portions of the foundation federation itself that have not forgotten their days of independence .  if the foundation moves too quickly in the wake of my surrender  it will deprive the rest of the galaxy of its greatest weakness   its disunity and indecision .  you will force them to unite by fear and you will feed the tendency toward rebellion within .         you are threatening with clubs of straw     said branno .     we have the power to win easily against all enemies  even if every world in the non foundation galaxy combined against us  and even if these were helped by a rebellion in half the worlds of the federation itself .  there would be no problem .         no immediate problem  mayor .  do not make the mistake of seeing only the results that appear at once .  you can establish a second empire merely by proclaiming it  but you will not be able to maintain it .  you will have to reconquer it every ten years .         then we will do so until the worlds tire  as you are tiring .         they will not tire  any more than i will .  nor will the process continue for a very long time  for there is a second and greater danger to the pseudo empire you would proclaim .  since it can be temporarily maintained only by an ever stronger military force which will be ever exercised  the generals of the foundation will  for the first time  become more important and more powerful than the civilian authorities .  the pseudo empire will break up into military regions within which individual commanders will be supreme .  there will be anarchy   and a slide back into a barbarism that may last longer than the thirty thousand years forecast by seldon before the seldon plan was implemented .         childish threats .  even if the mathematics of the seldon plan predicted all this  it predicts only probabilities   not inevitabilities .         mayor branno     said gendibal earnestly .     forget the seldon plan .  you do not understand its mathematics and you cannot visualize its pattern .  but you do not have to  perhaps .  you are a tested politician  and a successful one  to judge from the post you hold  even more so  a courageous one  to judge from the gamble you are now taking .  therefore  use your political acumen .  consider the political and military history of humanity and consider it in the light of what you know of human nature   of the manner in which people  politicians  and military officers act  react  and interact   and see if i   m not right .      branno said     even if you were right  second foundationer  it is a risk we must take .  with proper leadership and with continuing technological advance   in mentalics  as well as in physics   we can overcome .  hari seldon never calculated such advances properly .  he couldn   t .  where in the plan does it allow for the development of a mentalic shield by the first foundation .  why should we want the plan  in any case .  we will risk founding a new empire without it .  failure without it would  after all  be better than success with it .  we do not want an empire in which we play puppets to the hidden manipulators of the second foundation .         you say that only because you do not understand what failure will be like for the people of the galaxy .         perhaps .     said branno stonily .     are you beginning to weary  second foundationer .         not at all .     let me propose an alternative action that you have not considered   one in which i need not surrender to you  nor you to me .     we are in the vicinity of a planet called gaia .         i am aware of that .         are you aware that it was probably the birthplace of the mule .         i would want more evidence than resides in your mere statement to that effect .         the planet is surrounded by a mentalic field .  it is the home of many mules .  if you accomplish your dream of destroying the second foundation  you will make yourselves the slaves of this planet of mules .  what harm have second foundationers ever done you    specific  rather than imagined or theorized harm .  now ask yourself what harm a single mule has done you .         i still have nothing more than your statements .         as long as we remain here  i can give you nothing more .     i propose a truce  therefore .  keep your shield up  if you don   t trust me  but be prepared to co operate with me .  let us  together  approach this planet   and when you are convinced that it is dangerous  then i will nullify its mentalic field and you will order your ships to take possession of it .         and then .         and then  at least  it will be the first foundation against the second foundation  with no outside forces to be considered .  the fight will then be clear whereas now  you see  we dare not fight  for both foundations are at bay .         why did you not say this before .         i thought i might convince you that we were not enemies  so that we might co operate .  since i have apparently failed at that  i suggest co operation in any case .      branno paused  her head bent in thought .  then she said     you are trying to put me to sleep with lullabies .  how will you  by yourself  nullify the mentalic field of a whole planet of mules .  the thought is so ludicrous that i cannot trust in the truth of your proposition .         i am not alone     said gendibal .     behind me is the full force of the second foundation   and that force  channeled through me  will take care of gaia .     what   s more  it can  at any time  brush aside your shield as though it were thin fog .         if so  why do you need my help .         first  because nullifying the field is not enough .  the second foundation cannot devote itself  now and forever  to the eternal task of nullifying  any more than i can spend the rest of my life dancing this conversational minuet with you .  we need the physical action your ships can supply .     and besides  if i cannot convince you by reason that the two foundations should look upon each other as allies  perhaps a co operative venture of the greatest importance can be convincing .  deeds may do the job where words fail .      a second silence and then branno said     i am willing to approach gaia more closely  if we can approach co operatively .  i make no promises beyond that .         that will be enough     said gendibal  leaning toward his computer .   novi said     no  master  up to this point  it didn   t matter  but please make no further move .  we must wait for councilman trevize of terminus .        chapter nineteen  decision    janov pelorat said  with a small trace of petulance in his voice     really  golan  no one seems to care for the fact that this is the first time in a moderately long life   not too long  i assure you  bliss   in which i have been traveling through the galaxy .  yet each time i come to a world  i am off it again and back in space before i can really have a chance to study it .  it has happened twice now .         yes     said bliss     but if you had not left the other one so quickly  you would not have met me until who knows when .  surely that justifies the first time .         it does .  honestly  my   my dear  it does .         and this time  pel  you may be off the planet  but you have me    and i am gaia  as much as any particle of it  as much as all of it .         you are  and surely i want no other particle of it .      trevize  who had been listening to the exchange with a frown  said     this is disgusting .  why didn   t dom come with us .     space  i   ll never get used to this monosyllabization .  two hundred fifty syllables to a name and we use just one of them .     why didn   t he come  together with all two hundred fifty syllables .  if all this is so important   if the very existence of gaia depends on it   why didn   t he come with us to direct us .         i am here  trev     said bliss     and i am as much gaia as he is .     then  with a quick sideways and upward look from her dark eyes     does it annoy you  then  to have me call you    trev    .         yes  it does .  i have as much right to my ways as you to yours .  my name is trevize .  two syllables .  tre vize .         gladly .  i do not wish to anger you  trevize .         i am not angry .  i am annoyed .     he rose suddenly  walked from one end of the room to the other  stepping over the outstretched legs of pelorat  who drew them in quickly   and then back again .  he stopped  turned  and faced bliss .   he pointed a finger at her .     look .  i am not my own master .  i have been maneuvered from terminus to gaia   and even when i began to suspect that this was so  there seemed no way to break the grip .  and then  when i get to gaia  i am told that the whole purpose for my arrival was to save gaia .  why .  how .  what is gaia to me   or i to gaia   that i should save it .  is there no other of the quintillion human beings in the galaxy who could do the job .         please  trevize     said bliss   and there was a sudden downcast air about her  all of the gamine affectation disappearing .     do not be angry .  you see  i use your name properly and i will be very serious .  dom asked you to be patient .         by every planet in the galaxy  habitable or not  i don   t want to be patient .  if i am so important  do i not deserve an explanation .  to begin with  i ask again why dom did not come with us .  is it not sufficiently important for him to be here on the far star with us .         he is here  trevize     said bliss .     while i am here  he is here  and everyone on gaia is here  and every living thing  and every speck of the planet .         you are satisfied that that is so  but it   s not my way of thinking .  i   m not a gaian .  we can   t squeeze the whole planet on to my ship  we can only squeeze one person on to it .  we have you  and dom is part of you .  very well .  why couldn   t we have taken dom  and let you be part of him .         for one thing     said bliss     pel   i mean  pel o rat   asked that i be on the ship with you .  i  not dom .         he was being gallant .  who would take that seriously .         oh  now  my dear fellow     said pelorat  rising to his feet with his face reddening     i was quite serious .  i don   t want to be dismissed like that .  i accept the fact that it doesn   t matter which component of the gaian whole is on board  and it is more pleasant for me to have bliss here than dom  and it should be for you as well .  come  golan  you are behaving childishly .         am i .  am i .     said trevize  frowning darkly .     all right  then  i am .  just the same     again he pointed at bliss     whatever it is i am expected to do  i assure you that i won   t do it if i am not treated like a human being .  two questions to begin with    what am i supposed to do .  and why me .      bliss was wide eyed and backing away .  she said     please  i can   t tell you that now .  all of gaia can   t tell you .  you must come to the place without knowing anything to begin with .  you must learn it all there .  you must then do what you must do   but you must do it calmly and unemotionally .  if you remain as you are  nothing will be of use and  one way or another  gaia will come to an end .  you must change this feeling of yours and i do not know how to change it .         would dom know if he were here .     said trevize remorselessly .      dom is here     said bliss .     he i we do not know how to change you or calm you .  we do not understand a human being who cannot sense his place in the scheme of things  who does not feel like part of a greater whole .      trevize said     that is not so .  you could seize my ship at a distance of a million kilometers and more   and keep us calm while we were helpless .  well  calm me now .  don   t pretend you are not capable of doing it .         but we mustn   t .  not now .  if we changed you or adjusted you in any way now  then you would be no more valuable to us than any other person in the galaxy and we could not use you .  we can only use you because you are you   and you must remain you .  if we touch you at this moment in any way  we are lost .  please .  you must be calm of your own accord .         not a chance  miss  unless you tell me some of what i want to know .      pelorat said     bliss  let me try .  please go into the other room .      bliss left  backing slowly out .  pelorat closed the door behind her .   trevize said     she can hear and see   sense everything .  what difference does this make .      pelorat said     it makes a difference to me .  i want to be alone with you  even if isolation is an illusion .     golan  you   re afraid .         don   t be a fool .         of course you are .  you don   t know where you   re going  what you   ll be facing  what you   ll be expected to do .  you have a right to be afraid .         but i   m not .         yes  you are .  perhaps you   re not afraid of physical danger in the way that i am .  i   ve been afraid of venturing out into space  afraid of each new world i see  afraid of every new thing i encounter .  after all  i   ve lived half a century of a constricted  withdrawn and limited life  while you have been in the navy and in politics  in the thick and hurly burly at home and in space .  yet i   ve tried not to be afraid and you   ve helped me .  in this time that we   ve been together  you   ve been patient with me  you   ve been kind to me and understanding  and because of you  i   ve managed to master my fears and behave well .  let me  then  return the favor and help you .         i   m not afraid  i tell you .         of course you are .  if nothing else  you   re afraid of the responsibility you   ll be facing .  apparently there   s a whole world depending on you   and you will therefore have to live with the destruction of a whole world if you fail .  why should you have to face that possibility for a world that means nothing to you .     what right have they to place this load upon you .  you   re not only afraid of failure  as any person would be in your place  but you   re furious that they should put you in the position where you have to be afraid .         you   re all wrong .         i don   t think so .  consequently let me take your place .  i   ll do it .  whatever it is they expect you to do  i volunteer as substitute .  i assume that it   s not something that requires great physical strength or vitality  since a simple mechanical device would outdo you in that respect .  i assume it   s not something that requires mentalics  for they have enough of that themselves .  it   s something that   well  i don   t know  but if it requires neither brawn nor brain  then i have everything else as well as you   and i am ready to take the responsibility .      trevize said sharply     why are you so willing to bear the load .      pelorat looked down at the floor  as though fearing to meet the other   s eyes .  he said     i have had a wife  golan .  i have known women .  yet they have never been very important to me .  interesting .  pleasant .  never very important .  yet  this one           who .  bliss .         she   s different  somehow   to me .         by terminus  janov  she knows every word you   re saying .         that makes no difference .  she knows anyhow .     i want to please her .  i will undertake this task  whatever it is  run any risk  take any responsibility  on the smallest chance that it will make her   think well of me .         janov  she   s a child .         she   s not a child   and what you think of her makes no difference to me .         don   t you understand what you must seem to her .         an old man .  what   s the difference .  she   s part of a greater whole and i am not   and that alone builds an insuperable wall between us .  don   t you think i know that .  but i don   t ask anything of her but that she           think well of you .         yes .  or whatever else she can make herself feel for me .         and for that you will do my job .     but janov  haven   t you been listening .  they don   t want you  they want me for some space ridden reason i can   t understand .         if they can   t have you and if they must have someone  i will be better than nothing  surely .      trevize shook his head .     i can   t believe that this is happening .  old age is overtaking you and you have discovered youth .  janov  you   re trying to be a hero  so that you can die for that body .         don   t say that  golan .  this is not a fit subject for humor .     trevize tried to laugh  but his eyes met pelorat   s grave face and he cleared his throat instead .  he said     you   re right .  i apologize .  call her in  janov .  call her in .      bliss entered  shrinking a little .  she said in a small voice     i   m sorry  pel .  you cannot substitute .  it must be trevize or no one .      trevize said     very well .  i   ll be calm .  whatever it is  i   ll try to do it .  anything to keep janov from trying to play the romantic hero at his age .         i know my age     muttered pelorat .   bliss approached him slowly  placed her hand on his shoulder .     pel  i   i think well of you .      pelorat looked away .     it   s all right  bliss .  you needn   t be kind .         i   m not being kind  pel .  i think   very well of you .      dimly  then more strongly  sura novi knew that she was suranoviremblastiran and that when she was a child  she had been known as su to her parents and vito her friends .   she had never really forgotten  of course  but the facts were  on occasion  buried deep within her .  never had it been buried as deeply  or for as long as in this last month  for never had she been so close for so long to a mind so powerful .   but now it was time .  she did not will it herself .  she had no need to .  the vast remainder of her was pushing her portion of itself to the surface  for the sake of the global need .   accompanying that was a vague discomfort  a kind of itch that was rapidly overwhelmed by the comfort of selfness unmasked .  not in years had she been so close to the globe of gaia .   she remembered one of the life forms she had loved on gaia as a child .  having understood its feelings then as a dim part of her own  she recognized her own sharper ones now .  she was a butterfly emerging from a cocoon .   stor gendibal stared sharply and penetratingly at novi   and with such surprise that he came within a hair of loosening his grip upon mayor branno .  that he did not do so was  perhaps  the result of a sudden support from without that steadied him and that  for the moment  he ignored .   he said     what do you know of councilman trevize  novi .     and then  in cold disturbance at the sudden and growing complexity of her mind  he cried out     what are you .      he attempted to seize hold of her mind and found it impenetrable .  at that moment  he recognized that his hold on branno was supported by a grip stronger than his own .  he repeated     what are you .      there was a hint of the tragic on novi   s face .     master     she said     speaker gendibal .  my true name is suranoviremblastiran and i am gaia .      it was all she said in words  but gendibal  in sudden fury  had intensified his own mental aura and with great skill  now that his blood was up  evaded the strengthening bar and held branno on his own and more strongly than before  while he gripped novi   s mind in a tight and silent struggle .   she held him off with equal skill  but she could not keep her mind closed to him   or perhaps she did not wish to .   he spoke to her as he would to another speaker .     you have  played a part  deceived me  lured me here  and you are one of the species from which the mule was derived .         the mule was an aberration  speaker .  i we are not mules .  i we are gaia .      the whole essence of gaia was described in what she complexly communicated  far more than it could have been in any number of words .      a whole planet alive     said gendibal .      and with a mentalic field greater as a whole than is yours as an individual .  please do not resist with such force .  i fear the danger of harming you  something i do not wish to do .         even as a living planet  you are not stronger than the sum of my colleagues on trantor .  we  too  are  in a way  a planet alive .         only some thousands of people in mentalic co operation  speaker  and you cannot draw upon their support  for i have blocked it off .  test that and you will see .         what is it you plan to do  gaia .         i would hope  speaker  that you would call me novi .  what i do now i do as gaia  but i am novi also   and with reference to you  i am only novi .         what is it you plan to do  gaia .      there was the trembling mentalic equivalent of a sigh and novi said     we will remain in triple stalemate .  you will hold mayor branno through her shield  and i will help you do so  and we will not tire .  you  i suppose  will maintain your grip on me  and i will maintain mine on you  and neither one of us will tire there either .  and so it will stay .         to what end .         as i have told you    we are waiting for councilman trevize of terminus .  it is he who will break the stalemate   as he chooses .      the computer on board the far star located the two ships and golan trevize displayed them together on the split screen .   they were both foundation vessels .  one was precisely like the far star and was undoubtedly compor   s ship .  the other was larger and far more powerful .   he turned toward bliss and said     well  do you know what   s going on .  is there anything you can now tell me .         yes .  do not be alarmed .  they will not harm you .         why is everyone convinced i   m sitting here all a tremble with panic .     trevize demanded petulantly .   pelorat said hastily     let her talk  golan .  don   t snap at her .      trevize raised his arms in a gesture of impatient surrender .     i will not snap .  speak  lady .      bliss said     on the large ship is the ruler of your foundation .  with her        trevize said in astonishment     the ruler .  you mean old lady branno .         surely that is not her title     said bliss  her lips twitching a little in amusement .     but she is a woman  yes .     she paused a little  as though listening intently to the rest of the general organism of which she was part .     her name is harlabranno .  it seems odd to have only four syllables when one is so important on her world  but i suppose non gaians have their own ways .         i suppose     said trevize dryly .     you would call her brann  i think .  but what is she doing here .  why isn   t she back on    i see .  gaia has maneuvered her here  too .  why .      bliss did not answer that question .  she said     with her is lionokodell  five syllables  though her underling .  it seems a lack of respect .  he is an important official of your world .  with them are four others who control the ship   s weapons .  do you want their names .         no .  i take it that on the other ship there is one man  munn li compor  and that he represents the second foundation .  you   ve brought both foundations together  obviously .  why .         not exactly  trev   i mean  trevize           oh  go ahead and say trev .  i don   t give a puff of comet gas .         not exactly  trev .  compor has left that ship and has been replaced by two people .  one is storgendibal  an important official of the second foundation .  he is called a speaker .         an important official .  he   s got mentalic power  i imagine .         oh yes .  a great deal .         will you be able to handle that .         certainly .  the second person  on the ship with him  is gaia .         one of your people .         yes .  her name is suranoviremblastiran .  it should be much longer  but she has been away from me us rest so long .         is she capable of holding a high official of the second foundation .         it is not she  it is gaia who holds him .  she i we all are capable of crushing him .         is that what she   s going to do .  she   s going to crush him and branno .  what is this .  is gaia going to destroy the foundations and set up a galactic empire of its own .  the mule back again .  a greater mule           no no  trev .  do not become agitated .  you must not .  all three are in a stalemate .  they are waiting .         for what .         for your decision .         here we go again .  what decision .  why me .         please  trev     said bliss .     it will soon be explained .  i we she have said as much as i we she can for now .      branno said wearily     it is clear i have made a mistake  liono  perhaps a fatal one .         is this something that ought to be admitted .     muttered kodell through motionless lips .      they know what i think .  it will do no further harm to say so .  nor do they know less about what you think if you do not move your lips .     i should have waited until the shield was further strengthened .      kodell said     how could you have known  mayor .  if we waited until assurance was doubly and triply and quadruply and endlessly sure  we would have waited forever .     to be sure  i wish we had not gone ourselves .  it would have been well to have experimented with someone else   with your lightning rod  trevize  perhaps .      branno sighed .     i wanted to give them no warning  liono .  still  there you put the finger on the nub of my mistake .  i might have waited until the shield was reasonably impenetrable .  not ultimately impenetrable but reasonably so .  i knew there was perceptible leakage now  but i could not bear to wait longer .  to wipe out the leakage would have meant waiting past my term of office and i wanted it done in my time   and i wanted to be on the spot .  so like a fool  i  forced myself to believe the shield was adequate .  i would listen to no caution   to your doubts  for instance .         we may still win out if we are patient .         can you give the order to fire on the other ship .         no  i cannot  mayor .  the thought is  somehow  not something i can endure .         nor i .  and if you or i managed to give the order  i am certain that the men on board would not follow it  that they would not be able to .         not under present circumstances  mayor  but circumstances might change .  as a matter of fact  a new actor appears on the scene .      he pointed to the screen .  the ship   s computer had automatically split the screen as a new ship came within its ken .  the second ship appeared on the right hand side .      can you magnify the image  liono .         no trouble .  the second foundationer is skillful .  we are free to do anything he is not troubled by .         well     said branno  studying the screen     that   s the far star  i   m sure .  and i imagine trevize and pelorat are on board .  then  bitterly     unless they too have been replaced by second foundationers .  my lightning rod has been very efficient indeed .     if only my shield had been stronger .         patience .     said kodell .   a voice rang out in the confines of the ship   s control room and branno could somehow tell it did not consist of sound waves .  she heard it in her mind directly and a glance at kodell was sufficient to tell her that he had heard it  too .   it said     can you hear me  mayor branno .  if you can  don   t bother saying so .  it will be enough if you think so .      branno said calmly     what are you .         i am gaia .      the three ships were each essentially at rest  relative to the other two .  all three were turning very slowly about the planet gaia  as a distant three part satellite of the planet .  all three were accompanying gaia on its endless journey about its sun .   trevize sat  watching the screen  tired of guessing what his role might be   what he had been dragged across a thousand parsecs to do .   the sound in his mind did not startle him .  it was as though he had been waiting for it .   it said     can you hear me  golan trevize .  if you can  don   t bother saying so .  it will be enough if you think it .      trevize looked about .  pelorat  clearly startled  was looking in various directions  as though trying to find the source .  bliss sat quietly  her hands held loosely in her lap .  trevize had no doubt  for a moment  that she was aware of the sound .   he ignored the order to use thoughts and spoke with deliberate clarity of enunciation .     if i don   t find out what this is about  i will do nothing i am asked to do .      and the voice said     you are about to find out .      novi said     you will all hear me in your mind .  you are all free to respond in thought .  i will arrange it so that all of you can hear each other .  and  as you are all aware  we are all close enough so that at the normal light speed of the spatial mentalic field  there will be no inconvenient delays .  to begin with  we are all here by arrangement .         in what manner .     came branno   s voice .      not by mental tampering     said novi .     gaia has interfered with no one   s mind .  it is not our way .  we merely took advantage of ambition .  mayor branno wanted to establish a second empire at once  speaker gendibal wanted to be first speaker .  it was enough to encourage these desires and to ride the wind  selectively and with judgment .         i know how i was brought here     said gendibal stiffly .  and indeed he did .  he knew why he had been so anxious to move out into space  so anxious to pursue trevize  so sure he could handle it all .     it was all novi .     oh  novi .      you were a particular case  speaker gendibal .  your ambition was powerful  but there were softnesses about you that offered a shortcut .  you were a person who would be kind to someone whom you had been trained to think of as beneath you in every respect .  i took advantage of this in you and turned it against you .  i we am are deeply ashamed .  the excuse is that the future of the galaxy is in hazard .      novi paused and her voice  though she was not speaking by way of vocal cords  grew more somber  her face more drawn .      this was the time .  gaia could wait no longer .  for over a century  the people of terminus had been developing a mentalic shield .  left to themselves another generation  it would have been impervious even to gaia and they would have been free to use their physical weapons at will .  the galaxy would not have been able to resist them and a second galactic empire  after the fashion of terminus  would have been established at once  despite the seldon plan  despite the people of trantor  and despite gaia .  mayor branno had to be somehow maneuvered into making her move while the shield was still imperfect .      then there is trantor .  the seldon plan was working perfectly  for gaia itself labored to keep it on track with precision .  and for over a century  there had been quietist first speakers  so that trantor vegetated .  now  however  stor gendibal was rising quickly .  he would certainly become first speaker and under him trantor would take on an activist role .  it would surely concentrate on physical power and would recognize the danger of terminus and take action against it .  if he could act against terminus before its shield was perfected  then the seldon plan would be worked out to its conclusion in a second galactic empire   after the fashion of trantor   despite the people of terminus and despite gaia .  consequently gendibal had to be somehow maneuvered into making his move before he became first speaker .      fortunately  because gaia has been working carefully for decades  we have brought both foundations to the proper place at the proper time .  i repeat all this primarily so that councilman golan trevize of terminus may understand .      trevize cut in at once and again ignored the effort to converse by thought .  he spoke words firmly     i do not understand .  what is wrong with either version of the second galactic empire .      novi said     the second galactic empire   worked out after the fashion of terminus   will be a military empire  established by strife  maintained by strife  and eventually destroyed by strife .  it will be nothing but the first galactic empire reborn .  that is the view of gaia .      the second galactic empire   worked out after the fashion of  trantor   will be a paternalistic empire  established by calculation  maintained by calculation  and in perpetual living death by calculation .  it will be a dead end .  that is the view of gaia .      trevize said     and what does gaia have to offer as an alternative .         greater gaia .  galaxia .  every inhabited planet as alive as gaia .  every living planet combined into a still greater hyperspatial life .  every uninhabited planet participating .  every star .  every scrap of interstellar gas .  perhaps even the great central black hole .  a living galaxy and one that can be made favorable for all life in ways that we yet cannot foresee .  a way of life fundamentally different from all that has gone before and repeating none of the old mistakes .         originating new ones     muttered gendibal sarcastically .      we have had thousands of years of gaia to work those out .         but not on a galactic scale .      trevize  ignoring the short exchange and driving to his point  said     and what is my role in all this .      the voice of gaia   channeled through novi   s mind   thundered     choose .  which alternative is it to be .      there was a vast silence that followed and finally  in that silence  trevize   s voice   mental at last  for he was too taken aback to speak    sounded small and still defiant .     why me .      novi said     though we recognized the moment had come when either terminus or trantor would become too powerful to stop   or worse yet  when both might become so powerful that a deadly stalemate would develop that would devastate the galaxy   we still could not move .  for our purposes  we needed someone   a particular someone   with the talent for rightness .  we found you  councilman .     no  we cannot take the credit .  the people of trantor found you through the man named compor  though even they did not know what they had .  the act of finding you attracted our attention to you .  golan trevize  you have the gift of knowing the right thing to do .         i deny it     said trevize .      you are  every once in a while  sure .  and we want you to be sure this time on behalf of the galaxy .  you do not wish the responsibility  perhaps .  you may do your best not to have to choose .  nevertheless  you will realize that it is right to do so .  you will be sure .  and you will then choose .  once we found you  we knew the search was over and for years we have labored to encourage a course of action that would  without direct mentalic interference  so influence events that all three of you   mayor branno  speaker gendibal  and councilman trevize   would be in the neighborhood of gaia at the same time .  we have done it .      trevize said     at this point in space  under present circumstances  is it not true  gaia   if that is what you want me to call you   that you can overpower both the mayor and the speaker .  is it not true that you can establish this living galaxy you speak of without my doing anything .  why  then  do you not .      novi said     i do not know if i can explain this to your satisfaction .  gaia was formed thousands of years ago with the help of robots that once  for a brief time  served the human species and now serve them no more .  they made it quite clear to us that we could survive only by a strict application of the three laws of robotics as applied to life generally .  the first law  in those terms  is     gaia may not harm life or  through inaction  allow life to come to harm .     we have followed this rule through all of our history and we can do no other .      the result is that we are now helpless .  we cannot force our vision of the living galaxy upon a quintillion human beings and countless other forms of life and perhaps do harm to vast numbers .  nor can we do nothing and watch the galaxy half destroy itself in a struggle that we might have prevented .  we do not know whether action or inaction will cost the galaxy less  nor  if we choose action  do we know whether supporting terminus or trantor will cost the galaxy less .  let councilman trevize decide then   and whatever that decision is  gaia will follow it .      trevize said     how do you expect me to make a decision .  what do i do .      novi said     you have your computer .  the people of terminus did not know that when they made it  they made it better than they knew .  the computer on board your ship incorporates some of gaia .  place your hands on the terminals and think .  you may think mayor branno   s shield impervious  for instance .  if you do  it is possible that she will at once use her weapons to disable or destroy the other two ships  establish physical rule over gaia and  later on  trantor .         and you will do nothing to stop that .     said trevize with astonishment .      not a thing .  if you are sure that domination by terminus will do the galaxy less harm than any other alternative  we will gladly  help that domination along   even at the cost of our own destruction .      on the other hand  you may find speaker gendibal   s mentalic field and you may then join your computer magnified push to his .  he will  in that case  surely break free of me and push me back .  he may then adjust the mayor   s mind and  in combination with her ships  establish physical domination over gaia and assure the continued supremacy of the seldon plan .  gaia will not move to stop that .      or you may find my mentalic field and join that   and then the living galaxy will be set in motion to reach its fulfillment  not in this generation or the next  but after centuries of labor during which the seldon plan will continue .  the choice is yours .      mayor branno said     wait .  do not make a decision just yet .  may i speak .      novi said     you may speak freely .  so may speaker gendibal .      branno said     councilman trevize .  the last time we met on terminus  you said     the time may come  madam mayor  when you will ask me for an effort  and i will then do as i choose  and i will remember the past two days .     i don   t know whether you foresaw this  or intuitively felt it would happen  or simply had what this woman who speaks of a living galaxy calls a talent for rightness .  in any case  you were right .  i am asking you for an effort on behalf of the federation .      you may  i suppose  feel that you would like to even the score with me for having arrested and exiled you .  i ask you to remember that i did it for what i considered the good of the foundation federation .  even if i were wrong or even if i acted out of callous self interest  remember that it was i who did it   and not the federation .  do not now destroy the entire federation out of a desire to balance what i alone have done to you .  remember that you are a foundationer and a human being  that you do not want to be a cipher in the plans of the bloodless mathematicians of trantor or less than a cipher in a galactic mish mash of life and nonlife .  you want yourself  your descendants  your fellow people to be independent organisms  possessing free will .  nothing else matters .      these others may tell you that our empire will lead to bloodshed and misery   but it need not .  it is our free will choice whether this should be so or not .  we may choose otherwise .  and  in any case  it is better to go to defeat with free will than to live in meaningless security as a cog in a machine .  observe that you are now being asked to make a decision as a free will human being .  these things of gaia are unable to make a decision because their machinery will not allow them to  so that they depend on you .  and they will destroy themselves if you bid them to .  is this what you want for all the galaxy .      trevize said     i do not know that i have free will  mayor .  my mind may have been subtly dealt with  so that i will give the answer that is desired .      novi said     your mind is totally untouched .  if we could bring ourselves to adjust you to suit our purposes  this whole meeting would be unnecessary .  were we that unprincipled  we could have proceeded with what we would find most pleasing to ourselves with no concern for the greater needs and good of humanity as a whole .      gendibal said     i believe it is my turn to speak .  councilman trevize  do not be guided by narrow parochialism .  the fact that you are terminus born should not lead you to believe that terminus comes before the galaxy .  for five centuries now  the galaxy has been operating in accordance with the seldon plan .  in and out of the foundation federation  that operation has been proceeding .      you are  and have been  part of the seldon plan above and beyond your lesser role as foundationer .  do not do anything to disrupt the plan  either on behalf of a narrow concept of patriotism or out of a romantic longing for the new and untried .  the second foundationers will in no way hamper the free will of humanity .  we are guides  not despots .      and we offer a second galactic empire fundamentally different from the first .  throughout human history  no decade in all the tens of thousands of years during which hyperspatial travel has existed has been completely free of bloodshed and violent death throughout the galaxy  even in those periods when the foundation itself was at peace .  choose mayor branno and that will continue endlessly into the future .  the same dreary  deadly round .  the seldon plan offers release from that at last   and not at the price of becoming one more atom in a galaxy of atoms  being reduced to equality with grass  bacteria  and dust .      novi said     what speaker gendibal says of the first foundation   s second empire  i agree with .  what he says of his own  i do not .  the speakers of trantor are  after all  independent free will human beings and are the same as they have always been .  are they  free of destructive competition  of politics  of clawing upward at all costs .  are there no quarrels and even hatreds at the speaker   s table     and will they always be guides you dare follow .  put speaker gendibal on his honor and ask him this .         no need to put me on my honor     said gendibal .     i freely admit we have our hatreds  competitions  and betrayals at the table .  but once a decision is reached  it is obeyed by all .  there has never been an exception to this .      trevize said     what if i will not make a choice .         you must     said novi .     you will know that it is right to do so and you will therefore make a choice .         what if i try to make a choice and cannot .         you must .      trevize said     how much time do i have .      novi said     until you are sure  however much time that takes .      trevize sat silently .   though the others were silent too  it seemed to trevize that he could hear the pulsing of his bloodstream .   he could hear mayor branno   s voice say firmly     free will .     speaker gendibal   s voice said peremptorily     guidance and peace .      novi   s voice said wistfully     life .      trevize turned and found pelorat looking at him intently .  he said     janov .  have you heard all this .         yes  i have  golan .         what do you think .         the decision is not mine .         i know that .  but what do you think .         i don   t know .  i am frightened by all three alternatives .  and yet a peculiar thought comes to me           yes .         when we first went out into space  you showed me the galaxy .  do you remember .         of course .         you speeded time and the galaxy rotated visibly .  and i said  as though anticipating this very time     the galaxy looks like a living thing  crawling through space .     do you think that  in a way  it is alive already .      and trevize  remembering that moment  was suddenly sure .  he  remembered suddenly his feeling that pelorat  too  would have a vital role to play .  he turned in haste  anxious not to have time to think  to doubt  to grow uncertain .   he placed his hands on the terminals and thought with an intensity he had never known before .   he had made his decision   the decision on which the fate of the galaxy hung .     chapter twenty  conclusion    mayor harla branno had every reason for satisfaction .  the state visit had not lasted long  but it had been thoroughly productive .   she said  as though in deliberate attempt to avoid hubris     we can   t  of course  trust them completely .      she was watching the screen .  the ships of the fleet were  one by one  entering hyperspace and returning to their normal stations .   there was no question but that sayshell had been impressed by their presence  but they could not have failed to notice two things   one  that the ships had remained in foundation space at all times  two  that once branno had indicated they would leave  they were indeed leaving with celerity .   on the other hand  sayshell would not forget either that those ships could be recalled to the border at a day   s notice   or less .  it was a maneuver that had combined both a demonstration of power and a demonstration of goodwill .   kodell said     quite right  we can   t trust them completely  but then no one in the galaxy can be trusted completely and it is in the self interest of sayshell to observe the terms of the agreement .  we have been generous .      branno said     a lot will depend on working out the details and i predict that will take months .  the general brushstrokes can be accepted in a moment  but then come the shadings  just how we arrange for quarantine of imports and exports  how we weigh the value of their grain and cattle compared to ours  and so on .         i know  but it will be done eventually and the credit will be  yours  mayor .  it was a bold stroke and one  i admit  whose wisdom i doubted .         come  liono .  it was just a matter of the foundation recognizing sayshellian pride .  they   ve retained a certain independence since early imperial times .  it   s to be admired  actually .         yes  now that it will no longer inconvenience us .         exactly  so it was only necessary to bend our own pride to the point of making some sort of gesture to theirs .  i admit it took an effort to decide that i  as mayor of a galaxy straddling federation  should condescend to visit a provincial star grouping  but once the decision was made it didn   t hurt too much .  and it pleased them .  we had to gamble that they would agree to the visit once we moved our ships to the border  but it meant being humble and smiling very broadly .      kodell nodded .     we abandoned the appearance of power to preserve the essence of it .         exactly .     who first said that .         i believe it was in one of eriden   s plays  but i   m not sure .  we can ask one of our literary lights back home .         if i remember .  we must speed the return visit of sayshellians to terminus and see to it that they are given the full treatment as equals .  and i   m afraid  liono  you will have to organize tight security for them .  there is bound to be some indignation among our hotheads and it would not be wise to subject them to even slight and transient humiliation through protest demonstrations .         absolutely     said kodell .     it was a clever stroke  by the way  sending out trevize .         my lightning rod .  he worked better than i thought he would  to be honest .  he blundered his way into sayshell and drew their lightning in the form of protests with a speed i could not have believed .  space .  what an excellent excuse that made for my visit   concern lest a foundation national in any way disturbed then and gratitude for their forbearance .         shrewd .     you don   t think it would have been better  though  to have brought trevize back with us .         no .  on the whole  i prefer him anywhere but at home .  he would be a disturbing factor on terminus .  his nonsense about the second foundation served as the perfect excuse for sending him out and  of course  we counted on pelorat to lead him to sayshell  but i don   t want him back  continuing to spread the nonsense .  we can never tell what that might lead to .      kodell chuckled .     i doubt that we can ever find anyone more gullible than an intellectual academic .  i wonder how much pelorat would have swallowed if we had encouraged him .         belief in the literal existence of the mythical sayshellian gaia was quite enough   but forget it .  we will have to face the council when we return and we will need their votes for the sayshellian treaty .  fortunately we have trevize   s statement   voiceprint and all    to the effect that he left terminus voluntarily .  i will offer official regrets as to trevize   s brief arrest and that will satisfy the council .         i can rely on you for the soft soap  mayor     said kodell dryly .     have you considered  though  that trevize may continue to search for the second foundation .         let him     said branno  shrugging     as long as he doesn   t do it on terminus .  it will keep him busy and get him nowhere .  the second foundation   s continued existence is our myth of the century  as gaia is sayshell   s myth .      she leaned back and looked positively genial .     and now we have sayshell in our grip   and by the time they see that  it will be too late for them to break the grip .  so the foundation   s growth continues and will continue  smoothly and regularly .         and the credit will be entirely yours  mayor .         that has not escaped my notice     said branno  and their ship slipped into hyperspace and reappeared in the neighborhood space of terminus .   speaker stor gendibal  on his own ship again  had every reason for satisfaction .  the encounter with the first foundation had not lasted long  but it had been thoroughly productive .   he had sent back his message of carefully muted triumph .  it was only necessary   for the moment   to let the first speaker know that all had gone well  as  indeed  he might guess from the fact that the general force of the second foundation had never had to be used after all  .  the details could come later on .   he would describe how a careful   and very minor   adjustment to mayor branno   s mind had turned her thoughts from imperialistic grandiosity to the practicality of commercial treaty  how a careful    and rather long distance   adjustment of the leader of the sayshell union had led to an invitation to the mayor of a parley and how  thereafter  a rapprochement had been reached with no further adjustments at all with compor returning to terminus on his own ship  to see that the agreement would be kept .  it had been  gendibal thought complacently  almost a storybook example of large results brought about by minutely crafted mentalics .   it would  he was sure  squash speaker delarmi flat and bring about his own elevation to first speaker very soon after the presentation of the details at a formal meeting of the table .   and he did not deny to himself the importance of sum novi   s presence  though that would not need to be stressed to the speakers generally .  not only had she been essential to his victory  but she gave him the excuse he now needed for indulging his childish  and very human  for even speakers are very human  need to exult before what he knew to be a guaranteed admiration .   she did not understand anything that had happened  he knew  but she was aware that he had arranged matters to his liking and she was bursting with pride over that .  he caressed the smoothness of her mind and felt the warmth of that pride .   he said     i could not have done it without you  novi .  it was because of you i could tell that the first foundation   the people on the large ship           yes  master  i know whom you mean .         i could tell  because of you  that they had a shield  together with weak powers of the mind .  from the effect on your mind  i could tell  exactly  the characteristics of both .  i could tell how most efficiently to penetrate the one and deflect the other .      novi said tentatively     i do not understand exactly what it is you say  master  but i would have done much more to help  if i could .         i know that  novi .  but what you did was enough .  it is amazing how dangerous they might have been .  but caught now  before either their shield or their field had been developed more strongly  they could be stopped .  the mayor goes back now  the shield and the field forgotten  satisfied over the fact that she has obtained a commercial treaty with sayshell that will make it a working part of the federation .  i don   t deny that there is much more to do to dismantle the work they have done on shield and field   it is something concerning which we have been remiss   but it will be done .      he brooded about the matter and went on in a lower voice     we took far too much for granted with the first foundation .  we must place them under closer supervision .  we must knit the galaxy closer together somehow .  we must make use of mentalics to build a closer co operation of consciousness .  that would fit the plan .  i   m convinced of that and i   ll see to it .      novi said anxiously     master .      gendibal smiled suddenly .     i   m sorry .  i   m talking to myself .     novi  do you remember rufirant .         that bone skulled farmer who attacked you .  i should say i do .         i   m convinced that first foundation agents  armed with personal shields  arranged that  together with all the other anomalies that have plagued us .  imagine being blind to a thing like that .  but then  i was bemused into overlooking the first foundation altogether by this myth of a mysterious world  this sayshellian superstition concerning gaia .  there  too  your mind came in handy .  it helped me determine that the source of that mentalic field was the warship and nothing else .      he rubbed his hands .   novi said timidly     master .         yes  novi .         will you not be rewarded for what you have done .         indeed i will .  shandess will retire and i will be first speaker .  then will come my chance to make us an active factor in revolutionizing the galaxy .         first speaker .         yes  novi .  i will be the most important and the most powerful scholar of them all .         the most important .     she looked woebegone .      why do you make a face  novi .  don   t you want me to be rewarded .         yes  master  i do .     but if you are the most important scholar of them all  you will not want a hamishwoman near you .  it would not be fitting .         won   t i  though .  who will stop me .     he felt a gush of affection for her .     novi  you   ll stay with me wherever i go and whatever i am .  do you think i would risk dealing with some of the wolves we occasionally have at the table without your mind always there to tell me  even before they know themselves  what their emotions might be   your own innocent  absolutely smooth mind .  besides       he seemed startled by a sudden revelation     even aside from that  i   i like having you with me and i intend having you with me .     that is  if you are willing .         oh  master     whispered novi and  as his arm moved around her waist  her head sank to his shoulder .   deep within  where the enveloping mind of novi could scarcely be aware of it  the essence of gaia remained and guided events  but it was that impenetrable mask that made the continuance of the great task possible .   and that mask   the one that belonged to a hamishwoman   was completely happy .  it was so happy that novi was almost reconciled for the distance she was from herself them all  and she was content to be  for the indefinite future  what she seemed to be .   pelorat rubbed his hands and said  with carefully controlled enthusiasm     how glad i am to be back on gaia .         umm     said trevize abstractedly .      you know what bliss has told me .  the mayor is going back to terminus with a commercial treaty with sayshell .  the speaker from the second foundation is going back to trantor convinced that he has arranged it   and that woman  novi  is going with him to see to it that the changes that will bring about galaxia are initiated .  and neither foundation is in the least aware that gaia exists .  it   s absolutely amazing .         i know     said trevize .     i was told all this  too .  but we know that gaia exists and we can talk .         bliss doesn   t think so .  she says no one would believe us  and we would know that .  besides  i  for one  have no intention of ever leaving gaia .      trevize was pulled out of his inner musing .  he looked up and said     what .         i   m going to stay here .     you know  i can   t believe it .  just weeks ago  i was living a lonely life on terminus  the same life i had lived for decades  immersed in my records and my thoughts and never dreaming anything but that i would go to my death  whenever it might be  still immersed in my records and my thoughts and still living my lonely life   contentedly vegetating .  then  suddenly and unexpectedly  i became a galactic traveler  i was involved with a galactic crisis  and   do not laugh  golan   i have found bliss .         i   m not laughing  janov     said trevize     but are you sure you know what you   re doing .         oh yes .  this matter of earth is no longer important to me .  the fact that it was the only world with a diverse ecology and with intelligent life has been adequately explained .  the eternals  you know .         yes  i know .  and you   re going to stay on gaia .         absolutely .  earth is the past and i   m tired of the past .  gaia is the future .         you   re not part of gaia  janov .  or do you think you can become part of it .         bliss says that i can become somewhat a part of it   intellectually if not biologically .  she   ll help  of course .         but since she is part of it  how can you two find a common life  a common point of view  a common interest        they were in the open and trevize looked gravely at the quiet  fruitful island  and beyond it the sea  and on the horizon  purpled by distance  another island   all of it peaceful  civilized  alive  and a unit .   he said     janov  she is a world  you are a tiny individual .  what if she gets tired of you .  she is young           golan  i   ve thought of that .  i   ve thought of nothing but that for days .  i expect her to grow tired of me  i   m no romantic idiot .  but whatever she gives me till then will be enough .  she has already given me enough .  i have received more from her than i dreamed existed in life .  if i saw her no more from this moment on  i have ended the winner .         i don   t believe it     said trevize gently .     i think you are a romantic idiot and  mind you  i wouldn   t want you any other way .  janov  we haven   t known each other for long  but we   ve been together every moment for weeks and   i   m sorry if it sounds silly   i like you a great deal .         and i  you  golan     said pelorat .      and i don   t want you hurt .  i must talk to bliss .         no no .  please don   t .  you   ll lecture her .         i won   t lecture her .  it   s not entirely to do with you   and i want to talk to her privately .  please  janov  i don   t want to do it behind your back  so grant me your willingness to have me talk to her and get a few things straight .  if i am satisfied  i will give you my heartiest congratulations and goodwill   and i will forever hold my peace  whatever happens .      pelorat shook his head .     you   ll ruin things .         i promise i won   t i beg you           well    but do be careful  my dear fellow  won   t you .         you have my solemn word .      bliss said     pel says you want to see me .      trevize said     yes .      they were indoors  in the small apartment allotted to him .   she sat down gracefully  crossed her legs  and looked up at him shrewdly  her beautiful brown eyes luminous and her long  dark hair glistening .   she said     you disapprove of me  don   t you .  you have disapproved of me from the start .      trevize remained standing .  he said     you are aware of minds and of their contents .  you know what i think of you and why .      slowly bliss shook her head .     your mind is out of bounds to gaia .  you know that .  your decision was needed and it had to be the decision of a clear and untouched mind .  when your ship was first taken  i placed you and pel within a soothing field  but that was essential .  you would have been damaged   and perhaps rendered useless for a crucial time   by panic or rage .  and that was all .  i could never go beyond that and i haven   t   so i don   t know what you   re thinking .      trevize said     the decision i had to make has been made .  i decided in favor of gaia and galaxia .  why  then  all this talk of a clear and untouched mind .  you have what you want and you can do with me now as you wish .         not at all  trev .  there are other decisions that may be needed in the future .  you remain what you are and  while you are alive  you are a rare natural resource of the galaxy .  undoubtedly there are others like you in the galaxy and others like you will appear in the future  but for now we know of you   and only you .  we still cannot touch you .      trevize considered .     you are gaia and i don   t want to talk to gaia .  i want to talk to you as an individual  if that has any meaning at all .         it has meaning .  we are far from existing in a common melt .  i can block off gaia for a period of time .         yes     said trevize .     i think you can .  have you now done so .         i have now done so .         then  first  let me tell you that you have played games .  you did not enter my mind to influence my decision  perhaps  but you certainly entered janov   s mind to do so  didn   t you .         do you think i did .         i think you did .  at the crucial moment  pelorat reminded me of his own vision of the galaxy as alive and the thought drove me on to make my decision at that moment .  the thought may have been his  but yours was the mind that triggered it  was it not .      bliss said     the thought was in his mind  but there were many thoughts there .  i smoothed the path before that reminiscence of his about the living galaxy   and not before any other thought of his .  that particular thought  therefore  slipped easily out of his consciousness and into words .  mind you  i did not create the thought .  it was there .         nevertheless  that amounted to an indirect tampering with the perfect independence of my decision  did it not .         gaia felt it necessary .         did it .     well  it may make you feel better   or nobler   to know that although janov   s remark persuaded me to make the decision at that moment  it was the decision i think i would have made even if he had said nothing or if he had tried to argue me into a decision of a different kind .  i want you to know that .         i am relieved     said bliss coolly .     is that what you wanted to tell me when you asked to see me .         no .         what else is there .      now trevize sat down in a chair he had drawn opposite her so that their knees nearly touched .  he leaned toward her .      when we approached gaia  it was you on the space station .  it was you who trapped us  you who came out to get us  you who have remained with us ever since   except for the meal with dom  which you did not share with us .  in particular  it was you on the far star with us  when the decision was made .  always you .         i am gaia .         that does not explain it .  a rabbit is gaia .  a pebble is gaia .  everything on the planet is gaia  but they are not all equally gaia .  some are more equal than others .  why you .         why do you think .      trevize made the plunge .  he said     because i don   t think you   re gaia .  i think you   re more than gaia .      bliss made a derisive sound with her lips .   trevize kept to his course .     at the time i was making the decision  the woman with the speaker           he called her novi .         this novi  then  said that gaia was set on its course by the robots that no longer exist and that gaia was taught to follow a version of the three laws of robotics .         that is quite true .         and the robots no longer exist .         so novi said .         so novi did not say .  i remember her exact words .  she said     gaia was formed thousands of years ago with the help of robots that once  for a brief time  served the human species and now serve them no more .         well  trev  doesn   t that mean they exist no more .         no  it means they serve no more .  might they not rule instead .         ridiculous .         or supervise .  why were you there at the time of the decision .  you did not seem to be essential .  it was novi who conducted matters and she was gaia .  what need of you .  unless           well .  unless .         unless you are the supervisor whose role it is to make certain that gaia does not forget the three laws .  unless you are a robot  so cleverly made that you cannot be told from a human being .         if i cannot be told from a human being  how is it you think that you can tell .     asked bliss with a trace of sarcasm .   trevize sat back .     do you not all assure me i have the faculty of being sure  of making decisions  seeing solutions  drawing correct conclusions .  i don   t claim this  it is what you say of me .  well  from the moment i saw you i felt uneasy .  there was something wrong with you .  i am certainly as susceptible to feminine allure as pelorat is   more so  i should think   and you are an attractive woman in appearance .  yet not for one moment did i feel the slightest attraction .         you devastate me .      trevize ignored that .  he said     when you first appeared on our ship  janov and i had been discussing the possibility of a nonhuman civilization on gaia  and when janov saw you  he asked  in his innocence     are you human .     perhaps a robot must answer the truth  but i suppose it can be evasive .  you merely said     don   t i look human .     yes  you look human  bliss  but let me ask you again .  are you human .      bliss said nothing and trevize continued .     i think that even at that first moment  i felt you were not a woman .  you are a robot and i could somehow tell .  and because of my feeling  all the events that followed had meaning for me   particularly your absence from the dinner .      bliss said     do you think i cannot eat  trev .  have you forgotten i nibbled a shrimp dish on your ship .  i assure you that i am able to eat and perform any of the other biological functions .     including  before you ask  sex .  and yet that in itself  i might as well tell you  does not prove that i am not a robot .  robots had reached the pitch of perfection  even thousands of years ago  where only by their brains were they distinguishable from human beings  and then only by those able to handle mentalic fields .  speaker gendibal might have been able to tell whether i were robot or human  if he had bothered even once to consider me .  of course  he did not .         yet  though i am without mentalics  i am nevertheless convinced you are a robot     bliss said     but what if i am .  i admit nothing  but i am curious .  what if i am .         you have no need to admit anything .  i know you are a robot if i needed a last bit of evidence  it was your calm assurance that you could block off gaia and speak to me as an individual .  i don   t think you could do that if you were part of gaia   but you are not you are a robot supervisor and  therefore  outside of gaia .  i wonder  come to think of it  how many robot supervisors gaia requires and possesses .         i repeat  i admit nothing  but i am curious .  what if i am a robot .         in that case  what i want to know is  what do you want of janov pelorat .  he is my friend and he is  in some ways  a child .  he thinks he loves you  he thinks he wants only what you are willing to give and that you have already given him enough .  he doesn   t know    and cannot conceive   the pain of the loss of love or  for that matter  the peculiar pain of knowing that you are not human           do you know the pain of lost love .         i have had my moments .  i have not led the sheltered life of janov .  i have not had my life consumed and anesthetized by an intellectual pursuit that swallowed up everything else  even wife and child .  he has .  now suddenly  he gives it all up for you .  i do not want him hurt .  i will not have him hurt .  if i have served gaia  i deserve a reward   and my reward is your assurance that janov pelorat   s well being will be preserved .         shall i pretend i am a robot and answer you .      trevize said     yes .  and right now .         very well  then .  suppose i am a robot  trev  and suppose i am in a position of supervision .  suppose there are a few  a very few  who have a similar role to myself and suppose we rarely meet .  suppose that our driving force is the need to care for human beings and suppose there are no true humans beings on gaia  because all are part of an overall planetary being .      suppose that it fulfills us to care for gaia   but not entirely .  suppose there is something primitive in us that longs for a human being in the sense that existed when robots were first formed and designed .  don   t mistake me  i do not claim to be age old  assuming i am a robot  .  i am as old as i told you i was or  at least   assuming i am a robot  that has been the term of my existence .  still   assuming i am a robot  my fundamental design would be as it always was and i would long to care for a true human being .      pel is a human being .  he is not part of gaia .  he is too old to ever become a true part of gaia .  he wants to stay on gaia with me  for he does not have the feelings about me that you have .  he does not think that i am a robot .  well  i want him  too .  if you assume that i am a robot  you see that i would .  i am capable of all human reactions and i would love him .  if you were to insist i was a robot  you might not consider me capable of love in some mystic human sense  but you would not be able to distinguish my reactions from that which you would call love   so what difference would it make .      she stopped and looked at him   intransigently proud .  trevize said     you are telling me that you would not abandon him .         if you assume that i am a robot  then you can see for yourself that by first law i could never abandon him  unless he ordered me to do so and i were  in addition  convinced that he meant it and that i would be hurting him more by staying than by leaving .         would not a younger man           what younger man .  you are a younger man  but i do not conceive you as needing me in the same sense that pel does  and  in fact  you do not want me  so that the first law would prevent me from attempting to cling to you .         not me .  another younger man           there is no other .  who is there on gaia other than pel and yourself that would qualify as human beings in the non gaian sense .      trevize said  more softly     and if you are not a robot .         make up your mind     said bliss .      i say  if you are not a robot .         then i say that  in that case  you have no right to say anything at all .  it is for myself and for pel to decide .      trev said     then i return to my first point .  i want my reward and that reward is that you will treat him well .  i won   t press the point of your identity .  simply assure me  as one intelligence to another  that you will treat him well .      and bliss said softly     i will treat him well   not as a reward to you  but because i wish to .  it is my earnest desire .  i will treat him well .     she called    pel .     and again     pel .      pelorat entered from outside     yes  bliss .      bliss held out her hand to him .     i think trev wants to say something .      pelorat took her hand and trevize then took the doubled hand in his two .     janov     he said     i am happy for both of you .      pelorat said     oh  my dear fellow .      trevize said     i will probably be leaving gaia .  i go now to speak to dom about that .  i don   t know when or if we will meet again  janov  but  in any case  we did well together .         we did well     said pelorat  smiling .      good bye  bliss  and  in advance  thank you .         good bye  trev .      and trevize  with a wave of his hand  left the house .   dom said     you did well  trev .     but then  you did as i thought you would .      they were once more sitting over a meal  as unsatisfactory as the first had been  but trevize did not mind .  he might not be eating on gaia again .   he said     i did as i thought you would  but not  perhaps  for the reason you thought i would .         surely you were sure of the correctness of your decision .         yes  i was  but not because of any mystic grip i have on certainty .  if i chose galaxia  it was through ordinary reasoning   the sort of reasoning that anyone else might have used to come to a decision .  would you care to have me explain .         i most certainly would  trev .      trevize said     there were three things i might have done .  i might have joined the first foundation  or joined the second foundation  or joined gaia .      if i had joined the first foundation  mayor branno would have taken immediate action to establish domination over the second foundation and over gaia .  if i had joined the second foundation  speaker gendibal would have taken immediate action to establish domination over the first foundation and over gaia .  in either case  what would have taken place would have been irreversible   and if either were the wrong solution  it would have been irreversibly catastrophic .      if i joined with gaia  however  then the first foundation and the second foundation would each have been left with the conviction of having won a relatively minor victory .  all would then have continued as before  since the building of galaxia  i had already been told  would take generations  even centuries .      joining with gaia was my way of temporizing  then  and of making sure that there would remain time to modify matters   or even reverse them   if my decision were wrong .      dom raised his eyebrows .  his old  almost cadaverous face remained otherwise expressionless .  he said in his piping voice     and is it your opinion that your decision may turn out wrong .      trevize shrugged .     i don   t think so  but there is one thing i must do in order that i might know .  it is my intention to visit earth  if i can find that world .         we will certainly not stop you if you wish to leave us  trev           i do not fit on your world .         no more than pel does  yet you are as welcome to remain as he is .  still  we will not hold you .     but tell me  why do you wish to visit earth .      trevize said     i rather think you understand .         i do not .         there is a piece of information you withheld from me  dom .  perhaps you had your reasons  but i wish you had not .      dom said     i do not follow you .         look  dom  in order to make my decision  i used my computer and for a brief moment i found myself in touch with the minds of those about me   mayor branno  speaker gendibal  novi .  i caught glimpses of a number of matters that  in isolation  meant little to me  as  for example  the various effects gaia  through novi  had produced on trantor   effects that were intended to maneuver the speaker into going to gaia .         yes .         and one of those things was the clearing from trantor   s library of all references to earth .         the clearing of references to earth .         exactly .  so earth must be important   and not only does it appear that the second foundation must know nothing about it  but that i must not  either .  and if i am to take the responsibility for the direction of galactic development  i do not willingly accept ignorance .  would you consider telling me why it was so important to keep knowledge of earth hidden .      dom said solemnly     trev  gaia knows nothing about such clearance .  nothing .         are you telling me that gaia is not responsible .         it is not responsible .      trevize thought for a while  the tip of his tongue moving slowly and meditatively over his lips .     who was responsible  then .         i don   t know .  i can see no purpose in it .      the two men stared at each other and then dom said     you are right .  we had seemed to have reached a most satisfactory conclusion  but while this point remains unsettled  we dare not rest .     stay a while with us and let us see what we can reason out .  then you can leave  with our full help .         thank you     said trevize .     the end     for now       afterword by the author      this book while self contained  is a continuation of the foundation trilogy  which is made up of three books  foundation  foundation and empire  and second foundation .   in addition  there are other books i have written which  while not dealing with the foundations directly  are set in what we might call    the foundation universe .      thus  the events in the stars  like dust and the currents of space take place in the years when trantor was expanding toward empire  while the events in pebble in the sky take place when the first galactic empire was at the height of its power .  in pebble  earth is central and some of the material in it is alluded to tangentially in this new book .   in none of the earlier books of the foundation universe were robots mentioned .  in this new book  however  there are references to robots .  in this connection  you may wish to read my robot stories .  the short stories are to be found in the complete robot  while the two novels  the caves of steel and the naked sun  describe the robotic period of the colonization of the galaxy .   if you wish an account of the eternals and the way in which they adjusted human history  you will find it  not entirely consistent with the references in this new book  in the end of eternity .   all the books mentioned existed as doubleday hardcovers  to begin with .  the foundation trilogy and the complete robot are still in print in hardcover .  of the others  pebble in the sky and the end of eternity are included in the omnibus volume the far ends of time and earth  while the stars  like dust and the currents of space are in the omnibus volume prisoners of the stars .  both omnibus volumes are in print in hardcover .  as for the caves of steel and the naked sun  they are included in the omnibus volume the robot novels  still available from the science fiction book club .  and all are in print in softcover editions  of course .
