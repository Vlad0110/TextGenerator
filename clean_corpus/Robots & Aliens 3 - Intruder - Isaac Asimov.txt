isaac asimov   s  robot city    robots  and aliens    intruder by robert thurston    copyright              for my lovely ladies   rosemary and charlotte      what is a human being .   isaac asimov    it sounds like a simple question .  biologically  a human being is a member of the species homo sapiens .  if we agree that one particular organism  say  a male  is a human being  then any female with which he can breed is also a human being .  and any males with whom any of these females can breed are also human beings .  this instantly marks up billions of organisms on earth as human beings .   it may be that there are organisms that are too old to breed  or too young  or too imperfect in one way or another  but who resemble human beings more than they resemble any other species .  they  too  are human beings .   we thus end up with something over   billion human beings on earth right now  and perhaps    billion who have lived on earth since homo sapiens evolved .   that   s simple  isn   t it .  from the biological standpoint  we are all human beings  whether we speak english  turkish  or japanese  whether we have pale skin or dark  red hair or black  blue eyes or brown  flat noses or beaky ones  and so on .   that  however  is a biological definition  a sophisticated one .  now suppose that you are a member of a primitive tribe  homogeneous in appearance  language and culture  and you suddenly encounter someone who looks superficially like you but has red hair  where you   ve seen only black  fair skin where you   ve seen only dark  and  worst of all  who cannot understand    people language    but makes odd sounds  which he seems to understand  but which clearly make no sense whatever .   are these strangers human beings in the sense that you yourself are .  i   m afraid the consensus would be that they are not .  nor is it entirely a matter of lack of sophistication .  the ancient greeks  who were certainly among the most sophisticated human beings who ever lived  divided all human beings into two groups  greeks and barbarians .   by barbarians  they didn   t mean people who were uncivilized or bestial .  they recognized that some barbarians  like the egyptians and babylonians and persians were highly cultivated .  it was just that non greeks didn   t speak greek  they made sounds that made no more sense  to a greek encountering other languages for the first time  than a silly sound like    bar bar bar .      you might feel that greeks may have made that division as a matter of convenience  but that they didn   t go so far as to think that barbarians weren   t human .   oh  didn   t they .  aristotle  one of the most sophisticated of all the ancient greeks  was quite certain that barbarians were slave material by nature  while greeks were free men by nature .  clearly  he felt that there was something sub human about barbarians .   but they were ancients  however sophisticated they might have been .  they had limited experience  knew only a small portion of the world .  nowadays  we have learned so much we don   t come to those foolish conclusions .  we know that all human like creatures are a single species .   yes .  was it so long ago that most white americans were quite certain that african blacks were not human in the sense that they themselves were  that the blacks were inferior and that to enslave them and let them live on the outskirts of a white society was doing them a great favor .  i wouldn   t be surprised if some americans believe that right now .   it was not so long ago that germans maintained loudly that slavs and jews were sub human  so that they were right to do their best to rid    true    human beings of such vermin .  and i wouldn   t be in the least surprised if there were lots of people right now who harbor similar notions .   almost everyone thinks of other groups as    inferior     although often they do not care to say so out loud .  they tend to divide humanity into groups of which only a small part  a part which invariably includes themselves  are    true    human beings .   the bible  of course  teaches universality  at least  in places  .  thus  consider one of my own favorite passages in the new testament  the parable of the    good samaritan     luke           .  someone tells jesus that one of the beliefs one must have if one is to go to heaven is    to love .  .  . thy neighbour as thyself .      jesus says he is correct and the man asks     and who is my neighbour .      in other words  does he love only his friends and people he likes  or is he supposed to love all sorts of bums and rotters .    and here comes the parable of the good samaritan .  to put it briefly  a man needs help  and both a priest and a levite  professional do gooders  who are highly esteemed by pious people  ignore the whole matter  but a samaritan offers a great deal of help .   now we talk so much about a    good    samaritan because of this parable  that we think of the samaritans as all good and are not surprised at the help he offers .  however  to the pious jews of jesus    time  samaritans were heretics  things of evil  objects of hatred   and here we have a despised samaritan doing good when priests and levites do not .   and then jesus asks     which now of these three  thinkest thou  was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves .     and the man is forced to say     he that shewed mercy on him .      this is as much to say that all good people are neighbors even when they are the kind of beneath contempt individuals as samaritans are .  and it follows  since all human beings have the capacity to be good  all people are neighbors and love should extend to all .   st .  paul says in galatians          there is neither jew nor greek  there is neither bond nor free  there is neither male nor female  for ye are all one in christ jesus .      that is a flat statement of universality .   i know that there are many pious people who know these passages and who nevertheless maintain racist views of one sort or another .  such is the desire to be part of a superior group that nothing can wipe out the tendency to picture others as inferior  to divide human beings into a human  b semihuman  and c sub human  being careful always to put yourself into the first class .   and if we have such trouble in getting human beings to define what a human being is  imagine the problem a robot would have .  how does a robot define a human being .   in the old days  when i was first beginning to write my robot stories  john w .  campbell  my editor and mentor  challenged me on several occasions to write a story that hinged on the difficulty of defining a human being .  i always backed off .  i did not have to try writing such a story to know that it would be a particularly difficult one to write and that i couldn   t do it .  at least  not then .   in       however  i finally tackled the job and wrote    the bicentennial man .      it dealt essentially with a robot that became more and more human  without ever being accepted as a human being .  he became physically like a human being  mentally like a human being  and yet he never crossed the line .  finally  he did  by crossing the last barrier .  he made himself mortal  and as he was dying  he was finally accepted as a human being .   it made a good story  winning both the hugo and the nebula  but it didn   t offer a practical way of distinguishing between robot and human being  because a robot couldn   t wait for years to see if a possible human being died and thus proved itself to be a human being .   suppose you are a robot and you have to decide whether something that looks like a human being is really a human being  and you have to do it reasonably quickly .   if the only robots that exist are primitive  there is no problem .  if an object looks like a human being but is made of metal  it is a robot .  if it talks in a mechanical kind of voice .  moves with awkward jerky motions  and so on and so on  it is a robot .   but what if the robot looks  superficially  exactly like a human being  like my robot  daneel olivaw   how can you tell that he   s a robot .  well  in my later robot novels  you can   t  really .  daneel olivaw is a human being in all respects except that he   s a lot more intelligent than most human beings  a lot more ethical  a lot kinder and more decent  a lot more human .  that makes for a good story  too  but it doesn   t help identify a robot in any practical sense .  you can   t follow a robot around to see if it is better than a human being  for you then have to ask yourself   is he  she  a robot or just an unusually good human being .   there   s this     a robot is bound by the three laws of robotics  and a human being is not .  that means  for instance  that if you are a human being and you punch someone you think may be a robot and he punches you back  then he is not a robot .  if you yourself are a robot  then if you punch him and he punches you back  he may nevertheless be a robot  since he may know that you are a robot  and first law does not prevent him from hitting you .   that was a key point in my early story     evidence .      in that case  though  you must ask a human being to punch the suspected robot  and if he punches back he is no robot .   however  it doesn   t work the other way around .  if you are a human being and you hit a suspected robot  and he doesn   t hit you back  that doesn   t mean he is a robot .  he may be a human being  but a coward .  he may be a human being but an idealist  who believes in turning the other cheek .   in fact  if you are a human being and you punch a suspected robot and he punches you back  then he may still be a robot  nevertheless .   after all  the first law says  .  . a robot may not harm a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     that  however  begs the question  for it assumes that a robot knows what a human being is in the first place .   suppose a robot is manufactured to be no better than a human being .  human beings often suppose other people are inferior  and not fully human  if they simply don   t speak your language  or speak it with an odd accent .   that   s the whole point of george bernard shaw   s pygmalion .   in that case  it should be simple to build a robot within whom the definition of a human being includes the speaking of a specific language with a specific accent .  any failure in that respect makes a person the robot must deal with not a human being and the robot can harm or even kill him without breaking the first law .   in fact  i have a robot in my book robots and empire for which a human being is defined as speaking with a solarian accent  and my hero is in danger of death for that very reason .   so you see it is not easy to differentiate between a robot and a human being .   we can make the matter even more difficult  if we suppose a world of robots that have never seen human beings .   this would be like our early unsophisticated human beings who have never met anyone outside their own tribe .   they might still have the first law and might still know that they must not harm a human being   but what is this human being they must not harm .   they might well think that a human being is superior to a robot in some ways  since that would be one reason why he must not be harmed .  you ought not to offer violence to someone worthier than yourself .   on the other hand  if someone were superior to you  wouldn   t it be sensible to suppose that you couldn   t harm him .  if you could  wouldn   t that make him inferior to you .  the fallacy there ought to be obvious .  a robot is certainly superior to an unthinking rock  yet a falling rock might easily harm or even destroy a robot .  therefore the inferior can harm the superior  but in a well run universe it should not do so .   in that case  a robot beginning only with the laws of robotics might well conclude that human beings were superior to robots .   but then  suppose that in this world of robots  one robot is superior to all the rest .  is it possible  in that case  that this superior robot  who has never seen a human being  might conclude that he himself is a human being .   if he can persuade the other robots that this is so then the laws of robotics will govern their behavior toward him and he may well establish a despotism over them .  but will it differ from a human despotism in any way .  will this robot human still be governed and limited by the three laws in certain respects  or will it be totally free of them .   in that case  if it has the appearance and mentality and behavior of a human being  and if it lacks the three laws  in what way is it not a human being .  has it not become a human being in actuality .   and what happens if  then  real human beings appear on the scene .  do the three laws suddenly begin to function again in the robot human  or does he persist in considering himself human .  in my very first published robot story     reason     come to think of it  i described a robot that considered himself to be superior to human beings and could not be argued out of it .   so what with one thing or another  the problem of defining a human being is enormously complex  and while in my various stories i   ve dealt with different aspects of it  i am glad to leave the further consideration of that problem to robert thurston in this third book of the robots and aliens series .       chapter    robot city dreams    derec knew he was dreaming .  the street he now ambled down wasn   t real .  there had never been a street anywhere in robot city like this distorted thoroughfare .  still  too much was familiar about it  and that really scared him .   the compass tower  now too far in the distance  had changed  too .  there seemed to be lumps allover its surfaces  but that was impossible .  in a city where buildings could appear and disappear overnight  the compass tower was the only permanent  unchangeable structure .   it was possible this strange street was newly created  but he doubted that .  it was a dream street  plain and simple  and this had to be a dream .  anyway  where were the robots .  nobody could travel this far along a robot city street without encountering at least a utility robot scurrying along  on its way to some regular task  or a courier robot  its claws clutching tools  or a witness robot  checking the movements of the humans .  during a stroll like this  derec should have encountered a robot every few steps .   no  it was absolutely certain this was a dream .  what he was doing was sleeping in his ship somewhere in space between the blackbody planet and robot city .  he had just come off duty after dealing with the silversides for hours  a task that would tire a saint .   at one time  just after his father had injected chemfets into his bloodstream  he had regularly dreamed of robot city  but it turned out that his harrowing nightmares had all been induced by a monitor that his father had implanted in his brain .  the monitor had been trying to establish contact so he could be aware of the nature of the chemfets  which were tiny circuit boards that grew in much the same manner as the city itself had .  replicating in his bloodstream and programmed by his father  they were a tiny robot city in his body  one that gave him psycho electronic control over the city   s core computer and therefore all its robots .  after he had known this and the chemfets    replication process had stabilized  he had had no more nightmares of a distorted robot city .   until now .   since he was so aware he was dreaming  perhaps this was what ariel had explained to him as a    lucid dream .     in the lucid dream state  she said  the dreamer could control the events of the dream .  he wanted to control this dream  but at the moment he couldn   t think of anything particular to do .   he looked around him .  the immediate streetscape seemed composed of bits and pieces from several stages of the city   s development  a weird composite of what derec had observed during his several stays there .   but where were the robots .   if this was a lucid dream  maybe the reason he hadn   t seen any yet was that he hadn   t guided any into the scene .  maybe they were waiting inside the buildings to be summoned .  maybe he should do so  before he panicked .  but which one could he bring onstage .  how about lucius  the robot who had created the city   s one authentic artistic masterpiece  the breathtaking tetragonal  pyramidal building sculpture entitled    circuit breaker    .  he   d be a good choice since  as the victim of a bizarre roboticide  he no longer existed .  it certainly would be pleasant to see old lucius again  his body so unrobotically stooped  if only to chat with him about art .  there hadn   t been much art in his life lately  especially if you didn   t count the rather breathtaking spectacle of a thousand blackbodies spread across the sky .  that was pretty  but it wasn   t art .   he wondered why his thoughts were rambling so .  had the silversides disturbed his mind   s equilibrium that much .  forget them .  forget them now .  get a normal robot into the dream .  one of the most unforgettable robots he had known .  avernus  say .  let   s see his stern visage again  his jet black metallic skin  his interchangeable hands .  he concentrated on avernus  but the robot didn   t appear .  how about euler and his glowing photocell eyes .  nope  no deal .  let   s try for wohler  then  before he went nonfunctional trying to save ariel on the outer wall of the compass tower .  golden and impressive  wohler would be a wonderful choice .  but no wohler responded to his summons .  he would have to talk to ariel about this .  as a lucid dream  it was shaping up as one hell of a failure .     ariel  in her compartment aboard the ship  was also dreaming .  hers was not  however  a lucid dream .  deeper than that  it was a clearcut nightmare .   jacob winterson  the humaniform robot who had been her servant  existed again .  jacob had been destroyed by neuronius  one of the flying aliens called blackbodies .  he had blown up and mangled most of jacob  and himself in the bargain  .  the few charred pieces that remained were now buried in some unmarked area of the agricultural community she had initiated as a political compromise with the blackbodies .  the compromise had worked .  they had been about to destroy their planet   s new robot city entirely because it was a threat to their weather systems  however  an agricultural community was acceptable to all sides .   she missed jacob .  very much .  in that comfortable  detached way a human could love a robot  she had loved him .  not that it could ever have been real love .  she was too much in love with derec to be unfaithful to him except in dreams .  on the other hand  she could not deny that she had not sometimes been romantically attracted toward the handsome and imperturbable humaniform robot .   in the dream  jacob sat in front of a computer terminal  his humanlike fingers flying over the keyboard  pressing keys as if he wanted to push them all the way through  making the screen shake with the ferocity of his entries .   she asked him what he was doing .  he said he was searching for the formula that would transform a humaniform robot into a human being .  there was no such formula  she told him .  when he turned toward her  his eyes seemed filled with a frightening human anger .  he protested that there were at least a hundred earth and spacer legends in which creatures changed into human beings .  statues  puppets  fish  trees  all became human in such myths .  he was certain  he said with an un jacobian shrillness  that there had to be a formula by which he  too  could be transmogrified .     why did the compass tower look so diseased .  derec asked himself .  was it possible for him  as a lucid dreamer  to change that .  he concentrated on the building   s shape  trying to restore it to its architecturally magnificent pyramidal form .  but nothing happened .  if anything  the tower became uglier  and he had to look away from it .   in the distance something came toward him  traveling down the street at a high speed .  as it passed by buildings  the buildings changed .  when it neared  he saw it was a vehicle  but one quite unlike any robot city mode of transportation .  it ran on three thick wheels  making it vaguely resemble a jitney  the smaller  lighter utility type of vehicle used for taxiing around the city .  the vehicle   s body was misshapen  as if a lot of ungeometric chunks had been welded together on a long central stem .  it was colored black and gray in an illogical and splotchy fashion .   still certain he was in the midst of a lucid dream  derec stood defiantly in the center of the roadway    daring the vehicle to come to a screeching stop at his feet .  which it did .  good  he thought  i   m in control of the dream at last .  just watch me now .   a large hatch at the top of the vehicle sprang open with an explosive sound  and dr .  avery  his father  pulled himself through the opening .  what kind of a lucid dream was this .  the last person he wanted to see was his megalomaniacal father  interfering in a dream in just the way he   d interfered with derec   s life  injecting him with chemfets and transforming him into a walking computer .  half computer  anyway .   avery was looking more demented than usual .  his eyes  usually intense  now glowed with an overdramatic madness .  in fact  avery looked so exaggerated that derec felt he could relax .  no reason to be afraid  after all  just a dream .  a dream he would seize control of at any moment .     ariel placed her hand upon jacob   s .  his hand  she noted  felt soft  more like human than humaniform .  she told him to stop .  there was no need for him to become human .  even if he found a formula  it would be foolish to use it .  as a humaniform robot  jacob had all the virtues of human existence without all the miseries  without human physical and emotional pains .   jacob turned away from the computer and looked at ariel  for a moment a humanlike sadness in his eyes .      don   t you see .     he said     i want the misery .  i want to feel what a human feels .  pain  happiness  love .  i want to love you  mistress ariel .      she put a finger on his lips .  in contrast to his hand  they felt robotic  hard metal lips that could  if she pressed hard enough  make her fingertip bleed .  she almost wanted to test that out .  if she tried to cut her hand  would jacob be able to invoke the first law of robotics   the part stating that a robot could not allow a human to come to harm   fast enough to prevent her from succeeding .      you can   t love me  jacob     she said tenderly .     i love derec  so there   s no point in your loving me .  it would be   what do they call it in romances   unrequited .         that wouldn   t matter .  i would be happy with that  too .  i could respond to it  as in your great literary works .  i could  like one of your legendary lovers  die falling off a bridge or swimming a river or with a vial of poison and a great dagger plunging in           hush  jacob .  please stop .  i wouldn   t want you to die for me .         i am already dead .         no  don   t say that .  you   re here .  you   re           in a grave .         jacob           a rotting scrap pile of metal  spare parts covered by soil .      his words were so fiercely spoken they frightened her .  she backed away from him .     dr .  avery was dressed in a black and gray silver buttoned uniform that seemed too militaristic for a scientist .      you look bemused     he said  then added almost contemptuously      .  .  . my son .  what is bothering you .         it   s well  it   s that this is my dream  and i   m supposed to be in control  and you   re not welcome in it .      avery smiled sinisterly .     you can   t get me out of it .  i am everywhere .  in the city  in your dreams  in your hat .         my hat .  i don   t even wear a           just an old earth expression .  i am an expert in old earth expressions .  can it  flip out  you   re the bee   s knees  life is hard and then you die .  i know earth expressions from all parts of its history .         but i wouldn   t know any  and this is my dream  and you come out of my mind .         are you sure .         i know you   re nowhere near .  i am on a ship heading for robot city .  you may be in the city  muddling things up as usual  but you   re not on this ship .         maybe i am .  i am  after all  omniscient and omnipotent .         i know  i know .  always a god in your own mind .         yes .      if this was a lucid dream  derec thought  then he should be able to flee from the old bastard .  he whirled around and started running down the street .  on both sides of him buildings seemed to slip into the ground while new ones popped out .   many buildings were oddly shaped  not at all like any existing robot city ones .  some were tilted at odd angles  with several leaning into others while others leaned away .  in the distance a tall edifice swayed from side to side as if caught in a violent wind .  but there was a rhythm to its swaying  reminding him of a dance .  what dance .  something intruding from his past  a vague memory that would not get focused .  his past had a way of doing that  with some memory fragment flashing into his mind and going right out again before he could make any connection with it .  there were so many parts of his past life that were still blocked from his mind by the amnesia that had once been total .     ariel suddenly found herself in an underground corridor on earth  but it looked nothing like any of the tunnels she had seen during her actual visit there .  for one thing  it was deserted .  you never saw an empty passageway on earth .  human bodies were visible everywhere  except in private quarters .   her steps echoed hollowly through the corridor  with a hundred echoes of echoes .  she felt as if she were being hounded by a mob of people all walking at her exact pace .  each time she turned around to confront her trackers  there was no one in sight .   she came to a section kitchen  the kind of public eating area she   d come to despise .  plenty of food steamed on cafeteria style trays  but no people sat at the many numbered tables or worked behind the counters .  the room looked as if there had been a sudden alarm and everyone had scurried out .   she felt hungry  and  taking a spoon and wiping it thoroughly on a paper napkin  she was an auroran  after all  who was repelled by earth   s poor hygienic habits   she scooped out a biteful of something soft and white .  however  when she put it in her mouth  it seemed to flame up and singe her tongue and the roof of her mouth .  she spit it out .      are you poisoned  mistress ariel .     it was jacob again  appearing at her side as if by magic .      no .  but it is good of you to ask .         i must .  first law .         oh  of course .  if you decide to become human  jacob  you won   t have to obey the laws of robotics any more .  i   ll miss the advantage of having you protect me .         i would protect you  mistress  whether i were human or robot .      there was something so touching  something so sad and vulnerable about this dream version of her dead robot companion  that ariel began to cry .  she cried in her dream  and she was still crying when she woke up .     derec looked back .  avery and his strange vehicle had vanished from the center of the street .  good  at least something in this lucid dream had worked out right .   ahead of him there was a park .  derec could see tall trees  thick with branches  heavy with green leaves .  brightly colored flowers lined cobblestone paths .  metal umbrellas shaded soft lights that were spaced evenly along the pathways .  at the top of a slight rise  he could see swings  slides  see saws  monkey bars  all the equipment of a playground .   he raced toward the park  picking up his pace .  the street seemed to speed beneath him as if he were powering a treadmill .  before he reached the park  the buildings lining the street grew larger  towering over the thoroughfare  bending toward it  shading the light and making everything darker .   his last step from the city street onto the park   s cobbled path was an impressive leap  one longer than he could normally accomplish .  landing  he stumbled forward for several steps .   he started walking toward the playground .  the pathway was soft  resilient .  he decided to trot  and the bounciness of the path added a spring to his steps .  he attained such a speed that he nearly skidded past the playground entrance .   a closed gate blocked the way into the playground .  above the gate was a gilded sign that read  a very park .  the old reprobate  he   d named a park after himself .  what gall .  playgrounds were supposed to represent happiness and joy .  in no way did they suggest the doctor   s monstrous cynicism .   underneath the large sign was a smaller one that read  stand on soap  all geeks who mentor here .  what did avery mean by that .  and how could he  after all  mean anything .  he was merely a figure in derec   s dream .  the real question was how could derec   s mind have formed this unusual scene  these strange words .  he would have to discuss all this with ariel  the expert on such matters .   when he opened the gate  there was a sonorous beep as the gate latch separated from its fastening .  a deep voice that seemed to come from above said     welcome .  enjoy .         enjoy what .     derec asked .  there was no reply  no doubt because the voice was a recording cued by the opening of the gate .   tentatively he took a couple of steps into the playground .  to his immediate right was a high slide .  even though he didn   t remember his childhood  he knew it was a slide .  it even looked like a familiar one .  walking up to it  he discovered it was incomplete .  no ladder led up to the platform from which a child would start his downward plunge .  the slide appeared to stand without any support .   an overwhelming urge to try out the slide came over him .  although he could have climbed from the bottom edge of the slide up to the platform at its top  he knew he had to start from the platform itself .  this was his lucid dream and he could do anything he wanted to  including jump higher than was physically possible .  crouching down as close to the ground as he could get  he jumped up .  he reached for the edge of the platform  but just missed .  back on the ground  he scrunched down again and made a second  magnificent leap that took him higher than the level of the platform .  reaching out  he grabbed its rim .  struggling and grunting  he pulled himself onto the small platform .  it bounced up and down like a diving board  nearly flinging him back to the ground .   the slide seemed even taller than it had from ground level  or else he had become very small  a child again .  looking down at his hands  he saw they   d shrunk .  they were child   s hands .  not only that  his clothing had been magically transformed .  he was now dressed in one of those silver jumpers that were once all the rage for toddlers .   how did he know about silver jumpers .   before he could even speculate on this mystery  a voice from down below called to him     c   mon down the slide  honey .  i   ll catch you .      there was a woman standing at the foot of the slide .  she seemed tall and thin  but he could not make out the details of her face  even though it was turned upward at him .  her voice was soft and wonderfully friendly .  he felt ready to slide down to her .  but  even as he stared at her  her shape changed .  now she was a short  rather plump lady in odd  out of date clothes  but the face was still not discernible .  was this some trick of one of the silversides .  were they experimenting with human shapes  using pictures they extracted from the ship computer .      don   t be afraid  honey     the woman said .  was he mistaken  or was that eve silverside   s voice .     you won   t falloff the slide .  it   ll be all right .      if it was a silverside  he or she just might make him fall to the ground by pulling her hands away just as he reached the bottom edge .  he shrunk back  no longer wanting to slide down .   the woman was now medium height  medium build  wearing a pristinely white lab smock .  no matter what shape she took  what clothes she wore  he still saw no face .  he knew there was a face there .  it just wouldn   t come into focus for him in spite of the vivid details of the rest of her .      let go of those bars  dear  and come down .  don   t worry .  mommy   ll catch you .      mommy .  this was his mother .  no  it must be a silverside  playing a joke .  he didn   t know his mother and  in fact  knew very little about her .  his father had provided no information .  how could a silverside even hope to duplicate her .  wait .  this was a dream .  the woman below was neither silverside nor his mother .  it was an apparition from his own mind .   one thing he did know now .  he didn   t want to go down the slide  not even to his mother   s eagerly awaiting arms .  he started to scream .  his screams sounded childlike  shrill  highpitched  tremulous .      no  i   m not coming down .  i   m not .  i   m not .         it   s all right  david .  mommy   s right here .      david  his real name  or at least the one that ariel and his father had said was the right one .  perhaps this was no dream and this was really his mother .  if he slid down  he could see her better .  but her arms might turn into knives  fire  pain .  he was suddenly very afraid of her .      leave me alone .     he screamed .     leave me alone .      suddenly the bars he was clutching became red hot  and so did the metal beneath him .  it felt the way a slide did when it had been standing in the sun at high noon on the hottest day of the year .   how did he know that .    he could not hold on .   he had to let go .   he slid down  screaming .   his mother   s face seemed to come up at him  but there were still no recognizable features on it .   he saw her reach out toward him .   and woke up .   he could feel the sweat on his face as he stared up into the lovely face of ariel welsh .  she stood beside his bunk  her arms reaching out to him just like his dream mother   s had .     chapter    dealing with the silversides    ariel rubbed derec   s forehead gently .  the way she touched him was now one of his favorite things in life .  it seemed to him that her fingertips did not actually make contact with his skin but merely gave off comforting rays as they passed above it .  ariel had told him that there were people who appeared to heal the sick because of the comforting warm emanations that came from their hands .  the warmth had actually been measured and was sometimes burning hot .  on the planet solaria  she told him  such affection or healing was rare .  solarians obeyed taboos against touching others  and that seemed sad to her .      you   re positively drenched in sweat  derec .  that must have been one whale of a dream .         it was .  awful .         i know how you feel .  i just had a lulu of a nightmare myself .         what was your dream about .      she didn   t want to tell him that it concerned jacob winterson or that she had awakened crying .  he   d been somewhat jealous of jacob  so the subject was best ignored right now .      nothing special .  tell me yours .         there was the city  robot city  and it was all strange  mixed up .  and my father in a car that looked like a disease .  and .  .  . and .  .  . my mother .  .  .         hush  hush .  take it easy .  when you   re ready  tell me all about it  calmly and in order .      he nodded .  getting up from the bunk  he brushed past her .  as he paced  he concentrated on stretching the sleep out of his muscles and lowering his breathing to an acceptable rhythm     i thought i was having a lucid dream  but  you know  i was never able to control it  not even for a second .      as he related the dream  ariel noted that his face and voice were childlike .  sometimes she forgot how young they actually were .  all the responsibility and strain of their lives since they had first come to robot city had seemed to age them incredibly .  sometimes her mental image of herself was of a much older woman  one who   d been coping with adversity for so long that the experience registered in deep lines on her face .  however  a look into any mirror showed her the same young  almost adolescent  mien  the baby fat of her cheeks  the brightness of her eyes  the radiance of her long black hair  the youthful sheen of her skin .  her figure  once fairly gaunt  had filled out well  too   as derec so often reminded her .   looking into his tired eyes  realizing he had not slept well for some time  she wondered how a couple of kids like them had stumbled into a life filled with so much tension and danger .  why couldn   t they go back to aurora  they had been there  excited with their love  for too brief a time  and romp without care through one of its lovely forests or swim in a placid lake .  if not aurora  the strictly regimented  uncomfortably overpopulated earth might even do .  anywhere where they could be suitably young for a while .      what do you make of it  ariel .  the dream .      she wondered how much analysis he could take right now .  his face pale beneath his damp  sandy hair  he looked vulnerable .      well  i don   t really know .  maybe all the worries you   ve had  what with the strange messages you   ve been getting from robot city  maybe they   re just coming out in your dreams .      derec   s chemfets had gone haywire when he had tried to contact robot city .  normally he could easily check on operations there from vast distances across space  but all he could sense these days was some vague activity and some nonsense he could not interpret .  the last time he   d tried  he could swear the central computer was too occupied with transmitting a medley of unusual songs to bother responding to him .  that wasn   t the way the chemfet system was supposed to work .  the computer was the conduit between derec   s chemfets and robot city  allowing him to run the place and  since the responsibility was so awesome  to delegate authority properly to the appropriate robots .  in a way  robot city had become an extension of derec  or at least of him and his wishes  his orders  his plans and dreams for the city   s future .  he had previously been able to take charge of any part of the city   s operations in an instant  without having to accept musical digressions from a computer .  now a good part of the city   s activities seemed shut off from him .   he felt isolated  as if the chemfets  unable to sustain normal contact with the city  were idly traveling through his bloodstream to no useful purpose .  it was a nerve wracking feeling that may have been something like the detachment and distortion of reality that a disturbed person must feel  and he didn   t like it .  his father was  derec believed  insane  and he sometimes worried that genetics would win out  and he   d wind up in a loony bin himself .   dr .  avery could very well be behind the present looniness in robot city .  whenever there was trouble there  he was always the first logical suspect .  since he was the creator of the city  no one would know better than he how to disrupt it .   ariel now smiled at him .  what must she be thinking as his mind drifted off like this .      frost     he said     it all seems pretty warped when i think of it .  maybe it   s just worry about robot city .  but that part where i can   t see my mother   s face  that really scares me .         take it easy  darling .  maybe you dream about her because you want to see her           i never think of her .  i don   t want to think of her .      she hadn   t expected him to be so vehement on the subject of his mother  a woman whose name neither she nor derec knew .  ariel had conducted an extensive computer search of genetic records on robot city and aurora  but had not been able to locate a single fact about derec except the skimpy details accumulated since their arrival in robot city .  she had no idea why so few records of him existed .  she thought his father might have blocked or erased any file on derec  or that even her mother  juliana welsh  who had financed dr .  avery   s work  had pulled some strings to suppress any bureaucratic documentation on derec   s earlier life .  derec himself remembered enough to know that he was  indeed  a spacer  that he had some training as a roboticist  and that his memory had been deliberately erased .  none of the memory that his father had restored had provided any solutions to the other mysteries surrounding his existence .   she put her arms around him and hugged him .     forget it  derec .  i   m just psychologizing  and i   m not really good at it .  it was just a dream  only a dream .  nothing to worry about .  really .         you   re right  probably .     his voice was calmer .     what i need is some real rest .  i never could sleep in one of those tubelike contraptions .     he gestured toward the bunk  which did  indeed  look like half a tube .     maybe there   ll be some time to relax in robot city  especially if everything   s okay there .  and if we can get the silversides straightened away .         adam and eve .  you   d seem friendlier to them if you   d use their first names .  old human custom .      ariel was happy to see a smile briefly cross derec   s face .     sorry  just can   t get used to those names  especially since they tend to look like us when they   re in the mood to look human .  anyway  it   s a wonder i didn   t dream of them .         i think they   ve invaded some of my dreams .  and i   d much rather dream about you  darling .      she kissed him and said     i think i   ll check in with wolruf .  she   s with adam and eve right now .  you know their new game .         i don   t think so .         adam   s taught eve a version of the wolf state .      adam had arrived on the planet of the kin  intelligent wolf creatures  in an egglike vehicle .  because he had not yet encountered sentient life  he had been shapeless .  when he joined the kin  he transformed himself into kin shape .  he had a tendency even now to return to that form regularly .  the kin had dubbed him silverside because  even when he changed his overall appearance  he still retained the metallic  silvery surface of a robot .      now the two of them become wolves and start nipping at each other while barking out that strange language .  it   s weird  really .  they go around in a circle and growl  go after each other   s tail .  wolruf says they   re imitating some wolf pup behavior adam observed at what he calls the pack home .  lately  they   ve been transforming from shape to shape too much  and just to annoy us .  adam says they have too few forms to imprint on .  i guess he means they need practice .  you know  if we let them use the key to perihelion and flash them to earth  they   d probably go insane trying to copy all the life forms there .      the keys to perihelion were transport devices that took the user first to perihelion  the place said to be nearest to all other places in the universe  and then to other specific  preset destinations .      they do seem different lately     derec said .      a little bored  i think .  remember how adam was so intent on imprinting on everything   us  the kin  the blackbodies  robots .  there was something desperate about it  something to do with his quest to define what  exactly  a human was .  all the present changes are playful rather than purposeful .  they seem less curious somehow .         maybe it   s us .  adam   s so intent on defining    human    as the highest order of being  and he doesn   t seem quite convinced yet that we   re it .  he needs a greater variety of humans to study .  anyway  get yourself some rest .  i   ll get you up again according to schedule  and that   s coming around soon enough  sonny boy .      blowing him a kiss at the door  ariel left the sleeping compartment .   derec glanced at his bunk  unsure whether he wanted to return there .  why welcome the dreams that awaited him  stalking him like the kind of wolf adam had been when they first met .  he put one foot on the edge of his bunk and began to vigorously massage the skin of his face  trying to make himself feel more awake and alert .   adam was so unpredictable  he thought  meddlesome .  he had admired the blackbodies  taking them  with their high intellectual abilities and impressive appearances  as probably the truest example of the humans he was programmed to seek .  his experiments in imprinting on them had nearly wrecked ariel   s establishment of a new farming community .  then  when adam had discovered the embryo form of eve in the forest  derec and ariel   s problems had doubled .  adam brought ariel to the    egg    in which eve had arrived .  since ariel was the first living creature she saw  eve   s first shape  and the one she returned to most often  was as a silver toned image of ariel .   despite all the knowledge the silversides had accumulated from contact with humans  kin  and blackbodies  they frequently acted like children .  they were fascinated by new information and sometimes flaunted an idea with repetitiveness and ferocity .   derec recalled the day before they had all left the blackbodies    planet .  he had been in a lab working on an adaptation of a remote control device designed to make it easier for the robots in the field to communicate with their central computer .  ariel   s transformation of the settlement from a robot city to an agricultural setup had necessarily expanded the geographical area in which the robots had to function  often removing them too far from the computer for effective comlink communication .  derec had designed a powerful modemlike wireless remote that could be operated easily at such distances .  it was itself a miniature computer with limited access memory .  attached to the chest of a robot  it could be activated when the robot placed its hand over the middle of the device .  without otherwise interrupting its task in the field  the possessor could transmit or receive data easily without having to travel to a computer terminal .   adam and eve had come into the room while he was busily attaching the experimental devices to a pair of utility robots who had been reprogrammed to be field foremen .  he had switched off the robots so that he could more easily attach the remotes to them .   at the moment of their entrance  adam had looked like a slightly distorted version of derec molded in silver  with a touch of ariel added  while eve merely resembled ariel alone .  derec had firmly wished that the silversides would encounter other humans  so they would at least look different .  of course  there was no telling how much mischief they could cause if they met up with the wrong human .   derec had always been a bit uncomfortable around eve in her ariel mode .  now that the robot was getting better at the mimicry  he had often wondered if  in a dark place where the silver exterior of eve would not be so obvious  he could mistake her for ariel and gather her into an embrace .   with adam  the effect was less disturbing but equally annoying .  for derec  looking at adam was like seeing an avant garde artist   s rendition of himself .      why have you disconnected this robot .     adam had asked  his busy fingers touching the robot in several places .  the hand was vaguely caninoid  derec had noticed  suggesting that adam had just come from a session with the caninoid alien wolruf .      because there is less chance of damage to already existing circuits when modifications are made during the disconnected state .  and  adam  this is delicate work and i have to concentrate so please don   t ask any more questions .  i won   t answer them .         why have you become so hostile to us .     adam had asked .      because you   re pests  both of you  and you test my patience .  anyway  i   m busy now .         but how can we absorb new information and learn about humans if you refuse to deal with us .         right now i don   t care whether you absorb beetle oil off a dirty floor .         is there a beetle here .     adam said eagerly .  he was already scanning the floor for an insect to study and perhaps  in part  become .  derec had shuddered at the picture of a silverside taking on the image of a giant bug .  at least there had so far been nothing derived from insects in any of their shapes .  human  wolf  robot  and winged alien  yes  but nothing even vaguely entomological .      the floor isn   t dirty     eve had observed .     what would beetle oil look like .  is it transparent .  would it blend in with the dirt of the floor  if there were any .      derec had always had difficulty coping with the literalness of robots  but with the silversides the wordplay had become excessively ridiculous and irksome .      there is no beetle  no beetle oil  no such thing as beetle oil as far as i know .         would you lie to us then .     eve had asked .  there had been an ariel like sweetness in her voice .  he had wished she would use a different sort of voice .      gladly  especially if it would get rid of you .      he had spoken to eve while still attaching the remote to the robot and had not observed adam pick up the other remote from the table .  at first he had held it in his hand  then had held it to his head for a moment .  when derec had finally noticed adam   s meddling  the silver humanoid robot was pressing it against his leg .  finally  he had observed where derec was attaching the other one  which had led him to press the device against his chest .      how is it attached .     he had asked .      that doesn   t matter     derec had said irritably     since they   re not going to be put on either one of you .  put it back on the table .         but we crave knowledge even when it has no practical function for us     eve had remarked .      and i find this device aesthetically pleasing     adam had said as he replaced it on the table .   derec had returned to his work and so didn   t notice the slow changing of adam from humanlike to robotlike .  when he did look up  he had seen that adam was now what he had originally termed a walkingstone  a humanoid robot .  however  there was one major difference .  he now had a duplicate of the remote upon his chest  as if welded there .   passing his hand over its front  a band of light in the center had gone on  and  across the room  the computer screen had seemed to go haywire with flashing data as it transmitted information to adam   s remote .  this had been a new one for derec .  adam could copy a device like this  attach it properly to his mimicry of a robot body  and make it work .  his imprinting abilities were improving by leaps and bounds .  how could they possibly control him .   instead of letting adam know he had achieved something interesting  he had hollered at him .     stop that .         why .         because i say so .  you are putting this place into jeopardy .         i am only receiving geographical information .  what harm could that do  master derec .         with you there must be something .         you don   t seem to approve of us  master derec     eve had said .  derec had taken note of how the two of them had suddenly invoked the polite form of address for a robot to a human .      does my approval really matter to you  eve .         yes  it does .  you and ariel are the only humans we know .  if you are indeed the high intelligence we are programmed to seek  if you are indeed the humans you claim you are  then we will be in your image .  and  in your image  we must be acceptable to you .  is that a part of first law .         no  it isn   t .         well  it should be .      derec had given up .  there had seemed to be no sensible way to control them .  the more traits and features they copied  the more their chameleonic abilities were a threat   and the more power they could attain .  the first law should protect humans against them  but they were so clever  they could become the first robots to circumvent the law without destroying the letter of it  simply by denying people their status as humans .  if they achieved power and could manufacture more of themselves  there was no telling what they might do .  if they could add to their fund of human knowledge with imprints from every alien they encountered  they could eventually become the sort of world conquering monsters  conglomerations of aspects and traits from many creatures  that robotics experts had always thought impossible .   derec had clenched his fists tightly for a moment  to try to get rid of his ridiculous thoughts .  this was the kind of thinking that had probably driven his father insane .  releasing the tension in his hands  he had returned to his work  ignoring the silversides who grew bored  changed back to their human shapes and left the lab .   later  derec had discussed their charges with wolruf  who had managed the best lines of communication to the silversides .  he was not sure why she was so successful with adam and eve .  it was perhaps because adam  when he had first emerged from his own metal egg  had encountered the kin .  he had molded himself into kin shape and stayed in that form until he began to encounter other intelligent forms of life .  wolruf   s appearance  actually more doglike than wolflike  reminded adam of the kin  perhaps making him comfortable with her .      i   m confused     he had said to wolruf without a word of greeting to her .  she stroked the side of her jaw with the backs of the sausagelike fingers of her left hand  a gesture he recognized as indicating concern or even worry .      what botherss    u  frriend derec .     just as wolruf   s s   s had the faint sound of a hiss in them  her r   s tended to be a bit extended too  reminding derec of a whispered growl .  the lupine structure of wolruf   s mouth did not allow her to enunciate his language easily  although she had certainly improved her linguistic skills .  the s   s and r   s used to be more pronounced and the   nonexistent .  once he had had to concentrate fiercely to understand  but now he never had much difficulty .      adam and eve .  they   re driving me crazy .  how can we let them loose on any world .         do otherrss haverreason to fearr them     u think .         darn right .  most human societies certainly .  look  many of us are quite superstitious .  back on earth  a simple function robot is looked upon with dread  and most robots are kept out of the way  and on the settlers    planets they   ve tried to ban robots altogether .  i think there   s some of that kind of fear in all humans  even though the spacers have managed to accommodate themselves to the situation by using robots as a servant class .         i wonderr  should the silverrsidess be trreated different from otherr rrobots .         it   s the shape changing .  look  my people have a history of superstition toward what they perceive as unnatural .  in our imagination we see monsters in closets  believe illogically in the possibility of blood sucking vampires  werewolves who           excusse me  i know not the terrm werrewolvess .         can   t tell you much .  evidently  at the time of the full moon on earth  a time when  superstition has it  people tend to grow madder   certain humans get transformed into wolfshape and run about the countryside killing and ravaging until the moon sets .      the brown and gold hair on the sides of wolruf   s face had begun to stiffen and rise slightly .  derec recognized this as a physical sign that the alien was disturbed .  and then he had recognized why .      i   m sorry  my friend .  i was thoughtless .  it happens that  like robots  wolves are regarded with some fear .         and  to    umanss  would i be some kind of wolf .         maybe  to some .  hey  old superstitions are hard to cope with .  to most  you   d be more like a dog  and we humans have a bizarre fascination and love for dogs .  back on your home planet  don   t your people have some fears  some superstitions .         don   t know what    u   well  perrhapss .  a kind of inssect  verry tiny  that           see .  all i   m saying is that we   re a superstitious lot  we humans .  give us a robot who can look like anything he wants to and molds himself into a different shape right in front of our eyes  and we   re liable to back off in a hysterical fit .  the silversides change shape as regularly as most of us change clothes .  and they are trouble .  wolruf  my friend  they   re two whirlwinds looking for villages to wreck .      she had stared at derec for a moment  her dark deepset eyes searching his face in a way that might have seemed sinister had he not known her so well .     well     she had finally said     seems to me that the besst place forr them might be a worrld wherre they could not causse the harm you suggesst  and wherre itss inhabitantss wouldn   t even rreact to their shapechanging .  be good forr uss  too .  we then study them furrther with the proper facilities  try to rrid them of their   what would    u call them .    inconsistenciess .         yes  exorcise them of their demons .  that   s a wonderful idea  wolruf  but where is this perfect world .         robot city .         robot city .  but i don   t want to take them to   wait  you   re right .  adam   s really bored with robots and there   re only robots there .  he says he receives little satisfaction from imprinting on robots .  i think he   s somehow relegated them to a lower order of species .         i don   t underrsstand .  if manmade  can they be a sspeciess .         they   re not .  but adam perceives them that way  and has dismissed them .  he   s searching for the highest order of being on which to imprint  and he sees no future in being a robot .  apparently his programming is to imprint on humans  but he still resists the idea that ariel and i are the answer .  and in robot city she and i would be the only humans  unless my father showed up .  it   s good .  with us  and you  as the only nonrobots there  we might be able to keep them in check .  if we couldn   t affect their programming  maybe we could bore them to death .         oh  but i don   t ssuggesst they sshould die  derrec .  oh  no .      derec had smiled .  sometimes wolruf could be just as literal as a robot .      i didn   t mean it that way .  i mean a boredom so intense that it   d render them relatively inactive .      the plan had been easy to put into operation .  the silversides were curious to see the robot city they had heard so much about and had given derec no opposition to the idea .  they had been relatively quiet on the trip out so far  and he had begun to wonder if they were being devious  planning some massive silverside trick .  however  as they neared robot city and the chemfets in his bloodstream began to cause havoc within him  derec had worried less and less about his robotic charges .  in fact  he was tired of thinking of them now .  he wanted no worries at all .  if only he could relax with ariel  make love with her  rest in her arms .   for now he might as well settle for his uncomfortable bunk .   he did fall asleep .  but more dreams came .  in one of them a supervisor robot changed its face to resemble dr .  avery  then announced that the laws of robotics had been repealed and he would derive infinite pleasure from purposely mutilating a human .     chapter    something is rotten in the city of robots    derec   s apprehension grew as his ship  piloted by the robot mandelbrot  settled down onto a landing platform at the robot city spaceport .  his chemfets seemed to be in turmoil  as if they were struggling to process information that had been deliberately scrambled .  at the same time his emotions were becoming scrambled  too .  he snapped at mandelbrot even while he was struggling to control his temper .  before the landing  mandelbrot made a routine request for orders  and derec responded testily     we   ll land when i feel it   s right and not before .      of course ariel  at that moment  had to be standing nearby  examining the cubes  spires  and blocks of the city from a view portal  and of course she had to throw her two credits in .      whatever   s wrong with you  you don   t have to take it out on mandelbrot     she muttered .   he could have merely acknowledged the truth of what she said  but he had to top her two credits with a pair of his own .      i   m not taking anything out on mandelbrot  ariel .  you know as well as i do that it doesn   t make any difference to him what i say or how i say it  so long as he doesn   t have to remove me from harm or save my life .  first law and all that .  i know i can be a real bandersnatch  call him every name in the dictionary of insults  foam at the mouth and jump up and down   and it all won   t make any difference to him .  only humans brood over other humans    words .         how epigrammatic .      he didn   t want to tell her he didn   t know what epigrammatic meant .  it was already clear she had more general knowledge in her brain than he  and he didn   t want to give her the satisfaction of supplying a definition .   the anger in her face softened  and she moved toward him  patting him on his arm .     honey  there   s no reason to be a grouch  even with a robot .  anyway  how can you be sure he   s not aware of your irritation .      derec glanced at mandelbrot  who calmly sat at the controls .      oh  he   s aware all right .  he has to be .  again  the ever present laws .  he has to know what mood i   m in  what my nuances might mean  what my attitude is toward him   it   s all information which he processes in his positronic brain  and it helps him to judge how to react when the laws need to be applied .  a robot can simulate emotion for a human being   s comfort or pleasure  but a robot   s emotion is only specific positronic activity .  aware  yes  but insulted  no .      ariel sighed .  derec hated that sigh .  it clearly indicated she didn   t agree with him but was finding the argument too tiresome to continue with .  the sigh dismissed the argument along with him and his moods .  yet  when she was moody  they had to play by different rules .  ariel could achieve a righteousness that would make a moral philosopher blush .   she walked back to the view portal  muttering     well  when do you expect us to land  then .         soon enough .  i just have to look  make sure everything is all right down there .         i don   t understand  what could be wrong .         with what we   ve been through  you can ask that .         frost  you really are in a blue funk today .  i   m not going to put up with it .  summon me when you need me  master .      after she had stalked out  derec said under his breath     oh  ariel .      apparently mandelbrot heard him  for he asked     is there something wrong  friend derec .         nothing that need involve you  mandelbrot .     if the robot was at all bothered by derec   s irritability there was no way for him to show it in his face or body .  derec wondered if ariel was right about robots having feelings .  certainly the humaniform robots like r .  daneel olivaw or ariel   s precious jacob winterson appeared to have emotions .  they seemed so human  it was hard for observers not to apply an emotional overlay to them .      we are closing in on the compass tower     mandelbrot said .   the large view screen in front of the pilot seat displayed the tower  the first robot city structure derec had ever known .  he and ariel  then known as katherine  had arrived there from the gray misty spot known as perihelion  when they had pressed the corners of a key to perihelion .  that particular key had been set for robot city  and they found they could travel nowhere else  except back to perihelion  with it .  the tower was a pyramidal building that was larger and higher than any other building in the city .  inside it was the office in which dr .  avery had secreted himself to observe robot city .  derec wondered if his father were in there now  messing up the workings of the place just so he could mess up the workings of his son   s chemfets and  for that matter  his mind .      hover here for a while  mandelbrot .      derec stared down at the city  his city now and not avery   s  uncertain of what looked strange about it at this moment .  the compass tower was the same tiered structure it had always been .  there were none of the odd lumps upon its surface that he had seen in his nightmare .  the city itself  as it always had  stretched from horizon to horizon  except for some parkland to the south .  new buildings had sprung up while old ones had been disassembled by the robots  whose job it was to continually refine the city  making it even fitter and more luxurious for human habitation .  someday  human colonists would actually be admitted into the place .  normally derec would not have been aware of such architectural alterations  but his chemfets kept him up to date on all of the city   s transformations .   the robots in the streets below moved busily enough and appeared to be concerned with their usual goals .  yet  even their movement didn   t look right to him  didn   t feel right .  and many of the usually busy thoroughfares seemed deserted .  perhaps robot city had indeed turned into the city of his nightmare .   it was probably his imagination .  the silversides  ariel  all his responsibilities were making it work overtime .  he was just plain exhausted  frustrated   that was probably the answer .  he would have to make himself human again  rebuild his own personality the way the figures below rebuilt the city .   lately derec had had the sense that since his awakening in an amnesiac state  he had become a robot himself .  he was increasingly concerned with his duties  one crisis after another  it seemed  and  like the robots below  rushing to goals that were usually shadowy and mysterious .   sometimes he felt he was divided inside between the human and robot sides of his personality .  certainly  because of the chemfets  he was at least part robot .  at times the human side ruled his life and emotions  at other times the robot part took over .  he was human at the height of a crisis  when a battle had to be fought or a decision made  human when he was with ariel  at least in the loving and tender times  or even the angry ones  human when he had to instruct and guide the robots or intellectually confront avery .  on the other hand  in between these active human periods  there were times when he allowed the robot inside him to take over .  the robot was in charge when he had to do the dirty work  the menial activities that occupied so much of his duties .  he was also robot when he felt nothing but an emptiness inside toward ariel or wolruf or mandelbrot  the trio who meant so much to him now .  there were times when he suddenly realized that time had passed and he had only the vaguest idea of what he had done during it  and in his mind that became the robot   s time rather than the human   s .  he wondered if a robot  along some pathway of his positronic brain  was ever conscious of everyday routine .     after landing  derec was surprised to find the spaceport deserted .  usually a few maintenance robots were in evidence  searching for rarely found trash  shining up already shiny surfaces .  the spaceport seemed to derec like an enormous white elephant  an area that functioned only when he or ariel used it .  of course  much of robot city was like this   structures designed for thousands or even millions of human immigrants  magnificent living quarters for people to come  commercial setups for invisible shoppers  workplaces used now only by programmed robots who mainly made tests of equipment .   as they passed through the deserted terminal  adam and eve looked about  their heads snapping from side to side as they tried to absorb all the new information .  to derec it looked as if the two chameleonic robots were searching for someone or something to copy .  he smiled .  there   d be no new beings to change into in robot city .  the robots they   d encounter were so much like ones they   d already seen  they would  as wolruf predicted  grow bored and become more malleable to human manipulation .  then perhaps derec could straighten the two little buggers out .      shouldn   t someone be welcoming us or something .     ariel asked .      i   m not sure     derec answered .     i   m not up on spaceport protocol .  it just seems that we should be seeing a few robots behind a few counters or something .      outside the terminal  at the proper station  they found a floater  so called because it went down robot city roadways without actually touching pavement .  it was a two seater  so derec told wolruf and mandelbrot to locate a larger vehicle and follow him and ariel into the city .     keep a lookout for anything that looks out of sync     he said to them .     we   ll rendezvous at the compass tower and compare notes .      on the ride down the long access road to the city  ariel said     now that you   re here  what do you feel  derec .         i still can   t make any sense out of the chemfets .  but i don   t know what   s wrong .  something has changed here  but i can   t see it yet .         if you don   t see something  how do you know it exists .         that sounds faintly philosophical .         my habit .  sorry .      the floater was small  so small that their shoulders  hips  and legs were pressed together .  normally he liked being this close to her  but today there was a stiffness in the way she held herself .  it made him uncomfortable to be touching her at all .   he smiled at her .  she stubbornly refused to smile back .  although she tried to look relaxed  her tension was apparent in her eyes .   touching the bar that controlled the vehicle  derec brought it to a stop at the first block of buildings after they crossed into the city proper .  he got out before the floater had settled down onto the pavement .      where   re you going .     ariel asked  as she  too  squeezed out of the vehicle .      just a look around .      he approached the side of a cube shaped building and stared at it .     look at this .      standing beside him  she tried to see what he saw .      what is it .         that seam there .     she had to squint to see it .     the city is assembled from five meter square slabs that come out of an extruder in a sort of ribbon .  the material forms and reforms  following some sort of predetermined programming .  it becomes windows  walls  rooms  entire storeys of buildings  structuring itself .  it   s done so flawlessly there should be no seams  cracks  openings  except where architecturally logical .  this seam isn   t logical .      looking closer  she could see that there was indeed a tiny separation .  only a very thin coin could get through it  but it was certainly a flaw .   he strode away from her  running his hand along the wall and around a corner .  when he was out of sight  she heard him yelp .  she ran around the corner to find him staring down at his little finger .      look     he said  holding out the finger to her .  there was a tiny cut at its tip and a minuscule drop of blood had oozed out .  she was always surprised by how much darker than hers his blood was .      what happened .         the damn thing cut me  that sliver there .         sliver .  but that   s impossible .  you once told me the building material is programmed with the first law .  it can   t allow you to get hurt  especially on it .         that   s right .  by all rights  i shouldn   t be bleeding .  well  take a gander .      the sliver was even more minuscule than the split seam  but it was there  all right .  a tiny bit of red at its tip made it slightly more visible .      what   s happened .      derec did not stand around long enough to respond to her question .  he was several steps farther on  his eyes nervously inspecting another building  a small sloping structure that thrust upward into the sky  ending in a spire .      look up there .     he cried .   he meant the spire .  as she peered at it  she realized that there was something just slightly out of kilter about it .      it   s tilted a bit     she said .      right     he said .  there was an offensive tone in his voice  as if he were condemning her for verifying the obvious .      no supervisor robot would allow such a deviation from the norm .         i don   t know .  i seem to remember something i read about earth and a leaning tower there .  it was quite a tourist attraction .         well  i   ll refer your observation to our tourist board .         don   t be sarcastic .  i   m trying to help .      again he didn   t respond .  he was now running  eager to examine another building .  ariel clapped her hands twice as a signal to the floater .  the pair of claps made the vehicle rise from the ground and follow her as she walked to derec .   he stood in front of the building   s entrance and stared at it .      anything wrong with this one .     she asked .      nothing i can see .  i   m sorry i snapped at you .  i just feel at           forget it  buddy .  i ragged you pretty hard back on aranimas   s ship when we first met .  we   ll just consider your present mood a paying back .         thanks .      as his eyes scanned the wall in front of him  his concentration was broken by a loud thumping sound .      what was that .     ariel asked .      i don   t know .  let   s go in and find out .         every time i turn around  you   re being brave .  okay  you lead .      the building   s entrance was situated in a corner of the street facade .  next to the door was a handplate that could identify both human and robot personnel .  this meant it was considered a security area  and only registered individuals would be allowed into the building .  that didn   t worry derec .  his handprint was automatically registered with all robot city identity systems  so he placed his hand against the handplate confidently and casually  expecting the door to pop open immediately .  it did not .  he pressed his hand harder against the plate .  again nothing happened .      what   s wrong .     ariel asked .      i don   t know .  maybe it hasn   t been connected yet .         here .  let me try .      brushing past him  she placed her hand on the plate .  derec was again impressed by the thin angular look of her fingers and would have been willing at that moment to take her hand and lead her to someplace dark  comfortable  and quiet where they could concentrate on kissing and making up .   the door wouldn   t open for her  either .  irritated  she slammed her fist against the door itself  and it slowly  creakily  came open .  the sound was especially disconcerting .  it was another anomaly .  no door in this robot city should squeak .      well  fancy that     ariel said     it was already open .  shall we .      she gestured toward the dark interior .   when they entered the building  they should have triggered a force field that would immediately switch on the lighting .  but after a few steps  they still stood in what seemed like absolute darkness  broken only by the light streaming in from the doorway .  that light was soon lost as the door slowly swung shut .  the air seemed stale  and derec wondered if the circulation systems had broken down  too .  instinctively  he reached for ariel in time to feel a shudder go through her body .      you   re right     she muttered .     something   s wrong here .     she hugged him tightly .     derec  let   s inspect some other building .         i   m with you on that .  the doorway should be        she suddenly screamed  not a scream of fear so much as of startlement .  with her head so close to his  the sound of it nearly deafened him .      what happened .         something brushed against my leg .         what .         i couldn   t tell .  felt like an animal .  like a rat or something .         what kind of animal could it possibly be .  you   re imagining things .  there   re no animals in robot city .  they           there it is again .  it just slammed into my calf .         maybe it   s a robot .  a delivery or cargo           didn   t feel like a robot .  too soft  too        derec felt a forceful nudge against his ankle .  ariel was right .  it did feel like an animal .  must be the power of suggestion .      ariel  everything is all right .  we   ll just make our way to the door and get out of        to his left there was a faint animal like noise .  it sounded like a subdued cackle .  an elf or tiny demon pleased with his or her work .  there was another small cackle on the other side of him .  a third behind ariel .  in a moment there were cackles all around them  and they had become louder .  whatever was inside this building seemed to like chattering to each other .   taking ariel   s hand  derec fled backward toward the door that was faintly outlined from outside daylight .  near the door  before the two of them had flung it open and fled from the building  he nearly tripped over something  something that screeched back angrily at him .     chapter    the watchful eye    there was no such thing as an all seeing eye in robot city  but the watchful eye believed it must come close .  even though it usually sat safe in its haven  its rudimentary body drawn snugly inside  it could observe and examine whatever happened in the city .   since the time it had arrived in the city through an underground tunnel that had originally been meant for human sewage  of which there had so far been so little that the sewer   s walls were brightly pristine and its clear water smelled fresh and pleasant   it had gradually taken over all robot city systems .   the watchful eye had no idea how it had arrived on the planet .  after coming suddenly to awareness in a field outside the city  it had molded itself into simple but functional form .  searching the countryside  it located the sewer tunnel .  at first it had transported itself by the kind of carts used for supply and passenger transport through the intricate network of tunnels  and eventually found its way to the lair of the central computer .  it had taken a while to learn that the computer was merely a machine and not a living being .  it took some more time to discover how to operate it .  for one period it roamed at will around the inside of the computer and absorbed random bits of knowledge .  now it had collected a considerable amount of the computer   s information  much of which it was not certain how to use .  the only way to find out  it had discovered  was to practice .   first it practiced on the numerous robots that roamed the huge city   s streets .  although it had not yet seen a robot up close  it knew about them from studying the view screens set up in the underground computer center .  as it became more computerlike itself  it began using the computer to communicate with the robots .  it convinced the robots that it was human and  according to second law  should be obeyed as a human .   as long as they could not see it  the watchful eye was able to carry off the illusion convincingly .  it had forbidden the highest ranking robots to come into its presence or have any sight of it .    although it had accessed much information about humans    visual data  anthropological studies  physiological and anatomical maps  psychological data   it believed it hadn   t yet reached an understanding of what a human really was .  it yearned to see one .   there had been no problem in making working models of humans  no difficulty in creating thousands of computer visualizations of human beings .  where it had failed  however  was in really knowing what a human was .  all the information files had been entered by humans who already knew what they were .  essential things had been left out  and the watchful eye needed to fill in those blanks .   the next step on its agenda had been to study and then obtain control of the city itself .  from computer files the watchful eye evolved an extensive  albeit distorted  view of the place .  since it had no previous knowledge of humans or robots  it couldn   t always interpret the data it collected .  but that didn   t matter .  knowing bits and pieces was enough for the time being .  after all  it had learned something about quests and felt that if it continued its robot city experiments  it could eventually control the place completely .  it did not know what it would do when it became that powerful  but it believed that life must  if nothing else  be a learning process .  the computer   s philosophical files reinforced that conclusion .  when it had power  it would know what to do with it .  once it had not known what a computer was  now it had completely subjugated one .  domination of the city would present little difficulty .   it liked to think of itself as the watchful eye because it could keep track of so many parts of the city without moving from its haven .  the screens displayed any place it wanted to view  and it could keep track of several points at once .  not that there was much need to oversee the robots .  they accepted orders readily and acted upon them with dispatch and without further questions .  that was good  because it did not have time to keep specific attention on the individual robots .  there was so much to do  so many experiments to conduct  so much to think about .  .  .  .     eve silverside walked behind the others  pleased that wolruf had decided they should walk into the city rather than search out a proper sized vehicle .  her head often turned to examine the city   s immensity .  she had previously seen only the pastoral landscapes of the blackbody planet  with its natural wonders and its robot made agricultural community .  adam  who had seen a robot city  had described it to her  but she had not been prepared for the overpowering qualities of the real thing .  she was now in human form  resembling a chunkier and silver colored ariel  and her startlingly humanlike eyes were open wide in amazement .   even though she had been told about robot city   s incredible mass of architectural wonders  she had not been prepared for its dazzling array of colors  its intricate walkways  the geometric perfection of its buildings .  although she tended to examine the scene around her with a robotic objectivity  she was impressed and thought robot city was indeed a splendid place .   ahead of eve  wolruf hunkered down  peered at the edge of a curb  and picked up something .      what is it  wolruf .     mandelbrot asked .   she held up a crumpled piece of paper .  adam took it out of her hand and examined it .     it seems ordinary  not unlike paper i have already seen     he commented .      not that it   ss paperr     wolruf said     it   ss strrange it   ss here at all .         i do not understand .      when adam talked with wolruf  his face seemed to change slightly  its human aspects taking on a suggestion of wolruf   s caninoid features .  adam   s nose seemed to lengthen and his face became flatter  like wolruf   s .      paperr shouldn   t be here  that   ss all .  here on thiss street it iss litterr .  small robotss take care of litterr wheneverr it occurss  which iss rare .  robotss  aft   err all  do not use paperr .  the small robotss detect litterr     u see  then collect it  then dispose of it .         i see no utility robots in this area     mandelbrot said .  there were  in fact  no robots of any kind to be seen .     perhaps one will come soon .         maybe     wolruf said  then loped a few steps farther and pointed at the pavement .     thiss iss slidewalk     she said .      yes     mandelbrot said .      shouldn   t it move .  we stand on it  it remainss still when ourr body weight should make it move .         that is truly puzzling .  perhaps it is inoperative .         if so  where are slidewalk maintenance robotss .  when something in city breakss down  maintenance robotss are ssupposed to appearr immediately .         perhaps they are busy elsewhere with a different slidewalk .         maybe .  but thingss don   t break down in robot city at such rate .  two areass of slidewalk down at same time in same sector iss unusual     u see .         yes .  i should inform you also of another matter .         what  mandelbrot .         since you have been observing these flaws  i have been trying to contact other robots through my comlink to obtain answers for your questions  and so far none have responded .  based on data from my previous visits to this city  such a phenomenon  even on the outskirts here  is highly anomalous .            u believe ssomething iss wrrong here  mandelbrot .         yes  i do .         let   ss go on then .      eve wasn   t sure what to make of the conversation between the caninoid and the robot with the strange arm  itself something of an anomaly .  the arm  which had once belonged to a robot of a different class than mandelbrot  was shaped differently and  because it was thicker and longer than his other arm  looked awkward on his body .  it was malleable and mandelbrot could change its shape  although  unlike the silversides  he could not transform any other part of his body .   thinking of her shape changing ability seemed to start up a mechanism in her body .  she looked around for something to change into .  adam had explained to her that there seemed to be an urge inside them to seek out new beings and imprint upon them .  it was very humanlike  he said  or at least derec had informed him so .     derec says that humans love to seek out new experience .  a new experience for us is a previously unseen kind of being whose shape we can take .  although we are not supposed to have emotions about it  i think the mechanisms inside our bodies are engaged when we think about changing ourselves or when we see a being on which we can imprint .     whatever it was  a simple mechanism or a genuine yearning for new experience  eve now felt a strong urge to form herself into a new shape .   but what shape could she choose .  she had been human like ariel  caninoid like wolruf  a robot like mandelbrot .   there must be some different kind of life here  she thought .  she walked closer to a building  a strange structure  narrow and tall .  staring up at its top  she saw a row of ugly birdlike creatures staring down at her from under the building   s eaves .  they were still  impassive  although she thought she perceived a meanness in their eyes .  stepping back to try to see them better  she pointed upward and asked mandelbrot     what are those  please .      mandelbrot glanced up at them .     they are not alive     he said .     they are some kind of ornament placed along the upper rim of the building .  i think they are called gargoyles .  these are made of robot city material  but in the past they have often been sculpted from stone .         they are interesting .  adam .  do you think we could become like that .      adam had adopted a quite humanlike shrug  copied accurately from derec .     we could become statues  yes  but i see no point in it .  there is little for us to learn from representations of life  eve  unless we actually encounter the creatures that were the models for these statues .         i doubt that that would be a pleasant experience     eve said .  she looked away from the gargoyles and walked a few steps farther  then she turned and went back .   there was something here  inside this building  and it was not gargoyles .  she sensed there was something on the other side of the wall  just standing still but perhaps with life inside it .      mandelbrot .         yes  eve .         how does one gain entrance to such a building as this .      mandelbrot had been instructed by derec to cooperate with the silversides as much as possible unless he sensed danger for them .  there did not seem to be any threats hereabout  so he replied     i believe the door for this building is located on the north side .  up those steps .      eve immediately went up the steps .  climbing was one of the few activities that made her appear more robotlike than humanlike .  there was a certain mechanical awkwardness to the way she proceeded from stair to stair .   at the top of the stairs  there was indeed a door  and it was slightly ajar .  from below  mandelbrot saw the door hanging open and cautioned     the open door .  that is another anomaly .  do not go in there  eve .      one thing that eve had    inherited    from copying ariel was stubbornness .  once she had a goal set in her mind  she would not easily veer from it .  she pushed the door open and went inside .   with a faint crackle  some light came on .  to eve it was clear that the illumination was not full power .  that didn   t matter to her  she increased the power of her optical sensors .  the room was dim  and there were many shadowy areas .  she increased her olfactory sensors and observed that the hint of an unpleasant odor in the room was more than just a hint .  there was a heavy pervading sense of decay in it .  something might be dead in here .   the room was cluttered .  broken glass littered the floor  she recalled what wolruf had said about utility robots keeping things clean   some furniture had been heaped in one corner  most of it with missing pieces or chunks  metal debris was all over the room in piles of varying sizes  everything was laden with dust .   she walked through the room boldly  scrutinizing its contents .  behind her  mandelbrot came through the doorway .      eve  derec has instructed me to keep you and adam away from harm .  we don   t know anything about this building  so please come with           what is this  mandelbrot .     she held up what appeared to be a long jointed tube made of metal wires and strips  plus some electronic wiring .      i would say part of the skeleton of a robotic limb .  well articulated if complete .  now  eve           there   s something over here .      as she neared a shadowy niche  she saw that there was someone in it .  however  she could detect no life coming from the figure .  even though it was standing  its legs were crossed unnaturally .  there were shreds of cloth remaining from an outfit that was not definable .  its torso seemed ravaged and scarred .  its eyes were so deepset that at first she wasn   t sure there were any .  there were black circles around them .  its arms hung at odd angles .      mandelbrot  this looks like a        as she came close  the figure   s head moved slightly as if about to slide onto its left shoulder  and it reached out its left arm toward eve .  she was tempted to ignore mandelbrot   s warnings to back away from it and instead take the hand .     the watchful eye had detected robot city   s new arrivals and was quite gleefully keeping track of them .  they might be human  it thought .  the first two it saw on its view screens answered many of the requirements it had deduced for humans  requirements that it had laboriously formulated from the visual and technical information in the many computer files .  still  its uncertainty as to what actually constituted a human made it want to continue observation at a distance .   the watchful eye had a need to know about humans .  so far it had been frustrated in its studies and experiments by the lack of any genuine humans to observe .  now perhaps they had returned to the city apparently built for them .   listening in on their conversation  it detected that the new arrivals    names were ariel and derec .  there was a lot of data about a derec in the files .  this might be he .  derec had been so important he had one of the access codes to the computer .  it had been extremely difficult for the watchful eye to bypass and then cancel it .   after derec and ariel had entered the warehouse where some of the watchful eye   s failures  series b  batch     were housed and had been attacked by the cackling monstrosities  it became confused .  the humans  if they were indeed humans  just ran away  out to the street .  why did they run .  what kind of emotional weakness could cause such cowardice .  maybe they were not humans  then  maybe they were failed entities  just like its own creations .   it didn   t have much time to consider their behavior because it detected another set of intruders .  first he saw the small furry being who was so assiduously examining whatever she found in her path .  her intelligence was clear  and she was observant .  it listened in on her comments about the litter she had found .  that was perceptive of her  observing that discarded paper was a rare thing in the city and that utility robots should have removed it long ago .  it was not sure where the paper had originated  but it suspected that it came from one of its experimental creations in the building that eve had inspected .  it recalled that the place was a warehouse for some more of its abandoned experiments .  there had been some ritual among these creations that had involved paper .  it had not liked the ritual  in which strange looking marks were made on paper  and so had forgotten it .  as far as the litter problem went  perhaps it would reactivate the robots that had once had that job .   next in line was clearly a robot  but even the robot was a variation on what it was used to .  mandelbrot  as it heard the robot called by the fur creature  whose name was apparently wolruf  had an arm that did not seem to belong on his body .   the figures following mandelbrot confused the watchful eye  who was not easily disturbed .  it recognized right away that they resembled the two humans it had seen earlier .  they had similar faces and bodies  but their skin was a sort of silvery blue as compared with the faint pink tone of the earlier arrivals  and there was a bit more rigidity in their movements .  otherwise  they could have been twins of the pink beings .  further  there was assurance in their walks and the way their arms swung calmly at their sides .   it had a new problem to consider now  one that increased its interest .  both sets of intruders resembled humans as described in computer files .  the first set seemed more awkward and not as self assured as the second set .  however  the second duo  who had the proper bearing and look of intelligence  were  in coloring  more like the city   s robots .  its first impression was that while both sets could be human  the second might be an advanced version of the species .   when eve entered the warehouse  it was very pleased .  it found that a circuit inside one of its creations there was still operable  though very weak   and it was able to make it move by remote control .  it liked eve   s cool response to the event .  she seemed much more in command of her emotions than the skittish pair who had entered the other warehouse then scampered out of it at their first opportunity .  if the watchful eye could have smiled  and it could have but had never bothered to learn the manipulation for the physical display of amusement   it would have smiled with satisfaction at what it now perceived as the superior human  eve silverside .     chapter    timestep and bogie    as the warehouse door slowly and creakily shut  derec thought he saw many eyes looking back at him from the closing sliver illuminated by daylight .  even after the door was closed  he still felt there was a good chance he would see the eyes again in his next nightmare .   ariel  now relaxed in his arms  snuggled her head against the side of his neck .  since she was a bit taller than he  she had to slouch awkwardly in order to perform the act .      what was that .     she said  her words muffled .      i don   t know .  whatever they are  they shouldn   t be there .  there are no animals indigenous to robot city  and i know i   ve made no allowance for any kind of animal life here .  i   m not sure i even like animals  especially small ones .         maybe they weren   t on the planet when the robots arrived .  maybe they were underground .  maybe they   ve come to the surface from the bowels of the planet .  they might have gotten  i don   t know  stirred up while the robots were building the city and have been slipping out under those construction slabs .     the slabs ariel referred to were the five meter square pieces of iron plastic alloy that emerged from a machine called the extruder .     maybe they were already           calm down .  i   ve examined all preliminary studies of this planet  the ones done before the city forming project began .  the place was barren  no animal life evident anywhere .  so they   re not likely to have come up from the underground or           how about from space then .  they landed in a spaceship while we were gone  and now they   re hiding out until they know what to do about us .      derec frowned and broke from the embrace .     you might have something there .  i   ll have to check records .  even better  we can interrogate robots .  after all  they can   t lie to us .      as if in response to his comment  a robot came whirling around a nearby corner .  both derec and ariel were astonished by this figure  since whirling was indeed the correct word for its current maneuver .  it moved as if on roller skates  balletically spinning with its arms outspread .  before reaching them  it executed a lovely twirl on its left leg alone  with its right leg pointing elegantly backward .      stop .     derec ordered it .  it had brought its right leg down and seemed ready for another move  but derec   s order brought it to a halt .  its body appeared to collapse a bit  and it slumped ungracefully .     come here .      when the robot stood in front of him  derec asked     your name .      there was no response  which irritated derec .     come on  every robot has a name .         except during a name changing period     the robot said .     i have not chosen my new name yet  and so am without a name for the moment .  i was considering renaming myself timestep .         timestep .  what kind of name is that .  does it indicate a function or role .  as a name it is against regulations .         there are regulations about names .      derec didn   t know the answer to that  so he said     never mind .  tell me  you said new name .  that means you must have an old one .  what is it .         line foreman    .         have we met before  line foreman    .     the robot did not respond  but merely stood with the blank face and relaxed body that was the look of robots when they conversed with humans .     why don   t you answer me  line foreman    .         are you talking to me  sir .         didn   t i call you line foreman    .         you may have indeed .  but that is not my name .         you said it was .         it was  once .  it is not now .  i do not respond to it .         all right then .  you  there  the robot standing in front of me  have we ever met before .         not formally  but i know you are derec .  this is the first time you have ever spoken to me .         why were you dancing just now .         i don   t know .  it just felt good .         you have a feeling about dancing .         i think perhaps .  it is also perhaps a positronic anomaly .         there are enough anomalies around here without me having to worry about positronic ones .  robot  you might be in some way programmed  or reprogrammed  to dance  but i doubt you have a feeling for it .         my partner says i do .  my partner says i am a very smooth dancer .         i   ll bet you are .      derec felt as if he wanted to yell uncontrollably at this too clever  evasive robot .  ariel squeezed his hand and said softly     let me talk to him for a moment .  robot  have you no duties at this moment .         duties .  yes  i suppose so .         you suppose so .  a robot doesn   t suppose when it comes to duty .  you either have one or you don   t .         well  yes  i have a job that i do .         why aren   t you doing it then .         i had not realized i had stopped doing the job .         you had not        ariel   s anger was clear  so derec  calmer now  took over again .      you mentioned a partner .  where is your partner now .         i don   t know .  we agreed it was time for me to go solo .  want to see my soft shoe .         no .  i give up .  ariel  this is worse than arguing with a robot about one of those odd hypothetical cases where a law of robotics can   t be easily invoked .         i know what you mean     she said  nodding .     let   s try another tack .  robot  there are some terribly strange beings in that building over there .  do you know anything about them .      the robot   s head jerked toward the warehouse .     i know nothing of any strange beings     he said .   ariel shrugged .      wait     derec said     it might be the word strange not registering with him .  they might not be strange to him .  let me try .  robot  are there any beings at all in there .         i could not say for certain  for i have never entered that building .         let me put it this way .  have any new beings of any kind  humans  robots  aliens  entered the environs of robot city .         yes  besides you  three new robots and an alien came today .  the alien and two of the robots have been here before .         he must mean wolruf and the others     ariel commented .      besides them  and us  has anyone new come to robot city at any recent time .         that sounds properly phrased  all right     ariel whispered .      yes     the robot said .   derec stared at the robot for a long while  expecting him to say more .  frustrated  he finally asked     well .  tell me about our newcomer .         i may not .         what .         i am not allowed to .  a block has been entered for that particular information .         a block .  how could there be a block for me .  i am derec avery .      derec realized that he was sounding overbearing  but he couldn   t help it .  this robot got on his nerves .      while it is true that you are derec avery  and i owe you the kind of loyalty that would remove such a block  i cannot .  there is a further block upon the first block .      derec shook his head vigorously  trying to clear it .     what do you mean  blocks on blocks .         if the first block is removed  the one preventing me from revealing the information you request   and second law tells me such blocks may be removed by you or  for that matter  ariel welsh or dr .  avery   a second block wipes out the information before i can voice it .  therefore  if i obey you now and attempt to tell you what i know  then i will not know it anymore .  consequently  i will not be able to tell you .  because third law requires me to protect myself  and by extension any vital information i hold  i have to try my best not to allow such a situation to come to pass  and must respectfully request that you interrogate me no further on this matter .      as the robot awaited derec   s response  he executed a few mild soft shoe steps .  his arms appeared to throw imaginary sand onto the ground .   derec wondered if what the dancing robot said was true .  he had often told robots to forget specific information but had often wondered if they really did .  perhaps the data would not be erased but instead skillfully diverted from one positronic pathway to another  leaving it hidden rather than eliminated .  it was possible he could find a way of getting such data out .      i will interrogate you as long as i wish     derec said coolly .     in fact  i am so angry i don   t give a hoot what happens to you or your information .  robot  i           timestep .  i have decided on that as my name .  it has a nice ring  don   t you think .      as if to prove how wonderful a name it was for him  timestep tapped out a quick and intricate hard tap routine with his feet .  since the feet were made of metal  their taps were louder and more resonant than the average human tap dancer could achieve .  there was an inappropriate look to it all  especially since he waved his arms like a clumsy man falling .      timestep  i order you now to tell me the answer to the question i asked before .  inform me of any newcomers to robot city whose identity has been previously blocked .      the dancing stopped  but timestep said nothing .      well .     derec asked .      well  what  sir .         give me the answer .         the answer to what .         my question .         i don   t know the answer to your question .         the information has been destroyed then .         i don   t know the answer to your question .         timestep  do you recall once having the answer in your memory banks .         no  i do not .  i know nothing about any newcomers to the city except for yourselves and your companions .      derec made a quick gesture with his hand  the dismissive one that most humans used for robots .     you may go  timestep .         thank you  master derec .  and  please  look for the silver lining .         what do you mean by that .         i don   t really know  sir .      timestep danced off .  when he was going forward  his movements and dance steps were more precise and graceful .  before he rounded a corner  he twirled around a high pole with a round old fashioned lamp at the top .  derec did not recall the pole being there when they had arrived at the corner moments ago .  he had to admit that the height at which timestep twirled around it was quite impressive .      what are you smiling about .     he asked ariel .      i   m not sure .  i liked that robot  i guess .  i hadn   t realized how much i missed some entertainment .  when we first arrived here  we watched entertainment tapes  and they were pretty sad .  i knew they couldn   t take me away from my worries then  but  to tell the truth  i wouldn   t mind viewing some of them again now .  i mean  we   ve been so busy lately  i haven   t had much time to relax .  you know  just relax and watch something  no matter how trivial .  i   d really like to see timestep   s whole act .      derec wondered if he could just curl up someplace and concentrate on a book or a hyperwave program .  his mind always seemed to be stuffed with responsibility  work  research   all the problems that came with the territory in robot city  any robot city .      i think timestep could use a dance teacher     was his only comment .      really .  i thought his moves were pretty good  especially for a robot .  maybe we could arrange a little recital for him .         ariel           sorry  sorry .  only trying to cheer you up .         can   t work up much cheer when the place seems to be falling apart .     .      best time for it .  anyway  it   s not all that bad here .  a dancing robot  some pests in a warehouse  a few things out of order  your strange intuitive feelings .  .  .         that   s just it  you know .  my intuitions .  they   re one of the side effects of the chemfets .  i know when something   s wrong here .  and something is definitely wrong .         like something is wrong in denmark  wherever that was .            something is rotten in the state of denmark         derec corrected .  the line came from the fairly rotten production of hamlet that he had staged  while playing the leading role to ariel   s ophelia  with an all robot supporting cast .      what   s really rotten is your mood     ariel said .     i thought you were going to lighten up .      her words  spoken so softly  soothed him .  ariel could be the cleverest  most sarcastic person in the universe  especially when she got her dander up  but she often knew the moment when a quietly spoken phrase was the right tactic .  he took her into his arms .      oh  ariel  it   s just   just that i   m never sure .  i still remember so little of my life that i feel like i   m hamlet .         isn   t that just a carryover from having played the role .         maybe .  but i do relate to the character .  i   m alone           hey  you   ve got me .         i didn   t mean it that way .  i mean that i have to be in charge of this city .         there   s a saying somewhere about its being lonely at the top .         something like that .  i   m never sure what i do is right .  my father didn   t really tell me how to take care of things .  just made me leader and took off .  i don   t know who my mother is .  i don   t really know what my mission is .  stuff like that .  they   re not the same as hamlet   s  but they   re similar uncertainties .         maybe what destroyed hamlet is he thought too much about what he was doing .  like you   re doing now .  snap out of it  my love .  you   re not hamlet .  if anything  you   re a hero  a man of action rather than a procrastinator .  these  what you call uncertainties  are only human reactions to  well  the uncertainty of existence .      derec laughed .     now you   re getting too heavy .         i have been putting on a bit of weight .  ever since falling in love with you  my love .  so let   s get moving .  i need the exercise  and you need some work to get the glooms out of your head .         it   s a deal .  you know what we have to do .  find avernus  dante  rydberg  euler  all the other supervisor robots who link up to the computer .  they must know what   s going on around here .  and we can hack through the computer itself  see if we can come up with something .         okay  buddy .      holding hands  they started in the direction of the compass tower .  after they   d walked a few steps  two humanoid robots came running by .  they were tossing around a large metal sphere  perhaps an oversized ball bearing from somewhere .  the sphere went back and forth between them .  from their speaker grilles came a continuous outpouring of satisfied sounds .      what was that .     derec said after they had passed .  he would have stopped to interview them  but he had been too amazed at the sight to think of any logical action .      they seem to be playing some sort of game .         game .  robots playing games .         odd  i agree .  kinda cute  though .  i never thought much about robots having fun .         i   m not sure robots are supposed to have fun .         don   t be a spoilsport .         maybe i   m jealous .  i wouldn   t mind having the time to throw a ball around .         well  we could join in .  but  from the size and apparent weight of that ball  i think one catch   d flatten either one of us .  i know what you mean  though .  i   d like to return to aurora and hike across a few fields  or just lie about and enjoy a rigorously enforced lethargy .         still  that game there is just another anomaly for us to consider .  why aren   t they occupied with their duties .  who could have told all these robots to take time off to dance and play ball .         maybe we   re just not used to them having time off .         no  it   s more than that .  robots don   t have time off .  whenever they   re not doing something  they just stand there .  on aurora  you people store them in those wall niches .  and why in blazes would any robots ever play games .  and  if a robot is playing a game like that and making happy sounds  does that mean it   s having fun .  is there any way it could feel the sensation of           stop .  i   m not up to one those positronic conundrums right now .  you can be terribly single minded  darling .         and you love me for it .         only when i   m what you   re single minded about .      they stopped walking for a moment to kiss .  a robot passing by whistled  unused to such rude behavior from a robot  derec angrily broke from the embrace and ran up to the whistler  ordering it to halt .  it stood  awaiting derec   s words .      did you whistle just now .         yes .  you know how to whistle  don   t you .  you just pucker up your lips and blow .         i know how to whistle .  but how do you know .  you don   t even have lips to pucker up .         a technicality .  i can reproduce any human sound using my mimicry integrals .         you have mimicry integrals .         i do now .         you didn   t once .         until recently  i didn   t .         and you can copy human sounds .         name one  kid .  please .         you shouldn   t call me kid .         i was not aware of that .  i call everyone kid .         well  not me .  and why aren   t you answering my questions .         i don   t cotton to the third degree  copper .         kid  cotton  copper .  you   re using slang  aren   t you .         you ain   t just a kiddin     kid .         where did you learn slang .         same place i learned whistling .         and you never told me that .  okay  start back at the beginning .  where did you learn to whistle .         i saw it in a movie .         a movie .  you watch movies .  how is that possible .         there are many stored in the compass tower  pal .  they are for research .  we must study humans to understand them  kiddo .  and there ain   t been many o    you fellas around robot city  so how else can we study you .  we obtain the movies from the computer   s entertainment system .         is that what   s going on here then .  you robots   ve been watching old movies .         some of us .      ariel stepped forward to address the new robot .  she talked quietly  in contrast to derec   s nervous and energetic tone .     when do you have time for that .  what about your duties .      the robot swiveled its head toward her .     oh  i get it .  i like it .  you   re doing one of those copper tricks .  the good guy bad guy routine  i think it   s called .         it   s no routine .  answer my question .  you have to obey second law .         sorry .  all right .  i am not aware that the fulfillment of my duties is in any way impaired by the time i spend with hyperwave and prehyperwave movies and shows .         what is your job .         i am a perimeter observation and intruder inspection specialist .         a what .  that doesn   t   wait  do you mean a border guard .         that is the vulgar term  mistress ariel .         we don   t need border guards .  robot city   s allover the planet .  there aren   t any borders .      the robot made a move with his shoulders that  in a human  would have been a shrug .     i was misinformed     it said .   now derec took over the questioning .     you do a job for which there is no need .         it seems so .         was border guard always your job .         no .  i was once an analyst .         you would have to be reprogrammed to change your role here .         yes .         and you were .         yes .         who did the reprogramming .         i am not allowed to say .         yes  you can .  you are allowed to tell me .         nope .  i realize you are derec  but this is not a matter of robotic law protocol .  i really cannot .  there is a block upon the information which  if i attempt to reveal it to           i know  i know .  the information self destructs .  you forget it before you can say it .         that is so .      derec  looking worried  turned his back on the robot .     heads up     he said to ariel  then reared back his fist  as if to smash her in the face .   the robot   s hand was quick .  he had derec   s arm in between pincers in a split second .  derec relaxed in his grasp .      it   s all right  robot .  i would never hurt her .  i was just testing you .         testing me .         i wanted to make sure you would still obey the first law and keep me from harming ariel .         i would .  i must .      derec sighed .     at least something in this place is working according to hoyle .         excuse me     the robot said .     i missed a beat there somewhere  pal .  is there someone named hoyle i should know about .      derec laughed  pleased that at least this robot  with its skills at slang  could still be crossed up enough to take a statement literally .     it   s nothing     he said .     just a figure of speech .         i will look it up .  thanks a bunch  kid .         stop calling me kid .  it   s not only inaccurate  it   s disrespectful .         it   s not so inaccurate     ariel muttered .     i mean  you   re still a teenager .         i don   t feel like one any more .         i apologize  master derec .  i thought kid was a respectful term .  it is in the movies  i think .         i give up .  get on your way .         as you wish .  here   s looking at you  k   master derec .      the robot began to glide away .      wait  what   s your name .     derec called after it .     bogie .         that   s your new name  one you chose .         yes .         do you see many movies .         i have studied a certain period of the cinema  yes .         why .  why a certain period .         it was my assignment .         who made the assignment .         i am not allowed to say .         okay  okay .  i get the message .  i won   t ask any more questions .  you may go now  bogie .         yes  master derec .      bogie disappeared around another comer .  derec might have been mistaken  but the robot   s hand  extended in front of him  looked like it was flipping an invisible coin .      what do you make of that  ariel .         when i was a child  my mother had me watch a lot of movies from old earth .  they were shadowy  and dark  and in shades of gray they liked to call black and white .  very hard to watch  quite unreal .  they were usually about crime and murder and private detectives .  bogie   s like a character in one of them .  the slang seems about the same  far as i can remember .  maybe we can watch a few .         might help in figuring out what bogie is talking about .  for right now  though  i think we better get to the compass tower before any more of these wise guy robots show up .         wise guy .  and you were complaining about bogie   s slang .         it gets to you after a while .          what about your respect for language .         not sure i have any .  c   mon  i want to find the supervisors and work with the computer .         unless it thinks it   s a movie character  too .         don   t even think that .      as they headed toward the compass tower  the watchful eye studied the situation .  if these were the superior humans  they certainly were tentative  but also a bit aggressive .  derec nearly hit ariel  after all .   it was hard to examine them as long as it stayed put in its haven  yet it could not move now .  it must remain at the core of the city .  perhaps it would be useful to have derec and ariel spied upon .  spies could signal it when there was any danger of being discovered .  it decided to assign timestep and bogie to that job .  they had already proved their efficiency with the successful way they had absorbed the research materials assigned to them .   through the comlink system it contacted both robots  who  with nothing better to do  changed direction and met at the compass tower  just after the humans had entered the immense pyramidal structure .     chapter    mumbling robots and sassy computers    bemused by the actions of derec and ariel  the watchful eye turned its attention to the other set of newcomers in time to observe eve and mandelbrot leaving the building where she had discovered the residue from some of its early genetic experiments .  eve   s conduct in the old building seemed worth the watchful eye   s admiration .  it certainly preferred her cool reactions to the cowardly and brutal responses of ariel and derec .   its admiration increased when it eavesdropped on adam   s questioning of eve .  his queries were much more analytical and logical than those of derec and ariel in their interrogation of the two robots .  the watchful eye was  however  puzzled by certain aspects of the adam eve relationship .  it had detected a warmth and shared emotion between derec and ariel  even when they had been arguing with each other .  their silvery counterparts seemed close only when they shared information .  and they did not touch each other gently the way ariel and derec did .  the watchful eye placed no importance on emotion  but it had noticed that emotion seemed to playa key part in many of the descriptions of humanity contained in the computer files .   there was  as hamlet obsessed derec might have put it  a method to the watchful eye   s madness .  it was confused by some aspects of robot city  and it believed it needed help .  whichever of the two pairs appeared superior  it would enlist in its cause  as advisors  helping it to run the city .   up to now  it had only had the assistance of robots because there was no one else available .  robots did good work when properly instructed  but  if any of their laws of robotics were involved in the task  they could ask many time wasting questions .  if one of the watchful eye   s orders seemed to put a robot in danger  it would initiate long discussions about the task until the watchful eye finally revised the job to eliminate third law obstacles .  now that the newcomers had arrived on the planet  it was beginning to hear first law ruminations from the robots .   although the watchful eye would not have considered it in such terms  robot city had become its own personal toy .  it had not  after all  been conscious for very long  and in some ways it was still a child .  that was why it had conducted so many experiments since its arrival .  it was testing robot city  rearranging the place to fit its needs  finding out what worked and what did not  reprogramming robots to store the information that was beyond its ability to assimilate .  eventually it planned to restore order to the city  a highly structured order based on theories it was formulating daily .  it was determined to achieve the goal of establishing its own city .   the newcomers  with their experience and intellect  could help it .  it would put them under its thumb  a colloquialism it had learned from the computer   not that it had any thumbs  or at that moment any hands  and use their expertise to put the city also under its imaginary opposable digit .   as eve and the others continued their journey  the watchful eye searched for ariel and derec .  at first it could not locate them  but then its new spy  timestep  informed it that they were about to enter the compass tower .  quickly the watchful eye activated the life support systems that the pair would need inside the pyramidal structure .        it smells musty in here     ariel remarked as they headed down the corridor leading to the supervisors    meeting room .     like it   s been closed up tight for a long while .         maybe it has     derec responded .     it   s possible that when we   re not here for a long period of time  they close down the air circulation systems .         maybe .  but i sure don   t like it smelling like a tomb .      she coughed .  the echoes of it seemed to swirl down many hallways in front of them .      i don   t remember it being this cold in here  either     she said .     i know  don   t say it .  no reason to keep heating systems in complete operation for robots alone .      they came to the meeting room door  which was ajar .  derec placed his hand on ariel   s arm and whispered     wait .      she whispered back     what   s wrong .         that door   s usually not kept open .         so what .  it   s safe enough down here .  no need for security .         i know  i know .  it   s just disturbing .  it should be closed .         god  you   re going anomaly crazy .  let   s go in .      she charged ahead of him before he could hold her back .  her sudden move didn   t surprise him .  ariel had always been more impulsive than he .  he ran after her .   again  as they crossed a threshold into a dark room  the automatic lighting did not function .  at least the compass tower rooms had manual overrides so that  when necessary  lights could be controlled by the inhabitants .  ariel  feeling the wall next to the door with the back of her hand  found a light switch and flicked it on .   the supervisor robots were  in typical fashion  seated around the long meeting table .  she recognized avernus  dante  rydberg  euler  anon  and particularly the first wohler  the robot who had saved her life on the outside wall of the tower  then had lost all memory of his own heroism .  each time she saw wohler  she felt a twinge of affection for him .      why were they sitting in the dark .     ariel said .     hey  why are you guys sitting in darkness .         it is not dark now     avernus said .  his voice sounded odd  a bit deeper  like a sound tape being slowed down .      but it was .  wait a minute .  you fellows don   t usually play those robotic word games with us .  heck  the bunch of you together form a major computer .  what   s going on .         nothing     euler said .  his voice sounded weird  too .   she turned to derec .     what   s going on  you think .         i don   t know .      he walked around the table  studying the robots carefully  sometimes touching them  asking fast questions  receiving slow answers .  finally  he came back to ariel and whispered     they   re not really functioning .         what do you mean .  they responded to your questions  they spoke .         but their responses were meaningless  they didn   t really say anything .  you heard them .  whenever my questions had anything to do with possible computer malfunctions  they each said the computer is fully operational .  but  when i asked any specific questions about what was wrong with the city  they said nothing was wrong .  well  we can see how much is wrong and  ariel  part of what   s wrong is them .  whoever   s behind the sabotaging of the city has gotten control of them  too .  they   re just another system gone haywire .  let   s try the office .  maybe we   ll find the culprit there .      before they left the room  derec and ariel looked back .  the supervisor robots had not appeared to move an inch .  they had not sprung up  ready to serve derec and ariel  or provided useful information .  they had seemed listless  and listless robots seemed a contradiction in terms .  before she switched off the light  ariel said  a bit sadly        bye  fellas .     was she mistaken  or was there a faint mumbling response from them .   the office light also had to be turned on manually .  the room itself looked no different from usual .  its furniture was all in place  surfaces were clean  the computer was positioned correctly on the desk .  the surrounding walls  furnishing a computer display of the view from the compass tower roof  still functioned  although they showed an altered robot city  now too dark and too mysterious .  derec cursed under his breath .      what   s wrong .     ariel asked .  it seemed her main question ever since they had returned to robot city .      the chemfets .  it   s as if they   re getting fainter  dissolving .  whatever   s affecting the city is affecting them .  it has to .  let me at the computer .      as he activated the screen  called up access codes  made his fingers fly across the keyboard  his eyes teared up and he struggled to keep from crying .  ariel  for the first time in a long while  didn   t know what to say to him or what to do for him .  the chemfets had always been a mystery to her  and she didn   t know how to counter their effect on him .   finally  with an angry yowl  derec slammed his fists on the keyboard .  a few random letters appeared on the screen followed by a question mark .      it   s like everything else around here .  it won   t communicate with me .  whatever i type into it  it sends back gobbledygook   an error message  or request for clarification  or denial of access .  i asked why the lighting systems were not working properly  and it asked if i   d like a cracked cheeks cassette delivered to our rooms .     the cracked cheeks were the robot jazz group that had formed during the    circuit breaker    incident .  a fascination with creativity had captivated several robots at the time  but avery had later programmed such    dangerous    impulses out of them .     i asked why so many systems were down  and it called up a file management tutorial file .  i asked if there had been any newcomers to the city  and it said that information was restricted .  i asked it to unrestrict it  and it said it was restricted forever .         how can that be .         i don   t know .  it just seemed to be toying with me  treating me like a child  not relating to the chemfets at all .  there   s been some kind of bypass  somebody   s hacked in or something  or a computer virus  i don   t know .  whatever  whoever it is  is in control .  i could try to access the right information until i was blue in the face  and i   d just get nonsense from it .  the computer   s been taken from me  the robots are no longer in my power  the city is running down  and i can   t stop it .  and all i want to do is go back to the ship  lift off from this hellhole  go back to aurora or even to earth  and never come back .      he was close to breaking down .  ariel could see that .  gently she ran her hand through his bristly sandy colored hair  uncertain for a moment of what to say  then she knelt down beside him .     hey  snap out of it .  these are minor setbacks  pal .  we can take care of them .  we   ve done it before .      he smiled .     you   re right .  what   d i do without you .         probably blunder on with much less efficiency .      he sat quietly for a long while .     i wonder if he   s behind all of it .      she did not have to ask who he was .      it has the fingerprints of dr .  avery all over it  doesn   t it .         it has to be him .         but     said dr .  avery  his small form stepping out of a dark comer     this time it is not me .  i am  my son  just as confused by it all as you are .        chapter    no averys need apply       you were in that corner all this time .     ariel asked .   avery looked smug as he responded     since long before you violated my privacy by coming into the room .  i   ve been         derec suddenly screamed     damn you .     he vaulted out of his chair and lunged at dr .  avery  grabbing him by the throat and shoving him against the nearest wall .  the doctor   s eyes remained calm  as if the way he looked when he was being murdered was the same as when he delivered a sarcastic comment .      derec .     ariel shouted .     stop .  right this minute .      she pulled hard at his arm  breaking his grip  then she interposed her body between him and dr .  avery .  with a forceful backhand  she hit derec on the side of his face .  derec   s eyes looked momentarily dazed .  gently she began walking  edging him back toward the computer terminal .      now why in the name of the fifty spacer planets did you do that .     she said .   derec sat down again .  his fingertips brushed along a row of letters on the keyboard .     i   m sorry  ariel .         how about me .     avery said  his voice a bit shaky as he tentatively touched his throat .     i think you should apologize to me .         no .  that i won   t do .  you spied on us .         i wouldn   t call it spying  son .  i was here first  remember .  meditating in the darkness .  you intruded on me .  i just wasn   t ready to announce it .         he   s right  derec     ariel said .     his spying   s not important enough for an attempted murder .         i wouldn   t have killed him .  you know that .     ariel was bothered by the fact that she really didn   t know whether or not derec could commit patricide .     i just wanted to hurt him .         well  you at least succeeded in that purpose  young man     avery said .  now he was tugging at the cuff of his sleeve with one hand  smoothing out the cloth of his laboratory smock with the other .     you do not seem to be accomplishing much elsewhere  however .  no wonder you were reduced to tears .      derec made a small furious sound in his throat  but restrained himself from jumping up again .  instead  he said quietly  in a level voice     what it was  ariel  he saw me cry .  i didn   t want him to see that  that   s all .  not him .  childish of me  i guess .  i   m sorry .      ariel hugged him .     you are childish  darling .  and it   s all right to cry .  no matter who sees it .         not if it   s him .     he rubbed at his eyes with the back of his right hand  trying to wipe away any remaining evidence of his tears .     he has no right to judge me .         i   ve always judged you .  i am your father .  i   m supposed to .         he may be lying about being my father .  how do we know .         you   ve inherited my bad temper  son .  isn   t that proof enough for you .  and why won   t you address me directly .      derec refused to reply .  he sat silently  staring at the computer screen   s last message  a bit of gobbledygook about invalid parameters .   avery  smoothing down his white wavy hair  then pressing down his mustache  walked forward .  ariel noticed that his eyes glowed .  he had always seemed crackbrained in his words and deeds  now she saw it in his eyes .  derec whirled around in his chair and faced the scientist .  a strange smile came slowly over avery   s face .      we have a problem     he said .      we have many problems     derec said .     which one are you referring to .      avery waved his hand in a dismissive gesture .     not the ones between you and me  son .  they are trivial .  i will win you over in time .  no  i mean the city .  my city .  your city  too .  almost all normal functioning has stopped  as you   ve seen .         and you have nothing to do with it .      avery shook his head no .     i understand why you suspect me .  i might suspect myself .  but i was away on a different project  conducting a different set of experiments at another robot city .  i used a key to perihelion to return here yesterday  and my arrival has so far been undetected .  that   s no surprise  considering the way things have fallen apart here .         what   s the cause of it .     derec asked .      i can   t find out .  the changes didn   t occur by themselves  i   m sure of that .  someone is behind them .  but i haven   t a clue whom .  for a while i thought it might be you  fooling around with your domain here  trying out your wings .  but i realize now it wasn   t .         why do you think it   s someone .     ariel asked .     couldn   t it be a flaw in the works  something you overlooked that   s making the city decay .      a flash of furious anger came briefly into the doctor   s eyes then receded as he stared at his questioner .      no  the city cannot decay     he said .     it could choke itself to death with overproduction  as it was doing the very first time you two arrived here .  it could come close to social ruin  as it nearly did when the artist lucius created his    circuit breaker    sculpture .  but the mechanisms themselves cannot fail  and neither can the robots .  however  essentially i agree with your insight .  there is decadence here .  not originating in the system but from an outside source .  we must find the source .         stop saying we     derec said angrily .     you do what you want to  but i won   t work with you .  until i find out otherwise  you are my chief suspect for the state of the city .      again the doctor smiled  and again it was a strange smile  corning over his face as if it were released by a spring mechanism .     we must work on your logic circuits  son .  why would i try to ruin robot city  the city i created myself  then peopled with my own robots .  destroying this city would be  for me  like destroying myself .         excuse me  sir     ariel said     but your previous behavior doesn   t entirely eliminate the chance you might  in a fit or tantrum  decide to get rid of your own creation .  i   m sorry  but i have to agree with derec on this .      she moved to derec  placed her hand casually on his shoulder .      well  don   t the two of you make a pretty pair .     avery said .     like dull eyed pioneers in a tintype .  all the imperfections of humanity stiffly posed on a chemically treated plate .  i suppose i   d hoped for more from you two  but one thing i   ve learned  humans may fail you but robots are forever .      ariel laughed .     that   s diamonds are forever  i believe .         my robots will endure beyond the cheap glitter of geological accidents .      derec started to stand up  but ariel   s gentle pressure on his shoulder kept him seated .     doctor     she said     i admire florid language as much as the next gal  but what in frost   s name do you mean .      avery   s eyes squinted and his head tilted slightly  as if he could not comprehend how he could be misunderstood .     my dear  a robot is  although manmade  the finest stage of humanity  the ideal toward which you puny  disease prone  uncertain beings should aspire .  instead  you don   t even respect them .  you order them about  treat them as servants .         not true     ariel said .     we do respect them .  most of us .         but not all     avery said smugly .      at any rate  they were created as servants     derec said     adjuncts to human laborers in industry  maids in private homes .         yes  they were enslaved at first .  but i have liberated them .  i have created communities for them where they can exist without the continual interference of the human race  cities more magnificent than the overcrowded hovels of earth and the brutally isolated homes of aurora .  i   ve         .    wait  wait     ariel said .     with due respect  sir  these robot cities are designed as relatively perfect environments for humans to come .  yet  you say they   re really for the robots .         very good  ariel .  you catch on quickly .  i   ve had to tell my robots that they were building for humans .  the laws of robotics demand that .  they must at least think they are here to protect humans  to follow orders from humans .  rarely  however  do they ever encounter humans .  that doesn   t seem to make any difference to them  so long as they think there will be humans eventually .         but you   ve never intended to  say  import colonies to live here .         originally i did .  but i   ve changed my mind .  i say  robot city for robots .  why contaminate them with hordes of humans spreading their weak minded mores and indifferent customs .  don   t you see  ariel  it would be wrong for the superior beings to continue to serve the lesser .  that   s why i am a liberator .  the robot is the next level of existence .  humans can die out  while robots will endure .      ariel realized that she had been holding her breath as she listened to the doctor   s shouted diatribe .  she turned to derec and whispered     he is mad .         i heard that  young lady .  and of course you   d perceive me that way  with your limited perception .  i   d expect no more .  but your antagonism only stimulates my positronic pathways .         your what .         positronic pathways .  you see  i have not only created the avery robots in my own image  but i have recreated myself  casting away my humanity and transforming myself into a robot also .         ba nanas     ariel muttered .   avery merely smiled .  now she could see it as a definitely robotic smile  even though she believed none of his story .      i knew you wouldn   t believe     avery said .      are you trying to say  oh  that you   ve implanted a robot brain into your head .  is that what the positronic pathways guff is all about .         i see that you   re patronizing me  so i think we can terminate this discussion .      for a moment ariel wondered if this figure  identical to the dr .  avery she had met before  might indeed be a robotic recreation .  then he swept by her  and his easily detectable body odor told her that he was still at least partly human .   after avery slammed the door behind him  ariel commented     the man needs help .         so do we     derec said .  his fingers flew across the keyboard again .  some data came up on the terminal   s screen .     look at this  ariel .      all she saw was a bunch of figures .     what does it mean .         this is a report of construction activity in robot city .  the earlier figures represent the city   s normal rate of new building .  but lately the figures have gradually fallen off  with fewer and fewer buildings being created .  since before we arrived  there have  in fact  been no new buildings created .  all construction in robot city has stopped .         funny     ariel commented .      what   s funny about it .         this tends to support your father   s story .         how does it do that .         well  remember what he said about robots being the supreme whatever and all that  plus the city being the safest haven for them .  so why would he stop that .  why would he allow the robots themselves to become  as he said  decadent .  this man isn   t going to be happy with listless supervisors and robots who are tap dancers or movie buffs .  after lucius  he programmed creativity right out of his robots .  no  for once dr .  avery isn   t the chief troublemaker .  it   s somebody else  it   s got to be .         okay  granted .  but what do we do now .  i can   t get anything out of the computer  the robots are uncooperative  and the city   s becoming a play village for someone whose identity we don   t know .  what next  my pretty .         well  i   ve got a swell idea if you don   t mind a little break in the action .         you   ve got           this room comes furnished with a couch bed  and there   s even a blanket on the end table there if you want privacy .         you flip off the lights  i   ll switch off the computer .         why the computer .         i don   t know .  i   ve a feeling it could spy on us .      as they embraced in darkness  the real spy outside the door  still indoctrinated with the laws of robotics  knew they applied in some way to this situation  and so he discreetly retreated .  after all  he thought  in the best movies he had seen  the camera always discreetly retreated from this sort of scene .  as he rejoined timestep outside the compass tower  bogie decided that the shadowing assignment was a fortunate one .  keeping watch on the two young humans was a bit like watching a movie   in a way  better  since it took place in three dimensions .     chapter    creature discomforts    each time wolruf stumbled or bumped into something  she cursed in her own language .  eve asked her what words she was speaking  but she replied that it was merely her own private nonsense .   the silversides and mandelbrot had no difficulty with the darkness of the streets .  equipped with precise sensory circuitry  they could proceed easily through such darkness .  wolruf  even with the keen senses she had developed in the wilds of her homeland  couldn   t detect every obstacle in her way .      is the lack of proper lighting bothersome to you .     mandelbrot asked her .      so true .  i rememberr lightss coming on when walking these strreetss .         they do not seem to be functioning now .         like so many other thingss here .  what iss wrrong  mandelbrrot .         i do not know .         what we have seen     eve asked     is not necessarily like this place as you know it .         verry different     wolruf answered .     strreetlampss alwayss lit one   ss way .      they walked a few more steps  turned a corner  with wolruf   s shoulder painfully bumping into the side of a building   and saw flickering light up ahead .      what is that .     eve asked .      not sure     wolruf said     but my nose tellss me apprroach cautiously .         your nose speaks to you .         no  that iss rrendening of saying from my worrld into    uman wordss .  we sense dangerr  we say we sniff it out with our nosess  even when there iss no actual scent there .      eve did not quite understand  but she chose to keep quiet  especially since wolruf  assuming the role of scout  now sprinted ahead of the group .      adam .     eve said .      yes .         is this a strange place  this robot city .         in my limited experience  where every place i have seen is strange to me  this one is  too .      the glimmering light shone from an open area in between two tall buildings .  gesturing the three robots to stay put  wolruf edged along the front of the building until she came to its comer .  looking around it  she saw that the light came from a bonfire in the middle of a vacant lot .  gathered around the flames doing an odd  jerky dance was a crowd of small creatures .  because the fire cast distorting shadows  she could not easily focus on the figures .  yet she was sure they were shaped like humans  but much more diminutive .   at first she thought they might be a group of children .  then a few danced into a clear patch of light .  wolruf saw that not only were they even smaller than she had thought  they were also not children .  one male had a beard  a female had quite fully developed  in miniature  breasts  another had an aged  deeply lined face .  definitely not children .  they were adults .  tiny  tiny adults .     the watchful eye no longer knew what to think about the new arrivals .  such contradictory behavior  it thought .  the one called ariel seemed all right  except when she decided to be affectionate with derec .  derec cried and nearly murdered the new individual  avery .  avery stomped around like a caged animal .  who were these creatures .   it knew from its earlier research that avery might be the creator of robot city  but the doctor   s behavior was so erratic that the watchful eye did not want to make contact with him .  if avery discovered it here in its safe haven  there was no telling what he might do .   now  to further complicate matters  the second group had come upon one of the watchful eye   s master experiments .  series c  batch    one of its better efforts .  a failure like the rest  yes  but an interesting failure at least .  like some of the other humanic substitutes  they had developed a rudimentary society .  although none of these batches had contributed the insights about the laws of humanics that the watchful eye sought  they had  by banding together and rapidly evolving a few customs  provided an abundance of useful data about cultural tendencies .   because there was so much for it to consider  the watchful eye now chose to retreat into its stasis state .  in stasis  it shut off its senses so that it could concentrate exclusively on problems  this time the new and altered situations brought into its hermetic world by the intruders .  it wanted to analyze how they would affect its overall existence and whether it would have to take any action against them .  before settling itself back into its safe haven  it sent out messages to its spies  bogie and timestep  instructing them to signal it if a new crisis developed .  when that was done  it snuggled down into the haven  curled up into an embryonic state  and disconnected all sensory networks .  immediately it was welcomed into the calm comfort of nothingness  a place where it sometimes yearned to be forever .        well  we   re on our own for a while  kid     bogie commented after acknowledging the watchful eye   s message .     the big muddy   s spoke .         big muddy .     timestep said .     is that a proper name for           let me put it this way  pal .  i wouldn   t speak it if the big muddy was looking over my shoulder .      timestep did a little clog routine from one of the dance tapes he   d studied .      nice moves  tip tap .         it   s timestep .         you say so  tip tap .         what are we supposed to do now .         keep tabs on dick and jane up there  send the big muddy signals if they get up to somethin    it should know about .         what are they doing now .         friend tip tap  we   ll just draw the curtain across that little scene .         all right .  then we should just stand here and wait for something to happen .            bout the size of it  big boy .      they stood silently for a long while  a pair of silvery statues streaked with blue in the dim  reflected light at the foot of the compass tower .      bogie .         yeah  kid .         who is the big muddy .         don   t know .  just the boss  far   s i know .         have you seen it .         nope .  nobody has  far   s i know .         why has it taken over robot city .         beats me .  place has certainly changed since it breezed in  though .         i don   t feel comfortable about that .  a while ago i had a safe  normal routine .  every day i did my job .  i never questioned whether or not to do it .  then the big muddy came  and before i knew it  i had walked off the job .  that   s when i found out i was a dancer .  the big muddy told me .         yep .  same for me .  i had a compulsion to examine old movies  came from big muddy .  i don   t mind it  though .  there   s a lot of truth in flickerdom  kid .  i   ve copped much more about human life now .  you don   t trust society broads and you don   t rat on a partner  stuff like that .  the flicks   ve helped me to see the vast potential of the humans we serve .  i   ll be a better robot because of them .         you confuse me  bogie .  i am not certain all this is right .  once we were building and maintaining robot city  now almost everything about the city has stopped .  we are the servants of the big muddy now .         maybe this burg needed a rest  kiddo .  you worry too much .  dump it in a grocery cart and carry it out to the parking lot .  we   ve got a job to do right now .  let   s do it .         do you think the city looks the way it used to .         no  it don   t .  but  like they say  that   s chinatown  jake .      timestep couldn   t understand half of what bogie said  but he chose now to keep still until something happened .   a long time passed and nothing happened .   finally he said     i cannot stand still this way .  i   ve got to dance .      in the few pools of light  timestep   s dance became a silhouette of a slow tap .  he moved from one lighted area to another .  bogie  who   d seen some dancing in movies  judged that a human would have probably found the robot   s little routine bizarre  since it was tap dancing without music .  the clunking noises as his feet made contact with the pavement echoed through the long street .  they were grating sounds .  timestep should hire himself a band  bogie thought .     now that night had fallen  the darkness inside the compass tower office seemed total to ariel .  she stuck her head out from beneath the blanket and could not discern anything .  after blinking her eyes a few times  however  details of the room appeared to emerge from the blackness .      it   s eerie     she whispered .   derec  who had nearly fallen asleep  was startled awake and asked     what did you say .         eerie  the darkness in here .  i mean  the room .  usually all those view screens are on  transmitting scenes from the outside world .         they are on .  there   s just so little light out there  you can hardly tell .     he sat up .     but it is awfully dark .  let   s take a better look .      after adjusting their clothing  derec led ariel to the desk that dominated one side of the room .  flicking on a small desk lamp  it had been so dark  even that flimsy light pained her eyes   he pulled out the slab of controls from its position just beneath the desk blotter .  sitting down  derec worked the controls  searching for clearer pictures or any kind of image that would be displayed recognizably on a view screen .  most of the screens remained shadowy .  here and there they could see the shapes of buildings  sometimes a few dim stars in the sky .   he pointed one camera downward  and it picked up the pools of light near the compass tower .  they came  he saw  from some light bands in a building across the way .  apparently the lighting system there had not broken down .      look there .     he pointed to the view screen .     something   s happening down there .     he zoomed in on the movement  enlarging the image until they could plainly see timestep doing his dance .  the robot  with a movement approaching grace  leaped from pool to pool .  derec turned up the volume on the sound pickup  and they could hear the hollow  plaintive  echoing  tapping sounds .      weird     ariel said .     do you think that   s the dancer we met .         looks like him .      timestep stretched his arms outward and tapped to the left  then he shuffled a bit and made the same move to the right .      it   s not like human dancing     ariel said     but it has its own elegance  its own special grace .  you know  once   when i was about twelve or thirteen   i was given an old mechanical toy  some kind of precursor to robots  perhaps  but really just a toy that was wound up and run .  it was a little metal man in a harlequin costume  and it stayed in one place  a tiny pole running up its back .  when it was switched on  it did this queer  floppy dance .  its legs bent in right angles at the knees  then came down and hit its pedestal a couple of times  then resumed its stance with the right angled knees  then down again  and so forth .  i was fascinated by it  played with it for hours .  i liked it better than all the technologically fashionable toys that were arranged in clusters around my room .  but i think my mother sneaked in when i was asleep and took it away .  i don   t remember who gave it to me .  look at that .      timestep had executed an extravagantly long soft shoe glide  coming to a stop beside another robot she hadn   t previously noticed .      say  that   s   what did he call himself .    bogie  wasn   t it .  what are those two doing down there .         i don   t know  but it seems terribly coincidental that the two of them should wind up together and right near the compass tower entrance  don   t you think .         maybe .  i wish timestep   d dance again .  he couldn   t possibly be tired .         what did you get out of it .  the dance  i mean .  it might be a bit unusual  but it was just a robot dancing .  they can do anything they   re programmed to do .         don   t be so pragmatic .  there was a beauty in his dance .         only in your mind .  a human doing the same dance with about the same ability  you   d find him awkward and minimally talented .  that robot is about the same as the famous talking dog .  it   s that he does it at all that   s amazing  but there was nothing remotely beautiful about it .      ariel muttered     have it your way  mr .  critic at large .     she walked away a few steps  then whirled around to say     but i liked it .      derec was used to ariel being touchy on occasion  so he shrugged and said     i   m sorry .  just my opinion .  let   s go down and pay these fellows a visit .         it   s not necessary .         c   mon .  maybe timestep does encores .        the three robots and wolruf stayed outside the perimeter of the tiny creatures    encampment .  after a flurry of interest in the intruders  the small people had turned their attention back to their ritual by the bonfire .  there was a definite pattern to the ritual .  first they circled the fire in a line  each creature keeping a hand on the shoulder of the individual in front of it .  then they broke up into couples and performed a dance that featured a complicated but rhythmic sequence of high kicks .  the kick dance was followed by a synchronized turning toward the fire  the move accompanied by a high pitched wail .  wolruf was reminded of the noises of a high flying bird like species from her home planet .   when the moaning had reached its loudest point  it stopped abruptly  and several of the small people dropped quickly to the ground .  the ones left standing picked up their fallen comrades and dragged them away from the fire .  after pulling them a short distance  they began arranging them in a number of piles .  the wailing resumed  then the standing people clapped their hands three times  and the fallen bodies stirred and got to their feet .  a short frenetic dance that looked like celebration followed .  after that  another group took its place around the fire and executed the same ritual  step by step .      it is strange     eve commented .      what does the ritual mean .     adam asked .      i would speculate that it has something to do with death and resurrection     mandelbrot said .      why do    u say that .     wolruf asked .      some information about such rituals on other planets that i have stored in my memory banks .  the rite here suggests that some of them die  the ones piled up  and then are in some way resurrected .  the reason for resurrection is not clear to me .  to understand  i am afraid we would have to observe their culture at length .         i would like to do that     eve said .     they  too  seem to be human  adam .  perhaps they would supply some data for our quest .         perhaps .         but we have to meet derrec and arriel at the towerr     wolruf said .      you two go ahead     eve suggested .     we will follow soon .         what will    u do .     wolruf asked .      nothing dangerous  i assure you .  i just wish to study them a while .         it would be best if you continued on with us     mandelbrot said .      no     wolruf said         u know these two .  they get idea     u can   t stop them .      if mandelbrot had been a nodder  he would have nodded .  he and wolruf quickly left the lot  heading toward the compass tower .   a moment later  eve crossed into the area where the tiny creatures were busy with their ritual .  they didn   t seem to notice her .  adam followed .  they stepped carefully  putting their feet down only in clear areas .  this kind of walking was easier for a robot than it would have been for a human .  if there had been any danger of eve or adam putting their feet down upon one of the tiny creatures  they would have sensed it quickly and been able to balance on one leg for as long as it took until a safe step could be ventured .   when they were near the fire  eve said     they seem intelligent .  can we talk to them  do you think .         we can try  eve .      she crouched down  getting her head as low as she could without falling over .  reflected light from the bonfire seemed to move like the tiny dancers across her silvery surface .      hello     she said .   some of the dancers looked at her .  they stopped  stood still  and stared up at her .     can you understand me .      they said nothing .  a tiny  prettily formed woman stepped forward .  she had large bulging eyes and a swelling by her right ear .  eve expected her to say something  but she did not .  she merely scrutinized her visitor  a quizzical expression on her face .      i am eve .      the small woman made some odd sounds in her throat and pointed up at eve .  three others joined her  another woman and two men .  they all appeared amused .  the woman with the large eyes began jumping up and down  her odd raspy sounds getting louder .  the trio behind her laughed merrily .  one slapped his knee .  then they all began talking  if that   s what the chattering sounds they emitted were .      there seems to be a language     adam said .      maybe we can learn it .      saying hello again  eve reached out her hand toward the small woman  who  scared  took some steps backward .  then she appeared to get control of herself .  she turned her back on eve and resumed her place in the bonfire ritual .  the other three followed her .  soon none of them were paying any attention to the gigantic silver intruder who hovered above them .  the ritual appeared to get fiercer each time they repeated it .   eve stood up and walked past the fire .  many of the small people were gathered in a corner of the lot  working furiously .  she had to squat down again to see what they were doing .  when she saw what it was  she called out to adam to come and view it for himself .   gesturing for him to hunch down beside her  she indicated the group in the corner .      what are they doing  eve .         look .  there are rows and rows of these small creatures on the ground there .  beyond that  there are more of them in piles .         like the dance .         no  not like the dance .  the ones in this pile are dead  adam .  the others are burying them in the ground  but there are too many dead ones and they are not able to keep up the pace .  look  over there  more are being carried here .      from all points of the lot  it seemed  surviving creatures were hauling their dead compatriots to the burial ground .  there was a slow rhythm to the way they walked  as if it  too  were part of the bonfire ritual .  eve noted that there was no human emotion on their faces .  they were merely burying their dead methodically .   when each corpse had been covered over  the gravediggers turned to the next tiny plot of land and dug a hole for the next in line .      adam  i think there   s something wrong here .  they are dying out  all of them .  they will all be gone shortly .  yet i detect no signs of disease .  no  it is more like they are just wearing out .  derec told us nothing of these creatures .         i do not understand  eve .         i surmise that they did not exist a short time ago  when derec and ariel were first here .  they have only existed for a short time  and now they are dying out .  i suspect there is something sad in that .      she turned her head and saw that one of the corpses now being conveyed to the burial ground was the small woman with the bulging eyes .     even when he stood still  timestep   s left foot kept tapping from side to side .  bogie recalled a character in a movie who had performed the same movement at the beginning of a dance number .  he could not remember specifically because he rarely watched musicals  much preferring the mystery and action films that were so well represented in the robot city film and tape archives .   he was about to suggest that one of them should again station himself in the hallway outside the office when he heard the last few soft treads of ariel and derec as they came to the outer door of the compass tower .  as bogie glanced toward the tower  he saw the door beginning to form itself before letting them exit .      run     he said to timestep     they   re coming out .      they both started clanking up the street  but the second law of robotics  that they must obey an order coming from a human being  made them stop running when derec yelled for them to stop .  as derec and ariel walked up to them  timestep   s foot resumed its slow tapping movement .      you two  you   re spying on us     derec said .  his voice has assumed the firmness that humans often used when addressing robots .     why .         we are not allowed to tell that     bogie said .     it is a confidential order .         from whom .         we are not allowed to tell you that .         another one of your infernal blocks .         yes .         it   s my father     derec said angrily .     only he would think up tricks like this .         i still disagree     ariel said .     his tricks would be even more diabolical .         and there   s no way i can remove these blocks right now .         only the one who put them there may remove them .         did a human put them there .         i cannot say .         you cannot say because you don   t know or because my father put in those blocks .         i cannot say because i am prevented from saying .         nice try     ariel whispered     trying to trick him into admitting your father   s the perpetrator .         well  tricks like that sometimes work  ariel .         i know  you   ve been around the block a few times .      derec was about to continue his interrogation of bogie when mandelbrot and wolruf rounded a corner and headed toward them at a fast pace .  wolruf was loping on all fours  as she sometimes did when she was tired .  since she stayed beside mandelbrot  keeping at his pace  they looked like a man and his dog out for a stroll   if you didn   t look too closely .      where   re our two mischief makers .     derec asked when they reached him .      a good question     wolruf said .  she explained how they had left the silversides behind to study the creatures they   d discovered  and she was surprised to see derec   s eyes light up with interest .  he turned to ariel and said excitedly     these may be more of the same pests that attacked us in that building .  let   s go see .         good idea .  anyway  it   s never wise to leave adam and eve alone anywhere they could cause trouble .      they started down the street  the way mandelbrot and wolruf had come .  the alien and the ever loyal robot walked right behind them .  after a few steps  derec glanced back at bogie and timestep .      hey     he called back to them     you   re going to follow us and spy on us anyway  you two .  you might just as well come along with us .      it was probably his imagination  but it seemed to derec as if the two spies began their walk toward him with some eagerness in their stride .     chapter    trouble right here in robot city    even though wolruf had described the vacant lot   s strange colony to him  derec was unprepared for what they found there .   first  the bonfire had gone out .  it now smoldered pathetically  a few wisps of smoke rising from what proved to be some type of synthetic wood .  the wood  now a jumbled pile of charred curls  gave off a strong chemical odor that reminded ariel of a broken down food synthesizer  never one of her favorite smells .   next  derec saw the dancers .  they were still a circle  but no longer moving .  they were on the ground  some face down  some face up  their hands still joined  but clearly dead .  their bodies had not been moved because the carriers and the gravediggers had died out now .  as he walked around the yard  he had to step over more than a hundred undersized corpses .   finally  he saw adam and eve at the half completed graveyard .  eve was delicately picking up the creatures    bodies  one by one  and placing them in a row of graves she had quickly dug with her hands .  it was an odd action  derec thought  one that seemed to indicate compassion on her part .  while she could have some understanding of human feelings  he thought it doubtful she could feel such compassion herself .   still  adam and eve were a new breed of robot  one that had appeared as if by magic on two planets now  adam having found eve on the blackbodies    planet after himself coming into sudden existence on the planet of the wolflike creatures  the kin   and so anything was possible .  the way the silversides kept surprising him  he might never get a fix on them .  perhaps they were indeed the prototypes for emotional robots  a concept that did not correspond with derec   s present knowledge of robotics .      where did they come from .     ariel said  looking down at the many bodies .      i don   t know .  they seem to be one more thing that   s gone wrong with the city .         are they the same ones who attacked us in the warehouse .         maybe .  or that might have been another bunch .      ariel shuddered .     you mean they may be allover the city  living in open spaces or dark places like rodents .         rodent may not be the proper analogy .  they do seem to have been human or humanlike .  what do you think  adam .  eve .      adam was holding one of the little corpses in his left hand while he poked at it with a finger of his right .  the figure appeared to be a gaunt young man with a short beard .  his body was extremely thin .   adam  while still strongly resembling derec  had taken on some of the corpse   s appearance .  his face had thinned and there was a hint of metallic bristles on his chin .  he seemed to have grown taller and slimmer  also .      they seem to be miniature versions of humans  inside and out     adam observed .     i sense a musculature  a bloodstream  arteries and veins  small fragile bones .         bound to seem fragile .  anyone of us could crush anyone of them .         do you have to say things like that .     ariel said .      sorry  thought you were tougher .      she looked ready to slug him for making that remark .      since when does good taste indicate weakness .  huh  derec  huh .         okay  you made your point .  i   m a bit dense when my world is disrupted this violently  okay .      she touched his cheek with the back of her hand .  her touch was so gentle  he immediately wished he could devote all his time and energies to her .      adam     he said     you seem to have imprinted partially on the corpse .  have you learned anything from that .         only that i cannot do it very well .  before it died  i started to study it .  i found i couldn   t imprint on it successfully .  it was as if there was very little life in it when it was alive .      derec nodded .     well  it was already dying perhaps .         yes  but it was more than that  master derec .  there was simply very little awareness inside here .     he held out the corpse .  derec flinched a bit .  the corpse   s tiny  delicate face was twisted in pain .     the impression i had was similar to what i have received from small animals .  what i concluded was that they resembled humans but were not human .         i do not agree     eve said .  adam looked toward her .  derec wondered if adam could possibly feel the discomfort that he always felt when ariel challenged his opinion .  there was a sense of competitiveness between him and ariel that sometimes interfered with their ability to communicate .  but adam and eve should not  as robots  have that kind of communication difficulty  and there was no reason for them to compete with each other .      we saw very little of them     eve explained     but there was a definite society here .  they interacted with each other  joined in a complex ritual together  did indeed combine together into a sort of colony .  they had a need to dispose of their dead .  are not these proofs that they had at least a rudimentary society .         she   s got a point there     ariel observed .   derec glanced at eve .  her face seemed to alter slightly  becoming even more like ariel   s whenever ariel talked .      what matters right now     he said     is not what they were  but why they were here .         do you have any answers .     ariel asked .      not many .  only my father .  these creatures may be the result of some lousy experiment he   s done down in his mysterious underground laboratory .  he   s let them loose to   to do i don   t know what .  with him how can you           let   s not give you too much rope to hang yourself with     avery said  as he strolled into the lot  again emerging from some dark place .     yes  don   t say it  son   your old dad was eavesdropping again .  i would have remained hidden  but i   m tired of your trying to hang the blame on me for everything that goes wrong here .  after all  you   re the one in charge  derec .  try considering it could be you who   s to blame .         i haven   t even been here since           i know  i know .  and of course you   re not at fault .  but i was away  too  remember .     he sauntered around the lot  examining the ugly scene .     this place was once a small park as i recall .  i remember programming these for the city  soil and all .  i never expected the dirt to be used for burials .     he wrinkled his nose .     they   re decaying at an above normal rate  these corpses .     he reached down  picked up one of the bodies .     interesting workmanship     he muttered .   ariel charged forward  angry .     workmanship .  how can you           how can i analyze this dead thing so coldly .  objectivity .  i am a scientist  my dear .  it   s my mind set  if you will .  anyhow  this was not a true living being .  although realistic and cleverly designed  with a great deal of genetic accuracy  i suspect this is merely an android  a kind of dime story copy of a humaniform robot  with admirably realistic detail .      ariel thought of jacob winterson and how he was just as    dead    as the tiny body avery held so casually in his hand .     i don   t believe you     she said  although to herself she admitted the doctor might be right .      well  my dear  of course i can   t be sure .  i admit i can detect no mechanisms in this particular miniature .  but a well crafted miniature has to be what this is .  do you know about miniatures in art .  they   re quite wonderful .  on a small surface  sometimes made of vellum  sometimes ivory or copper  the artist would render exquisitely detailed little landscapes or portraits or whatever .  often the painting was done with the patient strokes of a single strand brush .  the details might astound you .  you   d swear that you were looking at an intricate painting that had been mechanically reduced or done with microsopic brushes .         what was the point of them .  i mean  why choose a small area when you could have a whole canvas .         perhaps the challenge  perhaps the artistry of working on a small scale  or perhaps commercial motives .  you see  miniatures were often encased in jewelry   lockets and such   and so a pretty penny could also be earned from such a specialized craft .  when photography came in  and you could place a small photo in a locket  the need for miniatures diminished and painters had to look elsewhere for pla  es to cash in on their talents        you sound bitter  dr .  avery     ariel said .     as if you were an artist yourself .         i am  in a way .  i started out as an architect  and architecture  when done right  is an art form  too .  robot city was my masterpiece   until my son allowed it to get out of hand .         don   t say that .     derec shouted .     it wasn   t my fault  what happened to the city .         i didn   t mean to say it was .  all i meant is that it is your responsibility .  please excuse me now .  i want to get this specimen to a laboratory to examine it before it is fully decayed .      holding the tiny figure aloft  the way he might have held a beaker with volatile contents  avery rushed off the lot .  derec  his eyes glowering  stared after him .      don   t let him get to you     ariel said .      he hasn   t gotten to me     derec said sullenly .      sure  and this place doesn   t stink .  let   s get out of here .      derec and ariel led an entourage that included wolruf  mandelbrot  adam  bogie and timestep out of the lot .  eve insisted on staying behind to finish the burials .  although derec found her behavior peculiar  especially for a robot  he did not argue with her .  there were  after all  more important problems to occupy his mind  and anyway  the task would keep her out of trouble for a while .   when he looked back at her  she was gently placing a body into a minuscule grave in the delicate way a child might put a doll into a toy crib .     bogie and timestep took up the rear of the bizarre little march through the dark city streets .      hey  kid     bogie said     whattaya make o    that scene back there .         i did not know i was supposed to interpret it     timestep said .     none of the humans made that request of me .         yeah  i know .  but i just wanna know about these little people so we can figure out our duties if we ever meet any live ones .  are they human and covered by the laws  or what .  after all  these guys don   t seem to know what they are .  if they   re human  they   re our concern  too  right .         it would seem so .         on the other hand  if their fate is inevitable  as derec and the others seem to be saying  there   s not much we can actually do for them .  if they live a very short time then pop off  no interference or help on our part is going to stave off their destiny .  then we may not have to help  except perhaps to protect them from immediate dangers .         that may be true .         so what do we do .         i don   t know .         me neither .  we   ll have to wait and see  just chug on up the river and hope the leeches don   t suck us dry .           well  one good thing     ariel said     the city is more peaceful this way .  remember how there used to be a hum of activity even in the dead of night .  all these anomalies may be beneficial .         ariel  the city is decaying  and fast  just like those corpses .  it   ll be           hey  lighten up .  i wasn   t serious .     they walked almost a block in sullen silence before she spoke again .     don   t take everything on your shoulders  derec .  the city is important to me  too   as are our lives  as you are .      without breaking stride  he took her hand and held it .  in response  she squeezed his .      your father   s not looking too well     she said a few steps later .      an understatement if i ever heard one .         he   s your father .  i   m a bit hesitant to come right out and say he   s bonkers .  but he is .  somebody should talk to him  try to help him .      derec stopped walking and smiled  slyly .     would you like that job .      she wasn   t prepared for the question or the challenge contained in it  but after a moment of consideration she said     yes .  yes  i would .         it   s yours then .  catch him if you can .         i   ll find a way .         i bet you will .      after they had proceeded a little farther  their steps clicking hollowly on the pavement and the city seeming to envelop them from above  derec said     i   ve been thinking .  the taming of adam and eve is the main reason we returned to robot city  and we   ve lost sight of it .  but i   ve got to work out what   s wrong here .     he stopped walking again  took both her hands in his .      ariel  will you take charge of the silversides  see what you can do to  well  civilize them .  with your psychological expertise  perhaps you can figure out how to get into the minds of these new styled robots .  i know they   re a mystery to me .         sure  i   ll do it .  you knew i would .  any other miracles you   d like me to perform today .      he smiled .     that   ll be sufficient for now  thank you very much .         what are you going to do in the meantime .         i   m not sure .  seems to me the clue to the anomalies has to be in the computer somewhere .  i think mandelbrot and i will take a trip down to the central core  see if we can detect anything .  i   ll take these two with me  too .      he gestured toward bogie and timestep  both of whom had also stopped walking  while staying a precise two steps behind .  if he had looked closely  derec might have noticed that bogie stood oddly  the slightly tilted stance that robots sometimes adopted when they were in communication with each other .      do you think a tap dancer and a wise cracker can help .  i mean  as robots go  they   re weird .  talk about your anomalies .  .  .         by the same token  i don   t particularly want them out of my sight .         gotcha  hot shot .         your language is deteriorating .  if you don   t watch out  you   ll sink to bogie   s level .         hope not  kiddo .         stop .      they agreed to keep each other informed on the progress of their tasks .  ariel told wolruf and adam to come with her  and derec continued on  the silent mandelbrot at his side  and bogie and timestep trailing after .     as soon as bogie heard that derec intended to travel down to computer level  where he knew the watchful eye was  he obeyed its instructions to rouse it if there were any danger .  the signal     this is your wake up call  pal .      was sent  and the watchful eye came abruptly to consciousness .     chapter     the wandering eve    it took some time for the watchful eye to catch up on the events that had transpired while it was in stasis .  bogie   s report  transmitted over the robot comlink  was more confusing than helpful  what with all the ancient slang the robot had copied from movies .   the watchful eye had only itself to blame for bogie   s movie obsession .  when it had first arrived in robot city and obtained control of all systems  it had decided to form a network of knowledge .  it wanted so much to find out about humanity that it had been unwilling to take the time to penetrate the computer each time it needed a particular item of information .  so it had delegated certain groups of robots to research and store information in certain peripheral fields .  bogie was part of the popular culture through the universe team  while timestep had belonged to the group studying performance arts .  other groups had specialized in such areas as sociology  psychology  and economics  all fields that the watchful eye rarely needed now for its running of the city  but might require in the future .  whenever it did need an item of knowledge from one of these teams  it requested it via comlink  and the robot who had specialized in the requested category would respond with a useful precis of the topic .   some of the robots  like bogie and timestep  had immersed themselves so thoroughly in their areas of expertise that they had developed very peculiar characteristics related to their new found knowledge .  bogie had adopted certain attitudes and in some cases actual dialogue from the old earth movies he had been assigned  while a similar robotic pathology had affected timestep in a more physical way .  although timestep was less obsessional than bogie  he had nevertheless acquired a need to perform the dances he researched .  perhaps he had watched too many recordings in hyperwave and old style technologies of dancing through the ages .  part of his research had included a precise examination of the anatomical requirements for good dancing  and he had soon begun to try out the terpsichorean movements themselves .  at one time or another he had executed steps for various types of ballet and popular dancing .  lately he had centered his interest on tap dancing .  whatever movements he attempted  the watchful eye knew  would appear terribly awkward when compared to the recordings of old dancers  but there was at least a kind of achievement in the clunkily graceful and more or less accurate way he danced .   timestep was dancing now  as he followed derec down city streets .  mostly he was doing something called the soft shoe  with an occasional foray into buck and wing .   bogie   s message had stated that derec intended to inspect the central core computer .  the watchful eye would have to seal itself in its hiding place .  to throw the intruder off guard  it would also supply some other surprises .     eve was not certain what to look for .  she wanted to know more about the tiny creatures  and so she searched for signs of their existence the way a hunter sought the spoor of the animal he was tracking .   there were traces .  the more she looked  the more she refined her own tracking abilities  seeing clues that might have been ordinarily overlooked .  near a gutter  where   in a normally functioning city   it would have been swept away into the sewer system  she found a coat  so small she could barely hold it between her fingertips .  there was a barely discernible piping around the coat   s collar in delicate golden stitches .  short lived or not  these creatures picked up some skills along the way .   in a corner of a doorway  she discovered some food crumbs .  derec or ariel would never have perceived them  because they looked so much like dust that had been neglected by the now inefficient sanitation robots .   eve went through a half open doorway into the building  where she saw that a colony of the creatures had indeed once inhabited the place .  they had apparently moved on  leaving behind many clues  artifacts of their existence .  she was particularly taken with a small metal unit evidently used for cooking .  there was a tiny pile of ash beneath its lower grating that indicated some substance was bummed there to give off cooking heat .   leaving the building  she walked a long way before encountering any more clues .  she passed several of the city   s robots  many of whom seemed to be  like her  wandering aimlessly .  when she tried to address them to ask them about the tiny creatures  they kept babbling about blocked information .  some of the robots passed by her without even responding to her .   dawn came to robot city  and the place quickly got lighter .  bright rays reflected off the metal sides of buildings .  eve was dazzled by the sudden intensity of the light .  it must be different here  she thought  from ordinary human cities  where there might not be so many clear bright surfaces for sunlight to bounce off .   as she passed by a spherical building  she heard a mournful noise that reminded her of the wailing in the vacant lot .  she stopped and listened at the building   s door .  there were more sounds  faint and muffled  that seemed like the voices of the tiny creatures .  she pushed the door open .  it stuck less than halfway  but she managed to push herself through the narrow opening .   she entered a lobby that  like most robot city rooms  was decorated with some hope of eventual human habitation .  an ornate desk was strategically placed in its center and there were many pictures on the walls .  she inspected the pictures  but they meant nothing to her .  there was so little in her experience that she could apply to the viewing of any scene .  a couple of the pictures presented recognizable activity  but in the main they were unusual colors set in unusual patterns .   walking across a deep piled rug whose configurations were mazelike but colorful  she approached the desk .  she noticed that the legs of the desk were shaped like claws  making her think for a moment that the desk had feet that clutched the rug .  strange  she thought  why would anyone want to carve an animal   s foot on a piece of furniture .  further  no line of the desk was straight  another design feature that seemed unnecessary to her .  there were curves  inset grooves  knot holes  many shapes she did not even recognize .   but it was the top surface of the desk that really caught her attention .  kneeling on it  in a circle  was a group of the tiny creatures  all facing inward .  they held hands and made soft  moaning sounds .  in the circle   s center  a delicately formed young female swayed  her movements apparently guided by tone changes in the group   s moaning .  when their sound increased  her body began to jerk violently .  when they became softer  grace returned to her gestures .   eve put her hands on the desk so that she could lean down and look closer  but her quick movement alerted the group to her presence .  the ones facing her looked up at her  while the others twisted around to see her .   breaking handholds  they started scattering to all sides of the desktop .  directly opposite her  eve saw the top of a small ladder  that apparently led down to the seat of a plain chair behind the desk .  none of the group went to the ladder  however .  when they had gone as far as they could  standing with their heels right on the edge of the desktop  they stood tensely .  they trembled  as if willing to jump off should eve get any nearer to them .  only the young female who had been in the circle   s center remained in place .  she stared up at eve with curiosity .      who are you .     eve asked .  her words seemed unnaturally loud as they traveled around the room and discovered echoes of themselves .   there was no response .  a skinny little male on one side made a broad hand gesture to a female across the way  but eve could not discern what it meant .  she decided they could not understand her words .   a better idea  she thought  would be to make a sign of peace .  moving her hand slowly  she laid it in an open area of the desktop  palm up  fingers open .  there was another flurry of fear among the creatures at the desk   s fringes  but the leader  after a moment of consideration  strode confidently forward and  climbing into eve   s palm between her thumb and index finger  walked slowly around the center of her hand .  once she knelt down and felt eve   s malleable metal skin .  the female stroked it several times  as if concerned with its texture  then studied her own skin  clearly comparing it to eve   s and perhaps wondering why hers was so much softer and more pliable .   when she was through with her inspection  the tiny female sat down in the center of eve   s palm and looked calmly up at her .  eve interpreted this as a signal that it was all right to lift her hand off the desk and hold the female aloft .   bringing her hand close to her eyes  eve examined the little creature .  she was quite slim  with delicate limbs and very small hands and feet .  her clothing was colorful  with an intricate design  leaves interweaving .  there were buttons going down the back of her one piece garment  and she wore a cloth belt at a slight tilt at her waist .  her round face was as delicate as the rest of her .  a bit of a nose  a narrow line of a mouth  eyes like little dots .  her hair was long and wavy .  she obviously spent some time grooming it .  how could these people not be intelligent  eve wondered  especially if they could make themselves clothing and take such care of their appearance .   down below  the ones who had scattered now came close together again .  they stood in a group and looked up in awe at eve   s scrutinization of one of their own .  she noted that they  too  were carefully dressed and groomed .      now i   m going to put you down     eve said  modulating her voice so that it was quite low .  again she put her hand on the desktop and held it there while the female slowly  almost casually  got off .  she went back to her group that had not stirred this time when eve rested her hand on the desktop .   eve was not sure what to do next .  as the tiny figures gazed up at her  and she down at them  they seemed in a standoff .      eve     adam said .  he had entered the room and now stood a few meters behind her .     what is this .      she explained about her search and how she had found this small band moaning in their odd circle .      it could be a religious ceremony     he commented .     the group were at prayer  perhaps .         you might be right .  they seemed to be imploring  or perhaps mourning .         you   re interested in them  i see .         as a study  yes .  they are strange to me .         are you sure  a study .  there seems to be something more to it .         what .         you seem to care about them .         are we capable of caring .         i   m not sure .         neither am i .         ariel sent me to find you .  she has set up headquarters at a place they call the human medical facility .  she dismissed the robots who were stationed there because they did not respond properly .  now she is trying to extract information from a computer devoted to medical data .  she is cursing often because it is malfunctioning or has been tampered with .  i am to bring you back there with me .         why .         my opinion is that she wants to keep track of us .  derec has put her in charge while he tackles the problems of the city   s systems .         what if we do not choose to be in her charge .  should she necessarily have dominion over us .         mistress ariel appeared to believe you should be kept out of trouble .         she is so sure i will get into trouble .         it seems so .         what is the logic of that .         it is not necessary to analyze it .         i would like to .      eve glanced down at the desktop .  the little creatures there were conferring among themselves .  their chattering sounds could barely be heard  but they seemed to contain more agitation than meaning .      adam .         yes .         let   s bring them with us .         that is unnec           it is for research  adam .  we need to discover more in our quest to define humanity .  they may help .      she reached her hand toward the group  intending to pick up a couple of its members as delicately as she could .  but the fear returned to their eyes  and they began to scatter .      no     she said .  carefully modulating her voice so that it took on a humanlike  soothing gentleness .     i win not harm you .  adam  is there something here we can carry them in .      he scanned the room .     i see no container of any kind .         then we will carry them on this desk .         eve  they could falloff .         we will walk slowly .        only avery saw them carry the desk slowly through the city streets .  he hadn   t usually paid much attention to furniture moving robots on spacer planets .  with their strength and meticulous sense of caution  they were expert at it  able to keep their load level  never bumping the item against anything  and delivering it undamaged .   it seemed to him that robots regularly performed miracles  as a matter of course .  in fact  he thought  only robots could perform miracles nowadays .  whatever capacity humans may have had for such feats was long gone .   the more he watched robots in general  the more he knew he needed to become one .  and he would .  he could feel himself transform more and more into a robot as the days went by .  he had convinced himself there were microprocessors in all his limbs and that his senses were now controlled by sensory circuits .  all he needed was the positronic brain .  that would come  he was sure .  he would find a way to turn the inefficient lump in his head to a perfectly functioning  spongelike  positronic entity .   in a dim back part of his mind  he recalled an old earth story where a primitive robot had wanted a human heart put inside his body so he could be more human .  of course  he really wanted human emotion .  a useless prize if there ever was one  avery thought .  the story was so vague in his memory that he could not remember whether the robot had gotten a heart .  probably it had .  earth stories could be dreadfully sentimental about such things .   he did not .  of course  know it .  but timestep could dance a musical number from a film adaptation of that story .  and bogie could have told him how the tale came out .    as avery moved closer to the desk toting robots  he noticed the living creatures cowering at the center of the desktop .  they seemed puzzled by the city  as if they thought they had passed over into another dimension .   his excitement grew as he saw how nicely formed these tiny humans or androids were .  they might be just the experimental rats he needed .  the body he   d taken from the vacant lot had been too decayed by the time he   d carried it to his laboratory several levels beneath the city .   he had been able to put it through only a few tests before discarding it .  under a microscope scanner he saw that a simple microchip had been implanted in its brain and that there appeared to be patterns of circuitry that might control the body   s movements  the way a puppetmaster gave false life to the wooden figures attached to strings .   however  nothing was conclusive .  the creatures did not appear all that robotic  either .  he suspected they had been genetically engineered  then activated by the implanted technology .  at any rate  he was certain they were not actual laboratory grown humans .  no  they were more like dolls  formed from genetic materials but given a kind of life through robotic means .  it was even possible they had a minimal awareness .   he had to find more specimens and had been seeking them out when he saw derec   s odd robots taking that desk down a robot city street .  the runty creatures on the desktop were the specimens he needed .   the robots were of special interest to him  also .  he had recognized immediately  when he saw them back at the vacant lot  that they had not been constructed from his own designs .  they were definitely not avery robots .  where had they come from  and whose design were they .   avery nearly laughed from happiness .   derec would certainly have been surprised to know that his father could actually laugh .   there was much to study here  and he was never happier than when he was engaged in theorizing or conducting experiments .     watching avery watch the robots  who  in this chain of spying  were keeping a close watch on their diminutive charges   the watchful eye was puzzled by the new turn of events .  how  it wondered  did avery keep appearing from out of nowhere .  he seemed to have an uncommon knowledge of the labyrinthine routes through the city and particularly of the hiding places that removed him from the watchful eye   s surveillance .   and why were the new arrivals carrying a desk .  and what were the experimental subjects  from series c  batch     doing on top of the desk .   too many mysteries  too much disorder .   it seemed as if derec and his cohorts had  since their arrival in robot city  thrown much of what the watchful eye had done into confusion .  they had  in fact  become a serious threat to his domain .  it believed it should just eliminate them    but it could not .  that was also a mystery to it .  what was it that held it back from simply disposing of the intruders .   it sometimes appeared that it  too  had to respond to the demands of first law  just the way a robot might .  but it could not be a robot  it was sure of that .  robots could not do what it could do .  also  it knew it was different from the so called humans who were now interfering with his design .  it could not be a human  either .   there was a sound outside the computer chamber .  it reassembled itself and waited for derec to enter .     chapter     counterpoints    ariel slammed her fist against the keyboard  making it bounce and slide backward .     there   s no help in this frosted computer     she yelled .     it isn   t functioning any better than anything else around here .      wolruf  who had been reacquainting herself with the layout of the medical facility  studying scanning systems and trays of medical instruments  came to ariel and asked     iss something wrrong .      her gentle tone and phrasing calmed ariel down .  wolruf   s kindness  as well as her directness  would always make her a good friend .      something   s wrong  all right .  i ask this computer for suggestions on how to treat avery  and it tells me to give him two aspirins and put him to bed .      wolruf squinted at the screen .     doess it rreally rrecommend that .  perhapss           no  wolruf  it didn   t say that in so many words .  it   s just that no matter how hard i try to track a hypothesis  the computer leads me to a dead end or loops me back to some sector i   ve already seen .  all of its essential information has apparently been cached away somewhere in inaccessible data banks .      ariel was about to turn back to the computer and fight the damned machine again when an abrupt sound from outside the room startled her .  wolruf   s head turned toward the noise .      what was that .     ariel said  standing up  looking around for a weapon to use to repel invasion .      someone iss outside     wolruf said  wrinkling her nose .   the noises on the other side of the door did sound something like footsteps  ariel thought  but of someone moving very slowly and with a very heavy tread .  she nodded to wolruf  signalling her to open the door while ariel moved to the other side  ready to react to an attack if it came .   when the door opened  it revealed a somewhat bent adam silverside  his back to the room  his arms clutching his end of a desk that would have sold for a pretty penny back on aurora .  ariel had seen one like it in her mother   s home  and juliana welsh bought only the most expensive items .  her money went into self indulgent luxuries or to finance fanatics with crazy schemes  like dr .  avery and his grand city forming experiment .   as ariel went to the doorway  she saw eve on the other end of the desk  standing straight on a lower stair and holding her end of the piece of furniture aloft .  they smoothly eased the desk into the room and gently set it on the floor .  for the first time ariel saw the group of tiny people on the desk   s surface .      where   d you find these .     she asked .  eve told her about her adventures in exploring the city .      are they the same as the ones in the vacant lot .     she asked eve .      we cannot be certain     eve replied .     perhaps you could help us figure that out .      ariel smiled .     god     she said     just what i need .  another impossible problem dumped in my lap .     she saw that eve was about to speak and anticipated her .     no  i know that you have dumped nothing in my lap .  we humans have some outlandish ways of phrasing our thoughts  especially when we are miserable .  no  eve  i am not miserable  i am just exaggerating .  and i   ll explain the virtues of exaggeration to you some other time  thank you very much .      on the desktop the tiny figures were surveying the room .  there was a strange sadness in their eyes  as if they saw at once that there was no easy escape    derec had not been near the central core of the computer for some time .  it had changed in some way  but he was not sure how .  still encased in thick transparent plastic  the intricate mechanisms inside looked like the work of several abstract expressionists painting in a number of styles .  it definitely did not look like the workings of a computer .   he walked to the side of the shell and put his fingertips against its surface .  they came away with a thin layer of dust on them .  he scowled  puzzled but   with everything else that had been going wrong   not surprised .  before  this environment had always been kept pristine .  there had been robots housed here whose only job was maintenance .  where were they now .   walking around the enormous chamber  he found several small floor level robot niches meant for the kind of function robots that computer room janitors were .  some of them still had maintenance robots snuggled inside  but clearly they were now inoperative .  if he had had time  he would have scheduled them for repair  but the repair shops were no doubt just as inoperative at present .  functionless cleaning robots would have to wait their turn in the line of the many anomalies to be dealt with .   returning to mandelbrot  he held up his dirty fingertips without speaking .  behind mandelbrot  bogie and timestep stood silently .  well  not completely silent .  timestep   s toes beat out a soft slow tap rhythm on the metal flooring .   pointing toward the computer  derec said     well  guys  i   m going inside .  you wait here  but if you sense me in any trouble  remember the first law .         you need not remind me     mandelbrot said .      i know  i know .  sorry if i hurt you .         how could you hurt me .  that is outside the           i spoke out of turn .  just give me good backup  hear .      without waiting for any of the robots to question his colloquially expressed order  derec walked up the steps to the platform that led to the computer chamber entrance and pushed a red button set in the door .  fortunately  the button still worked  and the door slid open .   the button was the only mechanism that did work  however .  after he went through the doorway  the heat lamps did not come on  the sprayers did not send a full body spray of compressed air over his body to remove dust .  he would have to enter the chamber in a contaminated state .  that probably didn   t matter  since from all evidence the chamber was probably contaminated already .   in order for him to enter farther  the wall in front of him should slide open .  with nothing working right  it of course did not .  he recalled  however  that there was a manual override located just beside the outer door .  he had to fumble around in the dark for a moment to find out .  when he did  it at least worked .  the wall slid open .   now he entered what to him seemed like a shadowy world .  in the dimness the computer   s shapes  he recalled circuitry  microprocessors  tubing  synapse wiring and other electronic marvels from his first visit here  seemed ghostly  unreal .  he needed light .  the manual override for the inner room functions was nearby  he knew  and he groped for it .  before he found it  his hand briefly brushed against the outside of the watchful eye   s haven  which it had reshaped into an innocent looking storage cabinet  a good disguise as long as the human did not decide to inspect its contents .  although detecting the touch  it felt no danger yet from derec and remained still .   derec   s manipulation of the override produced only partial light  but enough to see that not only was the main computer malfunctioning  it appeared to be covered with a strange kind of dark green moss .   the watchful eye perceived the bitterness in derec   s whispered curse .  it had known the moss  even if it had been conceived on the spur of the moment  had been a good idea .     bogie wished he could discuss his dilemma with timestep but they could not converse privately  either out loud or by comlink  because of the presence of mandelbrot .  he had no way of knowing whether or not mandelbrot could eavesdrop in either way  but there was no point in taking a chance .   the problem that bogie felt just now had to do with allegiance .  he sensed that the watchful eye was close by  somewhere inside the transparent shell  perhaps near derec .  if one of them were to attack the other  what would be his duty .  he wondered .  his allegiance had been to the watchful eye until the arrival of derec and the others .  the first law said to protect the human  but would that interfere with his loyalty to the watchful eye .  it would help if bogie had actually seen the watchful eye  who said it was human  yet did not act especially human and never referred to itself as of masculine or feminine gender .  if it were human  had it displaced derec in robot city   s ruling hierarchy .  could he allow derec to harm the watchful eye .  must he come to derec   s defense if the watchful eye attacked him .   considering orders did not help .  derec   s order to come in an emergency was recent  while the watchful eye   s command for dutiful obedience had been in effect for some time now .   the only thing to do  bogie decided  was to hope that real life was not like the movies  where so often violent activity preceded the peaceful finale .  he had no desire at this moment to cut to the chase .     the creatures had seemed to calm down after ariel had approached them .  she had drawn a chair up to the desk  keeping her hands safely out of sight  and talked to them .  her words didn   t matter  she had known that .  what language they had was their own .  whoever had created them had neglected to program any known language into them  perhaps on purpose .   now they sat in a semicircle facing ariel  seeming to listen to and understand her gently told version of cinderella  a tale she embellished with some ancient auroran variations .  cinderella became relegated to the management of the household robots  since no auroran performed menial scullery tasks   and the glass slipper was replaced by a personal robot left behind at the ball .  the prince   s emissary had been instructed to examine how the robot reacted to the maidens of the land .  when it came to the mysterious  pretty woman who had danced with the prince  the emissary would be able to tell by the robot   s response that this was she .  one of the ugly stepsisters nearly fooled the emissary  the robot  having been part of the household  did respond efficiently to others in it   but then cinderella swept in and the emissary could tell by the promptness with which it went to her that the pretty maiden dressed so much more plainly than her stepsisters was indeed the beautiful woman in the lavish gown of the previous night .   standing on the other side of the desk  the silversides and wolruf were also entranced by ariel   s version of the tale  although eve had to ask frequent questions of adam that he could not answer .  she decided that the fairy godmother must be  like them  a shape changer  and that was why she could do such marvelous things with pumpkins and farm animals .   ariel came to the end of her story and was about to say that the prince and cinderella lived happily ever after  but she thought of the questions that the silversides might ask her  especially about how a human pair could possibly live forever  even if they were long lived aurorans  and she swallowed the phrase and merely said that everything went nicely for the happy couple for the next few decades .   when she stopped speaking  the tiny people looked eagerly at her  as if they wanted more .  however  now that she had settled their anxieties  it was time to find out something more about them .  but what .  she had in front of her a bunch of minuscule human beings  apparently sentient  possibly  if avery was right  android in nature  essentially a sophisticated version of the kind of mechanical toys she had played with as a child .  should she see if they could playa tin drum or walk stiff legged like tin soldiers .  eve had said she had observed dancing in the ones at the vacant lot  and that this group had been performing some kind of ceremony .   ceremony  that was the key .  whatever life they had  whatever    civilization    they could develop in their short lives  it seemed that it all was tied in with ceremony .   carefully putting her hand down on the desk at a sufficient distance from where the group was gathered  ariel began to trace out a small circle with the tip of her index finger .  she hummed an old melody  a song about a woman whose lover kept going off to war  was eventually killed  then returned to her as a ghost .  it had a plaintive sound  she knew  even when sung in her slightly out of tune voice .   at first the group merely watched ariel   s finger move around  then the leader stood up and made authoritative gestures to her followers .  joining her  they clasped hands  formed a circle  and began to dance around  slowly  to the rhythm of ariel   s tune .  tears came to ariel   s eyes as she watched them dance gracefully and with more than a touch of elegance .  it was beautiful  both the dance itself and the fact that they had understood her so quickly and easily .   she stopped tracing the circle and lifted her hand from the desktop .  a moment later the dancers halted  too  looking up expectantly at ariel  who nodded and returned her hand to the desk  this time tracing out a figure eight with her finger .  she moved her finger faster  and hummed a quicker tempoed song  one about the happiness of frolicking in auroran woods .   the auroran songs made her feel nostalgic for her home  and briefly she wondered when she would ever return there .  the way things were going  she might live the rest of her life confronting danger with derec and desiring a more peaceful time with him .    the dancers reformed themselves into a line .  with the leader in front  they began a quite lovely quickstep dance following the figure eight with more precision than ariel could with her finger .  tears now fell from her eyes  and eve noticed them .      what is it  mistress ariel .  are you injured .      ariel was touched by eve   s first law reaction .     no  i   m fine .  i   ve always done this   bawled like a baby when i see anything done with any artistry .  i mean  this is almost like dancing  ballet even  the way they move so delicately .  sometimes people think i   m reacting with sentimentality  but that   s not it at all .  it   s just the way i respond to the beauty of it  even more the fact that such beauty is possible .  maybe it   s a kind of sentimentality  but it comes from admiration and not from tender feelings .  you don   t understand very much of this  do you  eve .         no  i do not .         nor do i     dr .  avery said  stepping out   as usual   without warning from a hiding place .  he had stepped through the doorway  which had been left open after the silversides brought the desk through it .  ariel was so startled she didn   t know what to say  although she was already calculating how to make him stay so she could  as ordered  try to cure him .      if there is anything to your theories of art  ariel  or to anybody   s theories  for that matter  it is not in intakes of breath at seeing something well performed or sighs of admiration at a work well executed .  but that is unimportant to me  actually  since i don   t believe there is anything to theories of art .  i believe imagination is a curse  unless it is used for applied science .  works of art are garbage unless they demonstrate a useful theorem .      ariel  recalling lucius   s sculpture called    circuit breaker     the one authentic piece of art produced by a robot city robot  and the doctor   s hatred of it  knew that avery was speaking the truth .  he truly despised artistic creations .      was not that idea once called utilitarianism .     eve asked .   avery seemed impressed .     my  she does look amazingly like you  ariel  doesn   t she .  and is  perhaps  smarter .  at any rate  that ancient philosophy  utilitarianism  does perhaps vaguely resemble the assumptions behind what i said .          he walked to the edge of the desk and stared down at the tiny figures .  when he had started speaking and ariel had stopped singing  they had ended their dancing .  now  they looked up at avery .  fear had returned to their faces .      i can see why playing with them made you feel like god  my dear     he said .      i never said it did .         oh  but i could see a godlike look in your face .  you were looking for ways to send down tablets from the mountain or part a body of water for them  were you not .         no  i was not .         i wasn   t speaking literally .  but i think you   re trying to establish a relationship with them that is godlike  studying them and finding ways to improve their meager existence .         i requested mistress ariel to study them     eve said .      is that so .  you continue to amaze me  what   s your name  eve .  you are quite a feat of robotics .  while we   re on the subject of gods  who made you .         i do not know that .         some fancy piece of programming blocking out the information .         no     adam interjected .     we do not know our makers .  each of us appeared on a planet in an egglike  embryonic form with no awareness of where we came from .         embryonic .  how did you come to look as you do now .  derec and ariel did not cause you to be formed in  as it were  their own images .         we imprinted on them and thus resemble them .  i have been many other forms .      avery was impressed .     hmmm  i must pursue all this with you soon  but one experiment at a time .  i try not to divide my concentration .  it   s destructive to my work .  and my work at present is these well made little toys .  i need one to take apart and find out what makes it tick .         don   t be callous     ariel said angrily .     you can   t just take one of these and kill it .         that   s exactly what i plan to do .  how are we to discover anything about them otherwise .     he looked around the room .     and this place is ideal  with all the right tools for dissection .  i won   t waste time by returning to           no .     ariel shouted .     you can   t do it .  i won   t let you .         my dear  your tears were sentimental enough .  forget any gallant defenses of these things .  they are merely mechanical devices .  fairly sophisticated ones  yes  but           can   t you see .  look at them .  they are sentient human beings .      ariel   s dislike of avery had made her choose one side of the issue when  only moments ago  she had been contemplating just the point of view that the doctor was now suggesting .      not at all .  they are  i am certain  genetically engineered experimental figures .  some miniaturized human cells have been grown to form an incredibly accurate framework but they are not alive .         they danced .  they communicated with me .         i am sure they make decent substitutes for pets  but what you saw was the result of some impulses of cybernetic origin .         i don   t care what the hell is inside them or even if they were made in a lab .  they are real people with a genuine culture .         just some anthropological factors put into the design .      moving quickly  avery reached down and picked up one of the figures  a chubby man with puffy cheeks .  it began squirming in his hand  while the others scattered across the desktop .     derec wondered why  at a time like this  he so often felt a need to use a personal .  there were none here at the computer center .  there was no need for one  since humans did not generally come here .  he would have to ascend to the surface to find one  they were in almost all robot city buildings   but when he got there he no doubt would find out that all the personals were  like the rest of the city   s systems  out of order .  and he dreaded even imagining what a non working personal would be like .   tentatively he touched a shard of the hanging moss .  he was surprised to find it smooth instead of slimy  dry and not wet .  it   s fake  he thought  but why would anyone make fake moss and hang it on a computer in big bunches like this .      this part   s definitely out     he said out loud .     maybe i can juice it up .      he looked around for a typer  the kind of keyboard designed to communicate with the core computer .  there was a bank of view screens along one wall  but all the keyboards had been removed .      it would take somebody to disconnect them     he said .     no computer could do this to itself .  somebody   s monkeying with things .  but who .  if not my father  who .  there   s got to be somebody i don   t know about .      as he said this  he leaned against the hiding place of the watchful eye  who might have been amused by the irony of derec   s words if it had comprehended irony .  it studied derec closely  the haven did not block out sensory information   discovering much about him that it had not perceived when observing him through the city   s spy systems .  there was apparently a musky odor to his body  perhaps caused by the fact that he had not had time to bathe since arriving on the planet .  since none of the spray bathers worked  the chances were that derec would get muskier .   and there was a surprising heft to the young man .  he was thicker than he   d appeared  and inside the thickness  there was much more concentrated weight .  derec   s outer shell  what they called skin  was more softly textured than had been expected  at least by the watchful eye  who up till now had been knowledgeable only about the hard surfaces of robots .   it was tempted to reveal itself but was taken aback by derec   s sudden curse .  the man ran to the center of the room and looked up   where the watchful eye had hung the keyboards in clumps around cables .  there were three clumps  all looking like some odd kind of fruit .   derec  swinging around  appeared to address his words to the ceiling .     what   s going on around here .  who are you  you filthy frosted bag of sewage waste .     the watchful eye wondered why derec   s words made no sense .  there had been nothing filthy in the sewer he had traveled through  and sewage waste might indeed be a compliment .     why are you doing this .  why are you turning my city into a pesthole .      it was amazed by derec   s anger .  while that was supposed to be a human characteristic  derec nevertheless had not seemed the type to lose his composure .  now his face was quite red  and his body was trembling .   it longed for derec to leave so that it could restore its haven to its normal shape  slip it into the compartment fashioned behind the wall  where he normally kept it  and shut out robot city for a while .  it had to calculate its next moves  and whether they   d be directed against derec or elsewhere .  it could not harm derec or any of his companions  nor could it  under most circumstances  injure any of the city   s robots .  but it could destroy the city  it thought .  it only needed a rationale to begin the process .     as soon as avery picked up the tiny creature  ariel leaped toward him .  but she was not quick enough .  eve got to avery first .  she grabbed him from behind and forced his arm slowly down until he released his captive .  when the small man had run back to his companions  eve let avery go .   he whirled upon her  fury in his eyes .      how dare you attack me .         first law     she replied .     your actions were going to result in the death of the human in your hand .         but that is not a human being .  it is an android  a robot like yourself .         that may be true  but it has not been proven .  i see a human being .  i must not allow him to come to harm .  and  sir  wouldn   t third law also be applicable to these circumstances .         how .         if the being is  like us  a robot  then shouldn   t we protect our own from harm as we would ourselves .      ariel might have been mistaken  but she thought that or .  avery nearly choked with rage at eve   s question .  at any rate  he did not respond immediately .  he merely stared at eve  the way he might have if a peer had asked the question .      where in blazes did you get that idea .     he finally asked .      it seems natural to me .      avery seemed stumped for a moment  then he addressed eve slowly and methodically     eve  you and adam are expensive pieces of merchandise .  there is no need for you to endanger yourself when a human   s safety is not involved .  that is what the third law is about .  it is not about a community of robots evolving a set of ethics based on this law .  you do not  i repeat  do not  have a duty to protect your own as you would yourselves .          i am not certain about that     adam said  coming forward .     especially since many robotic matters are different for us  for eve and i .  to our knowledge  we are the only beings like us .  when a function robot is deactivated  there are many other function robots to take its place .  if the very existence of either of us is threatened  i believe it the responsibility of the other to perform any act that would protect us .      avery smiled .     that   s almost theological  adam .  you seem to see yourself almost as a separate species  committed to preserve your kind as well as yourself .         perhaps     adam said .     i believe you may be right  but as yet i don   t know why .         we don   t really know who we are  what we are     eve said .     it may be that the three laws are not the only ones that apply to us  or that our existence may depend on a different way of interpreting them .      avery shook his head several times in confusion .  at the same time  ariel noted  there was some admiration for the silversides in his eyes .      you   re verging on existentialism  eve     he said .     but i think you   re dead wrong .  look  humans have a history to preserve  science and philosophy to transmit through generations .  they have to be concerned with protecting other humans from harm .  they have vital reasons to  even if many of them  perhaps a majority  show no inclination toward such selfless activity .  as robots  adam and eve  your only real duty is to protect the investment .  no sense in letting yourselves be destroyed unnecessarily .  but you have no reason to identify yourselves with anything more than that  not a higher calling or some set of philosophical speculations  especially some sort of ethical idea about being the protectors of each other .  the important matter is that you harmed me when you should not have .         you were in no harm  and the little man was     eve said .      all right  all right .  i vow to you then  i intend no harm to this tiny creature you fancy so much .  the laws do not apply to this situation  understand .      eve and adam were not sure what to do .  it seemed that the doctor   s vow prevented them from moving against him .  yet .  .  . even if he handled the tiny creature gently now  would the future harm he might cause it in his laboratory be sufficient reason to intervene .   as avery made another move toward the table  ariel stepped forward  a surgical knife in her hand .     but i  because there are no effective laws of humanics  may stop you  dr .  avery .         and i     wolruf said     can act without rrestrrictionss  since i am neitherr  rrobot nor    uman  and there are no lawss of caninoidss .      avery looked from ariel to wolruf  then to the two robots .  a smile flashed briefly across his face .  it was a clue to a smile rather than a smile itself .  then he pulled a straight chair away from the nearest wall and sat down hard .      why am i even arguing with you .     he said in a soft  troubled voice .     i   m not a human .  i   ve transformed myself into a robot .      ariel started to say that that was just his madness  then an idea came to her .     it   s worked  has it .  you   ve got a positronic brain and all the rest .         of course     he muttered .      then  as a robot  you must obey me  a human .  correct .         what are you   i   ll never   i can   t        all the anger seemed to go out of his eyes  and he slumped in his chair .     yes     he muttered .     i must obey you .  second law .  i will obey you .  .  . mistress ariel .      ariel rubbed her hands together .  she didn   t know how long she could work this new ploy  but it gave her an opportunity to use the doctor for both her projects .  his great intelligence could help her to study the tiny creatures  and toying with his delusions might be the answer to curing them .      sit straight  doc   wait  what is your name now .      he looked up at her with sad eyes and said weakly     name .         do you have a robot name .  have you chosen one yet .      he seemed momentarily puzzled by her questions .      yes  i have     he said .     just now .         and what is it .         ozymandias .         very good .  that   s the name of a poem  isn   t it .         yes .  it   s about a once mighty king  a    king of kings .     on the pedestal of its statue are inscribed the words     look on my works  ye mighty  and despair .             how nice .  you don   t mean them ironically  i hope .  well  i haven   t despaired yet  and neither should you .  that  by the way  is an order  ozymandias .         yes  mistress ariel .         okay  let   s get to work .  i   m not sure where to start .        derec came out of the computer chamber with a hangdog look on his face .     the computer   s been severely tampered with  mandelbrot     he said .     we   ve got a pack of work to do .         yes  sir .  i will help .         thank you .  let   s go .      after derec had taken a few steps  bogie called to him     what about us  master derec .  what should we do .      derec resisted an offensive answer and said instead     do you have anything to do at this moment .      the watchful eye had given the two robots no further orders  so bogie could truthfully say     no .         well  then  i guess the two of you have danced and wisecracked yourselves right into my heart .  why don   t you tag along .  that is  come with us .         i know what    tag along    means     bogie said  and derec wondered if there wasn   t a suggestion of huffiness in the robot   s reply .     chapter     frustrations    avery itched to grab one of the tiny creatures  whom ariel was now calling    the dancers     and take it apart under a microscopic scanner with a selection of the fine surgical instruments available in the medical facility .  however  since ariel forbade that any harm should come to the dancers  the dissection would be a violation of second law  and he must not violate second law .  she still claimed it would also be a violation of first law because of the essential humanity of the dancers  but he rejected that preposterous idea out of hand .    sometimes  in the back of his mind  he almost remembered he was really human and not subject to ariel   s orders .  at those moments his hands automatically reached toward the nearest dancer  and his fingers trembled .    on her part ariel felt as if she were swimming from one whirlpool to another .  each whirlpool was a different task  a different goal .  at the center of one was avery  who was acting crazier by the minute .  the dancers  occupying her dreams as well as her daily routine  swirled in the middle of another .  the third contained adam and eve  who  although themselves quite fascinated by the dancers  were still unpredictable and often disobedient .  the previous day she had caught them trying to teach the dancers acrobatics .  eve picked up one  a male  and  keeping him firmly but gently between her fingers  tried to show him how to execute a series of midair flips .  the little creature was obviously frightened  even though he did not struggle .  the dancers  avery suggested  treated their captors as gods and cooperated with any foolish things a god might try  no matter how dangerous .   it seemed that the silversides would do anything to sidestep an order from ariel .  they had apparently never resolved the dilemma of whether or not derec and ariel were humans or if they were the proper kinds of humans  those for whom their mysterious and vague programming had been set .  they knew they were supposed to serve humans and imprint themselves upon them  but had been given no guidelines about what a human was and how to recognize one .  they were frequently puzzled by the behavior of derec and ariel  and  for that matter  the insanely contradictory actions of avery   and had trouble convincing themselves to accept these particular humans as representative of the highest order of being in the universe .   earlier in his existence  adam had believed the blackbodies to be more intelligent than the humans he had encountered up to that time  and eve had accepted the word of a demented blackbody that it was the only human in the galaxy .  their mistakes were just as responsible for making them cautious as were their doubts about derec  avery  and ariel .   in a way  they were searching for some higher kind of human  dismissing derec and ariel as  like the dancers  some primitive and unworthy form of the species  not worthy of their loyalty and obedience .  as a result  sometimes they responded like any robots to the requirements of the laws of robotics  but at other times  questioned every word of an order  or analyzed a first law situation so interminably that ariel or derec would have died before the silversides had stopped them from coming to harm .  and sometimes they were just plain ornery  rejecting orders without rhyme or reason  as if they just meant to taunt her .   ariel had decided to treat them as if they were human and subject to human weaknesses .  if they were being obedient  she gave them orders .  if they were not  she ignored them .   there was enough to do without pampering them .     today adam and eve were relatively docile .  eve  especially  tended to be cooperative when ariel was working with the dancers .  she would stand beside the desk and study them with the same intensity that ariel showed  and often looking exactly like her  a state that ariel found unnerving  . when the dancers needed to be fed  eve even volunteered to do it .  she would take a dancer and hold it in her hand  then put some food on the fingers of her other hand while each dancer picked the crumbs off her fingertip and ate them with evident enjoyment .  the dancers always ate in a specific order  the leader first  an urge for order that ariel believed proved their essential humanity .   she had worked out a proper diet for the dancers through the use of the chemical food processor  trying out various dishes until she found some they would accept .  she was glad that derec had chosen to fix the foodmaking machines early in his repairing of the city   s systems .  it had come second  right after getting the personals operative again .      can we make them play the game again .     eve asked ariel  after the last dancer had taken the last crumb from her fingertip .      you bet .  it represents about all the progress i   ve made with them .      avery  who had been sulking in a corner  guarded by wolruf because he had already made four tries to escape   came forward to speak to ariel   s back .      of course you   ve made no progress .  there   s so little to be made .  if you would only let me at them .  .  .         swallow the words  ozymandias .  i won   t permit you to murder these           but it wouldn   t be murder .  they are no more than toys .  they are not even miniature frankenstein monsters or golems  they are merely mechanical devices .  mistress ariel  way back in earth history there were many manmade contraptions that fooled others into believing they were actual living beings or even miracles .  there was a mechanical duck that would not only appear to eat and quack but would even excrete materials from its nether end .  there was a chess playing robot that convincingly won games from masters .  a small figure with a quill pen that could laboriously but correctly write a letter  a companion piece that could draw kings and ships .  there were figures whose movements were lifelike  who even appeared to breathe .  milkmaids swinging pails and mountaineers in alpenstock hats emerged from clocks  appearing very real .  in more sophisticated times  people found the early robots  machines that couldn   t really do very much  quite amazing and lifelike .  so you see  ariel  your desktop figures are just extensions of a long tradition .  they are partially grown from cells  and partially controlled by technological means  but they are not the small scale humans you are so protective of .      ariel sighed .  she had heard variations of this diatribe so often since they   d captured avery that she wanted to wrap her hands around the doctor   s throat and strangle him  or at least remove his tongue so that she would not have to hear his whining maniacal voice again .  fortunately  as long as there were robots around  first law prevented her from taking such drastic measures .  that was why she could daydream about them without guilt .  come to think of it  she said to herself  she could not rely on either eve or adam to come to avery   s rescue .  if they were not in the mood for first law that day  they might be willing to be a detached and curious audience to an actual act of murder .   maybe strangling avery wasn   t such a bad idea .      do you have anything constructive to offer  ozymandias .         wasn   t that constructive .         not by a long shot .  you know what really frosts me .  that you consider yourself a robot and yet appear to hold robots in such low esteem .      he shook his head vigorously .     on the contrary  mistress ariel .  once we establish that these people are indeed manmade constructs  i will revere them as i revere all robots  even the smallest function robots that dust rooms and pick up trash .  the robot is the highest order of existence  and i am proud to be one .      she couldn   t dope avery out any more .  sometimes he would talk normally   or at least in what was a normal fashion for a man whose eccentricity was legend   and then he   d switch over to this robot identity  praising his own efficiency or going on endlessly about the virtues of his positronic brain .  derec continued to urge her to deal with the man  as if compassion and intelligent conversation with him would bring about a cure .  it was simply too large an order .  avery   s madness was beyond anything her homegrown sense of psychology could cope with .   still  she had to try .  she had promised .     while avery and ariel spoke  eve moved closer to the desk .  she wanted to watch the dancers play the game  which could not take place until ariel returned her attention to them .   or must she wait for ariel .  indeed  why wait for her .   she placed her hand in the middle of the desk  resting it on its side  thumb up .  the dancers immediately responded to the signal and began forming teams on either side of eve   s hand .  when they were ready  eve raised her hand and dropped a tiny rolled up piece of paper onto the middle of the desktop .  the dancers immediately began scrambling toward it .  one of them  the chubby one that avery had tried to take  reached it first .  he picked it up and began to run with it  but the opposing team quickly assembled itself .  a female sprang in front of the male carrying the paper and gestured others to join her .  in an instant  it seemed  they had surrounded the male .  they were not allowed to touch each other during the game  except by accident .  that had been one of ariel   s early rules  rules that she had communicated to the dancers through the use of a series of hand signs she had developed in her study of them .  once the player was surrounded  he must give up the paper  which he did .  the new possessors began tossing the paper between them  while the other team  staying close together  watched  waiting for the next move  looking for their chance to surround the player carrying the paper .   suddenly one of the females  a gaunt  thin one who had grown gaunter and thinner since the silversides had brought the group to the medical facility  started to rush forward with the paper tucked under her arm .  the other team started to go into a formation that could easily close itself around her  but she suddenly turned and flipped the paper back to a male who was running behind her .  he quickly hurled it to another male standing at the edge of the desktop .  this one ran in a straight line  along the desk edge  to the other side of the desk .  nobody could catch him .   when he reached the other side  he abruptly sat down  set the paper in front of him  and did a half bow to it .  the last act established the authenticity of the score  a procedure that ariel  who had adapted the game from an ancient auroran sport  had not originally taught them .  it seemed they were such slaves to ritual that they had to perform some rite when they succeeded at scoring .   the male stood up and left the piece of paper where he had deposited it  a signal for eve to pick it up and again drop it in the center after the teams had re formed .  she was about to let it go  when ariel hollered at her harshly     eve .  i did not give you permission to start the game .      eve  holding the paper over the anxiously awaiting dancers  looked up .     i wanted to start it .  since you were speaking with ozymandias  i decided to           it   s not up to you to decide .  you haven   t learned yet .  you are the robot  i am the human .  you wait for my orders .         we are not sure that is correct .       ariel threw up her hands in despair .  she did not need this kind of robotic sophistry right this minute .  staring down at the desktop  she said     okay  who   s ahead .        ariel didn   t have the patent on despairing gestures .  in another part of the city  derec was clenching his fists and resisting the impulse to slam them down on the nearest available surface .      another dysfunctional session  sir .     mandelbrot said .  derec almost laughed .  a dysfunctional session .  frost  an absolute failure .      it seems that our computer does not yet want to activate full access  mandelbrot .  this just doesn   t make sense .  it   s like the computer is playing with me  letting me do some things  blocking me from others .         do not the computers obey the laws of robotics  too .      derec shrugged .     they   re supposed to .  unless someone is controlling them from some outside source  overriding my requests as i make them .         is that possible .         i believe so .  there is someone in the city somewhere  the same individual that the robots are blocked from telling me about  and he or she or it   s the boss right now .  there   s something so  i don   t know  inhuman about our intruder   s actions that i suspect an alien  one as intelligent as the blackbodies and as mean as aranimas .      aranimas had been the alien who  before derec came to robot city  had trapped him on his ship and tried to make a slave out of him .  the most fortunate aspects of that terrible experience were that he had met ariel and wolruf and constructed the wonderfully loyal mandelbrot out of spare parts .   with an expansive hand gesture that clearly dismissed the computer  derec stood up and began pacing the room .     mandelbrot  i should be in charge  but the he or she or it is not allowing it .  this individual doles out some information through the computer   how to activate the devices for food  personals  the slidewalk  heat and light   but only that data that we require in order to survive .  when it comes to completely activating the computer  getting the services of the city running again  and putting the robots back in their proper jobs  it keeps blocking me from accomplishing anything .  obviously it is not out to destroy us  not at present anyway .  but he  she  or it is definitely hiding something from us .  its identity  of course  but maybe something more .  maybe there   s something about its identity that we should not know .  or about its future plans .         what about the chemfets .     mandelbrot asked .     in the past they have always provided the right information about the city .         that   s what   s really crazy  mandelbrot .  the chemfets aren   t any more functional than the city is now .  oh  i get a sensation or two about our mysterious visitor now and then  but no real clue about who or what he  she  or it is .  and i get this vague feeling that there   s some kind of a solution  but it remains just outside my reach .  at any rate  the chemfets are messed up  just like robot city .  there are times when i can hardly detect them .  and i hate that more than i can tell you .      he stretched his arms  as if trying to stir up the chemfets .     you know     he continued     i used to think the chemfets were a hellish thing .  i thought they were controlling me  racing up and down my bloodstream  making me ill .  now that they   ve reached maturity and i   ve integrated myself with them  i can   t cope with them not working like this .  i want to activate them desperately  and i can   t .  it   s like me and the city .  i want to get robot city going again .  i have to .  yet i   m so darn stymied .  there   s got to be a way  mandelbrot  and i   m going to find it .        the watchful eye eavesdropped on derec with some satisfaction .  now  back to its natural shape but completely hidden by layers of the mosslike substance it had strewn over the computer  it considered its next moves .   the strange word that derec had used  stymied  seemed to apply to the watchful eye   s circumstances also .  as ariel and avery continued their research on series c  batch     it did not feel safe in reactivating the robots who had done the original lab work that led to the creation of the various batches .  it had convinced those robots that more research was needed on the laws of humanics  and  since there were no humans in the city  they would have to create their own .  of course the watchful eye knew  as avery had perceived  that their little models were not full fledged human beings  that they were just robotically activated biological material formed into human shapes .  it could have made them into any shape  even made them look like itself  but it chose to create their appearance from pictures it called up from a computer file of historical figures .   because the intruders had to occupy so much of its time  the watchful eye could conduct none of its other experiments  either .  it had been about to begin a stress test to see how the iron plastic alloy that the city was made of could hold up under many different circumstances .  it had intended to fully explore the many facets of robot city and then  when finished  restructure and refashion it to suit its needs .   it was concerned with the laws of humanics because it wanted to find out just what a human was .  something just beneath the level of its consciousness compelled it to discover humans and emulate them .  there were times when it hoped that derec and ariel  or adam and eve  would finally prove to be the real humans  so that the matter would be settled and it could go on to its future  whatever its future was meant to be .  it was certain it had a destiny that would eventually be revealed .   more than anything else  however  the watchful eye missed the freedom to work on the biggest question it faced  who or what it was .  it had to be something  fit some category of existence .  for it did exist .   it could be human  although   if the intruders were humans  and which ones .  derec and ariel .  adam and eve .  the dreadful avery .     it did not physically resemble them .  but then  in its natural state  or at least the state it had been in when it came to awareness  it had resembled nothing more than a blob of matter .  later it had discovered that it had the ability to change its shape .  right now it could change itself into the shape of a human  but would it be human .  did these humans start out in the same puttylike shape it had .  had they originally hidden in their havens until they had chosen what they must look like .   it wondered if it could be some kind of animal .  there did not appear to be any kind of animal native to robot city  so it could only judge that subject from information extracted from computer files .  the files only confused it further  since it felt no link with any animal in any picture it called up .  in addition  it noted that many of the so called animals resembled the so called humans in many respects .  were they also kinds of humans .   it could be a robot  but it resisted that idea most .  it had studied the robots and found them to be too subservient  too easily programmed .  admirable pieces of construction though they were  they simply did not seem complex enough for the watchful eye to belong to their class of being .  it could not convince itself that there were any resemblances between a robot and it .  if anything  it felt more like a computer than a robot .  but it had a sentient life that the robot city computer did not .  so it had concluded it could not be a computer  either .   what was it .   it intended to find out soon .     adam silverside wandered through the streets of robot city  not knowing where he was going  not knowing why he had left the medical facility .  he had been watching eve concentrate so completely on ariel and the dancers that he had come to the conclusion that he was useless to their experiments .  sometimes ariel and eve conversed so intently on the behavior of the dancers that it seemed they were unaware of his presence in the room .   it was not that adam felt hurt  or even annoyed  at the way he had been ignored .  a robot does not feel the pangs of rejection that trouble humans in such matters .  a robot would  under normal conditions  not feel left out or even ignored .  after all  a robot can even stand alone without anything happening for a long  long time .   what adam perceived essentially  and in a logical way  was that he served no purpose in their work .  it seemed to him that since robot city was in crisis and derec and ariel were in turmoil about how to solve their respective problems  there should be something he could do .  it would be a terribly inefficient use of his time and abilities for him to stay where he was not needed .  their maker  whoever he or she was  had evidently planned them to be special .  they were compelled to serve and be useful through the direct or implicit order of humans  a second law imperative .   he came to the lot where they had discovered the first group of dancers .  it was completely empty now  with no traces left of its former inhabitants .  that was  in itself  another anomaly .  who had taken away all traces of their lives  even including the remains of the campfire around which they had danced .  who had smoothed over the ground so that even the graves could not be detected .  some of the city   s robots were  it seemed  functional .   he came to a parkland  where precisely sculptured bushes were placed at even distances along a smoothly raked path .  there were no footsteps on the path  and no people to sit in the benches under the park   s towering trees .  it seemed anomalous to adam that a park like this  and several other robot city areas  were so obviously built for human habitation  and there had been as yet so few humans upon the planet .  the city itself seemed useless  as useless as he now believed himself to be .   he came to an area where buildings stretched in a long semicircle around a nonworking fountain .  shops with blank signs were neatly arrayed along the street level of the semicircle .   the few robots walking through the streets were intent on their own goals .  none stopped at any of the buildings .   adam wondered why he felt no sense of belonging when he saw these robots .  how could he be a robot and be so separated from other robots .   there were no goods in any of the shops  no shoppers to select items in the first place .  like the park  another robot city anomaly .   shops and parks with definite purposes and no way to fulfill them .  the problem was similar to his own  he thought .  he had not only an ability to imprint upon living creatures  but to become astonishingly like them  adopting the patterns and characteristics of their lives as well as their physical appearance .  he could even lead them  as he had with the kin .  was this to be his life or  if not life  the parameters of his existence within the universe .  he felt compelled to change his shape into that of another  he needed to keep doing it until his dilemma of interpreting what a human was had reached a conclusion .  there was no purpose for him in robot city  no one on whom to imprint .   he did not realize that this frustrating state had been planned by derec and wolruf  and they in turn did not know what an astonishing success the plan had been  at least in adam   s case .  it would not have occurred to adam that he was being tamed .  if it had  he would have resisted it firmly .    as he had on the blackbodies    planet  he changed into the kin shape and began to run down the streets of robot city  then he tried the blackbody shape and clumsily flapped his wings  knocking them against the walls of buildings  then he was a function robot  picking up debris and depositing it in a sewer grating  then he took on derec   s shape  then ariel   s  then avery   s .   but all the transformations did not satisfy him .  he had done them all before .   he needed a new creature to imprint on .   he changed back to kin shape so that he could howl at the stars spread in the sky over the city .   then he was derec again  walking the streets back to the medical facility  his mission in the city unfulfilled .  he realized that  in a way  he was acting like the men in some legends he had read in computer files  the kind of legend where men shook their fists at the sky and castigated the universe .   he found the image odd .  he could shake his fist at the sky  but  sadly perhaps  he could not really feel the emotion that inspired the gesture .  the human emotion behind the gesture .     chapter     avery and the silversides    ariel awoke with a start .  she hadn   t realized she   d been asleep  must have dozed off with her head on the back of the cushioned chair she   d drawn up beside the desk .   it was certainly disconcerting to come to consciousness and look down on about a half dozen of the dancers staring up at you  while the rest played at some game that ariel had not yet interpreted .   they showed each other their hands  palms up or down  any number of fingers extended  sometimes no fingers extended  sometimes a fist .   there was a questioning look on their faces  as if they   d been curious about why their god seemed to need sleep every once in a while .  the dancers themselves never seemed to sleep .  ariel had watched them and delegated the silversides to observe them  but no sleep had ever been detected .  she sometimes wondered what it would be like to be awake for one   s entire life .  would you get a lot done or go mad from being conscious without respite .   as she always did when she hadn   t been studying the dancers for some time  she counted them .  there were still fourteen of them .  good .  avery  then  had not somehow eluded wolruf   s vigilance and  while she was asleep  sneaked to the desk to abduct one of the tiny creatures .   she glanced toward the other side of the room  where avery slouched in a chair  apparently dozing himself .   when he was ozymandias  he insisted that he never slept .   wolruf sat on the floor  keeping an eye on the doctor while thumbing through a picture book about auroran art that ariel had found in the small library attached to the medical facility .  she was studying it for practice in reading and to learn about human customs .  in the time that ariel had known her  wolruf   s ability to read standard had improved significantly  as had her command of the language .  the task of guarding avery had given her free time to add to her education in the ways of humans and robots .   ariel couldn   t think of what to do next with the dancers .  she   d been studying their customs for several days  and there didn   t seem to be much more to learn .  she had tried to communicate with them  but  except for the hand gestures needed either to get their attention or initiate games  most of her attempts had been unsuccessful .   all the dancers had been examined by a diagnostic scanner  the only piece of equipment in the medical facility that appeared to work successfully .  she was not sure why .  however  since the only systems derec had been able to  or been allowed to  restore tended to be life sustaining  she wondered if the scanner worked because it might be needed in an emergency .  derec was right about the presence in the city  she was sure of it .  and that presence was doling out favors  stingily but with some sense .  the scanner had revealed nothing new about the dancers .  as avery told her  they were anatomically consistent with full sized humans .  if there was robotic circuitry  the scanner didn   t detect it .   she missed derec so .  they had not really been together since that interlude at the compass tower .  they checked in with each other every once in a while  but at those times he was detached  more concerned with reviving the city than with reviving their passion .  and she couldn   t pin all the blame in that arena of life solely upon him .  after all  as derec had pointed out  her attention was just as fiercely fixed on the dancers  avery  and the silversides .   the two of them made a great pair  workaholics without much time for each other .  but she did long for a moment alone with him  just a brief time of being held by him  kissing him  feeling his gentle touches upon her back .   well  there was no time for romance now .  thing to do  she thought  is get the jobs done  restore equilibrium  then grab each other and race to the nearest dark place .   she raised her arms  trying to stretch weariness out of them .  as always  the dancers were interested in her movement .  whatever she did  they watched her do it with absolute fascination .  this time they imitated her  making ritualistic  slow stretching motions that duplicated her gestures .  how  she wondered  could avery keep saying that they were not living beings .  with such grace  such skill  they could be nothing less than human .   her mouth felt dry  and she was sure that her breath could cause an air purification system to malfunction .  there was the beginning of a headache at the back of her eyes .  she needed to use the personal .      eve .         yes  mistress ariel .         time .      the word was all she needed to bring eve to the desk to take over from her .  ariel stood up .      have you conceived a new game .     she asked eve .      yes .         of course .  i should have known .  show it to me when i get back .      when ariel had left  eve picked up one of the dancers  a short  for a dancer  stocky female .  the female did not resist in any way  none of the dancers did  anymore  and merely sat calmly in eve   s palm .      adam .     eve called .   adam  newly returned from his wanderings  stepped out of a dark corner of the room from which he had been watching her .      yes  eve .         there seems to be something wrong with the dancers  this one and all of them .         i have not seen it yet .         you have to examine their faces .  this one was young  like ariel  when we first brought them here .  now look .      adam bent down toward the stocky female in eve   s hand .  he hadn   t studied the dancers with the same meticulousness that eve had and wasn   t certain what she   d meant .  nevertheless  at least he was being asked to do something .      what do you see  adam .         one of the dancers  female category .         besides that .         her hair .  it was once dark colored and now it is mostly gray .  her face .  once it was unlined  now there are many lines in it .  her mouth .  once it was           that is enough  adam .  it is what i see  too .  not only in this one  but in all of them .  they have been here for four days  and none of them is young any more .  look at that one .      adam looked where she pointed .  a male dancer  one of the game players  had left the group and was sitting alone  his knees pulled up  his arms around his knees .  his face was old  pitted  sallow .      he appears to be unwell     adam commented .      i wonder what it means .  are they changing their shapes like we do .         perhaps  but i do not think so .         they are going to die     avery said  sitting up in his chair .  his movement forced wolruf to push her book aside and tense her body .   avery stood up and approached the desk .     i   m not sure why they have to die .  i suspect that whoever created them was at least partly interested in human life cycles .  otherwise he could have made them as permanent as robots .  that is  after all  one of the advantages we robots have .  their creator wanted them to die  or he messed up  i   m not certain which .  when they do go  i hope to find out by examining them .         ariel said    u can   t touch them     wolruf cautioned .      well  she must at least let me examine a corpse or two .         no .     eve said suddenly  unsure of why she had spoken out at all .   the doctor   s eyebrows raised in surprise .     you don   t wish me to  eve .         that is true .         how curious .  are you a robot with compassion then .         i do not know what you mean .         if you are  and i get a shot at you  we   ll have to program it right out .  i don   t know sometimes why things happen as they do in robot city .  first we get robots with artistic leanings  another trait i had to get rid of  and now compassionate robots .  is that a tear in your eye  eve  or just a trick of the light .  don   t respond  i was only joking .      ariel returned from the personal in time to hear the last of avery   s comments .  she was about to speak  to tell avery to zip up his mouth  when she noticed what was happening to adam .   adam stood at the side of the desk  just slightly behind avery .  he was staring at the doctor and at the same time undergoing a transformation  changing shape .  it was fascinating to watch .  first his body seemed to shrink as he lost a few inches of height .   was he trying to become a dancer .  she wondered .  could that be possible .  wouldn   t his mass have to be concentrated impossibly for him to change to that size .   then the shrinking stopped  and adam   s shorter body began to expand outward  making him look rounder .  his arms became shorter and hung differently  in a sort of apelike way .  then his face  which had been almost an exact replica of derec   s  began to undulate slightly  with his chin puffing out and his forehead narrowing  his chin coming to a point  then reshaping itself to a rounder contour .  at the top of his head  his metallic version of derec   s sandy hair lightened to white and got longer  messier .  but it was not until the next change that ariel realized what was happening .  resembling the hair in color and texture  a silver bushy moustache appeared to sprout under adam   s transformed nose .   ariel laughed abruptly  pleased at the first hint of merriment in her life for some time .   adam had changed himself from a mimicry of derec to a nearly exact rendition of the short  round  wavy haired and moustachioed dr .  avery .   avery didn   t notice adam   s transformation until ariel laughed .  at first he thought she was laughing at him  and he prepared a withering comment .   avery could not abide being laughed at .  the mockery of too many colleagues had made him sensitive to criticism and developed in him a lightning reflex to respond as cruelly as he could .   then he saw where ariel   s attention was directed .   he saw adam   s robotic and  to him  nightmarish version of himself  and he screamed in anger .  it was the kind of scream that rattled any loose item or emotional equilibrium in its vicinity .  on the desktop the dancers scattered in fear .     adam had not expected such a violent reaction from avery  and it shocked as well as intrigued him .  he had imprinted upon avery several times already  but only twice in avery   s presence .  each of those times the self centered doctor had not noticed or even looked at him .   although avery knew about the silversides    shape changing abilities  this was the first time he had observed an actual transformation .      i won   t have this .     avery yelled .     it is mockery .  you have no right to take my shape .  how is it possible even .  what kind of material are you made of .     he touched adam on his arm  his chest  his face .  adam   s skin was still like the syntheskin on any robot  except the few humaniforms .     there   s no human texture to your skin  no        ariel stepped forward .     that   s because adam is a robot .     she searched avery   s face for reactions and saw deep confusion in his eyes  so she added slyly     like you  ozymandias .      avery seemed momentarily confused .     of course     he said .     like me .     he examined adam more closely .     and robots are fixed  permanent .  not like humans  not like animals .  then adam can   t be a robot .  he   s something else in a robot   s clothing .         what am i .     adam asked .      i don   t know what you are .         if not human  what .  if not robot  what .         yes     ariel said  moving closer to avery     what is adam .         some new kind of creature  but i don   t know what .  he is capable of changing his shape .         yes  he is .  he can be human  robot  animal  alien .  but he is robot  ozymandias .         he can   t be .         oh  but he can .  they both can .  derec   s not sure how they shape change  but he thinks it   s facilitated by a kind of dna or dna analog in their cells .  apparently they can gain voluntary control over their cells  even adjusting their sizes and shapes .  they sort of think of the shape they   ll take  and its details are worked out in their positronic brains .  mandelbrot can drastically change the shape of his arm  but these two work miracles on their entire bodies .  adam says he started as a blob and knew how to alter his shape into a practical ambulatory form in his first few moments of awareness .         i refuse to accept that .  why did you laugh .         because you are like me now .  you accused me of being sentimental for believing the dancers to be human  and now you refuse to believe adam is a robot .  nevertheless  it is true .  why does it bother you so  ozymandias .         i won   t discuss it .         of course .  because it would embarrass you .  now that you   re a robot  you   re annoyed when another one comes along who   s greater than you are .         that   s not it at all .  and it   s not true .  transmogrification is no special achievement .  it makes him no more than a circus freak .         maybe you   re right .  it isn   t true .  good thing you   re not avery any more  ozymandias .  if you were  i   d have to say that maybe the great dr .  avery  creator of the avery robots  is jealous that someone else has designed and built a better model .      for a moment avery did not speak .  instead  he merely stared at adam  which was like looking in a mirror that slightly distorted the image .  adam   s skin was silvery  and there were more sharp lines in the shape of his body than in avery   s softly curved figure .  adam   s eyes had a serenity in them that avery had not  when looking in a mirror  seen in many years .  it forced him to consider a human avery whose life had been more satisfactory  when he had been married and at the top of his profession  adored by many  certainly respected by almost everyone .  why had his eyes changed .  he wondered .   ariel saw the emotional disruption in avery   s face  and at the same time saw a way to work with the man as derec had urged .  she moved to the other side of the desk  beside eve  who had been busy calming the dancers with gestures and a soft humming that almost had a tune to it .      eve     ariel whispered .      yes .         can you do one of those shape changes for me .         yes  into anything i know about .         well  do what adam did .  imprint on avery .  can you do that .         of course .      ariel watched with fascination as eve went through the same transformations that adam had .  it was even stranger to view in her  since before ariel   s eyes  eve changed from a female to a male .  while she had always known that eve could change shape  and had been told that adam had been a female when he was a member of the kin  she was still amazed by the process .  eve   s face changed earlier than adam   s had  and then she rearranged her body from the shoulders down .  when finished  she was even more uncomfortably like avery than adam was .      ozymandias     ariel said  breaking his concentration on adam .  as the man turned toward her  his jaw dropped open when he saw still another copy of himself .      this is unfair .     he cried  furious .      why .  most of the time they go around looking like derec and me  and it doesn   t bother us .  why does it so upset you  ozymandias .         i feel like they   re taking something away from me .         what .  your soul .      ariel   s question came as such a shock to avery that it made him laugh .     my soul .  hardly .  what would a robot do with a soul .  no  i mean my personality  all that constitutes me  my dignity .         dignity .  personality .  what do you care about those .      as ariel talked  eve had gone to adam  and now they stood side by side  twin averys  with the same subtle differences between them that a set of identical twins showed .   avery  uncharacteristically speechless  whirled around and strode back to where wolruf stood .  ariel might have been mistaken  but she thought  from the way the caninoid alien stood at a slight tilt and from the faint gargling sound coming from her throat  usually an indication of amusement for her   that wolruf found the proceedings funny .      come back here .     ariel shouted .      i refuse .         how can you refuse my order .  you are a robot and i am human .  you have to obey me .  second law  ozymandias .     she spoke this last with a lilt in her voice  mockingly .  he stood still for a moment  then spun around and returned to the desk .   meanwhile ariel had sidled up to the silversides .     adam  eve  i want you to do something for me .     they both glanced at her  awaiting their orders .     you   ve been around avery for long enough .  imitate him all the way .  talk like him  sound like him  rant like him  move like him  strut like him  whatever you have stored in your memory banks that you can use to be like him .  can you do that .      they both responded yes .  adam  particularly  welcomed the challenge .  it was a use of his shape changing ability  after all .  in a world where there was little to imprint on  any challenge would do .      all right     ariel said when avery had returned to the desk .     separate from each other  and when i give the signal  start .      adam went to one side of the room  eve to the other .  avery  who had not heard ariel   s command  looked back and forth from one to the other .   then  at a gesture from ariel  the assault began .  adam immediately launched a diatribe of avery   s that he had stored in his memory .  it was an especially ripe one  filled with florid phrases and a good deal of invective .  the robot   s voice was a remarkable playback  catching the tones and inflections of the doctor   s voice so precisely that ariel  if she had shut her eyes  would not have known it was not the real avery .   the target of the assault merely watched adam disbelievingly  his eyes widened  displaying less intensity and more confusion than perhaps anyone had ever seen in him before .  he chewed on his lower lip  another uncharacteristic act .  his fingers tapped against the side of his legs  a gesture ariel had seen often .  avery did it a lot when he was angry .   making a loud cough very like the one avery made to get another person   s attention  eve entered the fray .  avery   s head turned to watch her  while adam   s diatribe continued  louder .   eve began to mutter to herself in an avery like way and began to pace her side of the room in a strutting fashion .  as she walked her fingers  too  tapped against her legs .  once she stopped and banged her fist into the palm of her other hand  yelling     i will not have it .  this isn   t the way things will be .  i demand you let me have a dancer to experiment upon .      then she whirled around  just as avery had earlier  and walked to the desktop to stare down sternly at the dancers .  now that she looked like the doctor  she was amazed to find that the dancers were fooled by her .  they scattered just the way they did when avery hovered over them .   ariel saw eve   s face lose its hostility  softening into a gentler look .  because the silversides could only form aspects of facial expression  becoming much like an artist   s caricature  eve   s present look disconcerted ariel .  she did not like avery   s face appearing to be kind .  further  there was a suggestion of ariel   s face  seemingly superimposed upon the avery mien  that annoyed her .      eve     she whispered     they   re all right .  they just think you   re him .  don   t worry about it .  we   ll take care of them  and you can resume your familiar shape .      eve recalled her task .  her face became hard again  and she resumed muttering .  suddenly  in a move that ariel could not have expected  eve slammed her fist upon the desktop  well away from any of the dancers  .  even avery flinched at    the fury of the move  as if he didn   t believe someone looking like him could do such a violent thing .      what are they       he began  but adam came forward to stand next to eve .  they seemed an odd pair  like identical twins who had labored to differentiate themselves in any way possible  but just could not stop looking like each other .      we should not even experiment on these     adam said .     they are just vermin  like most humans  not like robots .  we should kill them .      eve  taken in for a moment by adam   s act  was ready to rush to defend them until she recalled her command to playact .      that   s going too far     avery shouted .     i would never say that .         ozymandias     ariel said     what you see is just their impression of what you say  how you act .  in their minds  capable as they are of processing data  you   ve shown yourself to be unpredictable and quite likely to perform violent acts .  that you   d think of killing the dancers seems within the realm of possibility to them .  and  for that matter  to me .         you don   t understand .  i   m not a destroyer  i   m a creator .  yes  if necessary i   d dissect an animal for scientific knowledge  but i   d never willingly kill for killing   s sake .         now you   ve said it  they know it .  they understand you better now .  tell them more .      avery smiled .     i see your ploy .  make me reveal myself so you can continue this charade .  well  ariel  it won   t work .      she shrugged .     don   t know anything about charades .         stop them  ariel .  you   re making me very nervous .      his tone had become whiny .  ariel felt they were really getting to him now .  she whispered across the desk to the silversides     fight  you two .  fight .         fight .     adam asked .     we cannot fight each other .         not a real fight .  fake it .      it was a bizarre  awkward battle  especially since adam and eve had to use precise arm movements in order not to strike each other in any way that might hurt either   by dislodging a circuit or causing positronic damage .  but adam   s voice circuit was quite capable of any imitative sound  and when they just missed with a blow  he created the sound of one .  many of the punches appeared to land with a thunderous impact .  after a well simulated blow  the victim would convincingly reel backwards from the apparent force of it .      stop .     avery hollered .  then he screamed to ariel     they can   t fight each other .  it   s strictly against third law procedure .  a robot must protect its own existence .  that means they can   t be aggressive .         but second law allows me to order them to fight to the death  if necessary .         well  yes  true  i guess  but consider the laws of humanics then .  you should not give an order that endangers the preservation of robotic existence .         that   s just so much balderdash .  there are no laws of humanics  they   re just theory .  back home we call them ethics    and  ozymandias  as anyone can tell you  ariel welsh is not an ethical person .         you   re lying .         maybe .  no law of humanics to cover that  is there .      avery was momentarily bemused .  adam and eve still struggled in their mock battle .  eve managed a skillful flip over adam   s shoulder and he staggered forward  nearly into ariel   s arms .   ariel wished derec could be in the room to watch the unprecedented scene of a pair of robots fighting .  she almost forgot that the prodding of avery had to be the main purpose of this theatrical display .   she whispered to adam and eve to quit the fray .  each of them returned to portraying avery  muttering and castigating  pacing and gesturing .      ozymandias  you   re trembling     ariel said from a point just behind his back  startling him and making him even more angry .      i am not trembling .         you   re shaking like a leaf .         you are right  ariel  you   re not ethical .  this whole attack on me is unethical .  you   re trying to drive me crazy .         that   s just paranoia  the least of your madnesses  i think .  and i   m not trying to drive you crazy .  i   m trying to do just the opposite   drive you sane .         that in itself is crazy .         you bet .      adam came by  now doing a full scale imitation of avery  with the right walk  the tics  the jumpy inflections in his voice  the sarcastic tone .  avery yelled in frustration and took a swipe at adam  landing a weak blow to his back .      ozymandias     ariel said     you just tried to hit adam .         that   s right .  i wish i could mangle him into spare parts .         but you   re a robot .         yes  what of it .         well  you just said robots shouldn   t be aggressive .  you just put yourself in danger by hitting adam .  you reacted to him in a very human way .  how could you possibly be a robot .         i am a robot .         no  you   re a human being .         i was once  but i   m not now .      now ariel was frustrated .  the idea that he was a robot seemed fixed in avery   s unpositronic brain .  yet she sensed that his anger over what the silversides were doing could be used to shake him out of his delusion .      are    u all fright  arriel .     wolruf said .      i   m okay .  i just had a foolish idea i could do something here  that   s all .         iss there anything i may do .         take me home to aurora .         if i could           no  wolruf  no .  i didn   t really mean it anyway .  i   m happy here in scenic robot city .  i plan to be president of the chamber of commerce .      she was about to tell the silversides that they could end their playacting  just as eve passed her .  eve stopped in front of avery and leaned in toward him  continuing her muttering in his voice .  he pushed her away .  she slid backward a few feet  then came close to him again .      stay away from me .     avery cried .     that   s an order .  second law .      ariel moved in closer  too .      you   re a robot .  you can   t invoke second law .         what .  oh .  yes .  get her away from me .         no .  go ahead  eve .  stalk him .  whatever he goes  you go .  you  too  adam .  encroach .      they surrounded avery .  whenever he broke away from them  one of them zoomed in on him again .  he flailed out at them  and they sidestepped his badly thrown blows .   finally  he broke into a run  pursued by adam and eve .  near the desk he spun around  and ariel saw he had something in his hand .  a moment passed before she realized what it was .  she had not seen it in a long time .   the weapon was avery   s electronic disrupter  a device that emitted an ion stream that would interfere with the circuits of any advanced machine .  any machine  like the silversides .  and he was raising it to aim at them .   ariel  who had been standing behind the silversides  ran between them  and roughly pushed them away .  in the back of her mind  she realized that she   d just violated another of the laws of humanics  the one that said humans must not harm robots .  both silversides went flying sideways .   her move came just in time .  avery   s shot went right over ariel   s head and would undoubtedly have affected circuitry in adam or eve .   she continued her rush to avery  jumping at him  knocking the electronic disrupter out of his hand and throwing him to the floor .      some robot you are     she said  breathing heavily .     you don   t even make a decent human being .         ariel     avery said weakly .  he struggled to his feet .     i don   t   that is  i   i   m   i am   i        he looked sick .  all the color had drained from his face .  ariel could see that it wasn   t the result of the fighting .  it was something else .  from the look of him  he could be dying .      you better sit down     ariel said .     adam .      adam picked up a chair and brought it to avery  who settled heavily down upon it .  eve walked to adam and the two took up a position behind avery   s chair .  the fact they looked so much alike was disconcerting to ariel  as if she were about to talk to a group called the avery trio .      are you all right .     ariel asked avery .      i   i think so .         robots don   t get sick  you know .  they don   t suffer from heart palpitations or exhaustion .  they           it   s okay  ariel .  you don   t have to speak to me as if i were a child .  i know who i am .  i may not like it .  i may want to live forever .  i may want to be a robot .  but i know who i am .         and that is           ariel  please .         no  i   m a literalist .  are you a robot  dr .  avery .         no .         say it out .         i .  am .  not .  a .  robot .      ariel smiled .      well     she said     that   s a start .        chapter     a disconnected detective    bogie stood in the corner where derec had placed him so long ago .  timestep was across the room in another corner .  while it was impossible for bogie to be bored or to consider the possibilities of nothingness while in fact doing nothing for several consecutive days  he was aware that he had been in the corner for some time .  it seemed to him that his position must be very much like the detectives on stakeout in several of the films he had researched .  in scenes where they had waxed philosophical in tough guy language  with plenty of wise cracks and sentimental observations about life  they had had to pass time with only their own words to keep them company  plus a few doughnuts .  bogie would  he decided  prefer to do a stakeout for derec than merely to stand in a corner awaiting his next order .   the order came  but not from derec .  the watchful eye transmitted a comlink message to bogie over the secret channel it had created for private communications with its robots .  the message told bogie to come at once but not to allow derec to see him go .  that posed quite a dilemma for bogie .  if he left immediately  it would be obvious .  if he waited for the right time  he would be disobeying the big muddy   s command to come at once .  for a while he stood in his corner  aware that he could get mental freeze out  a condition where a robot   s positronic brain essentially stopped functioning because of an unresolvable dilemma .  he was  he thought  a cybernetic goner if he could not slip away soon .   in the room derec was speaking with mandelbrot .      i had another dream about my mother last night     derec was saying .      that is your fifth dream about her     mandelbrot said .     the fifth that you have told me about .         yep .  that   s all of    em .  there wasn   t much to this one .  i was a child  and she came to give me medicine .  but this time i saw her face clearly .  she had blond hair and hazel eyes .  she seemed very kind .  we talked for a while  i don   t remember about what .  then she said she loved me and left .  and i woke up .         it was a pleasant dream then .         i suppose .  but i woke up wondering if the woman in the dream was really my mother .  i mean  i   ve never seen her  so anyone i think up could come into my dream and say she   s my mother without even looking anything like her .  do you understand  mandelbrot .         frankly  no .         well  i guess you don   t have a mother .         you know i do not .      derec seemed about to explain something to mandelbrot  but there was a soft rapping on the door .      that sounds like wolruf     derec said .     i   d recognize that tap anywhere .  come in  wolruf .      the caninoid alien came into the room .      messsage frrom arriel     she said .     she ssent me .  we are making progrresss with your fatherr  she told me to tell    u .      derec   s face brightened .     that   s wonderful news  wolruf .  how much progress  do you think .         am not able to guesss .  in my homeland iss no mental illnesss .  have not seen it before dr .  averry .         but he seems better .         that may be ssaid  i think .         good .  but she still doesn   t want me to come there .         afrraid you   ll           i know  i know .  i could set him back .  that   s okay .      it wasn   t  but he said so .  he was very curious about what his father would be like as a sane man .  he could not conceive of the possibility .      how about your other project .  the silversides .         they help arriel  but she feelss they are just ass unpredictable ass everr .         i suspect so .  and the dancers .         she ssaid to tell    u they do not do well .  they get old .  one died .         did that upset ariel badly .         no  i don   t think so .  eve wass concerned .  she inssissted on taking it somewhere and burrying it .  ariel ssaid that iss sstrange .         i agree .  but adam and eve seem full of surprises  don   t they .         alwayss .         anything more  wolruf .         that   ss all she told me to tell    u .         well  thank you .  you make a good messenger  wolruf .  i won   t have to shoot you .         shoot me .  you would    .      derec laughed .     no  i wouldn   t shoot you .  according to some earth legend i read about  if a king was dissatisfied with the news a messenger brought  he would order the messenger killed .  but  if it were ever true  it was a custom that faded out with civilization .         i am thankful for that .         stay with us  wolruf .  i   m hungry .  we can eat something .  i   ve taught mandelbrot how to program the chemical food processor .  he comes up with some awesome concoctions  and i   m sure if you state your preferences  he can devise something to your taste .      derec rose from his chair and led the others out of the room .  the food machine was located in a kitchen on the other side of the corridor .   the human need for food solved bogie   s problem .  he slipped away from his corner and  checking the corridor carefully  went out into it .  as he passed the kitchen  he heard derec talking and the sounds of mandelbrot operating the processor .     growing again the thick legs it used to get around the computer chamber  the watchful eye moved out of its haven .   there were no robots or intruders anywhere near the computer complex at this time  and it wanted to be ready for bogie when he arrived .  it had a plan  and it needed bogie to make the plan work .     it was night in robot city  bogie   s favorite time  and he noticed that the moonlight slashed off the sides of buildings like a mugger   s sudden attack .  as he walked quickly through the streets  he liked to think of descriptive lines like that  lines derived from the voiceovers in many of the old movies he   d viewed .  he glanced around for more opportunities to practice such lines .  in the night sky  the stars flickered on and off  like the sequins on a party girl   s dress .  the tunnel he would use to go down to the computer level   and the watchful eye   loomed mysteriously in front of him  like a black hole with a welcome mat in front of it .   he wondered why his thoughts had taken such an odd turn .  could it just be his fascination with all those movies he   d researched  or was there some reason to be wary of what the watchful eye had in store for him .     the watchful eye tracked bogie on his trip through the intricate maze that was the route to the computer chamber  watching several view screens so he could gain knowledge of the robot from all angles .  the more it could study bogie before the robot arrived  the easier it would be to duplicate him .  further  it could store images of bogie   s movements in its own memory banks  so that it could duplicate him with derec or the others .   bogie came through the sliding wall  saying     you called  boss .         that is correct  bogie .  you are the first robot ever allowed into this sanctum by me .  i hope you are honored .         a singular honor  boss .  i   ll dine out on this for years .  it   ll impress all the dolls .  a doll in washington heights once got a fox fur out of me .      the watchful eye hadn   t the slightest idea what bogie was talking about  but that didn   t matter .  it had no more use for bogie anyway .   it moved out of its haven  walking on the short  rudimentary legs so adequate for the computer room .  sometimes it had been necessary to get through interstices in the machinery  to stretch itself to an elongated shape and worm its way  grabbing with even shorter legs  and more of them   through an opening .  at other times it had needed to puff itself out in order to roll through a chute or tunnel  at those times it retracted its legs .  but now it was perched on its conventional limbs  standing in front of bogie  who had to look down at it .      say  boss  you   re not what i expected .         you did not expect me to be so amorphous .         if you say so .  what i mean  i didn   t expect a blob .  from the movie of the same name .      this robot had gone too far with its research  the watchful eye decided .  shutting him off was  in a way  a kindness .   using bogie as a model  supplemented with the images it had already stored  the watchful eye began transforming itself .  bogie watched silently as the blob began to grow in height and shrink in width .  soon its legs lengthened and it grew arms .  a moment later it was in a clearly humanoid shape .  even quicker came the changes that made it clearly a robot .  last were the delicate shifts in the facial and bodily look that gave it features and characteristics .  but it was not until the watchful eye had finished its transformation that bogie recognized it .      hey     he said     you   re me now  boss .  that   s a nifty trick .  how   d you do it .         that is not necessary for you to know  bogie .  i must explain to you now  because i want you to realize  that i will have to disconnect you now .         disconnect .  you mean  rub me out .         that is exactly what i do mean .  i need to observe our visitors up close  arid so i am going to pose as you .  that means i cannot take the chance of anyone discovering you here and guessing my disguise .  further  you are the only robot to be allowed into my presence  and so you have already seen too much and cannot be allowed even to carry that information in your memory banks .  also  you are no longer of any use to me .  so i must disconnect you .         it   s like shooting the messenger  i guess .         i do not understand the reference .      bogie explained what derec had said about messengers while the watchful eye opened the control panel in his back .      boss .         yes .         when i am activated again  i won   t remember anything .  i won   t even have this identity .  i   ll be reprogrammed .         if you are activated again  all that would be true .         if .         your existence is a threat to my safety .  i must protect myself  so i must destroy you .         oh .  i understand .  well  boss  i guess it   s goodbye  huh .         there is no need for amenities between us .      just before the watchful eye disconnected the final wire  bogie said     well  we   ll always have paris .      after bogie was shut off  the watchful eye  with the precision of a surgeon  broke him up into his components .  he carried the parts to a recycling chute  from which they would eventually be collected and taken to a robot recycling facility  where they would be used in the construction of new robots .   the watchful eye continued on down the corridor .  it wanted to reach derec   s quarters before bogie was missed .     chapter     save the last dancer for me    ariel was exhausted but too jittery to sleep  she had spent the better part of two days working alternately with avery and the dancers .   avery was  as doctors or med bots might say  responding to treatment .  under ariel   s relentless questioning  assisted by many queries from adam  she had briefed him on the types of questions to ask   the doctor had sunk into a depressed but much more rational state .  he treated adam politely  even though adam had chosen to continue to look like him .   sometimes  when adam asked avery a question  ariel got confused .  the question would be in avery   s old  madder voice   abrupt  condescending  sharp dictioned   but the real avery would respond in an un averylike voice  quieter  kinder  sad .  yet the technique  one never used before in psychiatric circles   a robot interrogator who could become an exact double of the patient   seemed to have good effects .  avery   s responses to adam tended to dig deeper into the man   s psyche  brought out more interesting possibilities .  his responses to ariel were more evasive  cloudier .  it became her task to follow up on the clues drawn out by adam .  she would zero in on any hint  any opportunity  make any remarks about any revelations  do anything  finally  to make avery talk .   in the last two days  avery had become more relaxed  calmer .  many of the things he said were still outrageous  and he could not get off the subject of wanting to dissect a dancer  but he no longer ranted  and his sarcasm was considerably reduced .  he seemed   to ariel at least   more rational  though hardly sane  and still not very nice .   now avery had concluded that he was better off as a human than he had been when he   d thought of himself as a robot .      no real insight there     ariel commented .     i should think that would be obvious .         no  no .  you do not understand me .     when he was misunderstood  he had a tendency to pat the outside of his right thigh nervously with his right hand .     i still think of robots as the greatest entities of all .  the perfect creatures  without emotion or aging  you know that old routine  i suspect .         i do .  schoolbook stuff back on aurora .  but i don   t agree that an invention without a true inner life or without feelings is worth being  no matter how long it exists .         well  i did .  in some ways i still do .  i   ve always wanted a life of the mind  not of the emotions .  and i   ve wanted to live longer than our natural lifespans .         an auroran lives so long  i   m surprised you   d even worry .  isn   t the real issue your fear of death .      he laughed scoffingly .     more schoolbook stuff  ariel .  if one wants to live forever  you reality distorters automatically knee jerk the idea of fear of death .         hey  i   m young and i fear death .         that attitude is only sensible .  we all have it .  but i don   t care about death itself .  if it comes  i   ll shake its hand and lead it off .  no  it   s the chance to watch history  to see what will happen further in science  that   s the reason i want the long life of a robot .  i want to see if the settler worlds will succeed or perish from their own boorish and violent ways .  i want to see if earth can somehow survive its terrible  claustrophobic ways of life  or will decay and be destroyed from the inside  becoming a ghost planet  a worn out memorial to what humanity once was .  i want to see if spacers           don   t get carried away by your own rhetoric  dr .  avery .  i get the message .  it   s not fear of death  it   s a need to know the future .         simplistically stated  but essentially correct .  at any rate  i spent so much time with robots and thought so much about them that eventually i wanted to be one  needed to be one .  i   d still like to be one .  the difference is i no longer believe i am one .      she turned the care of avery back to adam and took a short walk across the room to confront her other problem .  eve  now restored to her ariel form  sat beside the desk  merely staring at the dancers  the five who were left .  the other nine had all died quietly or  as avery would have it     ceased operation .      just looking at the remaining quintet made ariel sad .  she had hoped for great communicative advances when she had started working with the tiny creatures .  so little had really been accomplished .  the games were cute  and some of their behavior showed a minimal intelligence  but no language had been conveyed  only a few hand signals .  the gestures were significant  but not enough for ariel .   she had this faint sense that she had failed .  and the apparent success of her other project  avery  somehow did not compensate for her failure with the dancers .      anything new  eve .     she said as she sat down in her customary chair .      nothing .  they merely sit  holding hands like that .  they never even look up at us anymore .         perhaps they think that their gods are punishing them .         i do not understand .  their gods .         us  eve .         would you explain .         well  we   never mind .  ignore the comment .      there was something morbid about eve   s vigil over the remaining dancers .  each time one died  she insisted on taking it away  presumably to bury it .  ariel had never asked her where she went or exactly how she had performed the ritual .  she did not want to know .  the thought of eve in a lonely  dark area  performing death rites for a dancer made ariel shudder .   avery  still demanding that one be handed over to him for study  had fussed over the first four or five deaths .  ariel   s adamant support of eve had apparently discouraged him .  he had been silent on the matter for some time .  once she tried to introduce the subject  but he h   dd dismissed it with a wave of his hand .   at times ariel wished the dancers would finish their dying .  then she could return to derec and help him in restoring the city .  he had made some progress lately  managing to convince the computer to make all the lights of the city work again .  and some utility robots had been seen picking up street debris .  water no longer tasted brackish  and the food coming out of the processors actually had flavor .  but derec wasn   t satisfied  he said .  there were still so many things out of whack  and the essential mystery of why the city had deteriorated in their absence remained .   wolruf came into the room .  she was returning from stilt another meal with derec and mandelbrot .  ariel didn   t blame her for spending more time with them .  since adam had begun working with avery  there had been little for wolruf to do here .   coming to the desk  wolruf glanced down at the dancers .     they look worrse     u think .         much worse .         what can i do .         nothing much anyone can do .         could    u just sset them loosse .         why .         they could die in peace  alone .  on my worrld  there iss a custom of dying alone .         perhaps you   re right .  but i think it   s too late for such a compassionate act .  they   re too far gone .         yess  i ssee  i think .      when she turned her attention back to the desktop  ariel saw one of the dancers  a once chubby  now emaciated male  break his grip on two of the others and fall backward .   eve  now so used to a dancer   s passing  immediately scooped up the corpse and strode out of the room .  ariel  staring after her  said     and then there were four .  soon  none .  it won   t be long now .      she glanced over toward avery .  he was now looking at her with some concern in his face .  how sane of him  she thought .     timestep  in his corner  had seen bogie leave .  then  a short time later  he witnessed his return .  after bogie had gone back to his corner  timestep catalogued the oddities .  first  if not summoned by derec or even mandelbrot  why had bogie left the corner in the first place .  second  where had he gone .  third  why was his return so secretive .  fourth  an important fourth  what was it that looked so wrong about bogie .   derec reentered the room  followed by mandelbrot .  he was silent  his index finger tapping on his chin thoughtfully .  timestep studied the tap .  it was too slow  unrhythmic .  he would not have been able to use it for any dancing step he knew .   all the while he stood in his corner he called up from his memory banks the dances he had memorized and visualized how he would do them if his feet were not forbidden to move just now .    across the way  bogie appeared to lean forward  which seemed odd to timestep .  but then bogie had left the corner and returned to it on his own  so a simple bending at the waist should not seem so out of the ordinary .      bogie .     derec called  and bogie came out of his corner .  did timestep observe a hesitation before his companion moved .      did you think we   d forgotten you  bogie .     derec asked .   bogie hesitated before saying     that you would forget about me would not occur to me  master derec .         you seem a little sluggish .  and what   s this master derec .  what happened to    kid        kiddo        pal    .         i felt momentarily respectful  mast   kiddo .      derec narrowed his eyes as he stared at bogie .     are you functional .  should i send you to the robot repair facility for a diagnostic scan or a tune up .         that will not be necessary .  pal .      for a moment derec seemed unsure .     that   s okay     he finally said .     tell me  bogie  what do you know about our mysterious controller .         i know nothing of a mysterious controller  sir .         weren   t you supposed to tell me there was a block on that information  something like that .      again bogie hesitated .     the nature of the block upon information does not include such a question as the one you asked .  kid .      derec smiled .     very good .  it was a sort of    do you still beat your wife    question  wasn   t it .         i do not have a wife .  kiddo .         it   d be an idea  though .  robot husbands and wives .  robot families .  i might work on it when the mess here is cleared up .  would you like a family  bogie .         i cannot have a family .         isn   t there a family feeling among robots .         no  sir .  pal .         okay  okay .  you   ll have to forgive me .  i   m bone weary  and my mind isn   t even forming casual conversation effectively .  bogie .         yes  master   pal .         i need wolruf back here .  go to the medical facility and fetch her .         fetch .         bring her back here .  in fact  since she just left  you might be able to catch up with her even before she reaches the medical facility .  well  what are you waiting for .  get a move on .         yes  sir .      derec stared at the empty doorway for a long while after bogie left .  he seemed preoccupied .  then he turned suddenly and bellowed     timestep .      timestep immediately left his corner and went to derec .     yes  master derec .         is something wrong with bogie .  anything another robot can discern .         i do not know  sir .         let me put it another way .  was that bogie who just left here .         i do not know  sir .      derec looked worried .     well  that   s some progress .  you would know for certain if it was  wouldn   t you  timestep .         yes  master derec .         then there   s a possibility that something has happened to bogie .         yes  that seems possible .         is he malfunctioning .         i do not know  sir .         right .  i have to phrase the question differently .  is there a possibility that a robot such as bogie could malfunction .         it is possible  but there would have to be a reason .  he would have to be forced to resolve a dilemma involving the laws of robotics  or he would have to be given an order he could not carry out .         are they the only possible reasons for him to act uncharacteristically .         no .         what   s another .         he is no longer bogie as we knew him .  he has been reprogrammed or has reprogrammed himself .         mandelbrot .  do you agree with timestep .         yes .  but there is another possibility .  i tried to speak with him through comlink and he did not respond to his name .  also  there was a series of nicks along his right side before .  they are no longer there .         what do you think about him .         i think it is not bogie .  i think it is someone else .         our mysterious controller .         i cannot know that .  but it is a possibility .         timestep  what about this .  could it not be bogie .         that is possible  sir .         go after him  the both of you .  corner him .  bring him back to me .      the two robots left the room  and derec began to pace .  he sensed that he was going to regain his control of the city .  even the chemfets inside him seemed to be reviving .     the rest of the dancers did not survive for long .  eve disposed of the next three  then returned for a somber death watch over the last  the formerly sturdy woman who had been the leader of the dancers .  she was lying in the center of the desk  looking pale and weak  with no one to hold on to anymore .  ariel had leaned down close  watching the slight breathing movements of her tiny chest .      i wonder what she thinks     ariel said to wolruf     iss odd to me to wonderr what such a ssmall being thinkss .         oh .  we humans wonder about such things all the time .  part of our charm  our limitless curiosity about the universe .         i have at timess noticed ssuch .      avery  weary of the session with adam  came to the desk .  he stared down at the remaining dancer  whose arms rose upward for a moment in a characteristically graceful way .      let me have this one     he said softly  sounding quite sane about it .     she is our last chance to find out something about them .         no     eve said .     i must take care of her .         your care of them has been admirable  eve     avery said     but we shouldn   t waste this one on mere ritual  especially on ritual misunderstood by a robot .  ariel .  it   s your decision really .         and you   ll abide by it .      he sighed theatrically  as if assuming any judgment would be against him .     i will .      ariel looked from eve to avery  not certain how to say what she had been planning to say for some time .      eve  dr .  avery is right .  we must know about them  we           but i must bury her .      in a quick move  she picked up the last dancer from the desktop and held it close to her chest .      eve  put her back .  you can   t bury her right now .  she is still alive .         alive is not the correct word     avery said .      shut up with your logic for once     ariel said .     eve  i order you to return the dancer to the desk .  you must obey my order .  that is the second law  and the laws are part of you  isn   t that true .  you sense them inside you  don   t you .         no .  yes .  i cannot be sure .  something seems to tell me to obey you  but i am not sure that i can .         you must .  it is second law .         it is not just second law     adam said .  he was standing behind avery .     it is what we must do .  we cannot continue if we do not discover what is wrong with the city  and the dancers are part of the mystery .  return the dancer  eve .      eve gently settled the dancer back onto the desktop  then resumed her customary vigil .      eve     ariel said gently     it is important to me to know whether or not these tiny creatures are living beings or merely some kind of experimental robots or even  as dr .  avery has suggested  toys .         they are robots     eve said .     i have sensed no life in them  the kind of life i have felt coming from you  derec  wolruf .  what i detect in them is the same as what comes to me from mandelbrot and the other robots .     she pointed to the last dancer .     this  i believe  is a robot .      ariel was shocked .     you mean  you   ve known this all the time and not said anything about it .         you did not request it from me .  and no  i did not know it all the time .  or even most of the time .  when i first encountered these creatures in the vacant lot  i received my first glimmerings .  as adam did at the time  i felt little life in them .  but i had not experienced much of this world  or any other world  and i was not sure at the time what constituted a living being and what constituted a robot .  as i watched the dancers  i understood more and more what they were .  my certainty has only come recently .         eve  i           eve     avery interrupted     what do you feel coming from adam  coming from inside yourself .  do you feel  as you say  a living being or robot .         i cannot say .  it is different .  we are different .         that is so     adam said .     since i came to awareness on the kin   s planet  i have not been certain what i am .  i accept that we are robots  but actually  inside myself  i feel neither living being nor robot .         fair enough     avery said .      eve     ariel said     if you knew the dancers were not human  why did you treat them as humans .         i was not aware i was .         you cared for them  awarded them human death rituals  buried them as if they   d died .  if they   re robots  then they didn   t really die and didn   t need to be treated as such .         they ceased to exist     eve said .     isn   t a robot   s death as significant as a human   s .         mistress ariel     adam said     you buried the robot jacob winterson on the blackbodies    planet  did you not .         but that   s   i was about to say it was different  but you   re right  adam  it   s not .  i cared about jacob the way eve apparently cared for the dancers .  you did care for them  didn   t you  eve .         i am not sure what you mean .  i performed rituals that i believed were appropriate .         don   t go robotic on me now  eve .  you did feel compassion for them  sadness when they died .         there was an awareness of loss .  is that sadness  ariel .         i don   t know  eve .  i   m not even sure i can get a sense of it .      they watched each other silently for a time  then both looked down at the last dancer .  she was still breathing .      i must still order you  eve     ariel said     to allow dr .  avery to perform his examination without interference .  we need to know the facts that his work will show us .         yes .  that now seems logical .         logical .  why logical now .         enough information has been presented to me  and i understand the need .  so i conclude agreement .         no wonder you are not sure what you are .  i   m not sure what you are  both of you .      when the last dancer had died  hours later  avery gently picked it up from the desktop and went to a far comer of the room .  a few minutes later he came back with a number of slides .  placing them under a microscopic scanner and transmitting images of his findings onto its large screen  he showed ariel the infinitesimal microchips and circuit boards  miniature servo motors  linkages  wires .      as i suspected     avery said  but without his usual smugness     they are cleverly designed albeit ineffective robots capable of limited humanlike behavior .  the use of genetic materials was skillful  but the maker could not compensate for their rapid aging process .  if he had  these might have been quite successful little humaniform robots .      ariel stared at the screen without visible emotion .  she didn   t know what to feel .  relief that they were not tiny humans or sadness that  whatever they were  they had existed and only for a very short time .   finally  she took a cloth and wiped off the desktop .     well     she said     that   s it then .  let   s go see if we can help derec .      before they left  avery handed eve a small box .  when eve asked what it was  he said it was the remains of the last dancer .  he was turning it over to her for whatever disposal she chose .  she carried it away .     chapter     flight    the watchful eye realized as it left derec that its disguise had not fooled him .  it had come to that conclusion by analyzing the purposes of his probing questions  reading his facial expressions  and interpreting his body language .   in its studies of humans  it had called up from the computer a file on metalinguistics and paralanguage .    as it fled  the watchful eye wondered just where it had gone wrong in its bogie portrayal .  perhaps the mistake had been to try to imitate a robot in the first place .  after all  it was too complicated a being  too powerful an intellectual force  to get away with posing as a mere robot .  on the other hand  the flaw in its behavior may have been an error of pride .  it may have felt too easily superior to bogie  and robots in general  to pretend to be one effectively .  somewhere in the research  it had read that actors often succeeded because they immersed themselves in their roles  losing their real identity in them .  it should have studied bogie more .  oddly enough  it thought  its failure in the robot guise reinforced its belief that it was definitely not a robot itself .   perhaps its real error had been in leaving the safety of its haven in the computer chamber .  the haven was where it belonged .  perhaps it was never meant to leave it  or at least not to stray too far from it .  perhaps its existence was that of an armchair observer  participating at a distance  pulling strings like a puppetmaster .   what should it do now .  it wondered .  derec had ordered it to find wolruf  but wolruf was too much of a threat  and the caninoid alien might be with the other humans  all of whom might be able to detect that it wasn   t what it seemed to be .  for a moment  as it had left the room  it had felt a compulsion to do what derec said  treating it as a second law command .  but if it wasn   t a robot  why should it obey derec .  it couldn   t even be sure derec was a proper human  or a human at all .   at any rate  the order had been given to bogie  and the watchful eye was not bogie .  if it were human  it had the power of choice  if it were robot  it did not have to follow orders given to another robot  if it were animal or alien  it could follow animal or alien instincts .   since derec might spread the word that it was not bogie  there was no reason to stay out here in the streets  where the others could track it down and trap it .   as it headed toward the tunnel that led directly down to the central computer  it wondered if it could even continue its activities in robot city .  with derec and ariel there  it had enemies  and it could not abide enemies .  nevertheless  it didn   t want to eliminate them  as sensible a solution as that might be .  something inside it prevented it from killing .   suddenly it realized how it could give the intruders a setback  assert its power  allow itself to maintain control of the city  mold an environment that would be suitable for it instead of humans  and make it the powerful entity it had decided to be .   it would just accelerate the program it had planned all along by skipping a few steps and going directly to the main goal .   it would destroy  then rebuild  robot city .     wolruf had left ariel and the others for her nocturnal roaming of the city .  she had come from a place whose inhabitants traveled through the night compulsively  searching for answers to questions they had not always known they had .  while she subdued the urge at most times  tonight  after watching the end of the dancers  she had known she must be alone .  she climbed over the smaller buildings  raced down dark streets in long loping strides  crouched at the edges of roofs .   rounding a corner  she collided with a robot she recognized as bogie .      bogie .  what arre    u doing here .      but the robot did not answer .  it merely leaped over wolruf and raced on  around the corner from which wolruf had come .      stop .     said a voice .  it was mandelbrot  coming toward wolruf so fast he would have run her down if she had not jumped adeptly out of the way .  the robot timestep tapped along behind mandelbrot .      there iss something wrrong  mandelbrot  i can ssee     wolruf said .           only crush when ssomething iss wrrong .         excuse me  wolruf     mandelbrot said .     we are on urgent business .  i cannot stop to explain .      he sped past her .  her curiosity aroused  she raced after him on all fours .  timestep danced his way after them .      i can help    u .  arre    u following bogie .         no .      they rounded the corner .  wolruf saw bogie  still moving rapidly  up ahead .         u sseem to be following bogie .         no .         what arre    u doing .         trying to overtake the bogie that is not bogie .         the bogie not bogie .  explain  pleasse .      as they rushed along  mandelbrot told the alien what had happened .      then    u arre to brring that rrobot back to derec .         yes .         let me catch him forr    u .      with a strong  leaping thrust  wolruf surged ahead of mandelbrot and timestep .  her body low to the ground  she closed the gap between herself and the watchful eye in a matter of seconds .  her prey was not even aware of her pursuit .   with her last few powerful steps  wolruf propelled herself into the air .  her leap was magnificent  a smooth arc that reached such an impressive height she was able to dive down upon the fleeing robot .  her forelegs hit its shoulders with a mighty impact  knocking it forward onto its face .  wolruf landed on top of it .  she was able to hold it down long enough for the others to arrive .   rolling off the watchful eye  she looked up to see mandelbrot standing over them .      whoever you are     mandelbrot said     derec orders you to return to him with us .         whoever .     the watchful eye said .     i am bogie .         no  you are not .  i can see that now .         what makes you think so .         you have not copied bogie   s voice accurately  although the ability is programmed into you .  there was a rough sound in bogie   s voice that yours lacks .      another mistake  then .  the watchful eye should have adapted its voice to the robot   s .  for a moment  it wondered if it should have bothered with bogie at all .  for a botched piece of strategy  that robot was now parts on the repair facility floor .  the watchful eye could not feel regret  but it was conscious of the waste caused by ineffective action .      if you know i am not bogie     it said     then you may guess that i don   t have to do what you say .      without waiting for mandelbrot to continue the discussion  the watchful eye kicked out at mandelbrot   s leg  the surprise move made mandelbrot topple over  landing with an impressive clanking sound upon the pavement .   the watchful eye stood up quickly  feeling more in control of its unaccustomed robot body than before .  it turned to find wolruf leaping toward it .  with a vicious backhand blow  it struck wolruf in the neck .  choking  falling backward  wolruf collapsed .  she landed awkwardly on her back legs .  causing them both to throb with intense pain .   the watchful eye jumped over the fallen alien and tried to continue its run  but timestep  with a dancing twirl  tripped it up .  it stumbled  but this time did not fall .  when it regained its balance  it ran at timestep so quickly that the robot did not have time even to consider his third law responsibility .   it wrestled timestep to the pavement but then  in an abrupt move  broke its hold and raced away .  it had progressed half a block before mandelbrot stood up .  however  since he regarded wolruf the same way he did humans  first law compelled him to kneel down beside the fallen alien to see if she was in need of help .      i am fine     wolruf said in a faint voice .  she could barely talk .         u go on .  continue purrsuit .  i will go to derec .      wolruf watched mandelbrot and timestep chase after the strange robot .  when they were out of sight  she struggled to her feet .  the pain from her legs seemed to be traveling through her whole body .   her run to derec was done at a much slower pace then usual .     the watchful eye wished it had been able to imitate a robot   s speed  but its mimicry did not automatically give it full physical control .  unlike a normal avery robot  it skidded around corners and bumped into obstacles .  each little delay was allowing its pursuers to get closer .   it had one advantage over mandelbrot and timestep .  it knew where it was going .   the tunnel was not too far away now .  after looking back at its pursuers  it quickly calculated the time it would take them to close the gap between them and it .  it was likely they would overtake it a few meters from the tunnel entrance .   it needed a diversion .   it flashed into its mind a map of the area and discovered that there was a building coming up on its right that stored several of the results of its genetic experiments .  this had been one of its latest experiments  and many from this batch of creatures were still functioning .   if it went through this building  which had a rear exit  and could slow down its pursuers by doing so  it could reach the tunnel entrance easily .   as mandelbrot   s footsteps became louder  sounding as if he were ready to climb onto its back  the watchful eye took an abrupt right turn toward the building .  it ran at such velocity that it hit the entrance with an impact that sent the thick door flying open .   inside  bright light illuminated an enormous room .  spread across its floor  on shelves  sprawled over furniture  was a large group of rejects from the watchful eye   s experiments .   the beings of this particular group  the one it had created just before the arrival of the intruders  were somewhat larger than the dancers and built with less delicacy .  they were thick muscled  with bulges all over their bodies  bulges that did not actually correspond accurately with the protuberances of the human body .   toughness was their chief trait .  continually knocking against each other and starting fights  playing games that usually ended in fierce brawling  executing odd practical jokes  or banding together into groups and staging small battles that contained more strategy than one would expect  they had some resemblance to frontier people on the settler planets and in earth   s history .   in contrast to the roughness of their natures  they had organized themselves into a fairly intricate society  including a government laden with bribery and graft .  the watchful eye had been quite taken with this group  but had had to reject it because it exhibited too many weaknesses  and outside of their corrupt politics and a tendency toward lively song  they had displayed minimal intelligence .   most of its experiments were failures because they turned out to be too limited  even though each group displayed different characteristics .  it had wanted to discover more about the laws of humanics  which stated  more or less  that human beings must not harm themselves or allow others to come to harm  must not give robots dangerous orders  and must not harm robots unless the action could save other human beings   but its experimental creations generally became too independent  forming their own societies and proving nothing about the ethics that were the foundation of the laws .   on one side of the room  a large group was singing a raucous song  while a wild melee ensued near the watchful eye   s feet .  stepping carefully into spaces the tiny creatures tended to create when one of the larger entities came into the room that was their world  it managed to get about one third of the way across the room before mandelbrot and timestep came through the open doorway .  the watchful eye looked back for a moment and saw what it had expected .  the two robots had come to a standstill .  uncertain of how to wind their way across the overpopulated room  they further wondered if their actions here should be governed by the first law of robotics .  they were not sure if the law even applied to this situation .  it walked on  knowing that even if there were creatures under its foot as it came down  they were used to visitors and adept enough to scamper out of the way .  it easily reached the other side of the room  where some of the male citizens performed odd mating rituals with the females .   there had been no actual mating in any of the experimental creatures    societies  although pairing off and flirtation were not uncommon .    before mandelbrot and timestep could work their way cautiously across the room  the watchful eye was on a new street and making its way toward its tunnel escape route .  in its mind  coolly analytical in spite of the danger around it  it continued to formulate its plan for the destruction of robot city .     chapter     adam and eve and pinch me    adam found eve standing at the entrance to a small park set in the middle of one of several robot city building clusters .  this cluster included a small art museum  a library  an auditorium meant for music performance  and one of those plazas with customerless commercial shops that dotted the city .  the park itself was a circle of trees just inside a small metallic picket fence  with attractive groupings of benches  bushes  and flower beds throughout .   although eve stood still and looked into the park  it was clear to adam that she was not studying its landscape or evaluating its function .  she was staring at a particular comer  assuring herself that the activity she had just completed there had left no trace .   he stood by her side for a long while before speaking .  she continued to resemble ariel  while adam had changed from avery back to derec .  an outside observer might have judged them to be as romantically involved as the two humans were  the way they stood together silently against the park   s romantic setting .  but that was only another facet of their mimicry  and romance was not a part of their repertoire  unless their creator had some later surprise to spring upon them .      this is where the dancers are .     he asked .      yes .         you have buried all of them someplace in this park .         some of them .  others are elsewhere .         do you know why you have performed this ritual .         it seemed appropriate .  when we encountered the first group in that lot  they were burying their dead .  i finished that job  so it seemed to me balanced that i do the same task for the dancers .  i thought that  whatever they were  someone should perform the rites that appeared to be appropriate to their society .  am i wrong .         i would have no way of knowing that .  right and wrong seem to be the kind of polarity to which beings like derec and ariel and or .  avery give importance .  they are concerned with moral values .  we do not have to be  except as they apply to us .         i thought we were moral beings  too .         we are .  but we do not have to fret in the way that they do about values .  and ours are less complicated  governed only by the distinctions of set codes of behavior .  you have seen how they cannot even agree among themselves on an issue .         yes .  dr .  avery seems almost like an enemy of derec and ariel  while derec and ariel do not always get along with each other .  why cannot they agree on proper rules of conduct  adam .         i do not know .  we must observe them further .         they differed in their attitudes about the dancers .  ariel seemed genuinely sorrowful about their deaths  while avery appeared to be indifferent .         he was fearful of his own death .  he admitted that .         yes .  i have no real idea what death is .  it seems to be an operational being becoming nonoperational .         i believe that is somewhat accurate .  did you have feelings about the dancers when they became nonoperational .         i cannot answer you .  something was in my head but i do not know what .  i thought perhaps it was a positronic disturbance  but i am not sure .  all i know was that as i carried each dancer away from the medical facility  i sensed that there was an injustice in their lives  but i could not yet discern what .  if that is feelings  then i may be a robot with feelings .         the evidence is inconclusive at best .  will you bury more of these people if we discover their corpses .         yes  if it is possible .         should you wish it  i will help you .      they stood a while longer  then adam said     when i was helping dr .  avery  he told me a story .  he said i should know it because of our names .  it went like this  adam and eve and pinch me went out to take a swim .  adam and eve got drowned  and who got saved .      eve waited for adam to continue .  when he did not  she said     that is incomprehensible as a story  adam .         no  you   re supposed to answer the question .  perhaps it is a riddle .  try again  adam and eve got drowned  and who got saved .         logic seems to indicate pinch me .         that   s right .  and then i am supposed to do this .      adam put his hand against her arm  finger and thumb spread .  gradually he brought the two digits together and pressed against her skin in an approximation of a human pinch .   adam dropped his hand away .  eve watched the gesture and said     and .  .  .  .         and what .         what is the point .         i do not know .  i didn   t know when dr .  avery did it either  but he seemed to think it was worth smiling about .  when i asked him to explain it  he became angry .         do you think it is an allegory .  you see  adam and eve die and then pinch me is the survivor .  therefore  the teller touches the listener in a shared satisfaction that life goes on when other people die .  do you think that was what dr .  avery was trying to convey .         perhaps .  he appears to want to live on very much  so this could have been his way of explaining life to me .  these people can be like that  telling stories laced with obscurity when data is required .         i suspect that data is not always essential to them .  come  let   s find them .      in the distance there was an odd popping sound .  looking up  adam and eve saw an entire building flying above them  high in the air .      what is that .     eve said .      it appears that a building has left its foundation and taken flight .  odd .  when the robots remove a building from the city  it just disappears and is replaced by a new one .  it does not generally fly through the air .  something is wrong .  we must find derec and ariel .        chapter     avery redux    derec recognized the change in his father as soon as the man came into the room .  avery   s usually tense face  now drawn and tired with a sad darkness around his eyes  had relaxed .  its features were softer  and his eyes and mouth were not agitated by nervousness .  neither was his body .  he moved with an uncharacteristic slowness .  his fingers were still .  that was the real oddity .  his hands  usually so active  were not moving .  derec had become so used to the way avery   s fingers drummed against things   furniture  his clothing   that their lack of movement was like a sudden silence in a jungle  too disturbing to cause calm .   ariel looked a bit different  too  exhausted  eyelids drooping  mouth slack  no spring to her walk .      isn   t wolruf with you .     derec asked ariel .      she was  but she took off on her own .  you know how she does .         i sent for her .         i don   t know anything about that .      derec nodded .  his suspicions seemed confirmed .     i sent bogie to bring her here  except that i don   t think it was really bogie i sent .         what do you mean .      he explained .      you think somebody   s done something to bogie .     ariel asked .      possibly .  or it wasn   t bogie at all .         how could that be .         i don   t know  but timestep seemed to agree with me .  he and mandelbrot went after him .      avery  who had lingered at the door  stepped forward .     maybe it was the individual you   ve been looking for .  the one behind the city   s shutdown .      derec considered the possibility .     you may be right .  it   s worth considering anyway .  but could he disguise himself as bogie .      avery shrugged .     when you don   t know the identity of your antagonist  there   s very little to conclude .  we need hard evidence .         i heard that    we         ariel said .     does that mean you want to work with us .         it doesn   t mean anything     avery replied .     at least not what you insinuate .  i may no longer believe i   m a robot  and you may be smug about how you prodded me back to normality with your cheap tricks and psychologizing  but it does not mean i am somehow  as your tone implied  your ally .         well  pardon me     ariel said in mock anger .     derec  i think the train   s returned to the station .  your father is his old self again .      derec didn   t know how much he could appreciate that .  he had not liked dr .  avery in their earlier encounters and didn   t relish having to deal closely with him again .  and this was the man  after all  who had injected the chemfets into him  which had certainly turned out to be a mixed blessing .  but avery was also his father  and that had to count for something .  if only the doctor would treat him like a son for a change .      well     derec said glumly     we can use any help you might be able to give us .         of course you could .  the city is deteriorating .  i   d want my help  too .  i   d demand it .  i didn   t put you in charge to oversee its decline and fall .      avery   s words stung derec .  it seemed as if the man was continually judging him  and finding him wanting .      i think you two should get to know each other     ariel said .     you don   t need me around for that .  i   m going to take a stroll .  perhaps i can find the missing bogie .  i mean  the real one .      she walked out  an impish look on her face .  she knew exactly what she was doing .  the two averys had to meet each other head to head  something neither of them could do with her around .  she wasn   t sure why  but she thought something would have to happen between them  for good or ill .   after she left  avery observed     well  your girlfriend   s ploy is quite obvious .         stop .  don   t make her sound trivial by calling her my girlfriend .         sorry .  i thought you two were           we are  but she means more to me than that .         i   ll choose better words .  do you like paramour  foxy lady  lollapalooza  some dish  the cat   s pyjamas  a tomato           what are you talking about .         just earth slang .  i   m a collector of ancient colloquialisms .         you told me something like that in a dream .         did i .     avery began to walk around the room slowly .  he looked a bit more like his old self now  a shadow of it anyway .     well  i don   t put much stock in dream mysteries .  symbols and clairvoyance and that sort of bilgewater scum .  buried in your brain somewhere  although you don   t remember it  you must remember observing me using the old slang terms .         do you remember me observing you .      avery   s face softened .  he looked almost kind .      yes .  many times .  you used to come to my lab  sit on a high stool for hours  and watch me work .  you not only picked up some of my scientific terminology  and probably my ancient lowdown slang  you were able to repeat a considerable number of my curses when you were a very young age .  embarrassed your mother no end           my mother .  she   s been in my dreams  too .  she           i don   t want to hear about your trivial dreams .  you would probably assail me with sentimental theories  interpretations .  i can do without psychobabble  believe me .  let   s get back to business  we           no  wait .  my mother  did she have blond hair  hazel eyes .      avery looked astonished .     well  that   s true .  i didn   t think you could  that is  i thought you had no memories of her .         no .      the word was spoken so vehemently that derec realized the subject must be difficult for him .  although he drew back from it  derec had no intention of dropping it altogether .  he would find out about her in any way he could .      was i a difficult child .     he asked instead .   avery appeared ready to explode with anger .      can   t you get your bloody mind off nostalgic sentiment .  we have to   no  wait  i   m sorry .  i can be insensitive  i know that .  it must be strange to you  having me as a father .  i suppose an outsider might accuse me of having episodes of delusional paranoia  or perhaps intense megalomania .  i hate such terms .  would be interpreters of life hide behind words like that .  sometimes it seems that such words make them sound like they know something  instead of being the ignoramuses they are .      derec was confused by the changes in his father   s tone .  he could sound like a normal father at one moment  even a rational human being  but then switch in mid sentence to the sound of madness .  ariel   s treatment of him may have made him a more sensible human being  but clearly it had not completely cured him .      yes  derec     he said  his voice now eerily warm     you had a more normal childhood than you suspect .  parents who doted on you and all that .  you liked robots  and you picked up theories of robotics the way other children learn their letters and numbers .  i helped you build your very own utility robot .  you don   t remember positron  do you .         no .      he felt sad that he did not .      that was the name you gave your robot .  of course  he was just a utility robot and didn   t even have a positronic brain  but i thought the name had a certain charm  and so i didn   t correct you .  i suspect i didn   t have to correct you .  even that young  you probably knew what you were doing .  you always know what you   re doing .         i wish that was true .         isn   t it .         i   m afraid not .         well  maybe the amnesia robbed you of some confidence  but you   re an avery  as much as you resist the idea of being related to me .  it may insult you for me to say it  but there are times when you do remind me of me .         it may surprise you for me to say it  but no  i   m not insulted .  if i had your skills in robotics  i   d be  well  proud .      was it his imagination  derec wondered  or did his father   s eyes momentarily glaze over .  as he looked more closely into the man   s cool and detached eyes  he decided it must have been imagination .      well     avery finally said     you   re pretty skilled in that area already .  you may surpass me   and don   t say anything more about it now .  we should pursue other subjects .         we will .  in a moment .  i have to know one thing  then i   ll let you off the hook .         just don   t mistake me for an affectionate father .         i could hardly do that .      avery had walked away from derec  and his back was turned to him .      you said we were once close     derec said .     why did that change .      the answer came out abruptly  bitterly .      your mother left me .         tell me about her .          no .      this time his    no    was spoken softly  but with no less firmness .  derec was going to have to work hard to find out anything about her  that was abundantly clear .      derec     avery said softly     even talking with you is difficult for me .  don   t expect a plethora of revelations .      derec nodded .     all right  i won   t .      he wondered if he should walk to his father  perhaps embrace him  perhaps ask him if they could start over  perhaps suggest that he would still like to sit on a high stool and watch avery work .   he took one step toward his father but was interrupted by a noise at the door .  turning around  he saw wolruf limp into the room .  she was clearly on the point of collapsing .   derec rushed to her and caught her before she fell .  gently he eased her to the floor and felt for her pulse .  the slow rate of her pulse beneath her normally cold skin assured derec that whatever injuries she may have sustained  she was alive and not in immediate danger .   avery  reaching over his son   s shoulder  delicately spread areas of wolruf   s fur apart .  she winced with pain .      there seems to be a bruise on her neck     he said     a big one .         he strruck me there     wolruf said in a raspy voice .      who .     derec asked .     who hit you .         the bogie that iss not bogie .         all right  wolruf .  i want you to tell me about it .  but don   t strain your voice .  speak quietly  slowly .      she explained what had happened when she had caught up with bogie  and how mandelbrot and timestep had continued the chase .      okay     derec said when she finished     you rest right here .  we   ll get you to the medical facility as soon as we can .         no  derrec .  i will be fine ssoon .  you have too much that   ss necessary to do now .         well  we   ll see .      derec stood up and turned to his father  asking     what do you make of it .         i have some suspicions  but you tell me what you think first .      derec felt an odd pride in the way avery solicited his opinion  almost as if they were colleagues now .      well     he said     whoever attacked wolruf  it wasn   t bogie .         i agree  but why .         it simply wasn   t a robot city robot .  they are all programmed to accept her as a human .  that is  although they know she is an alien  they are to apply the laws of robotics to her  too .  if bogie was stopped by her  he would have had to allow it  according to first law .  instead  he retaliated .         was he reprogrammed perhaps  while you were off planet .         i don   t think so .  he was a proper robot previous to this incident  applying all the laws to his behavior .  no  if bogie attacked wolruf  he was not bogie .  i sensed a change in him before i sent him on an errand .  i rather liked bogie  and this one simply did not respond like the bogie i   d known .  and  by the way  all indications are that the robot i ordered to go to ariel never even tried to get there  another clue that i didn   t give the order to bogie  who would have been compelled by second law to obey it .  furthermore  in responding to wolruf   s leap upon him  he seems to have been using third law  that of protecting himself  but first and second law would have prevented him from doing so .         okay  good .  then if he wasn   t bogie  who was he .         an alien .         what alien .  except for wolruf  i haven   t encountered any aliens .  you have  what with aranimas and your erstwhile friends  the blackbodies .  none of them have any talent for disguise  nor have the few alien races that have been reported .  a human might pull off such a disguise  get into a robot suit and do a fairly accurate imitation  but there is no evidence of any other humans but us on the entire planet .  if i were still mad  we might have made out a good case for it being me .     he laughed softly  sardonically  then said reflectively     i did so want to be a robot .  i still say the role would have suited me .  so  derec  who do you think it might be .         how about a robot  one that   s not programmed in the same manner as a robot city robot .      avery   s eyes raised in admiration .     very good .  you   re right on the line of my thinking .  it   s a robot  i   m sure  but not an avery robot .         why are you so sure .         it would have to be some kind of rogue robot .  not my style at all .  an avery robot would not have so much confusion about the three laws .  no  somebody else made this robot  and i have a sneaking suspicion who .         who .  tell me .      avery shook his head slowly .     not now .  in a moment .  i have some questions to ask you .  i need to know about adam and eve .  your view of them .  i know where they came from  what they   ve done so far .  adam gave me a pretty full history during our marathon sessions together .  what do you think of them .  robotically speaking  i mean .         i   m not sure what you want .         free associate about them  if you like .          well  i don   t know .     he paused  trying to collect his thoughts .     sometimes they don   t seem like robots .         uh huh .  i   ve noticed .         one thing  they can be too mischievous .  i know some of it   s curiosity and some of it has to do with their over meticulous attempts to define some kind of impossible human being  an ideal we apparently fail to live up to .  as a result  their hold on the laws of robotics is shaky .         that seems to be because they apply them too specifically .  rather than accept us as the perfect humans they seek  they strip us of our humanity in their minds  and the result is that they don   t always jump to our aid according to first law  or obey us as second commands .         that   s not all of it  though .  they don   t seem to be certain that they are robots  in spite of all evidence .  they accept it and don   t accept it simultaneously .  it   s as if their mechanisms are so refined  they can   t be ordinary robots like the others .      avery winced .     by ordinary  you mean avery robots .         what   s wrong .         i don   t like to think of my creations as somehow second class models .      derec smiled .     if you say so  but i don   t think it   s a criticism of your skills as a roboticist .  at any rate  their behavior is inconsistent .  sometimes they seem to be normal robots  at other times they are excellent copies of whomever they   ve imprinted on .  adam does a mean wolruf  and eve   s version of ariel makes me edgy because it   s too accurate .         it   s this shape changing ability that fascinates me  derec .  explain it to me .      under avery   s sharp questioning  derec revealed what he had observed about the silversides  about the differences in their cellular structure  about the sequences of physical transformation during the imprinting process  about the shifts in matter density when they took on the shapes of either smaller or larger beings  about the limits to which they could reduce or enlarge their mass .   neither could approximate the size of small animals or insects  but could look like enormous versions of them .  by the same token  if giants had been available  they could not stretch themselves to that size  either .  when they had shaped their mass into a blackbody imprint  they had been about twice the size of that impressive flying alien .    excited by the information  revived by the challenge of a scientific dilemma  avery seemed more and more his old self .  he now stood by a desk  his fingers drumming in a fast  steady rhythm .  his other hand kept touching his long white hair or bushy moustache .  his eyes glowed again .   when derec had related all he could remember  avery balled up his hand into a fist and rammed it hard against his upper thigh .      that   s it .     he cried .     that must be it .         i hope you   ll let me in on it  since i   m thoroughly confused now .         bogie   the robot posing as bogie is a silverside .         you mean adam or eve .  really  i don   t think so .  they weren   t even here when things started to go wrong .  they were with me on           i don   t mean literally adam and eve .  i mean silverside generically .  there is another of these robots like adam and eve somewhere in robot city .         another one .     for a moment  derec was appalled at the prospect of a third mischievous robot to contend with  but then of course  he said to himself  i   ve been contending with it for days now .     you mean it was being bogie because it was able to change into his shape  to imprint upon him .      avery nodded and smiled oddly .     i guess we   ve got  as well as adam and eve  pinch me .      derec wondered if the doctor had slipped back into madness .  avery saw his son   s confusion and quickly explained about the children   s riddle he had tried out on adam .      adam never really understood it .  i tried to tell him it was just a joke  but he didn   t catch on .         i know what you mean .  i   ve spent hours attempting to make mandelbrot understand what humor is all about .  but what really is our pinch me .  for that matter  what are the silversides .         they   rre demonss     u know     wolruf said from the floor .  she had been intently listening to the conversation .        u should lock them up and hide key until they grrow up .  that iss my opinion .         i agree  wolruf     avery said .     i   d like to get them into a cell and take them apart  see what makes them tick .         don   t    u tell ariel that .  rememberr what she said about dancerss .         yes  that   s good advice  wolruf .      derec had no idea what they were talking about  but  with so many immediate problems to deal with  he decided not to ask questions about it .      father  you said you had an idea who the silversides are .         yes  and i have a hunch i   m right .  sit down .         i   m too nervous           sit down .      the tone in avery   s command was so authoritative  derec decided there must be a good reason for the order .  he pulled up a chair and sat on the edge of it .      i hadn   t wanted to talk to you yet about your mother  derec .  if i could avoid it  i   d never tell you about her .  unfortunately  circumstances now make it necessary .      derec realized why his father had told him to sit down .  he felt as if the air had been knocked out of him .  what could his mother possibly have to do with the crisis on robot city .   avery started to pace .  his fingers kept busy as he walked .      i   m not going to tell you her name .  you can dream that  if you want .  suffice it to say that  like me  like you  she was  is  a roboticist .  a very good one  the only one who could really challenge me .  perhaps it was  in fact  competition that kept me going  made me succeed  a competition that continued even after she left me .      wolruf was sitting up now  apparently to hear avery better .  she looked improved .  her eyes were clearer  and a sheen had returned to her fur .      when i came back here and found the city deteriorating     avery continued     i knew that somebody or something was behind it .  it wasn   t until i had the long talks with adam that i began to suspect that there might be a third robot like him in the city .  however  until our little talk  derec  i wasn   t sure .  now the evidence seems clear to me .  there is another robot  one like adam and eve  and the creator of all three of them  i am positive  is your mother .      that little piece of information really stunned derec .  he had to struggle to speak again .      but how can you be so sure they come from her .         i admit there is some intuition involved  but it   s intuition supported by logic .  the silversides and  presumably  our mysterious controller can only be the work of a robotics expert as skilled as i .  that isn   t ego speaking .  there just simply isn   t another roboticist as meticulous and creative   and that includes all the incompetents at the robotics institute on aurora   as i am .  except for your mother .      avery stopped to observe the effects of his words upon his son .  derec knew he was not disguising his emotions even though he very much didn   t want his father to see them .      i am projecting her intellectual progress  of course .  it   s been a long time since i   ve seen her .  at that time she was not yet my equal  especially in the fields of positronics and integrals  but in the years since  working in isolation  she may have come up to my level .  i don   t like admitting that  but she is younger  and in some ways i   ve slowed down .  plus  i   ve channeled my activities into the planning and development of robot cities  while she has been able  apparently  to concentrate on robots alone .  even knowing her skills and intelligence  these new robots represent an achievement that takes my breath away .  does that seem strange to you  son .  that the great egotist can indeed give credit to someone else .  you   re thinking that  i can see .         have you added telepathy to your considerable talents .      avery laughed abruptly .     you may be a chip off the old block after all .  that sarcasm was worthy of me .  wonderful .         why is it that your praise sounds like an insult .         that   ss enough     wolruf interjected .     you two can have yourr silly arrgument laterr .  there   ss much to be done .      avery nodded toward wolruf .     she   s bossy for an alien .         i like that in aliens     derec said .      pleasse     wolruf said .      all right     derec said .     assuming that my mother is behind all this  what   s she up to .  why develop this new kind of shape changing robot and then dump individual ones on different planets .         i can only speculate about that .      avery resumed pacing on the far side of the room .  derec paced a shorter path on his side .  wolruf was amused by the resemblances between the two men when they were pacing .      what it might be is that your mother always had a special interest in anthropology .  she could go on for hours about tribes  customs  rites  that sort of bilgewater .         you don   t put much stock in anthropology .     derec asked .      oh  it   s all right  just not in my sphere of interest .  i   m a creator  a builder  and i like to stay by myself .  going out and observing sentient creatures go through their dull  daily routines  and analyzing the meanings of courtship and aggressive rituals just simply isn   t my line .  it   s a useful minor science  where you can showboat by delivering solemn conclusions without much hard evidence  but it   s for people who are butterfingers in a lab .  on the other hand  your mother thought it was fascinating to study cultures  and she   d go off for weeks and months to take a peek at some social grouping or other .  she told me i was an old fuddy duddy whenever i said anything the least bit derogatory about her precious anthropology .  i suppose her scorn may have contributed to my present antipathy toward the field .         but i don   t see how anthropology applies to the new styled robots .         well  seems to me two factors particularly are clues to the anthropological nature of her experiment .  one is that the silversides seem to have come to consciousness with the urge to define and discover humanity  which they are further convinced is the highest intelligence in the universe .  but she has deprived them of any real information about what humans are .  therefore  as you   ve described it  whatever kind of sentient being they discover  they almost desperately try to find its humanity .      the real kicker has been that  because they   ve come to believe that humanity represents the highest standards  genuine humans are found wanting by them .  derec  your mother couldn   t have foreseen such a tantalizing irony .  when she finds out  she   ll be quite thrilled .      see  if another kind of being were to enter the city tomorrow  and it was a shade smarter than us  as those blackbodies you told me about might have been  then they would be convinced the newcomers are the humans  and it   s goodbye  derec  ariel  avery .  it wouldn   t matter if the newcomers were covered with slime  smelled like erupting sewers  and killed each other for fingernail scrapings .      anthropologically speaking  the key information that   s been denied them by not being programmed with detailed knowledge of humans is the data which would inform them of the nature of our culture .  another aspect of the denial process would appear to be the absence in their knowledge of our unfortunate tendencies toward emotion .  they can   t understand that culture and emotion define humanity as much as intelligence does .      since they don   t know what a human really is  they have the freedom to enter an alien culture and adopt its ways easily .  once they believe that culture is human  then all its customs  rites  behavior patterns become logical .  what a fruitful arena for anthropological study this   d make .  i mean  do you see  derec .      when avery stopped pacing  derec halted a short beat later .  they faced each other .  wolruf found an excitement in the way the two of them were now so furiously working together .  for the first time she realized they must be father and son .      you   re saying that the silversides and our mystery robot could be catalysts for  say  a study of what happens to cultures when they encounter robots like the silversides .     derec asked .      exactly .  and also what happens to them when they are introduced to cultures .  i think that   s where the shape changing ability comes in .  once they join a culture  they become like the individuals in it .  they are assimilated  a word dear to social scientists everywhere .  then these robots  sent to discover a culture  become integrated into it .  they can become the leader  as adam did with the kin .  or they can be corrupted by the culture itself  as both adam and eve were with the blackbodies .  or they can even disrupt its environment .  we and the robots are the    culture    here in robot city  and our pinch me has been studying us  manipulating us .      you know what the real clue is .  the dancers and all the other little creatures .  i suspect they   re some sort of genetic robotic experiments pinch me has been conducting .  they are  in a way  its own tiny anthropological studies .      without humans  or any kind of being other than robots  to examine  it started to create its own subjects  restricted cultures that it could study anthropologically .  they failed for the most part  i think .  at least it seemed to get bored with them and store them away in buildings allover the city .  but somehow they are based on its acquired knowledge of humanity  knowledge derived no doubt from the computer .      the trouble is  pinch me doesn   t know how to deal with applied knowledge  so he combined some robotics data with some genetic experimental information and created the dancers and the other groups .  that he could do as well as he did is impressive  but he couldn   t quite get the hang of it all .  so his experiments were failures  he couldn   t control the city  and he even messed up his foray among us in disguise .      derec nodded .     that   s all highly speculative  but it does provide some ideas that fit the facts we do know .      avery paced a few steps more  then said     it   s your mother   s failure really .  she   s conceived this intricate anthropological study  probably to study positronic minds in various cultural situations .  like our pinch me  her work is theoretical  almost playful .  just the way she was .      even though he felt a twinge of irritation at the mere suggestion that his mother could have botched her experiment  derec seemed to be gradually getting a picture of her through avery   s asides .  he figured if he could keep his father talking  he   d find out a great deal about her  especially when avery was in a bitter mood and not guarding his words .      she never was practical in her work .  i suppose that was another standoff in our marriage .  she could go off on such flights of fancy that i couldn   t bring her back to ground .         i wish i could meet her .      derec   s words angered avery .      i can see what you   re thinking .  if she   s behind these robots  then maybe she   ll be around to check on them .  well  forget that .  she has to leave them alone  let things happen long enough for data to be collected .  so she won   t be showing up to see how her little creations have evolved for some time  years maybe .  keeping a watch on the silversides won   t bring about any reunions for you  derec .      derec kept his anger in check .  there was no point in irritating his father any further .  give him some time  and maybe he   d relent on the subject of derec   s mother  although he did seem adamant in his hatred of her .      i   ll keep all that in mind     derec said .     for now  we have to find this third robot .  i hope mandelbrot and timestep haven   t lost him .         now that we have a concept of what we   re looking for  we can        avery was interrupted by the appearance of ariel in the doorway .  she was out of breath from running .      derec .  dr .  avery .  something   s happening outside .  buildings are  i don   t know how to describe it  they   re self destructing or something .  folding inward  sliding into the ground  falling over  disappearing altogether .  come see .      derec began to run out of the room immediately  avery close behind .  ariel led them out to the street just in time to see a structure down the block begin to tremble  then   without a sound   fall sideways against another building  which in turn fell forward .      there   s an ancient game  dominoes     avery remarked .     sometimes people lined them up and they fell  toppling each other  something like those buildings there .         what   s doing this .     ariel yelled .      i should have known     derec said and begun running down the street .     our robot     he yelled back to avery     he   s trying to destroy everything .  he has to be at the central computer .         i think you   re right     avery said  and ran after derec .      what robot .     ariel said before taking up her position as third in line .   wolruf limped out of the doorway and watched the trio disappear around a corner .   in the distance there was a bright flash of light and a tall narrow building   s sides began to undulate before the whole structure seemed to collapse inward .      no way to get any resst arround here     she said and loped after them .  as the pain worked its way out of her leg  she picked up speed .     chapter     the first confrontation    the watchful eye had to proceed carefully  destroying the city by sections .  before an area could be removed  it had to make sure that no harm would come to anyone   humans  robots  the alien  the thousands of creatures in labs all over the city that still survived its genetic experiments .  it merely wanted to dismantle the city and start again  so only uninhabited sectors could be destroyed .   nevertheless  destruction was easier than creation .  many programming steps had been necessary for the design of a building  but a mere six strokes on the main computer center keyboard could remove it .  the watchful eye scanned each structure for signs of robotic or human activity before performing the six strokes .  it was still in its bogie shape  and to a cynical observer  watching a robot attempting to destroy a city built by robots might have seemed ironic .   as soon as it had initiated its sequences of destruction  the watchful eye realized that the process it had to use was too well planned  too methodical  too full of fail safe devices .  it would take a long time to demolish the entire city .  if it had foreseen these complications  it would have restructured the computer   s architectural programming so that an automatic programmed sequence could be activated  one that would bypass all the fail safe devices that the city   s clever originator had installed in the computer .   checking the whereabouts of derec and its other enemies  it saw that they were nearing the underground entrance .  they seemed to be heading to its computer lair  no doubt to stop it from its systematic destruction of the city  and it had to stop them before it could continue .     derec had discovered mandelbrot and timestep wandering the streets looking for the bogie imposter .  when they had finally worked their way through the building with the roughhousing creatures  the street outside the exit had been empty .      it   s down at the central computer     derec said .     i   m sure of it .  come with me .      the slowdown to talk with the two robots allowed ariel and avery to catch up .  wolruf was so far behind that the others were not even aware she was on her way .   they headed for the tunnel entrance .  just before they reached it  the frame of the entrance appeared to balloon outward and then  like an enfolding hand  cover the opening derec had intended to pass through .     as adam and eve strode down a wide boulevard  they saw wolruf lope across an intersection  then disappear down a side street .      let   s go after her     adam said .     she might know what   s happening to the city .      without consulting with each other  both adam and eve changed to the kin shape and began to pursue wolruf  who had disappeared around a comer .  when they rounded that comer  they did not see the alien ahead of them .      she must have gone down one of those streets     eve said .     it will be difficult to find her .         i know .  but these beings leave a trace in the air that we can detect through our olfactory circuits if we increase them threefold .      eve discovered adam was right .  there was a sweet scent of wolruf   s fur that lingered in the center of the roadway .     wolruf reached derec and the others just as several buildings in a nearby block tilted  fell against each other  and collapsed  some into the street  others against buildings to the rear .  the effect was as if the buildings had been made of playing cards and someone had knocked them down .   wolruf took in the situation immediately .      iss there anotherr way down .     she asked .      lots of them     avery said     but  with this creature in charge of the computer  it can block us from going in any entrance .  in the meantime  it could reduce the whole city to rubble .      there was bitterness in the doctor   s voice .  no wonder  wolruf thought  he was watching the city  his own creation  being demolished at the whim of what appeared to be a rogue robot .      our best bet may be to dig through this     derec said .     one thing our friend doesn   t know about  and that   s the potential of mandelbrot   s arm .      when derec had built mandelbrot out of spare robotic parts  he had used an arm from a supervisor robot .  it was made of an enormously malleable cellular material and could be formed into many shapes with differing densities .  on many occasions it had become a most useful tool .      mandelbrot .     derec said .     do you think you could make some people sized holes through that mess .      he pointed toward the entrance .  although the main opening was gone  there were still some gaps where the edges of the twisted frame had not quite come together .      yes     mandelbrot replied .      then do it .         wait     wolruf said .     make a wolrruf sized hole firrst .  i   m smallerr  and i can get down there fasster than any of    u .         no     derec said .     that robot isn   t like the others .  it doesn   t regard you as human .  last time you went up against it  it might have killed you .  it could kill you for sure this time .         all of    u take riskss .  iss my turn thiss time .         it   s too dangerous .         don   t be such an idiot  son     avery said .     pinch me can do too much damage if we waste time getting there .         pinch me .     ariel said .     what are you talking about .  that robot down there is named pinch me .         just a pet name     avery said .     let wolruf go down there  derec .  wolruf  just delay him .  don   t put yourself in danger .         yes     derec said     just concentrate on diversionary actions  okay .      wolruf came from a culture where there had never been much use for diversionary action .  in a conflict  her people tended to go directly for the throat .  but she said     i will be careful  i prromisse    u .      derec considered the matter for a brief time before he said     okay  we   ll do it your way  wolruf .         thank    u .         i   m not sure that   s proper etiquette  thanking the leader for putting you in jeopardy .  mandelbrot  start digging .         yes  sir .      mandelbrot raised his arm  which at the moment was configured into a good copy of a human limb .  as he headed toward the tunnel entrance  which looked like a jumble of the city   s strange metal  the arm began to change .  first  it lengthened and an extra joint appeared at the center of the forearm .  its hand widened and fingers thinned into what looked like pointed claws .  turning its palm up to the sky  the fingers became sharp edged at their tips .  when he reached the pile  his arm was ready  and he began to rake at the twisted metal of the door frame .  he managed to insert one of the fingers into a tiny opening .  making the finger thicker  he made the opening just a little bit wider .      the metal may resist whatever abilities that arm has     avery said .     it   s strong .         so is the metal of mandelbrot   s arm     derec said .     besides  it isn   t so much a matter of tensile strength as manipulation .  wherever there   s an opening in the material the city   s made of  it can be worked with .  only a solid wall of it can stop mandelbrot   or  for that matter  any of us .  remember  ariel  the time i wedged a hole open with my boot .      mandelbrot   s hand kept changing to fulfill the needs of the task .  when the hole was wider  it bec  me a whirling wheel that knocked against the sides of the hole  widening it more .  after a moment  he could reach through it .  he enlarged the mass of his arm slowly and  gradually  painstakingly  he carved a hole large enough for wolruf to get through .      sstop now  mandelbrrot     wolruf said .     sstand by and give me rroom .  thank    u .      without so much as a farewell  the caninoid alien entered the hole  twisting and contracting her body to propel herself through it .   when she reached the other side and began loping down the dark tunnel  mandelbrot resumed his work on the opening .     the watchful eye detected the activity at the tunnel entrance  but assumed it would take a long while before they could get through .  it knew nothing of the abilities of mandelbrot   s arm and did not detect wolruf   s penetration of its improvised security barrier .   as it continued to pick and choose what part of robot city it would destroy  it concentrated so completely on its efforts at annihilation that it did not detect wolruf   s appearance in the computer chamber .   to make matters worse  it had been careless upon its return and left both the sliding door and wall open  so that wolruf could silently creep into the mainframe area .  she was happy to see that the bogie that was not bogie hadn   t even looked up from its work .   on a screen above the imposter bogie  a spired building appeared .  with a deft hand movement  the robot touched some keys on a massive keyboard .  the screen showed the spired building appear to sink into the ground  as a ship might be swallowed by the sea .   something must be done now  she thought .  derec had said something about a diversion .  what kind of diversion was possible under these circumstances .  she wondered .  she decided none .  trickiness was not her way .  attack was her way .  her throat tightened as she remembered the pain of the pseudo bogie   s last blow .  but she hadn   t been prepared for that .  now she was ready .     soon mandelbrot had fashioned a hole large enough for derec  ariel  and avery to pass through .      let me go first     avery said .     i know the networks and byways of this underground setup better than you possibly could .  better than anyone else could .  except  apparently  our little pinch me .      he manipulated his body through the opening without waiting to see if anyone disagreed .      pinch me  huh .     ariel said .      i   d love to     derec said     but i   m kinda busy right now .         ha ha .  i hope somebody explains the significance of the name to me sometime .         it   d be a pleasure .  you go next .  mandelbrot  you   ll never get your bulk through this pinhole .  go to the compass tower and man the computer terminal there .  as soon as you get a signal from me on the screen  begin restoring the systems that are still out of order .  i   ll work from my end with the chemfets .  i want robot city to be fully functional the next time we get together .         yes  master derec .  i will try .      timestep came forward  clearly expecting to be taken along .  but he wouldn   t be able to work himself through the hole either  so derec said     and  mandelbrot  take timestep with you .         what is my assignment  master derec .     timestep said .   derec wished he could give him something legitimate to do  but this was no time to be concerned with manpower assignments .     entertain mandelbrot .  dance for him .         he never stops dancing     ariel muttered .   mandelbrot and timestep set off down the street as ariel squeezed into the passageway  then derec .  fortunately for them  the watchful eye did not observe their entrance .  it was too busy with wolruf .     adam and eve reached the tunnel entrance just after derec had climbed into the hole .  they had seen the bottoms of his boots shaking as he wiggled through the opening .  then the boots disappeared .      what are they doing  do you think .     eve asked .      i would surmise that they are heading for the main computer .         why .         i cannot know  but i would surmise that the present crisis in the city originates there .         we should follow them .         i agree .      the hole was too narrow for them to go through in their kin shapes .  together  without consulting  they began to change  elongate .  restoring their basic derec and ariel facial features  their bodies became snakelike and sinuous  if snakes had long thin arms and legs to go with their bodies .  when their mass had narrowed sufficiently  they were each about seven and a half feet long .  eve first  they slithered through the narrow opening easily .     at that moment the watchful eye had wolruf  her jaws clamped around its wrist  hanging from its forearm .  it tried to fling the alien away  but she hung on tightly .  slapping at her with its other arm didn   t have much effect either .   it was time to use its transmogrification potentials .  concentrating on its arm  it flowed more mass into it  forcing the arm to swell up .  wolruf tried to bite harder  giving the hinge of her jaw great pain .  the watchful eye   s arm enlarged more  prying wolruf   s jaws apart .  she dropped to the floor .   as the watchful eye brought its other arm down toward wolruf   s head  she dodged sideways  then rammed the bogie who was not bogie in the legs .  like one of the buildings it had destroyed  the watchful eye toppled over  falling over wolruf and hitting the computer chamber floor with a resounding thud .  wolruf scampered sideways to avoid being crushed .   the fall did not hurt it  but it wound up in an awkward position .  wolruf  who had realized she could not possibly defeat this metallic monster  hoped she could hold it off until derec and the others arrived .     avery led derec and ariel down several corridors  all of them dark or only partially lit  another feature of their enemy   s tampering with robot city .  at a junction whose tunnels led in three separate directions  avery stopped suddenly .  he looked from one tunnel to another  his face confused .      what   s the matter     derec asked .      the damn creature  robot  whatever he is   he   s altered the network of tunnels down here .  they   re not laid out according to the original pattern .  he   s rearranged them just like he   s redesigned the city .         can we find our way .     ariel asked .     wolruf may be in trouble .  you know her  derec .  she won   t wait for us long .  she   ll go on the attack .         don   t worry  don   t worry     avery said .     i can work this out .  i built this city  remember .  no robot can fool me for long .  we   ll go this way .      he plunged into the right hand tunnel with his usual recklessness .  used to it now  derec and ariel followed close behind .     the false bogie struggled to a sitting position  and wolruf jumped onto its back  pushing it forward  ramming its head against its legs .  only the suddenness of her attack allowed it to succeed .  wolruf could tell the robot was too strong for her .  it had all the tireless force of any robot .  and it was bound by third law to fight back so long as it continued not to perceive wolruf as human .   she tried to hold its torso down  but it only had to push against the floor with its hands for sufficient power to fling wolruf off its back and send her flying through the air .  instinct took over  and wolruf landed on her feet  wobbly but still in control of the situation .   it was straightening up its back while at the same time turning around to face wolruf  ready to fend off another leap .  wolruf looked up and saw an empty shelf high up on the wall next to her .  crouching down  she pushed hard with her legs and flew up onto the shelf .  the bogie that was not bogie could just barely track her with its optical circuits .  she had hardly landed on the shelf when she jumped again  this time at an arc that led downward to the robot .  kicking out with both feet  she struck the bogie imposter on the forehead  snapping its head back .  it fell heavily .  wolruf landed on the floor  too  on her back .  when she stood up  she could barely walk .  the leg injury from her previous battle with the robot flared up again .   and the false bogie had somehow gotten to its feet and was hovering over her .   she tensed herself for a killing blow  but instead the robot merely looked down at her and said     why are you trying to hurt me .      its voice sounded hurt  but not in physical pain  as if its feelings had been hurt more than its body .      why arre    u trrying to hurrt the city .     she said .      i must .  it must be my city .         arre    u trrying to be leaderr .         i do not know what you mean .         do you plan to be dictatorr of rrobot city .         no .  i just want things here to be logical .  i must control events  and i cannot the way things are .         i don   t underrstand .  why need    u contrrol eventss .         i know inside me i have to .  i don   t yet know why  but the answer will come .  answers have come to me when i needed them .            u talk strrangely .         i am not really used to talking .         who arre    u .         i am me  that   s all i know .  i have taken the temporary name  the watchful eye .  the being whose shape i have taken called me    the big muddy .     he did not know i heard him call me that .  i don   t know why he did .         where is he now .  where is bogie .         i disconnected and dismantled him .  it was necessary .  why do you exhibit emotional disturbance .         am upset at what    u ssay .  i liked bogie  and he iss dead .         why do you say that .  he is not dead .  all of his component parts still exist and will function again .  i may put him together  gain  or his parts will continue as parts of new robots .  that is not death  there is no decay in it .         what do    u know of death .         only what i have studied about it in computer files .         that iss no way to know about death .         perhaps you will tell me more about death .  later  when i have finished with the city .  please attack me no further .      the watchful eye turned back toward its keyboard .  wolruf  unbound by any robotic laws  sprang up and  howling  rammed against the watchful eye   s back as hard as she could .  the blow knocked it off balance .   but not enough .   it whirled around and clipped wolruf with a hard  clenched fist punch to the side of her head .   she fell  limp  unconscious .   the watchful eye  with some gentleness  picked her up and placed her against the wall  and then it carefully rearranged her body in a way that  according to its observations  should be comfortable for a being that was the shape of the caninoid alien .   then it returned to the task of destroying the city .  .  .   as they walked through the new tunnel  everything around them looking spookier than ever in the dim light  derec asked avery     i   ve been wondering  if this new robot is like adam and eve  and by that i mean a shape changer and meddlesome pest  what   ll it be like when all three of them get together .         that   s not the sort of question that occupies my mind at times like this .      the snideness in his father   s voice was unmistakable .  derec wondered if the man would always be like that  scornful and sarcastic .  would they ever have a relationship that was anything like what normal fathers and sons had .  probably not .      still     derec continued     i can   t help but wonder .  two of them are bad enough  but we were getting used to them .  three would be worse  unpredictable  possibly disastrous .  when we get there and get things in control  it would be nice to find a way to get rid of pinch me .         you surprise me  derec .  i wouldn   t have thought you had such murderous thoughts .         oh  i don   t mean we should kill it or even dismantle it .  i   d just like to get it out of the way .  ship it to another planet  or secrete it in an attic  or hide it in a cave  anything to keep it away from adam and eve .         where it would cause trouble for others .  still  dismantling might not be such a bad idea .      he stopped talking  for they had reached the entrance to the computer chamber .     the watchful eye now realized that the immensity of robot city was a hindrance to its destruction .  after all the time it   d spent on the project  interrupted only by wolruf   s attack  there had not been enough progress .  only a small percentage of robot city had been toppled  collapsed  or removed .   since the humans were not as adept in stalking as wolruf  the watchful eye heard them ease open the outside door and come toward the computer .   it would have to confront them .   but it was afraid of confronting them .  it did not know why .     the watchful eye turned around to face its new intruders .  when it saw the three of them  all looking stern and clearly there with the same purpose as wolruf  to take away its control of the city  it momentarily considered rushing at them  attacking them  hurling them through the air with the same force it had thrown wolruf .  but these were humans  it couldn   t harm them .  it seemed as if the first law of robotics applied in this situation .  but why .  robotics laws were for robots .  it was the watchful eye  and it should not be governed by laws governing inferior creatures .   derec took a step forward .      dr .  livingstone  i presume     he said .  of course it did not understand the reference .      i am the watchful eye     it responded .      cute name     ariel muttered .      perhaps derived from all seeing eye  eye of providence  something like that     avery commented .     a symbol on currency  i think  signifying  i think  a new age or new order .      ariel saw wolruf lying unconscious near the wall  and she rushed to her .  after touching her and feeling for her life signs  she nodded to derec that wolruf was alive .  derec turned back to the watchful eye .      i don   t care who you are     he said .     why are you destroying my city .         your city .  it   s not your city now .  i have taken it over .  look at the screens .     it pointed toward a bank of view screens on which scenes of robot city   s destruction were displayed .     look at what i   ve done  and say it   s your city .         look on my works  ye mighty .  .  .     avery muttered .      okay     derec said .     right now i don   t care whose city you think it is .  just give me your reasons for demolishing it .         it is .  .  . not right for me .  i must accommodate it to my needs .         seems to me you   ve done enough accommodating already  mister .  i want you to stop accommodating and give me back control of the computer  so i can correct all the harm you   ve done .         it is not harm .  i will improve the city .  i cannot obey you  because there is no harm being done .         no harm .  that   s just another robot word game .  if i say there   s harm  there is harm  buster .         but i am not a robot .      here in the computer room derec could already feel his chemfets stirring  beginning to move along his bloodstream with a purpose .  it was as if they  too  had suffered structural damage from the watchful eye   s efforts and were now reestablishing themselves .  derec was sure control was coming back to him .  he had only to remove this obstacle standing in front of him  and he thought he knew a way to defeat the watchful eye .  he could  through his chemfets  sense disorientation in the new robot   s domination of the city .      watchful eye  if you insist on calling yourself that  i am derec .         i know that .         i am human .  do you understand .  i am human .  you must obey me .         i don   t see why that is so .         you have to obey me .  it is second law .  i know you have the laws of robotics embedded in your programming .  whatever i say  you must do .  i am human .         i don   t know that .         i am telling you .  i am human .  obey .  immediately cease your destruction of robot city .         it is not suitable .  it must be changed .         i want it the way it was before we arrived  before you came here and started tampering with it .  do it  robot .         i .  .  . i only look like a robot .  my disguise .  i am not a robot .  i am something else .  i must be something else .         you must be what you are  a robot .  you were created to serve .  to serve me .  obey me .  it   s second law imperative .      the watchful eye was not sure what to do .      only robots have to follow the three laws     it said .      it is objecting     avery whispered .     you can get it on the ropes .  it would not have to object if it knew what it was .  did you hear  it said it must be something else .  derec  it doesn   t know what it is .         watchful eye     derec said     you are a robot .         no  i am not .  i have logically concluded that i am not .  i look like one now because i have taken a robot   s shape .  that in itself proves i am not a robot .  robots are fixed  immutable  they cannot change their shape .         if only adam and eve were here     derec mumbled .      i thought you didn   t want to get them together     ariel remarked .      i changed my mind .     derec took another step forward .  he didn   t know if encroaching on a robot   s personal space could unnerve it the way it did humans  but anything was worth a try .   the watchful eye again wondered if it could hurt derec .  but as soon as it thought of the act  something inside it seemed to make him immobile .      watchful eye     derec said     in spite of any evidence you have manufactured for yourself  you are a robot .  there are others like you  and you will meet them .         others .  i know nothing of any others .         perhaps you have spied on them  too .  adam and eve are their names .         they cannot be robots .  i   ve watched them .  if they are of any designation  they are human .         no  we are the humans .  the three of us .  and you must  as i say  do what we tell you .  second law .  second law .  second law .      derec   s chanting of the terms seemed eccentric behavior to the watchful eye .  where was the consistency of behavior that a high intelligence must have .  it wondered .      watchful eye  i order you to move away from that keyboard .  we can take care of restoring the city .  do you understand .  you must do it .  move away from the keyboard .      something happened in the watchful eye   s mind .  something positronic  a clicking in  a prodding .  it knew suddenly that derec was right  and it must obey him .  it moved away from the keyboard immediately  with no argument .   derec felt his chemfets begin to function as they had before the watchful eye   s tampering had begun .  they seemed to positively roil in his bloodstream .  he gestured his father toward the keyboard .      you made this city .  you fix it .      rubbing his hands together eagerly  avery went to the keyboard .  he was already tapping keys before he sat down .      now  watchful eye  and i hope you get a less mouth filling name very soon     derec said     i want to be sure of everything .  i need to be completely in connection with the computer .  i order you to relinquish any link  except that of a normal robot city robot  you may still have with the computer .  but  before you do  let me ask you this one question .  can you get rid of the gook that   s allover the computer .      derec gestured toward the mosslike substance that was even thicker now  layers of it hiding most of the machine   s workings .      yes  i can .         do it .      the moss seemed to melt .  but  unlike melting substances  there was no residue collecting under it .  it merely disappeared  leaving the computer as it was  and in fact much shinier .      now  watchful eye  relinquish any computer link .         it is done     it said immediately .   derec  intent on regaining control over his chemfets  did not notice at first what was going on in the new robot   s face .  there was much less bogie in it .  for a moment there was a suggestion of derec  and then there was no face at all .      what   s happening with it .     ariel asked .      i wish i knew .      slowly  the watchful eye   s body changed shape  but this time it did not change into anyone  did not imprint on anyone .  it merely became bloblike  a roundish  amorphous being with stubby legs and little else that was recognizable  except for a single eye on its upper surface .  the watchful eye  perhaps  derec thought .      is that what it normally looks like .     ariel asked .      watchful eye  is that the shape you were in when you arrived on this planet .      a mouth appeared below the eye  apparently just so it could answer derec   s question .      yes  in nearly every respect .  i did not have legs until i needed them  then i grew them .      the watchful eye backed away on its short legs from derec and ariel .  it needed to get into its haven .   leaning against the compartment where it had hidden the haven  it activated the lock mechanism  keyed to its presence  and the door sprung open .  from inside the haven  an ovoid shaped thing rolled out .  the watchful eye touched it with one of its legs  and it came open .  it crawled inside and the seams of the ovoid thing sealed .      what is that .     ariel said .      the capsule it came here in  i suspect     derec answered .     the capsule my mother may have sent here  the way she perhaps dispatched the capsules adam and eve arrived at their planets in .  the    eggs     as they called them .         your mother .  why do i always feel i   ve missed something .         don   t worry .  i   ll explain .  let   s tend to wolruf first .        chapter     the second confrontation       well  my friend     derec said to wolruf  after she came to     we owe you a solid vote of thanks .         forr what     u think .         your holding action with the watchful eye .  a successful mission if there ever was one .  i told you to keep him occupied so we could get here .  you did .  therefore  thank you .         from me  too     ariel said .     even from him .     she pointed toward avery  whose fingers were furiously flying around the keyboard .      i can thank her myself     avery said  the kind of grouch in his voice that they had become used to .      yes     ariel said     but would you .         under the right circumstances .         do those circumstances come around often .         not often .         i thought so .      ariel made wolruf stand up and walk around to make sure she was all right .  there was no wolruflike spring to her walk  but otherwise she seemed normal .   when she was satisfied with wolruf   s condition  ariel walked to the capsule where the watchful eye still lay  an unmoving blob .      snug fit     she said .  derec looked puzzled .     i mean  the way our watchful eye fits so neatly into its egg .  must be very constricting and claustrophobic when traveling through space .         at that time it   s not aware of its surroundings .  adam told me he and eve came to consciousness only after they   d landed .  from what it said  i suspect the same was true for this one  too .         well     she said  stretching her arms and yawning     what   s next .         with what .         well  on the immediate level  i   d like something to eat .  i   m starving .  and i   d like to sleep for three days .  and i   d like to arrange a tap dance recital for timestep and maybe the partner he mentioned .  but what i   d really like to know is what are we going to do with our watchful eye here .         i   ve got some ideas     avery said .      i   ll just bet you have     ariel said .     but keep them to yourself for now  okay .         your girlfriend   s touchy     avery remarked .   ariel glared at avery but was too tired to attempt further repartee with him .  she wished she had a capsule like the watchful eye   s to crawl in and shut out the world .      well     she said to derec     what about the eye .         i don   t know .  if we   d had more success with adam and eve  i   d have a better idea .  this one may be our chance to find out more about these robots .  on the other hand  it might be too corrupted by its flirtation with power to provide the           flirtation with power .  you sound like you swallowed a textbook on improving verbal skills .         sorry .         he   s been spending too much time with me     avery said as he stared at a schematic diagram on the view screen .     he   s picking up my tendency toward the bon mot .         you betcha     ariel said .     so  derec  you   re not sure what to do with the eye .         that   s about it .  we   ll question it  observe it  give it a chance to explain itself  but i can   t figure out any more than that at this moment .         hey  we   ve had a busy day .         that iss a true sstatement if i everr hearrd one     wolruf observed .   derec walked over to his father and stood behind him .  the man   s fingers moved so fast they blurred from time to time .      is mandelbrot handling things all right at his end .     derec asked .      excellently .  for a robot he   s exceptionally skilled at computer operation .         i schooled him in it .         should have known .  old earth saying  those who can  do  those who can   t  teach  those who shouldn   t  think they are those who can  those who should  generally fake their way through college .         what does that mean .         maybe i didn   t get it right .      for a while derec watched his father labor in silence .  he could discern the effectiveness of the work avery and mandelbrot were doing by the way his chemfets had resumed their active and comfortable functioning .  he felt as if he could just lean against a wall  shut his eyes  and blend with the chemfets as they moved along his bloodstream .   he asked his father the question he could not stop thinking about .     could you arrange for me to meet my mother .      avery   s fingers stopped suddenly and rested on the middle row of the keyboard .  derec could tell he was carefully formulating his answer .  he knew his father well enough by now to realize that he composed his utterances  even those that appeared to be spoken spontaneously .      the proper question  son  is would i arrange it .  and  you know  in one of my foolish sentimental moments  of which i have few  practically none  i might arrange it .  fortunately for me  i don   t have to struggle with my conscience about it .  i haven   t a snowman   s idea of where she is or how to find her .      derec walked away .  avery called after him     derec .         yes .         you might not like her .  i don   t .         i   ll take the chance .         i could have predicted you   d say that .      derec saw adam and eve standing in the doorway .  he wondered how long they had been frozen in position there  watching .      adam .  eve .      they ignored him .  their attention was clearly focussed on the capsule .   this was the moment he had feared  and it had come too soon .     they entered the room  walking past wolruf  past ariel .  they were holding hands  and derec wondered where in frost   s name they had learned to do that .  ariel came to derec and held onto his arm .   they came to a stop by the capsule .  releasing eve   s hand and reaching down  he flipped a toggle located near the capsule   s seam .  a control panel slipped out of the tip of the egg shaped container .  adam manipulated a number of switches  and the egg began to glow .  derec could feel heat emanating from it .  there was a faint humming sound coming from the inside of the capsule .  the seams separated  and the silversides got their first glimpse of the watchful eye  who immediately began to stir .  it rolled out of the capsule and came to rest in front of adam and eve .      you are us     adam said .      we are you     eve said .   the watchful eye was so bloblike now that derec had not missed the presence of a head on the body .  now a head appeared to rise out of the middle of the blob  in the area where the eye had been .  the eye had disappeared and  in its place  as facial features became discernible  there appeared two eyes  both closed .  when it had fully formed  its eyes opened and derec saw it had the features of adam on its face .  adam as derec .  then the surface of its body started to undulate as it gradually formed itself into the humanoid state .  as it became more and more humanoid  it stood up on two legs and sprouted normal length arms .   as it became more and more like adam  adam started to change  too .  in a moment he looked more like avery than derec .   derec realized it could be difficult keeping track of these chameleons without a scorecard .      i am you  the both of you     the watchful eye said .     but who are we .         that we will have to find out     eve said .   eve   s ariel face had a suggestion of derec in it .  adam changed to caninoid shape  a mimicry of wolruf .  the watchful eye made a try at wolruf  too .  its wolruf was less delineated  less convincing as a copy  than adam   s .  eve became an effective wolruf  too .  wolruf came and stood beside them  and derec wondered if  should he close his eyes and then open them to find the quartet had shifted positions  he could tell which one was the true wolruf .  well  that couldn   t happen .  whatever other miraculous transformations they could achieve  they could not simulate fur  nor could they imitate very well the normal coloring of the beings they imprinted on .  a moment later  adam resembled derec with a caninoid overlay  the watchful eye looked like avery doing his impression of bogie  and eve was simply looking like ariel again .   on derec   s part  on ariel   s part  neither was sure what was making them uneasy .  however  in the past they had both felt a sense of danger from the two silversides  and now there were three .  three of them chatting together  as if they had so many questions to ask of each other  of themselves  of the worlds where they had been dropped so unceremoniously   and probably speculating about the havoc they could wreak if given half a chance .   avery  who had been too busy with the computer to notice the silversides    entrance  turned around in his chair and finally saw the curious trio .  he smiled .      the situation is replete with challenges     he said .      for whom .     derec said .      them or us .     ariel said .      them .  us .  whatever  it   s quite wonderful .      the three shape changing robots  apparently oblivious to the remarks of the others  joined hands in a humanlike way and began to walk out of the computer chamber .      should we follow them .     ariel asked .      let them go     derec said .     we   ve got too much to do .     avery returned to the computer .      message from mandelbrot     he said without turning around .     seems the supervisors are all active again  out of the meeting room and starting to function like gang busters .  systems are running more efficiently .  robots are coming out of their holes and crowding the streets like usual .  the city is returning to normal .  what do your chemfets tell you  derec .         what you   ve reported .  they   re more active than normal .  i think the crisis is definitely over .     he glanced toward the doorway the silversides and the watchful eye had gone through .     the city   s crisis  anyway .      his gaze stayed on the doorway for a short while .  then  his chemfets surging through his bloodstream  he returned to the task of putting robot city back into order .
