databank by matt elson      this is dedicated to    alfred bohung wu     my cousin  who is even more overeducated than i am      special thanks are due in the writing of this novel to dr .  william q .  wu and cecile f .  wu  my parents  for indulging my lifelong interest in history  ricia mainhardt  john betancourt and byron preiss  and bridgett and marty marquardt .          r .  hunter eased his muscular six and a half feet into the office chair .  as usual  he looked northern european  with short blond hair and blue eyes  though he could change his shape and appearance at will .  the humans on his team were all due to meet him here shortly .   jane maynard  the roboticist  and steve chang  the team   s general assistant  were having breakfast .  hunter had wanted them to have a solid night   s sleep .  the team had returned only yesterday from the german rebellion against the roman empire in a . d .    .  during the evening  hunter had arranged to hire an expert historian named judy taub for their next mission .  she had arrived a short time ago and was taking a few free minutes to see the sights around mojave center before rejoining hunter .   hunter was a robot who had been especially designed and built to lead the search for mojave center governor  the missing governor robot .  mc governor  by contrast  was an experimental gestalt robot who was supposed to be running the underground desert city of mojave center .  instead  he had separated into his six component gestalt humaniform robots and vanished .   each of the gestalt robots had fled back in time to a different era .  hunter and his team of humans had made three journeys in pursuit of them and had returned the first three components to the office of mc governor  where they stood merged and shut down  waiting for the other three .  however  hunter had to report to the governor robot oversight committee on his progress after each mission .  he had already requested that the city computer call the four members of the committee for him .      hunter  city computer calling .  i have the governor robot oversight committee on a conference call for you .         please connect me .      split portrait shots of the four faces of the committee members appeared on hunter   s internal video screen .  everyone exchanged greetings .  then hunter began his report .      mc   has been joined to mc   and mc       said hunter .      i can hardly believe it     said dr .  redfield  the tall blonde .     so fast .  you   re doing a very fine job .         it is not complete yet  of course     said hunter soberly .     i cannot guarantee that the remaining searches will not take longer .         i understand     said dr .  redfield .      where did you locate mc   .     dr .  chin shook long black hair out of her face .      in central europe     said hunter .  he hoped he would never have to tell them about the time travel device and so always tried to be vague in his answers to the committee .  since he was performing his duties acceptably  they had not argued with him .     naturally  all three gestalt robots that are in custody have been placed in a secure location .         you   re as efficient as usual     said professor post  his smile bright in his black beard .     what information do you have about your next mission .         for mc    i have a lead in eastern europe at this time     said hunter .      eastern europe .     dr .  chin raised her eyebrows .     so close to the site of mc     s hiding place .         this is the information i have     said hunter carefully .     i assume it is correct .         you have remained on a very tight schedule     said dr .  khanna  a native of india .     you have retrieved one missing gestalt robot each day since you began .  i look forward to seeing the completion of your duties .  personally  however  i would still like a report on your activities to date .         as i said before  no guarantee of consistent future results can be made     said hunter .  he deliberately answered only dr .  khanna   s first concern .      come now     said dr .  khanna .     suppose we do not ask for a guarantee  but merely a prediction .  do you have any reason to believe that the next mission  for instance  will be more difficult than the previous ones .         i consider each mission to be a blank slate     said hunter .     the specific answer to your question is    no     but i have virtually no knowledge of what i shall face .         you   re very cautious  as always     said dr .  chin .     i   m sure that   s fine with us .  good luck .         yes  hunter     said dr .  redfield quickly .     we are not pressuring you .         i should begin the next mission     said hunter .     if you have no more questions  i shall get started .         of course     said professor post .     good hunting .         i am not ready to sign off     said dr .  khanna suddenly .     i still wish to hear a report on your activities to date .  is there some reason you will not give it .         i am seeking the highest efficiency possible     hunter said carefully .  privately  that meant concealing the existence of time travel  he felt that widespread knowledge of it would harm humanity as a whole  so his adherence to the first law would not allow him to reveal it .      come on  dr .  khanna     said dr .  chin wearily .     we should let him get back to work .  good bye  hunter .      dr .  khanna disconnected abruptly  without speaking .   as hunter broke his connection  steve and jane came into the office .      morning  hunter     said steve cheerfully .     what   s next on the agenda .         good morning     said jane  with a smile .  highlights in her long brown hair brightened the little room .     i guess we   re all ready .         good morning     said hunter .  he looked past jane and saw that judy taub was also coming to the door of the office .      judy taub  steve chang and jane maynard .         pleased to meet you .     judy was short  with curly brown hair .  she shook hands with them both .     the history of the old soviet union is my field .  the stalin regime  including of course world war ii  is my particular specialty .         this will be the most recent period we   ve visited     said jane .     its society will be the most complex  i imagine .         if they didn   t have robots  our search is going to be about the same no matter what     said steve .      i arranged for all three of you to have your inoculations this morning     said hunter .     you have taken them .         yes     said judy .      of course     said jane .      yeah .     steve nodded .     hunter  have you briefed judy already .         i have briefed her about mojave center governor and the gestalt robots .  also  of course  i told her we are going back to moscow in      .         and he swore me to secrecy     judy added  with an easy grin .     about the time travel .  but it   s exciting .  i can hardly wait to try it .         i have not yet explained the miniaturization of the component robots to her     hunter added .     perhaps jane can do it most efficiently .         miniaturization .     judy turned to jane .      i suppose the easiest way to explain the miniaturization is in terms of the laws of robotics     said jane .     the third law of robotics says     a robot must protect its own existence  as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .             yes  i know the principle  if not the exact wording     said judy .     but what about this miniaturization .         the reasoning behind it goes like this     said jane .     mc governor is the only one of the experimental governor robots that did not shut down due to a malfunction .  the governor robot oversight committee needs hunter   and us   to restore mc governor so they can figure out what caused the malfunction of the others .         yes  hunter told me that part .         but the third law drove mc governor to split into his component robots and flee to avoid being dismantled during the investigation .         yeah .  .  . that   s why they ran away to different times in history .  go on .         well  the component robots also used the time travel process to miniaturize themselves to microscopic size     jane said  watching for judy   s reaction .      really .  i didn   t know that was possible .     judy looked around at them all in surprise .      well  it wasn   t  until mc governor developed the process himself .  the component robots apparently wanted to avoid receiving any instructions from humans .  even mc    who went back to the dinosaur age  was anticipating that he would survive into the human era .  the second law of robotics says     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law .             so when they became microscopic  they were invisible to humans     steve added .     that was the important part to the component robots .         and so no one would give them any orders .  okay .     judy nodded .     then what .         the process was flawed     said jane .     each gestalt component robot returns to his full  normal size eventually .  when he does  the laws of robotics will drive him to behave in certain ways   saving humans from harm  following their instructions  and saving themselves when they can   and so each robot runs the risk of changing history .         a very strong likelihood  in hunter   s opinion     steve added with a grin .   hunter nodded but waited patiently for jane to finish her explanation .      yes  i see     said judy .     the first law  in particular .  i remember it now .  the first law says     a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .             very good     said jane .     that   s one reason it   s so urgent for us to go back and get these robots before they change anything .         only one reason .  are there more .         yes     said hunter .     this must remain private among us  because we hope to undo this event .  have you heard on the news about the explosion in russia .         i heard something on my flight here early this morning   trouble in moscow .         yes     said hunter .     more than ordinary trouble .  a nuclear explosion has occurred .         a nuclear explosion .     judy   s eyes widened suddenly .     and that has something to do with our trip back to moscow in      .         exactly     said hunter .     we have learned that when the gestalt robots return to the approximate time at which they left  an instability created by their flawed miniaturization causes them to explode with nuclear force .         the approximate time .  not the exact time .         the gestalt robots left a couple of days ago     said hunter .     apparently the instability is so unpredictable that a few days    worth of uncertainty is involved .         i see .  now i definitely get the picture .     she nodded gravely .     somehow or other  you figured out that the next component robot will return to full size in      .  so we   re going back there to get him before he can change history   and before he can explode in our own time .         you got it     said steve .      but why did these component robots go all over the world .     judy asked .     why bother .  why not just go microscopic right where they were .  if they expected to remain that way  what difference would it make .  no human could find them anyway .         each component robot specialized in certain areas within mc governor to run the city     said jane .     i believe their specialities influenced their choice of where to hide  even though they never expected to participate in human affairs again .         how was mc   influenced .         i found out that mc   was in charge of ethics and morality as applied to the society of mojave center .  i believe he was drawn to this era because of the tyranny of both stalin and hitler .         i agree     said hunter .     judy  is this review sufficient for now .         uh   yes .  i   m still absorbing it all .         we should move to the bohung institute     said hunter .     during the night  i arranged to have our period clothing and belongings prepared .  i left them there for judy to examine .  you have completed your sleep courses in the pertinent languages .         yes     said jane .      let   s go     said steve .   hunter called for a security vehicle and drove it through the smooth  clean streets of mojave center .  broad avenues and narrower side streets ran throughout the underground city  connected by ramps to different levels .  robots drove various sorts of vehicles up and down the streets on their maintenance duties  human pedestrians strolled quietly past the shops and office buildings .  the city continued to function normally  its occupants unaware of hunter   s mission .   hunter stopped outside the front doors of the bohung institute .  the entire bohung institute had been closed and guarded by a detail of security robots under hunter   s orders .  inside the institute  hunter led the team to room f    .   this was a large room designed primarily to house an opaque sphere about fifteen meters in diameter .  the remainder of the room was lined with countertops .  the counters were occupied by computers  monitors  a communications console  and miscellaneous office items .      judy is fluent in both russian and german     said hunter .     however  i have not yet asked   steve and jane  were your sleep courses in those languages effective last night .         sure     said steve  with a smirk .     la .         da     said jane .     they worked fine .         good .  i took the data from the city computer myself .     hunter pointed to the clothes and shoes neatly piled on the counter .     judy  would you look at those for authenticity before we dress .         of course .         and we shall all take back a certain amount of soviet currency from that time     said hunter .     i shall pass it out when everyone is dressed .      one by one  judy shook out the heavy winter clothing .  hunter and steve had brown wool slacks and long black wool coats  with white cotton shirts  singlets  socks  and underwear .  judy and jane had dark blue wool dresses  long black coats  scarves  and white cotton underwear .  gloves  black leather belts  and shoes completed their wardrobe .      the styles are good     said judy  peering closely at the stitching .     we can   t take synthetics  though .  cotton thread .         yes     said hunter .      same with the shoelaces .         yes .      she nodded and turned to hunter .     the only oddity is that none of the clothes have labels .  a label would give the size of the clothing  maybe with a stamped or stenciled number .         how important is that .     hunter asked .     our earlier missions took place at times when such labels were not used .         i doubt anyone will notice     said judy .     if they do  we must all remember to say that we didn   t notice  or that they came off in the laundry .         simple enough     said steve .      how about the jewelry .     jane pointed to three decorative metal lapel pins lying in a tray .   judy picked one up .     this is more than just a pin  isn   t it .         they   re radio communicators     said hunter .     as a robot  i shall use my internal system  but you three must wear those .  will they pass .         yes .  they look simple enough .  but jane and i have scarves for our heads .  you two should have fur hats .         i have considered this     said hunter .     animal fur is not available to us here and we dare not take synthetic fur back with us .  i can tolerate the temperature without one .  if steve requires such a hat  we shall obtain one back in that time .         got it     said judy .      steve     said hunter  pointing to a canvas bag on the counter .     that is an imitation duffel bag of the soviet red army from this period .  if judy passes it  too  then you can carry a change of clothes for each team member and some hard rolls and dried beef strips in it .  these duffel bags will be common at the time  and we can explain its possession if necessary .  we know food will be scarce  but what we take must not attract attention .         that   s good enough     steve said quietly .      i   m sure it   s fine     said judy  pulling it open to look inside .      we must assume that our opponents could be a factor     said hunter .     jane  would you brief judy on them   very briefly .         dr .  wayne nystrom created the experimental governors     said jane .     however  he is not willing to let us simply reconstruct mc governor and turn him over to the governor robot oversight committee .  wayne has also gone back into the past and is trying to get the component robots away from us .         to what end .     judy asked .      he wants to dismantle and study them himself     said hunter .     to find and fix the source of the malfunction on his own .  we have prevented him from getting the first three  but we have not been able to grab wayne .  he has the ability to move in time without returning here and he has a robot named r .  ishihara helping him .         i see     said judy quietly .      please change into your costumes     said hunter .   while judy took the first turn in the adjoining room  hunter called the security detail .  he assigned a new security robot  r .  daladier  to replace ishihara .  when jane stepped out after her turn  now dressed as a muscovite woman of       hunter turned to jane .      jane  this is daladier  he will guard the room .     hunter turned to daladier .     you must understand that our mission involves potential harm to all humans in the world today .  ishihara  failing to be certain of that  failed his instructions .  what i say to you constitutes a first law imperative .  nothing any human  such as dr .  wayne nystrom  says can be allowed to deter your adherence to the assignment i am about to give you .         acknowledged     said daladier .      you must take custody of dr .  wayne nystrom and r .  ishihara if they reappear in this room through the sphere .  as soon as we have gone  you will shut off your hearing and radio reception so that if wayne returns here  he cannot use the second law to control you or to argue this first law imperative with you .  you will not read anything wayne tries to show you  you can blur your vision slightly to avoid this if necessary  while still maintaining enough sight to stop them .  the moment you see or .  nystrom  you will apprehend him  prevent him from leaving the room  and immediately call for help from the rest of the security detail that is assigned to guard the institute .         agreed     said daladier .     is r .  ishihara of equal importance .         no  he isn   t     said jane .     or .  nystrom is critically important .  ishihara is only important in that he is helping wayne nystrom .         i do not expect them     hunter added .     this is merely a contingency  in the event that you have the opportunity to act .      steve should have taken his turn to change .  instead  looking unusually grim  he had not moved .  jane frowned at him  puzzled .      those who are ready  please enter the sphere     said hunter .     i shall set the timer and the console controls .         you don   t need me     said steve .     i   m not going .           steve looked around at all of them  knowing he would get an argument .      what .     jane demanded angrily .      i don   t think i should go     said steve .      i am surprised     said hunter  studying his face .     is something wrong .         no  nothing   s wrong .  but i   m not necessary .  i started thinking about this when i woke up this morning  but i didn   t really decide until now .         what are you talking about .     jane glared at him .     decide what .         you don   t need me this time .  look  in the late cretaceous  maintaining our camp out in the wild was critical to survival .  i made a real contribution .  on the trip to jamaica  well  i went because i had agreed to   you could have managed without me .         not after rita took off on her own     said jane .      and last time  as i think back on the trip to roman germany  we spent most of our energy trying to find each other after we split up .  i don   t think i added anything .         not true     said hunter .     you helped carry our belongings and accompanied jane  allowing us to divide the team when it seemed advisable .         well  anyhow  you really don   t need me in a more recent human era like      .     steve turned to judy .     aren   t all the necessities for human life going to be available in moscow at that timer        well  generally .  but it   s in the middle of a war  where everyone has hardships   some of them severe .     she shrugged .     it   s hard to say exactly what life will be like for us on a given day .         i can   t help with that .  anything that   s happened because of wartime conditions is beyond my help  anyway .  and hunter can protect everyone .  he can also carry the duffel bag more easily than i can .      jane looked at hunter helplessly .      it is true that your duties have changed with each mission     said hunter .     however  your help has sometimes occurred in situations that were not predictable beforehand .  you understand the challenges and the constraints under which the team works .  i believe we still need your participation .      steve shook his head .     i doubt it .  you can keep jane and judy with you and concentrate on mc   and wayne .  i   d like to take my pay for the earlier trips and go on home .         how can you just walk away like this .     jane shouted .     we   ve all been working together .  and you didn   t say anything at breakfast this morning to me .  why didn   t you tell me .         i was still thinking about it     said steve  surprised at her vehemence .      you   re betraying all of us .     she turned her back angrily and folded her arms .      you hired me  remember .  i didn   t take any special oath of loyalty .  it   s a job .  and you don   t need me to do it .     steve turned to hunter .     you remember when you came up to my place on the mountain .         of course     said hunter .      you needed someone familiar with the outdoors to make and maintain camp for your team in the age of dinosaurs .  that was your basis for hiring me .         yes  that is correct .         you don   t need that in moscow in      .  and you didn   t really need it in jamaica .         we needed you in port royal .     jane whirled around again  making her long coat swirl .     don   t you remember what we did together   sneaking up on pirate ships and getting into those sword fights .  and jumping off to row ashore .  what if i   d been alone  steve .         you wouldn   t have been in that situation without me to start with     said steve .     i   m glad i helped .  but you know every mission is different .         your skills could have been necessary in germany of a . d .     as well     said hunter .     the wilderness had many dangers .  you did accompany jane at important times .  we did not utilize most of your skills  i admit  but we might have needed them .         all right  granted     said steve .     but not in moscow .  not in the time you   re going to visit now .         you   ve been part of this team .     jane insisted angrily .     your companionship and experience are part of this team  too .  how can you do this .      steve just shook his head .     i don   t like the idea of being tied down .  hunter  send someone up to my shack with my pay .  judy  nice to meet you .  good luck  hunter .  bye  jane .     he turned toward the door .      where are you going now .     hunter asked .      back home  of course .         how will you get there .         that   s my worry .     steve slipped out the door of the room .  the door closed behind him and his footsteps sounded quickly down the hall .     hunter watched steve go  reviewing his past behavior quickly .  nothing steve had said or done recently had revealed any desire to quit the team .  he was as startled as jane .      what are we going to do .     jane asked quietly .      how important is he .     judy asked .     as the newcomer  i don   t really know what   s going on .         he is essentially correct     said hunter .     the tasks for which i originally hired him are no longer necessary .  we shall go .     he hoisted the duffel bag and passed out some of the soviet currency to jane and judy .     first i shall tend the console and then i shall help you both into the sphere .      jane and judy looked at each other in surprise .  hunter was aware that as humans  their emotions did not shift instantly .  however  he saw no reason to delay their departure further .   in a moment  hunter had set the timer in the console .  after jane and judy were safely inside the big sphere with the duffel bag  he climbed inside and shut the door .  as always  the interior was dark and crowded .  then the sphere vanished .   all three of them tumbled onto cold  hard ground in near darkness .  the barest hint of sunset was still visible in the west .  the sky was clear and the moon threw a gentle light .  their breath frosted in the icy air .   hunter turned up his hearing and infrared vision to scan the immediate area for danger .  they were in open  barren land a short distance from the edge of moscow .  no one was near them .     we are safe for the moment .         where are we .     judy got to her feet  brushing off her coat .     my ears are cold already .     she untied her scarf from her neck and moved it over her head  knotting it under her chin .   jane imitated her .      we are on the outskirts of moscow     said hunter .     i brought us here to avoid appearing right in front of the local people .     he pointed .     the city is blacked out because of the war  but if you look that way  you can see some light leaking out of the shades of windows here and there .         i see them     said judy .      are you warm enough .     hunter asked .      yeah .  and walking will help     said judy .      i   m okay     said jane .     but i wish steve had come .         the walk will not be as long as it looks     said hunter .  he shouldered the duffel bag and they started .      hunter  have you discussed the chaos theory of history with judy .         not yet     said hunter .      i   m familiar with it     said judy  in a derisive tone .     but i just don   t buy it .  not every little  tiny event is going to change the sweep of major historical trends .         in our experience  that has proved to be true of the most insignificant events     said hunter .      i don   t want to hear about any rigid rules     said judy .     now  obviously  we won   t assassinate stalin or hitler  we probably couldn   t do it if we tried .  anything less than that is not likely to change the course of world war ii from where we stand .         you sound like steve on this subject     said jane .     except that you know your history .         only large scale changes can alter the flow of history     said judy .     i see nothing wrong with an aggressive involvement with events while we   re here .         i admit that the most extreme chaos theory of history has not been supported by our actions     said hunter .     in our first three missions into the past  we clearly caused certain changes by our very presence and behavior  even though the changes were all very minor .  no identifiable changes occurred in our own time .         exactly my point     said judy .      our remaining problem is this     hunter added .     none of us knows exactly when the threshold of change will be crossed .  at some point  the sheer weight of the small changes may precipitate a major one .  so we must remain very concerned about this principle .         i just don   t see how the three of us alone can bring about that much change     said judy .     the threshold is pretty high  if you ask me .         i shall point out an example pertaining to egypt     said hunter .     during the napoleonic wars  a battle was fought in egypt between the british and french .  the french defeat was significant but not ultimately decisive .  however  a french soldier digging a trench unearthed the rosetta stone  which led to the later translation of ancient egyptian hieroglyphics .  that translation in turn gave archaeologists the ability to read important writings  illuminating many centuries of history .         yeah  i know about that     said judy .      i didn   t     said jane .     what you   re saying is that the chaotic result of the french campaign was extremely important in ways that had nothing to do with the war .         yes     said hunter .      we might argue that the rosetta stone  or something similar  would have been found within a few decades anyway     said judy .     or that making these translations of hieroglyphics did not  after all  make a real difference in the development of society and industry in our own time at all .         isn   t that an odd argument for a historian .     jane asked .     to suggest that learning about history isn   t important .         wait a minute .     judy laughed .     i   m just saying that importance is relative .         i submit the following     said hunter .     many young people who will enter positions of importance in the cold war that follows world war ii were present in the battle of moscow .  altering which of them live or die could change the course of the cold war  theoretically bringing about the global nuclear war that was in fact just barely avoided during the second half of the twentieth century .         well  i can see that argument .  but maybe the individuals wouldn   t matter that much .  maybe the situation dictated decisions  not the individuals .  sometimes that happens .         our immediate concern is mc       said jane .      yes     said hunter .     i believe that when mc   returns to full size  the first law will drive him to interfere with the war if he can .      jane nodded .     with mc     s background in ethics and morality  his interpretation of the first law will probably have him focus on individuals who make decisions .         judy  where would that take him .     hunter asked .      you   re saying he will attempt to interfere with those who give the orders and carry out the mass destruction     judy said slowly .     that could take him almost anywhere .  immense suffering takes place on both sides  on all levels .  these two regimes both operated on fear and power emanating from the top .  decisions to cooperate and obey orders had to be made all the way down the command structure to the bottom .         sounds horrible     said jane .      it was     said judy .     or  i should say  it is .      they walked in silence for a while .  as they drew closer  hunter observed the buildings of moscow .  clearly  the city was not under attack tonight .      we must find shelter for the night     he said .     judy  where would this be most likely .         well  let me think a minute .  we   re in the first week of december      .  by this time  the german advance has been close to moscow for several months .  it has stalled right now  but moscow has been bombarded .  many people have fled the city and others have been displaced by the destruction .         are you saying that shelter will be difficult to find .     hunter asked .      no .  actually  thousands of people are living in schools and empty warehouses .  soviet factories have been moved east across the ural mountains to get them away from the germans  so lots of big buildings are empty .  we should be able to join a crowd of people in one of them .  after all  it   s only early evening .  everyone will still be awake .         good .      by the time the team had entered the city streets  hunter could see that the city was still active in its relative darkness .  crowds of people were trudging home on the sidewalks from their daily responsibilities  a few laughing and talking but most quiet and exhausted .  from behind all the drapes and shades in the windows  hints of light revealed that people were inside .   jane wrinkled her nose .     what   s the smell .  something   s burning .         coal     said judy .     they burn it to heat buildings .  the smoke always smells like that .         yuck .      judy nudged hunter and pointed down one block  where a big truck with an open back had stopped .  a large group of people  mostly women  were climbing down and going into the entrance of a building .  hunter changed direction and led his companions down to the entrance .   two dour men of average height but substantial girth stood by the doors in heavy overcoats and scarves  watching the crowd stream inside .      we should pose as a family     said judy quietly .     they will view us better that way .         what do you suggest .         given our looks  let   s present you and jane as brother and sister  i   ll be a cousin .  and you must have some reason for not being in the army .         what reason will work .         can you affect an exaggerated limp .         yes  i understand .     hunter nodded and began to limp on his left leg .     this will fit perfectly with our possession of the military duffel bag .  and it is time for us to switch to speaking russian .           when the team reached the entrance to the darkened building  one of the men guarding it moved to block his way .     yes  comrade .  i have not seen you before .         our home is destroyed     said hunter .     we need a place to stay .     he hefted the duffel bag on the strap .     we have no other belongings now but this .         where was this home .     the other man glared suspiciously at him .      to the west of moscow     said judy quickly .     on a collective farm .  overrun by the germans  now .      hunter could see that she had been caught off guard by the question .  he did not respond  concerned that he might contradict something she would say .  she still had the best chance of answering to the guard   s satisfaction .      the germans have been in their positions for weeks .  where have you been until tonight .         a warehouse     said judy .     it was too crowded .  they threw us out .         you are husband and wife .     the guard looked back and forth between them .      no     said hunter .  he nodded toward jane .     this is my sister .         yes     said jane .     our parents died in the war .         i   m his cousin     judy added .      and where did your parents die .     jane hesitated .     i was so upset when it happened .  .  .     she turned to judy uncomfortably .      we were on the run     said judy  with more confidence now .     they were killed somewhere along the highway from minsk  near smolensk .         and where exactly was your collective farm .         just south of smolensk .         what was it called .         the smolensk collective number two .     the guard studied her face for a moment  apparently without more questions .      you sustained an injury  comrade     said the other man  more patiently .     what happened .         my cousin was wounded in the battle of leningrad     judy said proudly .     he was nearly killed .  when he could walk  they sent him home to take care of us .         welcome  comrade     said the second man .     let them in  yevgeny .  we cannot have them freeze all night .      the first man nodded and stepped aside .   hunter led his team inside .  they found themselves in a very large  single room that took up the entire ground floor .  two stories high  with windows that had been painted black  it was already crowded .  a few people had brought chairs or cots  but most were spreading blankets on the bare wooden floor to mark their personal territory .      looks like a warehouse     said judy .     it probably housed industrial materials that were shipped east with the factory equipment .         people are favoring the sides and the front     said hunter .     the back corners are not taken yet .  let us move there quickly and take one for its relative privacy .      hunter patiently picked his way through the crowded room to the right rear corner .  it was far from the heating vents  but not too cold .  he set down the duffel bag .      over there     said judy  pointing across the room .     look .  an old woman is passing out blankets to some people .         we should get some for the two of you     said hunter .      you stay here     said judy .     protect our space .  i   ll get them .         take jane     said hunter .     i shall watch you carefully from here .         oh  i don   t think we   re in immediate danger .     judy headed for the blankets and jane followed her .   hunter observed that his concern was overstated .  under stress  humans could be short tempered and violent  but the people here had fallen into a regular routine  beaten down by the hardships of war and exhaustion .  from what judy had said  this society itself also regimented them severely .   judy and jane returned with some blankets .      they   re wool     judy said  handing one to hunter .     scratchy  but clean and heavy .         i   m not complaining     said jane .     it   s the only padding we   ll have on the floor  too .         use mine for your padding as well .     hunter gave his back to judy .   judy and jane spread out the blankets to sit on .  hunter sat down on the bare floor and leaned back against the cold wall .  he saw that no one was close enough to overhear him if he spoke quietly .      judy  where would mc   go in order to prevent the most harm with the least effort .         well .  .  .     judy glanced around .  then she whispered  switching to english .     he might try to stop the nkvd   the soviet secret police .  they act paranoid  and are irrationally cruel to everyone .  their own people are their primary target .  they are always hunting out potential security risks to the government  but that often means execution or lifetime imprisonment for people who merely ask for information or express an opinion .  and for talking about them  english is even better than russian .  we can   t chance being understood .         are they actually a greater danger than the upcoming battle itself .     hunter shifted to english  leaning close to her and lowering his own voice to a whisper .      the battle will cause a lot of suffering     said judy .     but the soviets will win the battle of moscow .  it   s their first major victory of the war .         are you sure it   s safe to speak english .     jane whispered  glancing around .     if we   re heard  they   ll know we aren   t russian peasants .         for the nkvd  yes     said judy .     we   re better off raising suspicion than being overheard clearly .         on this subject  then  we shall risk it     whispered hunter .     however  judy  the soviets do not know they are going to win .  mc   mayor may not know  i cannot assume his motives or information in choosing to come here .  jane has surmised that he has come here because of his responsibility for ethics in mojave center  but we have no certainty .  so my question about the danger from the nkvd still stands .         all right     said judy .     i   ll give you the whole picture .  despite their impending counterattack  the soviets are still on the defensive because this is their territory .  as they see it  they must either surrender to nazi cruelty or run .  if they flee  they expect to suffer even more from the winter and the pursuing enemy than if they fight .  the russian people are caught between stalin  hitler  and the russian winter .  those are unbelievably horrible options .         you are saying what .     hunter asked .      i   m saying that the russians don   t feel they have much of a choice about whether to fight .  so mc   can   t go to stalin  or the soviet generals  and talk them out of the violence .  and if he tries to persuade the nkvd to be more reasonable  they   ll throw him in prison or blow his electronic brains out .         the german army is the aggressor on the military front  then     said jane .     maybe he   ll try to stop them .         he doesn   t really need to     said judy .     since the soviets are going to drive them back anyhow .  by this time  the german army is almost frozen in place .         what happened to them .     hunter asked .     how could they get this far and then fail without being defeated .         they were handled with tremendous incompetence by hitler .  and one of the top german generals refused to issue winter clothing to his troops .  he was afraid they would lose confidence in his personal guarantee that they would take shelter in moscow before the winter turned cold .         that   s crazy     said jane .      that   s right     said judy grimly .     if it weren   t for the suffering of all the ordinary people caught in the middle  i   d say these two regimes   hitler   s and stalin   s   simply deserved each other .         suppose mc   convinced the germans to turn away from moscow     said hunter .      i don   t see how     said judy .     hitler   s not at the front  and he makes the ultimate strategic decisions .         please consider the supposition .         well   if the battle doesn   t take place  that would be a change of some magnitude     she said slowly .     but i can   t see it reversing the course of the war .  the soviets will still have the initiative on this front .         perhaps the german command should not be our first priority     said hunter .     i brought us here because the data in the sphere console told me that moscow  not the german lines to the west  was mc     s destination .  the site of the nuclear explosion confirmed it .         mc   may move quickly once he returns to full size     said jane .     we don   t know if he would choose to stay in moscow or not .         the center of the recent explosion in our own time was in moscow     hunter added .     of course  mc   could have moved around a great deal between now and our own time  once he had the advantages of normal human size .  for now  we will remain in moscow and try to learn if anyone of mc     s description has been noticed .      judy nodded .      do we have a plan of action .     jane asked .      i do not want to separate the team     said hunter .     as you know  we have had reason to regret doing so in each of the previous missions .         and without steve  one of us would be alone     jane added  shaking her head .      dinnertime     said judy  nodding toward the front .   much of the crowd had lined up to receive meager rations of bread  boiled potatoes  and water from the long table .  the remainder were still arranging their personal belongings at various places around the floor .  only a few had already been served .   hunter stood up .     we must join the line .         time to switch back to russian     said jane .   hunter led them to the rear of the line  where they waited patiently .  they passed through the line  receiving their dinner of thin soup and a hard roll in an odd assortment of dishes .  then they returned to their corner to eat .   jane and judy sat in the corner itself .  hunter placed himself where his body would block the view of them from the other occupants of the room .  then he slipped some of their dried meat out of the duffel bag for jane and judy to eat while no one else could see them .   hunter observed that the russians were still wide awake after dinner .  his team   s first two missions had taken place in summer and the most recent in early fall .  this was the first one to take place in winter  with early nightfall .  bedtime would not arrive for a few hours yet .  of his team members  jane had recently completed a full night   s sleep  though judy had risen very early to make the trip to mojave center .     as jane finished her dinner  chewing on her hard roll  she saw judy lean to her right to see past hunter .      you know     judy said quietly .     after years of studying this era  i finally have a chance to see the people of this time for myself .  since most of the people here are women  i   m sure that i can approach them comfortably for a little conversation .         please be careful     said hunter .      i   ll return our dishes when we   re all finished     said judy .     then i   ll see if i can strike up a conversation on my way back through the crowd .  maybe i can learn something .         you want to talk to people .     jane asked  glancing at hunter .      please be very careful     hunter repeated .   judy smiled .     don   t worry .  i have as much fear of the nkvd as anyone here .         we do not want to change anyone   s behavior unnecessarily     hunter added .      i don   t think anything i can say here will change the outcome of the battle .         i   ll go with you     said jane .   they collected their empty dishes and worked their way back to the front of the warehouse .  jane knew that judy believed hunter had an exaggerated fear of how much influence any of the team could possibly have on historical events .  so jane wanted to keep tabs on how judy handled herself .   judy took her time on the return trip  looking around for someone to approach .  many people were obviously as comfortable as they could get  having grown accustomed to life in these conditions .  others tended babies or small children and were too occupied to make small talk .  jane followed her  also surveying the crowd .      how about her .     jane asked quietly  pointing to one side of the room .   a tired  bent  elderly woman fumbled with her blanket  trying to shake it out with stiff  gnarled fingers .  she shuffled to one side  still stooped over  and shook it again .  no one paid any attention to her .   judy worked her way toward her in the crowd .  the old woman was obviously alone  though others sat nearby with their own families .  by the time judy reached her  the old woman was on her hands and knees  patiently smoothing and straightening the blanket on the hard floor .   judy squatted down and tugged the wrinkles out of the last corner .  the old woman looked up at her  startled .  she looked scared .      i   m only helping     judy said gently .     i   m sorry if i surprised you .      the old woman nodded  still watching judy cautiously .  then she glanced up at jane  who had come to stand behind judy .  the woman   s face was sharp featured and deeply lined .  after a moment  she relaxed a little and sat down on the blanket .      i   m judy taub .  what   s your name .         ivana voronov     she said quietly .  she smiled  though  for the first time .     please sit down .     she patted the blanket and looked up at jane again .     and your friend  too .      judy squatted down on the blanket  keeping her boots off of it .  jane joined her .  the old woman looked back and forth between them  waiting for someone to say something .      we   re new in this shelter     said judy .      oh .  where have you been .         well .  .  . on the move .  we   ve been displaced by the war .     judy shrugged .     we saw everyone getting off the buses .  where were you .  in a work brigade .         oh  yes .  we   re digging the big ditches to the west .         ditches .     jane asked  turning to judy .      antitank ditches     said judy quietly .     a quarter million muscovites are digging them with hand shovels .  three quarters of the workers are women  since the men are either in the army or working in heavy industry .  the ditches are to block the advance of german tanks from the west of the city .         by hand .     jane shook her head  impressed .     hard work .  especially in this weather .      ivana grimaced  rubbing her hands .     i can   t do very much at my age .  my hands hurt all the time .  so does my back .  these young girls  now  they work very hard .         thousands of people abandoned their jobs and homes during the past few months to get away from moscow     said judy .     fleeing the germans long before the battle .  ivana  why didn   t you go then .         yes  yes  those with money or companions or relatives to see all hurried away to the east .  i had no means to travel and nowhere to go .         what about your family .     judy asked gently .     do you have family members in the army .         my sons are in the red army     she said quietly  lowering her gaze to the blanket .     i have heard nothing from them for over a year .         where   s your husband .     jane asked .      he was taken .     ivana   s voice was almost a whisper .  she lowered her head  hiding her face .      you don   t mean by the germans  do you .     judy whispered slowly .   ivana shook her head  wiping away tears .   even jane understood that the nkvd had taken her husband .   judy leaned closer to her  still whispering .     do you know why .         no .  it was two years ago  when so many were taken .  they gave no reason and i have heard nothing .      judy nodded .   jane glanced at the people around them .  if they were listening  they were pretending otherwise .  however  ivana had become a liability to them .  with her husband arrested  she herself might be under the watch of the secret police .  her neighbors would not befriend her for fear that they  too  would come under the scrutiny of the nkvd .      have you been in this work brigade long .     jane asked .     staying here .         oh  yes .     ivana nodded  apparently glad to change the subject .     i   ve been in it for a couple of months .  my own building was destroyed by shelling  so i had to come here .  but it   s not a bad place .  the shelter is good and they always have food here .         do you know most of the people .  at least by sight .     jane leaned closer  too .      i suppose .  i don   t talk to very many people .     she shrugged  embarrassed .      how about the other work brigades .  do you work alongside others .         sometimes  yes .  not always .  our location each day is different .  so long as we dig the ditches  no one cares which brigade we are next to or where we dug the day before .      jane turned to judy .     i want to get hunter .  she might be able to help us locate .  .  . our friend .         all right     said judy .     good idea .  i   ll stay here with ivana .      jane stood up and patiently worked her way over to hunter .  now that the crowd had finished dinner and had taken their positions for the night  with some of them stretched out to relax  the way was more difficult .  it took her a minute or a little more to reach him .  he protectively watched her progress .      come and meet someone     she said quickly .     i think she can help us .     she turned to point to judy and ivana .   they were gone .        hunter looked where jane pointed .  he saw the empty blanket neatly arranged on the floor .  then he scanned the room quickly for judy and saw her by the door .   two men in long  black wool overcoats were escorting jane and an elderly woman out the front door of the warehouse .  in the front  where others could see them  the crowd in the warehouse had fallen silent .  yet they also looked away  at each other or at their belongings  pretending not to notice as they kept their hands busy with little tasks .      who are they .     jane whispered .      perhaps they are nkvd agents     hunter whispered back .     i would guess that they must be .         oh  no .     jane clutched his arm .     i   m sure they are .  ivana   s husband   that   s the old woman   s name   was taken by them a couple of years ago .         i have to get judy back     said hunter  feeling a surge of tension from the first law .     you will be much safer here than chasing the nkvd with me .  do you agree .         yes .  i   m sure i   ll be fine right here .  i   ll stay here in the crowd and lie low .  and i have my lapel pin to call you if i need to .         good .     hunter had no doubt that he could trust jane   s judgment  unlike steve  she had never caused trouble by improvising her moves .     in this crowd  of course  you will be in danger of being overheard if i call you  so i cannot .      jane nodded .     get going .      hunter did not want to be seen leaving the warehouse .  while judy and jane had returned the dishes and had spoken to ivana  he had studied the layout of the building itself .  moving casually with his overcoat bundled under one arm  he worked his way to the rest room and went inside .   as he had surmised  its outside wall had one long  vertical window in a wooden casement .  he turned on the water in the sink to create noise and pulled the window open with a creak and a low rumble .  then he turned off the water  slipped outside  and slowly pulled the window down again .  it made more noise  but now he knew it would not be too loud .  once it was closed  he shook out his overcoat and put it on .   in the cold  clear winter night  hunter turned and jogged toward the front of the warehouse .     judy was scared as the men took her and ivana out the front door .  they were not rough  but held their prisoners    arms firmly .  outside  they pushed judy forward against a large  black car without a word and frisked her .   she and ivana were put into the back of the car .  the men had not spoken at all .  they got in  slammed the doors  started the engine  and pulled away from the warehouse .   ivana was quivering in terror  speechless and beyond tears .  judy reached over and held her hand .  ivana did not seem to notice .   judy   s studies had taught her that stalin was responsible for the deaths of more people than any other individual in history .  she knew about the labor camps in the gulag where people were tortured  starved  and worked to death  and about the mass murders committed by his agents here at the front .  these people were beyond rational argument .   truth and accuracy were not valued by this government .  just a few months before this time  the nkvd had threatened to arrest red air force pilots as    panic mongers    when they had honestly reported the german advance toward moscow .  the values of the nkvd were so unpredictable that dealing with them was extremely dangerous .   judy did not dare speak .  remembering her lapel communicator  however  she reached up and switched it on .  the agents had not bothered with a thorough search yet  they might take it from her later .  now  however  hunter might pick up some sounds through it  such as the engine noise from the car .  she knew that the agents had ignored the modest pin as a danger because  in this time  no radio transmitter could be made that small .   the agents had come for ivana without explanation .  apparently they had taken judy because she had been with ivana .  that was all judy knew about them .   she looked out the car window into the darkened city .  searchlights swept the cold  clear sky for enemy planes  but no attack was occurring .  even artillery shells were not falling .  she knew that at this time  the german army was virtually immobile with the cold and was running out of both supplies and human energy as winter deepened .   even with her knowledge of this period  she could not recall exactly when the aerial attacks took place  and when they had been discontinued .  tonight  apparently  moscow was spared .  hoping that the ride would last a long time  she wondered if the lapel pin was actually transmitting .     when hunter came around the comer of the warehouse  he found the streets deserted .  he saw a single car driving away from the front of the warehouse .  he stopped and shifted to his infrared vision  which made visible the silhouettes of judy and ivana in the backseat .   hunter watched for a moment  unsure of what to do .  though he had more physical stamina than a human  even he could not keep up with a car for long  so when it was out of sight and hearing he would lose it .   suddenly hunter began to receive the static and engine noise from judy   s transmitter .  he understood that she had switched on her lapel pin .  now he had a chance to follow the car even after it left the range of his aural and visual sensors .   before following the car  however  he decided to make himself less conspicuous by altering his appearance .  his height was his most obvious feature  so he reduced it to six feet .  naturally  he could not change his total mass  so he remained just as heavy  but he now possessed a very solid  stocky build .  he made his face broader to remain consistent with his new body .  however  because he wanted judy to be able to recognize him  he did not change his face very much .  on their second mission he had done this  and when jane had thought he was a buccaneer  she had clubbed him over the head with a belaying pin .   his clothes were now a problem .  the bulky overcoat and shirt were still adequate  but his thicker waist threatened to pop the buttons on the waistband of his pants .  he slimmed his waist again slightly  putting more mass into his legs .  then he paused to fold under his sleeves and cuffs  since they were now too long for his shorter limbs .   the red taillights of the car were nearly out of sight by now .  hunter could still hear the engine noise through judy   s transmitter  however .  he took off at a run .   the car turned a corner to the right and vanished .  hunter maintained his pace at first .  then  when he heard another vehicle coming up the street behind him  he ducked into the shadow of a doorway .   he lost more time as he waited  but he could not afford to be stopped by military police  or more nkvd agents  or anyone else in authority .  at least the streets had very few people out who would notice him or report him .  when the way was clear again  he ran as fast as he could  and soon made the same turn himself .   ahead of him  the red taillights were already vanishing over a slight rise in the street .  the black car had now joined a couple of other vehicles going in the same direction .  however  with the radio signal to follow  hunter could still identify the one he followed .   no pedestrians were on this street  either .  though the city was very dark  the clear sky gave hunter enough moonlight to maneuver .  he could hear the radio signal from judy slowly and inexorably fading as the car drove away from him .  now he hoped that they would stop or at least be delayed before he lost the signal entirely .     jane sat huddled in her corner of the warehouse  feeling very much alone .  no one bothered her and  from what she could see  no one even seemed to have noticed her .  she reassured herself with the reminder that  of course  hunter would come hurrying back if she called him .  on the other hand  she would not interfere with his hunt for judy without an absolutely critical emergency right here .  she was uncomfortable simply because she felt so isolated here in this cold  gloomy place .   if steve had come on this mission  he would be here with her  right now .     judy stiffened when the car pulled into the rear lot of a large building .  the two men opened the back doors and pulled judy and ivana out by their arms .  as before  the men did not speak .   the inside of the building was dimly lighted  cold  and silent .  in the shadows  judy saw old  decorative wooden molding that had been ignored for years  judging by the filth collected around it .  from the regular distance separating the doors  she guessed it might have been a hotel in the czarist years .   the footsteps of all four of them tapped loudly as they walked down a large hall .  judy and ivana were taken to a small room lighted by a hanging lamp with a single bulb .  their escorts then left  loudly snapping the door lock into place .  the room had no other doors and no windows .   ivana quivered with fear .  judy looked around .  the room was set up as an interrogation or meeting room  not as a prison cell .  a long table ran down the center  with chairs on both sides of it .  she eased ivana into a chair  then pulled out another for herself  wondering how long they would have to wait for something else to happen .      ivana .  why would they want you .     judy asked quietly .     do you know .      the old woman just stared at her .      why did they take your husband .  what exactly happened .  maybe i can help somehow .      ivana just shook her head .  then she looked up at the light fixture and around the nearly empty room .  she gestured vaguely at the walls .   finally judy understood what ivana was trying to express .  ivana was afraid that the room was bugged with secret listening devices .  in this era  such devices would be very unsophisticated by the standards of judy   s time  but they would work .  judy simply nodded and stopped asking questions .   suddenly judy realized that if hunter had been able to track her radio signal  it might also influence the nkvd reception .  she decided  however  not to turn off her lapel pin .  it was her only hope of telling hunter where she was  so she would have to take the chance .   now that the engine noise from the car was gone  she realized she should send a sound of some kind .  she reached up and idly began tapping her lapel pin with her fingernails .  ivana paid no particular attention .   judy decided that the fact that ivana   s husband had been taken was enough reason for ivana to be arrested  too .  if he was still alive somewhere  he might have done or said something that had brought this about .  her sons  wherever they were with the red army  might also have attracted the attention of the political commissars assigned to the military .   judy remembered one case from the stalin era in which a man was sent to prison for thirty five years because he asked an nkvd agent why his neighbor had been arrested .  for that matter  judy   s presence with ivana in the crowded warehouse was the only reason that she had been taken .   judy wondered why no one had questioned them yet .     as hunter continued to run at a steady pace  except when he ducked out of sight from other vehicles  he realized that the signal from judy was growing stronger .  first the engine noise stopped  then he heard car doors opening and closing .  those sounds were followed by the creak of a building door and the sound of four sets of footsteps on an interior floor .   he knew that judy and ivana were unharmed so far from the questions judy had asked ivana .  from those he had also surmised that they were alone .  though conversation had stopped  the clear tapping and scratching sounds became louder with each stride he took .   finally the radio signal was so strong that hunter knew judy was within a hundred meters of him .  some quick zigzags in his route helped him focus on the source of the transmission .  she was inside a very large building right in front of him .  almost an hour had passed since he had left the warehouse .   the building was constructed of stone and brick .  most of its windows were completely dark  but the light shone around the shades on the first floor .  since the city was blacked out for the night  the external lights were off .   hunter assessed his internal energy level .  the prolonged run in cold weather had lowered his reserves significantly  but he would be able to function normally for a while yet .  he could not estimate how long  because the length of time would depend on his energy expenditure in rescuing judy and the duration he spent in the cold .  certainly the first law gave him no choice about attempting to help judy immediately .   before planning his actions  he considered the complex of first law imperatives weighing on him .  most importantly  he could not interfere with the nkvd   s historical actions .  he could not knowingly create any changes in the course of history .  of almost equal importance  he had to protect judy from harm .  as he had discussed with his team in the briefing before this mission  however  he now understood that the historical process would clearly accept some small level of involvement from him .   three approaches seemed open to him .  the first  direct confrontation  risked violence against judy and precipitating a change of actions by the nkvd toward ivana  so he discarded that .  the second was stealth  but he worried that sneaking into the building would take too long  since the nkvd might act quickly against its two new prisoners .  that left a simple bluff as the most direct and least violent course of action .   as steve had sometimes reminded him  improvising could be very useful .  hunter prepared himself to try it as he walked up to the front entrance  assuming a casual  confident walk .  the front door was locked  but he heard the metal pins rattle inside the knob .  they sounded simple and primitive .  in all likelihood  they would break easily .   he grasped the knob and forced it to turn .  the insides of the lock snapped and ground as he broke them .  however  a second lock held a metal bolt in place and he had no way to grab hold of it .   hunter fingered the doorjamb .  the wood was old and fairly solid  but it could be broken .  doing so would make noise and attract attention inside the building .  he decided that he would have to take that risk .   bracing himself with his legs  he crouched and positioned himself to spring forward .  then he slammed his entire weight against the door at the point where it would apply the most force against the bolt .  the bolt tore through the wooden doorjamb with a splintering sound as the door opened .   then he walked inside and calmly closed the door behind him .        at this late hour  no one sat behind the front counter .  the lobby was dark  though a light was on in a main hallway .  a burly man in a plain gray business suit was bending over a coffee percolator on a small wooden table about halfway down the hall .  he looked up in surprise and then walked forward  frowning .      who are you  comrade .  this office is closed .  what do you want here .      at the sound of his voice  another door opened and two more men  dressed in similar suits  followed the first man toward hunter .      where are the new prisoners .     hunter demanded .     i must see them immediately .         are you with the agency .     the first man spoke more cautiously .     we have not met .  my name is        hunter pushed past him .     stop interfering .  i shall have you all on report .  where are they .     the radio signal was very strong  telling him that judy was in a room right down the hall in front of him .      we must see your identification     another man protested .     please  comrade .  we can all cooperate after procedures have been followed .      hunter glared into the man   s eyes  gambling that the system of intimidation in this society also operated within this agency itself .     i cannot be bothered right now with the whining of subordinates .  if you will not show me the prisoners  i shall find them myself .      he shoved this man  also  but the third reached up to grab his upper arm .   instead of resisting  hunter looked down at this man   s face  as well .     i hear the weather is very cold out at the front .  since you have so much energy  they could use you there .  or perhaps you would prefer an assignment to vladivostok  where the siberian wind will keep you safe from german tanks .      suddenly uncertain  the other man stepped back  glancing at his two companions  and released hunter .   carrying the bluff forward  hunter strode past the third man and moved toward the room from which the radio signal came .     earlier that night  dr .  wayne nystrom had landed with a thump on hard ground .  he looked at his companion  the humaniform robot r .  ishihara .  they seemed to have arrived in their new time and place safely .      you okay  ishihara .         yes     the robot said calmly .   wayne surveyed the dry  frozen rolling plains around them .  the sky was clear but the sun was red in the west  low over the horizon .     well  it looks right so far .  if i calculated correctly  we   re on the russian steppe just to the rear of the german lines west of moscow in december of      .  it looks like the steppe in december  i think  but i don   t see anyone .  good for us that there   s no snow .         i hear the sounds of primitive machinery faintly in the distance     said ishihara .     to the east of us .  i expect we have arrived where you intended .         what kind of machines .         rough internal combustion engines  i believe .  a few small vehicles .  i hear nothing to suggest that large scale movement or violence is occurring at this moment .         good .     wayne tugged his long fur cloak tighter around the knee length tunic he wore .     the only trouble with coming directly here from germany in a . d .    is that we   re still wearing these clothes .         we shall be warm  at least     ishihara observed .  he was dressed similarly .     unless we find shelter  that is very important .         yeah .  i   m sure we can get contemporary clothes from someone  somehow .  i wonder what the germans of this time will make of us when they see us .     wayne grinned wryly .     they certainly won   t believe that we just arrived after visiting their distant ancestors .         no .     ishihara looked at the weak sun  low in the sky to the west .     night is falling .  even colder temperatures are imminent .  i suggest we start walking .         all right .  where to .         well  i have begun monitoring the german radio traffic .  it is heavy  coming from the east of us in the same area as the machine sounds .         you can understand german .         yes .  and i remind you that we dare not speak english in front of them  since the british and americans are enemies of the germans .  do you speak any russian or german .         no russian     said wayne .     i studied german  but only to read technical research .  i never spoke it much .  what about you .         as a researcher at the bohung institute  i took all the necessary data for modern german and russian a long time ago in order to read technical documents  also japanese .  so i shall be able to communicate here in those languages  though they will have evolved some in the forms i know .         i still have my radio pin  but for now i   ll let you handle this     said wayne .     in fact  i have an extra  i kept the one i took from steve in germany .  anyhow  just lead the way to the closest people you can find .      ishihara began to walk .  wayne fell into step with him .  the open ground was uneven and hard and the wind whipped across them from the northwest .  nothing was visible across the barren  flat farmland .      what is our long range plan .     ishihara asked .     where do we expect to find that mc   has returned to his full size .         well  i   m trying something a little different this time     said wayne .     actually  from the information i was able to obtain from the console on the sphere  i expect his miniaturization will end in moscow  behind the soviet lines .         you do .  why did you bring us here  behind the german lines  then .         i   ve come after three of the component robots now  and every time  they have been adept at avoiding hunter and his team when they first return to full size .  he has been able to run them down eventually  but never right away .         do you expect mc   to come here somehow .         yes .  i have been considering the effect of the first law on mc   when he analyzes the situation he has entered here .  with a war going on  he will want to stop the violence by interfering with the aggressor .         that would be the germans  i believe .         exactly     said wayne .     since the german army has invaded russian soil  i think he will come to the german lines to stop them if he can .  if we   re waiting for him  that will give us a jump on hunter   s team .         how extensive is your knowledge of history at this time .     ishihara asked .      very limited .  i remember which countries fought on which side .  and i know the germans mistreated the jews in europe .  nazi germany and the soviet union were pretty unpleasant  i guess .         my data is not extensive  either     said ishihara .     i merely have some summaries of the war given as part of my general education .  but your evaluation of german treatment of jews is an understatement of great magnitude .         it is .  why  what           alert     ishihara interrupted  suddenly looking into the distance to the east .      you hear something .         i have picked up a radio transmission between a patrol vehicle and its base .  the vehicle is on routine patrol  but it is coming this way .         have they seen us .         no  but they will soon  even in the waning light .  i suggest that we devise a personal history we can give to them .      by now  even wayne could hear the loud  rough engine in the distance .  a tiny speck of headlights was barely visible in the dusk .  wayne and ishihara kept walking .      we   d better make it quick     said wayne .     what do you suggest .         we must pretend to come from other countries .  i have a japanese name but not a japanese appearance  i was merely named after a japanese roboticist when i was created .  unlike hunter  i do not have the ability to change my appearance .  but maybe i can think of a way to trade on the german alliance with japan somehow .         what do you mean .     wayne was watching the german patrol .  so far  they apparently had not seen the two travelers yet  since the patrol was moving obliquely to them .      i am not certain yet .  i only know that my german  coming from many years in the future  will not pass as native to this time  so i won   t try to fool anyone .  however  your surname     nystrom     is swedish .  i see no reason to falsify it  your appearance matches that of your ancestors and sweden was neutral in this war  though the other scandinavian countries fought against germany .  we shall present you as swedish .         all right .      they walked in silence for a while .  the headlights grew larger  bouncing over the hard soil .  finally the lights changed direction and began to move straight toward them .      we have been seen     said ishihara .     the patrol has just reported to their base that they are going to interrogate two men on foot .  apparently they had just enough sunlight left to see our movement .      wayne grinned wryly .     i can hardly wait .      the small spot in the distance grew quickly as it raced toward them .  soon wayne could see that it was a vehicle designed with a cab in the front and a large  open back full of soldiers .  in the poor light  their gray uniforms and helmets made them almost invisible .  they held rifles warily and two of them were tending some larger weapon mounted on a swivel .      do you know what that   s called .     wayne asked .     their vehicle .         it might fit the term     armored car        said ishihara .     my data lacks a diagram  however .  that weapon on the front is a machine gun .  the patrol is accustomed to violence .  we must not risk angering them .         let   s stop walking and wait .      ishihara suddenly loosened his belt and reached into his tunic .     i believe we may be searched .         we don   t have any weapons .         i suggest you give me the device that triggers the time travel sphere     said ishihara .     i have opened a panel in my abdomen .  i believe i can slip the device inside my torso safely .         well .  .  . okay .     wayne gave it to him .     but it doesn   t look like a weapon .  why would they want it .         they will find it mysterious and might take it to study .  certainly we cannot afford to lose it .         no   no argument about that .      the german patrol slowed carefully as it drew near .  the soldiers looked over wayne and ishihara  their faces clearly puzzled by the long cloaks  tunics  and leggings .  some of them grinned as they muttered to each other .   one of the germans spoke .  wayne could not understand him at all  certainly the archaic german he had learned for the previous mission was no help .  ishihara answered him politely  however .  they spoke for a moment  then the german nodded .  he gestured for two soldiers to jump down .  they did so  their calf length black boots thumping on the hard ground .   ishihara leaned very close to wayne and whispered in english .     they will frisk us .  cooperate with them .  their commander  a korporal  has agreed to take us to german lines .         does he believe you .  about my being swedish and   whatever else you told him .         he has accepted it tentatively  but he is suspicious .  i told him that i lived in japan and took the name of a friend .  we must remain very careful .         got it .     wayne  at the gesture of the german soldiers  raised his arms high over his head .  he did not move as one of them quickly patted his clothing up and down the length of his body .  another did the same to ishihara .  then both soldiers stepped back and pointed to the back of the armored car .   the soldiers helped wayne and ishihara mount the back of the armored car .  the car lurched forward suddenly  into a wide turn .  as it rumbled over the frozen ground  the soldiers ducked down behind the steel sides of the car to avoid the sharp wind .  wayne and ishihara crouched with them .  around them  the nearest soldiers tugged on their fur cloaks and spoke quietly among themselves .     hunter strode down the hall with the three nkvd agents protesting and pleading  but no longer trying to grab him .  he could see that they remained intimidated by his threats and selfassuredness .  they were still arguing with him as he reached the door to the room from which the radio signal emanated .   ignoring the arguments of the agents  hunter tried the doorknob and found the door locked .  he turned and glared at the nearest man .     open this door  comrade .  now .         i have no key .     he backed away .      i do not believe you .  you all have keys .     hunter turned to another man .     open it .  i insist .      the second man folded his arms and shook his head .     we must follow procedure  comrade .  surely you would not argue with us about that .      hunter looked at the third man  who merely stared angrily back at him .      is that you  hunter .     judy   s voice whispered to him through his internal receiver .     it   s judy  we   re in here .      hunter decided that he could not wrestle with all three agents to get a key  since he was hampered by the first law requirement not to hurt them .  even with his greater strength  their sheer weight would stop him .  on the other hand  he could not afford to leave judy now .   a quick look into the crack between the door and the frame showed hunter that this door did not have a bolt lock .  he grasped the doorknob firmly  as he had done at the front door  and simply turned it slowly  with great force .  again  he heard the metal pins breaking .  then he shoved the door open and stepped inside the room .   behind him  one agent gasped in surprise  another muttered to himself .   hunter saw judy rising from a chair on one side of a table .  gently  he took ivana   s arm and drew her to her feet  she would not look up at him .  he walked her back to the doorway  while the agents stared at him in astonishment .  this time they backed away  making room for her .   when hunter had moved ivana out of the room  he closed the door behind her  though of course the broken latch would not catch .  a quick glance around the room showed him that it had no other exits .  he had no way even to pretend that they were escaping through a window  another door  or even a large vent .   judy watched him uncertainly .  hunter had already decided to take the greatest risk of exposing new technology he had ever considered on these missions .  before the agents regained their composure and entered  he walked over to judy and triggered his belt control  taking them back to their own time .        steve angrily marched down the hall away from room f    in the bohung institute .  he was mad at jane for arguing with him .  even more  he was mad at himself for handling his resignation so poorly .   as he furiously replayed the conversation in his mind  he realized that he should have raised the subject earlier .  jane had a legitimate point about that .  he could have shared his thoughts over breakfast  while he was still undecided .   at the same time  the episode reminded him that he really did not belong with educated  sophisticated company .  jane and hunter would have handled themselves properly .  so would all the historians who had joined them for one mission or another .  he was better off up in his mountain shack .   steve also pictured jane in his mind .  he had grown to like her a lot and  in jamaica  he had felt they were growing closer .  then in germany  they had not spent much time alone together .  after all  those missions were serious  not a time to socialize .  in any case  he still saw no reason that a woman with her education would be interested in a desert rat like himself .  he was better off just going home .   steve turned the last corner into the main lobby and headed for the front doors .  then running footsteps behind him got his attention .  puzzled  he stopped and turned around .      steve .     hunter   s voice boomed from down the hall .  when he came bounding around the corner  his long black overcoat flapping around him  he was recognizable  but much altered   shorter and broader than usual .     we need help .         huh .  come on  hunter .  we already settled that .  you don   t need me .         i have an emergency  steve .  we already left .     hunter walked up to steve  calmly now .      you already left   and came back again .         prematurely  i assure you .  we have not even begun to locate mc   .         what happened .  you would never even consider coming back here like this in the middle of the other missions .         the first law gave me no other choice .  i had to bring judy back here to escape the potential of extreme harm .  jane is in      alone .  please help .         well  you can rejoin jane right after you left her  can   t you .  you can take care of her .         i have considered this .  the society we entered is more complex than that of the roman frontier or the jamaican buccaneers .  the stalin regime is very dangerous and unpredictable .  finding mc   near the front of a major war will be more difficult in the industrial age than in earlier times .  i am desperate for your help .         you sure .     steve looked at him skeptically .      i even took another step out of desperation .  in prior missions  i would not knowingly allow any local to see the team appear or vanish in time  because it might set up lines of thinking or behavior that have a significant effect on them .  however  i had to escape with judy from a confined room .  nkvd agents saw us go in and will find us gone  even though the room has no exit except the one they are watching .         really .  that   s a big change for you .     steve suddenly realized how serious this was .     you must have been desperate .         i have just taken two risks i would not have considered before .  the irrationality and viciousness of the nkvd required me to take this lesser risk  rather than allow them the chance to torture judy for information .         yeah     said steve .     if they questioned her under torture  and she broke  they would learn that people were coming back from the future .         these were among my considerations  yes .         well  i approve of your looser interpretation of chaos theory .  but if any of you had changed history  it would be different right now  already .         it could be changed  right now  in ways that we have not noticed in the few seconds since i have returned .  judy and i must go back .  please join us .      steve sighed  but nodded .  as much as he did not want to rejoin the team  he did like feeling needed .     i have one request  though  hunter .         what is that .         would you change your appearance back to normal  at least until this masquerade becomes necessary again .  i can   t get used to this .         oh  yes .  of course .      steve walked with him quickly back to room f    .   in the room  judy was pacing anxiously .     are we ready .  can we go right back .         one more moment     said hunter .  he altered the shape of one forefinger slightly and plugged it into an electrical outlet .     i used an usually large amount of my stored energy during the night .  recharging from here will be very brief .  steve will come with us this time .         ivana can   t survive the nkvd     said judy frantically .     we have to help her somehow .  let   s go right back .         no     hunter said firmly .     the nkvd took you because you happened to be with her .  it was the result of our presence and i could justify taking you away again .  however  the nkvd came for ivana for reasons of their own .  we did not precipitate her arrest in any way .         you mean you refuse to help her .     judy   s eyes were wide with shock .      i must .  the first law imperative to avoid changing history requires it .         hunter     she wailed .     please .  how can one elderly woman   s freedom change the course of history .  how .  tell me that  will you .         the potential chain of events we could set in motion would be impossible to predict .         maybe it won   t make any difference .  if you can   t predict it  you can   t know .         the chance of harm to all the humans in the time line is too great to risk     hunter said patiently .      all right .  all right .     judy took a deep breath .     just indulge me for a moment  though .         how .         give me an example of how saving ivana might ruin history as we know it .  she   s already old  hunter .  and she probably won   t survive long after this battle anyway  but her suffering could be eased .         ivana alone is not the problem .  we must also consider the nkvd agents with whom she is in contact .  the agents are younger and may survive into the cold war era at the end of world war ii  less than four years from her time .  their actions and opinions may be influenced by what happens to her           specifically  hunter .  what could these agents do that would matter .         perhaps these agents will be politically active when the soviet union comes to an end in the early     s     said hunter .     what if seeing the cruelty of their system to a helpless old woman in      helped to change their opinion of the system they served .  if we rescue ivana somehow  maybe they will have one less doubt about their country .         that   s a very small change .         i hate to argue his side     said steve .     but in this case  i agree .  these agents may have relatives who will remember family stories about this time  too  and be influenced .         ivana has two sons in the red army     judy said slowly .      they may die in the war or they may live into the cold war years  too     said hunter .     what if the fate of their mother spurred them to participate in the later dismantling of the soviet union .  if she is rescued  they might           might not turn against the system     judy finished for him .  she sighed .     i get it .  i guess i always did .  i just wanted to hear you convince me .         i am already worried that vanishing with you out of the room the way we did may have disturbed the nkvd agents significantly     said hunter .   judy nodded solemnly .      judy  did the agents photograph you .         uh  no .  they just put us in the room and made us wait maybe they were working out what questions to ask or something .         you are still in danger of being recognized by the two agents who took you .  we shall have to be especially careful to avoid them .         yes  i see .         what   s my identity this time .     steve asked .     i can   t be a slave  as i was in roman times .  but you still have to account for my not being russian .         judy  do you have a suggestion .     hunter asked .      you can be a turk from central asia     said judy .     or a tatar  of old mongol descent both were in the soviet union at that time .         i took the sleep course for russian  but not mongol or any kind of turkish     said steve .      in moscow  russian will be sufficient     said judy .     hunter  are we ready .         yes .  we shall go back to moscow the following day  well after sunup  to look for jane .         what if something happened to her during the night .     steve asked .      i want to avoid returning judy during that same night     said hunter .     if something has happened to jane  we shall return here and then go back earlier to find her if necessary .  for now  we shall return after people have begun their daily routine  so that we can get lost in the crowd .  now that i have returned to my original appearance  the nkvd will not recognize me .     he turned to judy .     perhaps we should wait while you get some sleep .  you will lose a night   s sleep with my plan .         i   m too upset to sleep now     said judy .     i want to go right back .         let   s go     said steve .     early the next morning  jane woke alone in the corner after a nervous  fitful sleep .  she got in line with her companions for breakfast and then returned to her corner to eat a thin  tasteless gruel .  after returning her bowl and spoon  she queued up for the rest room .   jane finally took her turn and moved into a stall .  she flushed the toilet to cover her voice somewhat from her neighbors on each side .  then she switched on her lapel pin .      hunter .  it   s jane .  where are you .      she waited for an answer as long as she dared .  she repeated the message twice more  flushing each time to create more noise .  other people came and went .  when she realized that hunter could not or would not respond  she gave up and left the rest room .  now she was really alone .   out in the main room again  she heard the rumbling of trucks outside .  everyone else gradually began moving toward the front door .  she wanted to stay here  where hunter could find her  but she did not dare risk attracting attention .  to avoid that  she would have to stay with everyone else .   no one else spoke very much .  everyone plodded patiently out to one specific truck and climbed into the back  where picks and shovels were stored in barrels .  for them  of course  this was an established routine .   jane boarded also and soon found herself standing shoulder to shoulder with the other women out in the cold  clear winter morning .  their truck  part of a convoy  jerked and moved away .  the convoy wound through the streets of moscow  stopping at other large buildings that had been converted to emergency housing .  when all the trucks were full  they snaked out along an unpaved highway to the west .   all the women in the work brigade were well bundled against the cold .  jane could not remember if judy had told her how long they had been doing this .  no snow lay on the ground right now  but jane could tell by the way the truck bounced and rumbled on the unpaved road that the mud was frozen solid .  at one point  she overheard a woman say that the temperature was about minus twenty centigrade .   finally jane saw the ditches appear in the distance .  as the convoy turned to run parallel to them  heading for the ends still under construction  jane looked down at them .  she estimated that the nearest ditches were about eight meters wide and three or four meters deep .   when the truck creaked to a halt  jane jumped to the ground with the others and accepted a shovel from someone .  no one told her what to do  so she followed the other women .  they walked down an earthen ramp into the middle of the ditch .   some women stood in the center of the ditch  digging the deepest groove .  they moved dirt to an intermediate ledge  where other women shoveled it up to the surface .  there  a few more women began arranging the dirt into a ridge on each side of the ditch to make the ditch seem even deeper .   relatively few men were in the brigade .  the ones jane could see were either too old for the military or else injured in some way .  the men took picks to the undisturbed  frozen ground at each end of the ditch and began to break it loose .   jane could see that the purpose of the brigade was to create a ditch big enough and steep enough that german tanks would go front   down into them so sharply that they could not roll forward to come up the other side .  jane picked out a spot a short distance from the other women and switched on her lapel pin .  that way  at least  she would hear hunter in the unlikely event that he called her  despite their agreement that he should not risk it .  right now  it was her best hope .  then she started to dig .  if nothing else  the activity helped her keep warm .     hunter chose to return at midday following the night he left .  as before  he took his team to a spot outside the city to avoid being noticed on their arrival .  they landed east of moscow  on the opposite side of the city from the front .  he hoped that would help them avoid army patrols from either side .      you going to call jane .     steve asked .     i   m worried about her .         i do not dare  at least until taking the risk becomes justified     said hunter .     i am not receiving any sound from her  which means she has either turned off her lapel pin or else she is out of range .  i calculate the chance of her being surrounded by other people to be extremely high .  jf her lapel pin is turned off or out of range  calling her will not matter .  if it is turned on and within range  i would risk attracting attention .         wait a minute     said steve .     she   s been through this long enough to know how it works .  if it   s turned on  that means she figures it   s safe to hear from you .         at this time i will not take the risk     said hunter .     we must walk back to the warehouse and see if she is there .     he pointed toward the city .      look that way     said judy  pointing north as they began to walk .   hunter saw a faint  dark line on the horizon  too vague to identify .     do you know what that is .         the sixteenth and twentieth soviet armies are encamped that direction     said judy .     they   ll be opening the counterattack soon  to drive the germans back from moscow .  i think we   re looking at the very southern end of their line .         can they help us in any way .     hunter asked .   judy shook her head emphatically .     no .  the military has political commissars all through it .         they are as unpredictable as the nkvd .         well .  .  . let   s just say that the potential exists all through the soviet system .  we should avoid all the authorities as much as possible .           wayne sat huddled with ishihara alone in a small two man tent .  the night before  the patrol had taken them to a leutnant johann mohr .  leutnant mohr had communicated with them in rather limited english .  then he had tried to contact his hauptmann  who put him off until this morning  ishihara explained that the hauptmann was the german equivalent of captain .  so wayne and    ishihara had been put into this tent for the night  under guard .   to keep his guests away from the soldiers  leutnant mohr had ordered one of his men to bring their breakfast to the tent  maintaining their isolation .  wayne was finishing his bowl of hot gruel .  ishihara had already put his aside .  for now  they were simply left to wait .  wayne felt certain that leutnant mohr was afraid to take responsibility for making any decision regarding them .      we   ll have to continue faking our way with some kind of background story     said wayne quietly .     will this be acceptable to you under the laws of robotics .         yes     said ishihara .     the first law requires that i keep you safe as i aid your mission .  to do so  we must convince our hosts that we belong .      finally the flap of the tent was drawn back and leutnant mohr leaned down to look inside .  he was a tall  slender young man with blondish brown hair .  his stained gray uniform was torn in several places but had been brushed free of surface dirt .     hauptmann eber will see you now     he said in heavily accented english .     come now .      wayne crawled out of the tent and wrapped his cloak tightly around him again .  as he and ishihara followed leutnant mohr  the soldiers who had been guarding them fell into step around them .  leutnant mohr had been courteous to wayne and ishihara  in case they were telling the truth  but he had taken no chances  either .   as they walked among the rows of tents  wayne could see that the german army around him was in poor shape .  supplies and equipment were stacked on farm and peasant carts pulled by little horses with fuzzy winter coats .  these vehicles  in fact  were smaller and more poorly maintained than the wagons in the roman baggage train back in a . d .    .   the soldiers around them had not shaved  mended their clothes or boots  or washed with soap .  many were obviously very ill  coughing and wheezing in the cold air .  a large number also had dirty bandages on wounds that had apparently not been sufficiently serious to warrant sending them to the rear .  suddenly wayne realized that leutnant mohr and his men had no winter coats or boots .  he turned to look around at the other soldiers in the camp  and saw no sign of winter clothing anywhere .   leutnant mohr brought them to an officer standing over a metal barrel  in which a small fire burned .  he was a burly man with a full face and several days    growth of brown beard .  his face was taut against the cold wind .   leutnant mohr saluted and spoke to his hauptmann in german  then turned to wayne and ishihara .     hauptmann uwe eber .      hauptmann eber spoke to wayne in german  staring at wayne grimly .  leutnant mohr translated into english .      you are swedish .  why are you speaking english .     hauptmann eber frowned .      ishihara and i have only english as a common language     said wayne .     and ishihara can speak german with leutnant mohr  but i can   t .  leutnant mohr and i also share english .      hauptmann eber nodded  listening to the translation .     why would a swede be here on the russian front .         i am swedish  but partial to your cause .  my friend and i are working with swedish intelligence .         are you .     hauptmann eber turned his icy gaze on ishihara .     leutnant mohr says you are japanese .  you are clearly not japanese .  what is this nonsense .         i am not japanese     said ishihara .     i lived in japan for many years and took the name of my host family out of respect for them .  this is why i have a japanese name and also why my german and my knowledge of europe are flawed .         what is your purpose here .         we have come to the front in order to locate a russian spy who may have infiltrated the german front     said ishihara  in a confident  businesslike tone .   for the first time  hauptmann eber   s face registered concern .  his eyes widened momentarily  then he studied ishihara   s face .  without looking away  he spoke sharply to leutnant mohr  who saluted  turned  and hurried off alone .   hauptmann eber did not speak .  he looked around the camp and patiently warmed his hands over the little fire .  the soldiers in leutnant mohr   s escort edged closer to the fire  eyeing the captain warily .      he has sent leutnant mohr to find his own superior     ishihara said quietly in english to wayne .     a major bach .      wayne nodded .     he   s just like mohr .  nobody wants to take any responsibility for us .  they keep going up the line of command .         this system works on fear     said ishihara .     the punishment for making mistakes is severe .  it helps to focus authority at the top  where this government wants power to gather .      in a few minutes  leutnant mohr came trotting back .  he stopped and saluted .  he and hauptmann eber exchanged a few quick words in german .  then leutnant mohr switched to english again .      major bach has suggested that we all meet in oberst schepke   s command tent .      ishihara nodded politely .     ja .         just as you were saying     said wayne  with a slight grin  as they turned and began to walk .     which rank are we going to see now .         oberst is the equivalent of colonel     said ishihara .   in the command tent  wayne stood patiently as all the german officers reported in german to their oberst .  major bach was a short  burly man with dark hair .  oberst schepke  a scowling  gaunt  hawk nosed man  stood formally behind a battered wooden table  listening and asking questions .  then he used leutnant mohr as an interpreter to speak to his visitors .      the oberst has ordered me to use english so that both of you can understand     said leutnant mohr  turning to face wayne and ishihara .     he requires your credentials .      wayne felt a surge of panic .  he could not think of anything to say .  worried  he glanced at ishihara .      you misunderstand     ishihara said  with a formality and stiffness that matched those of the oberst .     we are undercover  traveling across the national boundaries of many nations .  certainly we could not operate effectively against the russian spy we seek if we carried documents that would expose our true mission .         then present whatever travel documents you have .  you must have passports of some sort .         they were taken from us and not returned     said ishihara smoothly .      by whom .         by petty bureaucrats in switzerland .      wayne was impressed .  ishihara was demonstrating a deft ability to improvise .  wayne assumed he was drawing on his limited history of this time .      i must have some way to verify your identity     leutnant mohr said for oberst schepke .      field marshal mannstein will speak for us     said ishihara coolly .   wayne had never heard of him .      mannstein     repeated the oberst  showing some surprise as he recognized the name without translation .  then he spoke to leutnant mohr in german again .      contacting mannstein from here will take some time .  he is still on the finnish border  moving on leningrad     leutnant mohr translated .   wayne suppressed a smile .  that was probably why ishihara had picked that particular individual as a reference .  also  of course  finland was next to sweden  where wayne had supposedly originated .  that might help convince oberst schepke that mannstein was a legitimate reference .      we do not have time to waste     said ishihara  maintaining his calm  reserved delivery .     the spy we seek came this way .  he is probably among us now  observing conditions and positions on our front .  soon  however  he will head for the soviet lines to report what he has found .         how much do you know about him .  do you know his appearance and what name he is using .         we know exactly what he looks like .  we don   t know what he is calling himself .         you have a photograph .  give it to me .         our photograph has been lost on our travels .  we have journeyed far  and quickly  to get here .         then describe him .      ishihara described the short  slender component robot  who was physically identical to the other five who comprised mc governor in combination with him .   oberst schepke was silent  looking at ishihara and wayne thoughtfully .  then he spoke again  nodding at their clothing .  leutnant mohr continued to translate .      why are you dressed this way .         we have had to travel alone  with little money and no support  through much of europe .  in the wild mountains of carpathia  our normal traveling clothes were reduced to rags .  we accepted these clothes from slavic peasants in a remote mountain village  where civilization has barely reached .         yes .  i have seen such places .  we have no clothes to spare here  either .      ishihara nodded his acknowledgment .     oberst  may we get on with our task .  this spy must not be allowed to report your positions to the enemy .      oberst schepke studied ishihara for a long moment without speaking .  wayne could see that he was torn between the fear of a spy in his camp and the fact that his visitors had no proof to back up their story .  the oberst  too  had to fear the reprisals of his own superiors if he made a mistake   regarding either possibility .  then he spoke again  briefly .      leutnant mohr   that is  i   will escort you about the lines within the area under my command     leutnant mohr translated .     if your quest leads you into the command of another oberst  you must return to me for an introduction .         thank you  oberst     said ishihara .   oberst schepke nodded sharply and barked an order .  all the soldiers snapped to attention  angled their right arms up  palms forward  and spoke in unison     heil hitler .      the soldiers did an about face and marched out  but oberst schepke eyed wayne and ishihara suspiciously .   suddenly ishihara imitated the salute .  following his lead  so did wayne .     heil hitler .      ishihara followed the soldiers out and wayne stayed close to him .  outside the tent  wayne let out a long sigh and relaxed for the first time since they had walked in .  most of the soldiers dispersed  but leutnant mohr remained .      you were slow with the salute  my friends     said leutnant mohr  looking pointedly at both of them .      i fear  leutnant  that we are out of practice     said ishihara .     as intelligence officers in neutral countries  and sometimes behind enemy lines  we must be careful not to speak too quickly .      leutnant mohr shrugged uncomfortably .     where shall we begin .  do you have a particular place .         no     said ishihara .     let us start simply by walking through the lines  asking questions of the soldiers .  as we go  i shall describe our quarry to you .  perhaps he can be found among refugees or pows .         very well .      as they began to explore the lines  wayne surmised how oberst schepke had made his decision .  finding the spy was too important to ignore .  since only his visitors could identify him  they had to be given some chance to do so .   at the same time  he could not allow the strangers to wander around his camp unsupervised .  wayne also suspected that the oberst had decided not to assign a higher ranking officer for this  for fear he would be embarrassed later if their story was not true .  yet he could not trust an enlisted man with this task .  for that reason  as well as his ability to speak english  leutnant mohr had received the chore .        hunter knew that the walk back into moscow was a long one for his human companions .  even he was using more energy than the weak winter sun could restore on the microscopic solar power cells in his skin .  the activity helped keep the humans warm  but they needed a rest by the time they reached the edge of the city .   he did not see a place nearby where they could get warm .  they settled for a bench on a sidewalk .  a few other muscovites walked past them .      we should be able to find a bus line  i think     said judy .     i think some of them are still running .         excellent     said hunter .      hunter     said steve .     where are you going to look for mc    anyhow .         not too far from here     said hunter .     my calculation of where mc   will likely return to his full size is out in a certain neighborhood that i will show you .  he should return within a range of a couple of blocks .         after we find jane  then  are we just going to stake out the area .         that will be a good beginning  of course     said hunter .     however  he may have already returned  or he may simply slip past us as the other component robots have on earlier missions .  if we lose him that way  our search will be even more difficult than before .         why .     judy asked .      he has more places to hide     said hunter .     in the middle of this large city  he can find shelter and company fairly quickly and can get lost in the crowds .         he won   t have a job or a place to live     said steve .     and when he first shows up  he won   t even have any clothes .  that will make him stand out in a crowd .      judy laughed .      clothes can be found in a city     said hunter .     further  with so many displaced people  i believe that fewer questions are being routinely asked of strangers than usual .         that   s right     said judy .      yeah  i see     said steve .     in the dinosaur age  all we had to do was find mc     s footprints or broken twigs to pick up his trail .  and even in port royal  jamaica  and on the roman frontier  a single stranger was pretty obvious to everybody .  this is a much more sophisticated urban area  isn   t it .         yes     said judy emphatically .     and  remember  the government is very dangerous .  don   t underestimate them .         got it     said steve .     hunter  i   m starting to get cold  just sitting here .         judy  are you rested enough to continue .     hunter asked .      might as well get it over with .         we shall look at the area where i expect mc   to appear on our way back to the warehouse     said hunter  rising .      let   s look for a major thoroughfare     said judy .     the city has reduced bus service  but the biggest streets will have what   s left .      as they began to walk again  judy looked up and down the blocks and suggested directions .  soon they were in a queue at a bus stop behind seven muscovites .  when the bus to the center of the city arrived  it was a very old  creaking vehicle puffing black smoke out of its exhaust pipe .  as hunter led his team into the bus  he imitated the woman in front of him  paying the team   s way with coins .  the bus was only half full  so they found seats in the rear  away from other people .   hunter sat without speaking  looking out the windows .  when he saw that the bus had reached the area where he had estimated mc   would appear  he stood up and pulled the horizontal cord running across the wall of the bus over the windows .  a little bell rang by the driver  who pulled over at the next bus stop .   hunter gestured for judy and steve to leave the rear door first .  when they were safely on the sidewalk again  he followed them .  the bus creaked and rumbled away  blowing black smoke over them into the chilly air .      doesn   t look like much  does it .     judy looked up and down the street .      what kind of buildings are these .     hunter asked  surveying the architecture .      these are all residential apartment buildings .  most of them are empty in the daytime .         where is everybody .     steve asked .      oh  you missed my explanation before  didn   t you .     judy turned to him .     men who can serve in the military left a long time ago and lots of people have fled to avoid the advancing germans .  i think that   s where many of the children went  families got them out of town .  the remainder are working overtime to keep the city functioning or to prepare defenses .         that means mc   could appear here and duck into a fairly empty building  doesn   t it .     steve looked up at the rows of windows in the building above them .      yes     said hunter .     he can also find clothing  if he locates something he judges the owner can lose without harm .         we can   t knock on every door     said steve .     what do you want to do .         i do not have a plan yet     said hunter .     i fear that finding him here will be difficult .  we shall not be able to watch this area constantly without attracting the notice of the authorities .         that   s right     said judy .      i want to find jane     said steve .     then we can concentrate on mc   .      hunter magnified his hearing to the maximum  listening for footsteps suggesting the weight of mc    or his voice speaking english .  he turned slowly in different directions  but heard no signs of the component robot .  this failure meant very little  however  considering the density and size of the buildings .  mc   could be quite close  or could still be microscopic  or might have already left the area at full size .      i agree  steve     said hunter .     we shall remain here at this bus stop and find a bus going toward the warehouse to look for jane .         is the nkvd looking for you two .     steve asked .     you think they   ll go back to the warehouse .         it is possible     said hunter .     since i have changed my appearance back to normal  they will not recognize me .  however  they did see judy clearly .         we   d better sleep somewhere else tonight     said steve  looking up the street .     how much time is there between buses  anyway  judy .         i   m afraid i don   t know .  that   s too much detail for the history i studied .      hunter looked at her .     once we get there  judy will have to hide in the crowd in case the nkvd returns .  we shall leave as soon as we have jane with us again .  please be very careful and very aware of people noticing you .         count on it     said judy  smiling wryly .     i   ve seen enough of them already .  i   ll be careful .        by the time the sun was low on the flat western horizon  jane was already exhausted .  for the last couple of hours  she had shoveled slowly  with very little dirt on the blade of her shovel .  as long as she continued moving  however  no one else in the work brigade seemed to care .   she had not been able to get enough privacy to call hunter .  except in the outhouse  which had no water to flush  she had not been alone all day .  she had not dared use her lapel pin for fear of being overheard by the people waiting in line outside .   during the course of the day  the ditch had grown .  since judy had told the team that the battle of moscow would involve the soviet armies counterattacking the germans  jane knew that the ditch she was digging was probably not important .  she knew she was not altering history by participating .   finally she heard the rumble of trucks .  everyone looked up to see the welcome sight .  she fell into line with the others  climbing out of the ditch and queuing for the ride back to the warehouse .   in the back of the truck as it jerked and drove away  jane leaned against the side and slid down to a sitting position .  she had not been this tired in a long time .  as a roboticist  she was simply not used to an entire day of the kind of physical labor that robots would do in her time .  the cold had taken a toll on her  as well  the daytime temperature here had been much colder than even the mountains of central germany on their previous mission .   even when the truck finally stopped  she did not stand right away .  she waited while the back was opened and the rest of the work brigade began to climb out .  finally she stood up  stiff with the cold  and followed them out of the truck .   jane joined the crowd moving toward the door of the warehouse .  then she glanced up and saw hunter just inside the door  towering over the others .  a wave of relief swept over her  but she knew better than to call out .  to those around her  she had to look as resigned as they were about this difficult routine .  as before  two burly men stood by the door  watching as everyone entered .  when she finally got inside  she could see judy and steve for the first time .      good evening     steve said in russian  grinning .     you okay .         worn out     said jane .     how did you get here .  hunter  where have you been all this time .         we can confer in a moment     said hunter .     now we must leave the warehouse .         all right .     jane accepted his judgment .     i   m ready .      hunter  moving against the current of people still plodding into the warehouse  slipped around the edge of the doorway .  steve waited for jane and judy to file after him  so jane pushed her way after hunter .      where are you going  comrade .     one of the guards put his hand against hunter   s chest .      we must find some friends     said hunter .     please excuse us .     he started to moved around the man  but the guard shifted with him  still blocking the way .      it is dark  comrade  and cold .  come inside for the night .     he gestured back toward the doorway .      this is very important     said hunter .      then you must explain it to me .      hunter hesitated  then glanced over his shoulder at his team .  then he moved back inside .  hunter led the team back to the familiar corner in the rear of the warehouse .  jane and steve exchanged puzzled glances but did not argue .      what   s wrong  hunter .     jane spoke quietly  seeing that no strangers were close to them .     we have to get out of here .         the nkvd knows what judy looks like now and may return here for her     said hunter .     we cannot risk remaining here .         exactly     said steve .     we could have rushed out of here .  you could have pushed past that guy .         i do not want to force our way out past the guards  either     said hunter .     that would be disruptive and would attract even more attention to us .         you aren   t just going to sit here and wait for the nkvd     said steve .     so what are we going to do .         for now  please prepare to sleep     said hunter .     i shall consider the options that we shall have after the lights are out .        wayne let ishihara do most of the work in their day   s search .  he knew that ishihara could turn up the sensitivity of his sight and hearing to find mc   and nothing wayne could do was the equal of that .  so he spent most of his time just holding his cloak as tight as he could .   leutnant mohr rarely spoke as he dutifully led his guests through the tents and up and down the lines .  wayne became sure that the nazi command had ordered leutnant mohr to be very careful with them .  if they proved legitimate  then oberst schepke wanted to be able to prove later that he had cooperated with them fully .  at the same time  he wanted to distance himself from the strangers in case they were phony .  as a result  leutnant mohr did not spend much time talking to soldiers or letting them see inside tents .  he gave them a perfunctory tour of the grounds that did not accomplish very much .   at one point late in the day  ishihara stopped and looked east .  wayne saw only open  frozen ground .  he waited to see what ishihara would do .      lieutenant     said ishihara  in english .      yes .         how far is the actual front line .         this encampment is roughly a half kilometer from the front     said leutnant mohr  squinting into the distance himself .     we are in panzer group    a mere twenty kilometers or so from moscow itself .         straight east of here .     ishihara asked .      so we are told .         how long since anybody moved .     wayne asked .      excuse me .     leutnant mohr stiffened .      how long have you held this position  without advancing .     wayne turned to look at him pointedly .      we are searching for a spy  not discussing military matters .     leutnant mohr fidgeted uncomfortably .      lieutenant .     wayne used his most authoritative tone of voice and tried to think like one of the german military men .     i want to know if that spy is gaining information of value   how fresh it is  or how old .  it bears directly on our purpose .  now answer my question .         well   the front moved slowly during the fall .  the camp doesn   t move as often  of course .  we advance the camp after the front is secure .      wayne looked around again .  he could see the german tanks lined up in rows  sitting cold  with looked to him as if it was freezing in place .      have you received any orders about advancing .     ishihara asked .      we have been told we will spend the winter in moscow     leutnant mohr said cautiously .  his young face looked unsure as he glanced toward the empty horizon again .   wayne caught ishihara   s glance and understood the point behind his question .  they had come here because wayne had expected mc   to attempt stopping the german advance .  wayne considered it a likely imperative under the first law .  however  if the german offensive had already stalled  then mc   had no need to influence them .   mc   might not be here at all .          late in the afternoon  wayne decided to let leutnant mohr off the hook for a while and requested that he and ishihara take a rest .  leutnant mohr left them in his own tent  with a firm suggestion that they remain there while he tended to his other duties .  wayne saw that he posted a couple of guards outside the tent as he left .   wayne moved close to ishihara and spoke quietly .      we aren   t accomplishing much here .         i agree     said ishihara .      do you have any ideas .         i have some information .         you do .         yes .  i have been monitoring the german radio communications continuously .         what did you find out .         from the communications among middle rank and senior officers coordinating their daily routines  i have learned that panzer group   is in fact blocked on its way to moscow by the soviet red army .         didn   t we already assume that .  or is it a military secret or something .         it is not a secret     said ishihara .     the german officers have referred to it repeatedly .  however  until now  i surmised that perhaps the german army had stopped from exhaustion .      wayne shrugged .     did you learn anything else .         yes .  i overheard a couple of officers in effect saying that general alfried jodi has forbidden the collection and disbursement of winter clothing to german soldiers .     ishihara looked at wayne carefully .     this information puzzles me .  it also disturbs me under the first law .         that sounds weird to me  too .  why would he do that .  do you know .         according to the officers whom i overheard  this general fears that providing winter clothing to their soldiers would cast doubt on his guarantee that they will take moscow before the onset of winter and spend the season safely in the city .         you mean he   s leaving them in the cold so they   ll be more confident of taking moscow soon .         that seems to be their belief  yes .         that   s why they   re all freezing .  not because the german command can   t get the winter clothes  because they refuse to .         yes .  that is a critical reason that the german soldiers are suffering so much from the weather .      wayne nodded slowly .     did you overhear anything else important .         no .     ishihara lowered his voice even more .     i cannot stop thinking about the harm being done to all these men .  they should all simply go home .  then no more war would take place on this front .         even if they did  the russians would chase them  wouldn   t they .  and keep fighting .         yes  that is what happened .  as i access what limited history i have  i see also that the nazi government is very cruel and oppressive  and that this mind set has influenced many soldiers .  the leadership is very destructive and survives on terror .         not every soldier can be like that     said wayne .     most of them must be ordinary people .         these individuals are emotionally broken past the point of taking their own initiative .  the higher ranks keep their lives and positions by cooperating   following orders  no matter what they are .  so do their subordinates .         what are we going to do .         i do not have precise details about this particular site in the war     said ishihara .     however  from the condition of the german army  i believe that the military initiative lies with the soviet army .         then you think we should go to the other side to look for mc   .         quite possibly .  if he reaches the same conclusion  then he might try to stop the battle by interfering with the soviet side in some way .         okay     said wayne thoughtfully .     but how do we get across the front to the other side   without both sides shooting at us .         i propose that we continue our charade     said ishihara .     as agents in pursuit of an enemy spy .         how so .         we could offer to infiltrate the enemy .  if we suggest  for instance  that mc   has already returned to the enemy to brief them on the information he has gathered  then it would be natural for us to follow him .         i see .  maybe the germans would help us get across  at least part of the way .         we must be careful in presenting this idea to our hosts     said ishihara .      yeah  you   re right about that     said wayne .     these nazis are still suspicious of us .         we cannot allow them to doubt us any more than they do already .         how do you want to handle this .         i suggest we drop hints     said ishihara .     our best opportunity may lie in inducing our hosts to make this suggestion .         all right     said wayne .     let   s get our story straight before mohr comes back .         we are too late     said ishihara .     i hear his footsteps coming now .      before wayne could reply  he heard the footsteps too .  leutnant mohr threw back the flap of the tent .  cold wind blew inside as he stooped to enter .      it never gets any warmer     said leutnant mohr .      that   s true     said wayne .     but we   ve been talking about our mission .      leutnant mohr sat down  wrapping his arms around himself .     it is good to get out of the wind .      wayne nodded .  he felt that leutnant mohr seemed uncomfortable with the informality .  for a moment  no one spoke .      our spy may already have left the area     said ishihara  in a calm  unconcerned tone .      yes .     leutnant mohr fumbled ostentatiously at his shirt pockets for a moment  then sighed .     do either of you have a cigarette  by any chance .         a what .     wayne asked .      we do not     said ishihara quickly .     i apologize .  we have often been deprived during our travels .      leutnant mohr nodded .      cigarettes are very harmful     ishihara added .      so   s the red army .     leutnant mohr grinned crookedly .      we do not know how far ahead of us the enemy spy may be     said ishihara .      we think we   re pretty close behind him     wayne added  hoping to help ishihara .   leutnant mohr nodded noncommittally .     your fur cloaks look primitive  but i suppose they are warm .         yes  that is true     said ishihara .     your uniform is not really heavy enough for this russian climate  is it .  you must be very cold .         it is nothing .     leutnant mohr stiffened suddenly  shrugging .     we shall be in moscow soon .         not if our quarry has reached it already     said wayne  in what he hoped was as casual a tone as ishihara was using .     that   s what we   ve been talking about .         yes .     leutnant mohr glanced at him  more interested .      he may have already learned enough about german positions to brief his masters .         so soon .         this is possible     said ishihara .     with the german army stationary now  the soviet army would gain information that will remain reliable until we move again .         you mean you   re too late .     leutnant mohr   s eyes were wide .     the russians already know our positions .         not necessarily     said wayne .     we may be very close behind him .         we believe we can stop him     said ishihara .      what do you think .     wayne looked directly into the leutnant   s blue eyes .      you must catch him at all costs .      wayne decided that mohr was not going to take the bait directly .     we may need to chase him across the front into the city .  can you help .      leutnant mohr   s back straightened .  his voice became formal and cautious .     i must return you to hauptmann eber for that sort of question .         can we cut short the process a little this time .     wayne asked .     instead of going to hauptmann eber and then the major and then oberst schepke   can we just go talk to the oberst right away .      leutnant mohr shook his head tightly .     no .  it is not done .  i must report to my immediate superior .         all right .     wayne sighed .     we certainly don   t want to get you into trouble .  take us to your hauptmann  please .      leutnant mohr nodded and led them out of the tent .   in the early evening wind  wayne wrapped his cloak more tightly around him .  the pale sun went down as he and ishihara followed the leutnant through the camp .  as before  hauptmann eber took them to major bach  who was squatting outside his tent  warming himself over a small fire in the gathering gloom .   hauptmann eber spoke briefly to the major in german .  instead of insisting immediately that they confer with oberst schepke  however  major bach listened to their argument in full .  he did not bother to stand .  as before  leutnant mohr acted as interpreter .      i don   t know  hauptmann     said major bach slowly .  the firelight played off his face  making him look mysterious in the shadows .     what do you think .  if this spy has already left  then it   s too late to catch him .  he will be debriefed as soon as he arrives  will he not .         most likely  sir .         he is on foot     said ishihara .      oh .  and how do you know .     major bach asked  turning to slightly to face him .      as far as we know  that is the case     said ishihara politely .     since he must avoid notice from our sentries  he has to be very careful in leaving the camp and maneuvering around german military lines .         what of it .     major bach spoke in a tone of complete indifference .      he must also worry about approaching soviet lines  to avoid being shot coming across the front .         he will have some sort of contact or credentials  or some identifying information .     hauptmann eber  apparently sensing the major   s skeptical tone  folded his arms and glared at ishihara .     more than you have  i might add .         if he is shot before he arrives  that will not matter     said ishihara .     he must find a way to make contact with someone on the other side before they open fire .  all of this means that he must move slowly   not to mention that he has roughly twenty kilometers of open ground between the two armies to cross somehow .         you think he is going to walk twenty kilometers to moscow .         the german infantry has walked much farther than that already .      major bach nodded .     i presume you wish help in pursuing him  not just permission to leave us .         we feel it is worth the risk     said ishihara .     if he left this camp today  for instance  then we may still be able to catch him before he locates his superiors  whether or not he reaches moscow ahead of us .  even a small amount of help would make a difference .      major bach gazed quietly into the fire without speaking .  following his lead  hauptmann eber did the same .  leutnant mohr watched them both  his eyes shifting between them nervously .   wayne waited  expecting that the major would finally abdicate responsibility after all  and take them back to oberst schepke .   finally major bach spoke briefly over his shoulder to an aide  who hurried into a tent .  then he spoke to wayne and ishihara again .     i will write you a pass to leave the camp .  it can be countermanded by someone of higher rank  of course  but i trust you will not trouble anyone of that sort .     he eyed them both pointedly .      of course     said wayne .      thank you  major     said ishihara .      you will be on your own  however .  i cannot spare men or supplies to help you .      wayne said nothing .  crossing the front to moscow was going to be difficult without a vehicle .  he had hoped the major would offer them some help .  since ishihara was not debating the point  wayne decided to keep quiet  too .   the aide brought a pen and a slip of paper to the major .  wayne realized that major bach was making a decision similar to the one oberst schepke had made about them earlier .  the major wanted to appear cooperative  in case they were legitimate  but he did not want to give them any real help  in case they were not .   further  major bach did not want to trouble his own superior about them again .  after all  oberst schepke had accepted their story  however cautiously .  now major bach had apparently decided that getting rid of them in this way fell within the scope of his own authority .  once wayne and ishihara were gone  these officers could forget about them and focus on military matters again .  maybe most important of all in this suffering army  they would not have to feed and shelter these two noncombatants .   major bach handed the pass to his aide  who in turn gave it to ishihara .      thank you  major     said ishihara .     surely you won   t mind if leutnant mohr drives us to the edge of camp .      major bach stood up for the first time  his face suddenly impatient .      we will remember your cooperation     wayne said quickly but calmly .   the major hesitated  studying his face again .  then his shoulders sagged .     of course .  leutnant mohr .     he gestured wearily and then squatted close to the fire again .         jane huddled in the corner of the warehouse .  gradually  other people around them stretched out to sleep for the night .  soon the overhead lights were turned out  leaving only one lamp burning at a table in the front and a single bare bulb over the rest room door .  the two guards talked with a couple of women at the front table .  the rear of the warehouse was almost completely dark .      we must leave before the nkvd agents return here seeking judy or someone who could tell them where to find her     said hunter quietly .     the rear door is in almost complete darkness .         it   s quiet in here     said steve .     as soon as we get up and start moving  those guys in the front will hear us .  especially if the door creaks .         yes     said hunter .     i have been looking for a diversion we can create .         do you see something  hunter .     jane asked  looking around the shadowed warehouse herself .      i believe so     said hunter .     the electrical wiring here is primitive  with the insulated cords along the base of the wall fully exposed .  a small door in the wall by the rest room almost certainly houses fuses and circuit breakers .         what do you have in mind .     judy asked .      the circuit breakers can be triggered without any long term harm to the system or to the safety of the humans here     said hunter .     if one of us moves the switches  then the light in front will go out .         sounds good to me     said steve .     that should create just enough surprise and confusion for us to slip out the back door .  is that what you want to do .         yes  but we must plan this carefully  since that light bulb will illuminate anyone near the circuit breaker .  one of us can go use the rest room without causing undue concern .  however  i prefer that i not be the one .  i should be near the door in case it must be forced open .         i   ll go     said judy  glancing around the warehouse .     steve might attract attention  since he doesn   t resemble the slavic russians .         i   ll go with you     said jane .     if we have to improvise  two will be better than one .         okay .         you cannot take your overcoats without being noticed     said hunter .     i shall carry them and give them to you when we are safely outside .         i   ll take the duffel bag     said steve .      all right     said judy .  she got up and began to pick her way directly across the warehouse to the rest room .   jane stood up and slowly followed judy .  her heart was pounding with tension  but she moved slowly and casually .  they worked their way among the sleeping russians  careful not to disturb any of them .   when they reached the rest room  judy turned the knob .  jane saw it move in her hand  but judy pretended it was locked  shrugging theatrically .  they stood patiently  pretending to line up .   trying to act bored  jane glanced toward the front table .  one of the women there  perhaps distracted by the movement of jane and judy  looked up .  then the woman yawned and returned her attention to her companions .  no one else had taken any notice of them .   judy took jane   s arm and pulled her a couple of steps to one side  so that she blocked the front table   s view of the circuit breaker .  jane could not see the rear door in the darkness at the back of the warehouse .  hunter and steve were also invisible  but she supposed they were moving toward the door by now .   the only path from here to the door ran along the wall .  they would have to walk in the dark down this side wall  turn at the back corner  and then cross part of the rear wall to reach the door .  the floor was clear all the way  since everyone had tried to keep away from the cold exterior walls when choosing places to sleep .   jane heard a quiet metallic clink as judy opened the door to the circuit breakers .  then she heard snapping noises and the warehouse darkened .  exclamations of surprise came from the front .  then a chair scraped on the floor as someone got up to find the problem .      around the wall     jane whispered frantically .     come on  quick .      jane hated walking blindly  but trailing one hand on the side wall in the darkness kept her oriented .  she held her other arm out in front of her so that she wouldn   t bump into the rear wall .  judy shuffled behind her .   just as jane   s hand touched the rear wall  she heard the door creak .  only a slip of pale moonlight revealed the doorway .  she walked faster now that she could see it  and recognized the silhouettes of hunter and steve as they moved soundlessly outside .      close that door .     one of the men who had been sitting at the front table shouted from about halfway across the room behind them  as he neared the circuit breaker .   more people murmured in the warehouse  disturbed by the shout .  jane ran for the doorway and ducked out  hunter was bracing it open with one foot while he held steve   s overcoat out for him to take .  judy followed right behind jane .      follow me     hunter whispered firmly .  he turned and took off at a jog .   jane saw the other overcoats bundled under his arm .  she and judy would have to wait to put them on .  jane ran after hunter  instantly cold in the frigid night air .  they ran through a narrow alley in the dark  silent city .  alongside them  light suddenly came on around the edges of the blackened windows .      who   s out there .     one of the guards yelled from the rear door .     the city is under curfew .  where are you going .  come back here .      hunter turned at the corner of another alley .  he waited for jane and judy to catch up  steve brought up the rear .  hunter shook out two overcoats and threw them over the shoulders of the women .  then  instead of moving toward the street  hunter led them up the other alley .   jane  holding the coat awkwardly over her shoulders as she ran  wondered if anyone was chasing them .  she didn   t hear anything .  the team turned another corner .  then hunter stopped  merely a looming shadow in front of jane  as everyone gathered around him .      i hear no pursuit     hunter said quietly  as he put on his own overcoat .     we must not linger for long  but you may pause to catch your breath .  judy  do you think someone will chase us farther .         i have no idea     said judy  shucking her overcoat and throwing her arms into the sleeves .  she shrugged it back onto her shoulders .     we   d better assume they will .  i don   t know how important they consider this curfew  or how much authority those guys have .  one thing this society stifles very hard is personal initiative .         you mean if they weren   t told to report or chase people who break the curfew  they won   t do anything .     steve asked  between rasping breaths .  he had the duffel bag slung over one shoulder .      it   s unlikely     said judy .     but they might have been given such orders .      jane had her own coat on properly now and fumbled the scarf out of her coat pocket with stiff fingers .      come on     said hunter .  as before  he jogged up another shadowed alley .   still holding her scarf  jane ran after him .  as before  they still turned corners frequently  always keeping to back alleys .  finally  hunter led them out of an alley onto a deserted side street .  in the open space  the weak moonlight illuminated their surroundings a little better than before .  hunter stopped and waited for his team to catch their breath again .      hunter .     jane asked  tying on her scarf .     where are we going .         i do not know exactly .  however  we can certainly find other buildings of the same kind housing other people displaced by the war .         how do we find one .     steve asked .      i am not sure     said hunter .     judy  can you suggest a way to do this .         uh   i   m not sure .  i have to think about it .         all right     said hunter .     in any case  judy  you will be safe as long as the nkvd agents don   t see you .  now that we are away from the warehouse where they first found you  our chances of avoiding them are much improved .         true     said judy .     but i think we   d better keep moving   to stay warm if nothing else .         use your hearing as we walk     jane said to hunter .     on maximum .         for what .     hunter asked  leading them down the dark sidewalk .     what am i listening for .         the sound of a lot of people sleeping in one big room     said jane .      that won   t be very loud     said steve .     even to you .         i am turning up my aural sensitivity     said hunter .     if we come within my hearing range of such sounds  i shall recognize them .         good luck     steve muttered doubtfully .     wayne and ishihara followed leutnant mohr away from major bach   s fire .  ishihara had managed to get the major   s permission for the leutnant to drive them out of the german camp and beyond german lines  but that would still leave many kilometers of open  frozen ground to cross .  on the other side  of course  they could expect to find thousands of soviet soldiers  expecting only the enemy to come across that stretch of territory .   leutnant mohr said nothing as he led them to his patrol   s armored car .  all three of them crowded into the cab .  it started with a loud roar and jerked forward .      how far is it to go past the most forward of the german lines from here .     ishihara asked casually .   leutnant mohr shrugged .     i am not certain .  not far .  it will take maybe fifteen minutes  since we must go around so many emplacements .         thank you for your courtesy  leutnant .     ishihara unfastened his fur cloak and shifted in his seat so that he could pull it off .      you   re welcome .         this cloak is quite warm .  with the tunic and our leggings  it is not really necessary for me .      leutnant mohr glanced at him in surprise .   wayne stifled a smile .  he was pretty sure he knew where ishihara was leading .  just in case he was wrong  however  he decided to say nothing until he was sure .      i might be induced to trade this cloak     said ishihara  holding a portion of the cloak in front of him where leutnant mohr could see it .      you would trade this cloak .     leutnant mohr asked carefully  struggling to hold the wheel as the vehicle bounced across the frozen ground .      i would consider it .         i don   t have much to trade     said leutnant mohr .     what would you want for it .         a favor .         yes .  what is this favor .         it will take great courage  leutnant .      leutnant mohr   s face tightened .     are you suggesting that i lack courage .         you tell me     said ishihara .      what do you want .         i want you to drive us across the neutral zone     said ishihara .      you mean the no man   s land .         yes .         toward the red army .  you   re insane .  we will be blasted into nothing in this armored car .         maybe not     said wayne  feeling that he could participate now .     one car alone will not be mistaken for a major military advance that would get a lot of attention .         you   re both insane .         as i said  it will take great courage     said ishihara  in an offhand tone .   leutnant mohr said nothing .      you don   t have to shake hands with the russians     said wayne .     just get us as far across the open area to the other side as you can .         we would have to anticipate enemy patrols     said leutnant mohr slowly .      most of that terrain is empty     said wayne .     if we see any sign of the enemy  you can let us get out and then you can run for it .         that   s a long way .  i could get into trouble with my superior .      wayne heard some indecision in the leutnant   s voice for the first time .  he took the cloak from ishihara and reached over to put it on leutnant mohr   s lap .  it was all wayne could think of to help convince him .      this is only december     said ishihara .     most of the russian winter still lies ahead .         we shall take moscow shortly     said leutnant .  mohr  just as he had said once before .      then you will not need the cloak     said ishihara .     please return it .         um   wait .         yes .     ishihara hesitated .      i will do it for both cloaks     said leutnant mohr  with sudden firmness .      what .     wayne was startled .      i will drive as close to the red army as i can get     said leutnant mohr .     in exchange  you will give me your cloak  as well .  this is my offer .      wayne grinned .     there   s nothing wrong with his courage  ishihara .  he   s just been bargaining with us .         what is your answer .     leutnant mohr asked .      sorry     said wayne .     ishihara may be warm enough without his cloak  but i won   t be .  i have to keep mine .         as you said  it will be a very long walk .         no deal     said wayne .     i keep my cloak no matter what .  i   ll freeze without it .         one cloak in exchange for the ride     said ishihara .     take it or leave it .         i accept     said leutnant mohr .         wayne relaxed  deeply relieved that leutnant mohr had given in to their terms .  of course  leutnant mohr was as cold as every other soldier in the german army  and the fuel he was using belonged to the army  not to him personally .  as he drove  he pulled the heavy fur cloak from germany  almost two thousand years earlier  over his lap .   leutnant mohr was not taking as much of a risk as he believed .  wayne knew that ishihara would be monitoring the soviet radio traffic .  he would know if any soviet patrol reported by radio that they were coming this way long before they were in sight .   no one challenged them as they drove close to the most forward german lines .  wayne decided that the entire army was just as cold and discouraged as the soldiers he had seen himself .  none of them wanted to take any initiative .  as long as the armored car did nothing particularly offensive  he guessed they would not be stopped .   leutnant mohr did not immediately drive straight through the lines out into the open front .      will the soldiers here let us go through their lines .     ishihara asked .      we must not be seen heading straight for the enemy     leutnant mohr said .   wayne saw that they were gradually moving to the left  going north behind the lines .      what is your plan .     ishihara asked .      yeah   can you really get us past them .     wayne looked out the window at the darkness  broken only by their headlights and a few small  weak fires along the lines .      yes     said leutnant mohr .     the north flank is not far .  going out past the flank will mean that we will pass only a few sentries .  they may not bother to stop us .      when the armored car finally reached the north flank  wayne was surprised to see that it was not really anchored in any way .  he knew that armies usually wanted some feature in the terrain to protect their flanks  such as a mountain  a river  or even a slight rise in the ground .  here  the german lines simply came to a halt on the level steppe .  it was another sign that weariness  cold  and exhaustion had undermined the efficiency of this army .   suddenly the headlights struck a couple of soldiers waving their arms .  leutnant mohr sighed and halted their vehicle in front of them .  then he rolled down the window and waited for them to approach him .   one sentry came up to the armored car .  he looked at all three of them carefully and then spoke .  wayne could not understand his german  of course  but he could judge the man   s tone .  the sentry spoke respectfully  aware that he was addressing an officer .  leutnant mohr answered quietly and confidently as he handed his pass to him .   the sentry moved so that he could read the pass in the glow of the headlights .  he showed it to his partner  who nodded and stepped back .  the first sentry returned it to leutnant mohr and pointed off into the blackness ahead  saying something else .  then he  too  backed away .   leutnant mohr put the vehicle into gear and drove forward  beyond the flank .      what did they say .     wayne asked .      they assumed i was lost     said leutnant mohr .     i explained that we were on a special reconnaissance mission and showed them the pass .         what will you say on the way back .     wayne asked .     when you   re alone .         i will circle around this spot and return to the lines farther to the rear .  major bach   s pass will serve with other sentries  who did not see me in your company .         they must have seen we aren   t in uniform     said wayne .     did they ask about it .         yes .  i told them i was not allowed to reveal your identities .         hey  not bad .     wayne grinned .     you   re a sharp guy  leutnant .      instead of answering  leutnant mohr simply pushed the accelerator  taking them faster over the hard ground .  they were now moving out into pure darkness slashed only by their own headlights .  after a while  he turned to the right .   for the first time  now  they were driving east  toward moscow and the soviet lines protecting it .  wayne looked back over his shoulder .  the last fires from the german lines were out of sight .  that was how leutnant mohr had decided the time had come to start across the open area between the lines .   no one spoke for a long time .  wayne could not see the speedometer  if the vehicle had one .  in the darkness  he had no way to judge their speed by the passing terrain  either .  he did not feel that they were moving very fast  but did not want to raise the subject .  at this point  he was just glad they had a ride across the cold  barren countryside .   wayne glanced up and suddenly realized that he could see powerful beams of light stretching high into the sky in the distance ahead .  they started from somewhere on the ground  over the horizon  and swept upward into the sky .  he suspected that he should already know what the lights were  so he did not dare ask .  maybe they were looking for enemy aircraft over moscow .  they had probably been visible for some time before he had noticed them .      i believe we are halfway to enemy lines     leutnant mohr said quietly .  he did not slow down or turn  but his voice sounded oddly tight     we have made excellent progress     said ishihara .  his tone was calm .   wayne picked up the meaning of his delivery .  ishihara was monitoring the soviet radio traffic and knew that the red army had not noticed them .  leutnant mohr was getting nervous  though  knowing that they were drawing closer to the enemy than to the safety of his own lines .   they rode in silence for a while longer .  finally  however  leutnant mohr came to a stop .  wayne saw nothing in the darkness around them .      what is wrong .     ishihara asked .      we are within five to seven kilometers of enemy lines     said leutnant mohr .  in the reflected light from the headlights  his face was pale and tense .      that is still a long walk for us     said ishihara .     we have had no sign of the enemy .         this is as far as i dare go     said leutnant mohr .     we are certain to attract soviet patrols in the next few miles .  and if they open up with artillery  i will not be able to go back to my own lines quietly  either .  i could be blamed for starting an unplanned action .         but five to seven kilometers     wayne started .     in this cold  we could           very well     ishihara interrupted  speaking more loudly than usual to drown out wayne .     your arguments are sound  leutnant .  we thank you for your cooperation .         i wish you good luck     said leutnant mohr .   wayne and ishihara got out into the cold night air .  the armored car jerked and rumbled away in a large turn .  in a moment  it was bouncing over the frozen ground back to the west .  wayne and ishihara were alone .      why didn   t you argue a little harder .     wayne asked  pulling his cloak snugly around him .     from the r .  hunter files    the now famous prototype of the highly successful    hunter    class robot first demonstrated his remarkable abilities in the mojave center governor case .  the following images are drawn from the robot city archives of derec avery  the eminent historian on robotics .       hunter in moscow .  r .  hunter   s ability to shift his shape to match local conditions proved invaluable on many of his missions .  here hunter has adopted the disguise of a russian citizen during world war ii .       mojave center .  in an ambitious attempt to reclaim unusable land and take advantage of readily available solar and wind power  a number of underground cities were built .  the state of the art facility under the mojave desert  known for its university and famous sculpture gardens  was perhaps the most successful .       wayne and ishihara pursued by the secret police . even in wartime the nkvd  stalin   s secret police  were everywhere  willing to kill anyone even suspected of being a danger to the soviet union .       medical robot .  this is a view of the head of a general purpose medical robot in r .  hunter   s time .  robots of this class staffed all of mojave center   s medical facilities  and performed most medical functions short of major surgery .       medical robot closeup . the diagnostic equipment located on the medical robot   s face can identify symptoms of any known human disease .  among other functions  the medical robots diagnostic scanners can scan individual cells for abnormalities .       the refugee warehouse . civilian refugees are crowded into massive empty warehouses after fleeing from the german army .  these refugees are in danger from the soviet secret police as well as the german army .       r .  hunter facial structure . shown here is an analysis of r .  hunter   s neural net flow after he has shifted his form to match local environmental conditions .       mc robots merged . three of mc governor   s six independent component robots are shown here .  after capturing

of trenches in front of the advancing german army .  although the final attack on moscow never came  the terrified civilians expected it every day .       hunter disguised . here is another of r .  hunter   s many disguises .  as long as his mass remained constant  r .  hunter could shift is face and surface skin structure in nearly limitless ways .          we cannot risk having leutnant mohr start a battle prematurely .  it could change world history in a manner very destructive to our own time .      wayne sighed .     freezing to death will be destructive to me  personally .         i cannot allow harm to come to you  either .  you are already aware of that .         for that matter  what about you .     wayne looked at him .     your energy storage has a limit  too .  how long can you manage out here without your cloak .         i can pursue normal activity without a problem until dawn  at which time even the weak winter sun will begin to recharge the solar collectors built into my skin surface .  unusually extreme activity tonight could drain me prematurely  but i do not foresee that happening .         so  we just start walking .  i   m not sure i can make it that distance .         i am certain you cannot     said ishihara .     i have another plan to propose .         good .         i warn you that considerable risk is involved in this suggestion  too .  however  i feel it is less risky to your welfare than simply trying to walk from here would be .         all right  all right .  get to the point  will you .  i   m freezing while we stand here .         i can radio ahead to the soviets on my internal system and ask for help .         uh   what would you say .         we will have to discuss that and come to agreement on our story  just as we did with the germans .  in this case  we should have plenty of time  since the soviets so far remain unaware of us .         well  we managed with the germans .  i guess we could come up with a better story this time .         if someone comes to get us  they may wonder where our radio is .  obviously  i cannot reveal that i am a robot with an internal system .         what do you want to tell them .         since we will have no radio of this era to show them  we must be careful to explain that our radio quit working and was abandoned before they arrived .  i recommend that we claim the germans had us under fire at the time .         got it .  but isn   t that a little premature .  first we   d better hope someone shows up at all .  then we can hope they don   t demand to see the radio .         with your agreement  i shall radio for help in russian to the red army .         go ahead     wayne said wryly .     otherwise  this cold may kill me first .      they stood in silence for a moment  as ishihara broadcast a message .      you get anybody .     wayne asked .   not yet .         what did you say .         i was deliberately vague .  i said that we were bringing intelligence about the germans back to the soviet lines but were stranded .         did you send it more than once .         yes  of course .  and i shall continue to transmit it at intervals .         good .         but i must question a statement you made a moment ago about dying of the cold .  before i can allow that to happen  i would have to insist that we leave this time and place .         changing to another time has to remain our last resort     said wayne .     that   s a second law imperative .         we discussed this matter in ancient germany     said ishihara .     i understand your concern that hunter will have assigned another robot to apprehend us back in our own time .  but of course we do not have to return there .  we can jump only a few hours and a few miles if you wish .         i know     said wayne .     but if we jump from here to moscow  for instance  we don   t know where we   ll appear   maybe right in front of people .  and if we move forward at too long an interval  i   m afraid hunter will already have grabbed mc   before we   ve had a chance .         i understand     said ishihara .  he hesitated  suddenly moving to face east .   wayne waited eagerly  sure that he had received something from the soviets .      they are coming     said ishihara .   how far away are they .         i do not know yet .  a red army unit finally responded to my message on the fourteenth repetition .  i said we are civilians escaping from the germans with military intelligence we wanted to share with the soviets .         how were you able to tell them where we are .  i have no idea .     wayne looked around in the darkness .          i could not .  i told them i shall transmit to them every minute or so  just counting numbers  so that they can trace the signal as they approach us .         i hope they hurry .  i   m getting colder by the minute .         they are not far .         good     said wayne .     do you know what will happen between these two armies here .  i mean  i know which side won the war  of course  but what about right here .  do you know anything about that .         i have no details .         none at all .         i only know that the germans will lose this battle outside moscow     said ishihara .     they do not take the city  despite what leutnant mohr said about it .  this is the first soviet victory of the war .         well  let   s figure out our story .  we want to have it before anyone gets here .        hunter walked through the dark  nearly deserted streets with his team  pausing to hide in shadows or around corners on the few occasions when they saw a vehicle .  they saw no other pedestrians .  at the same time  hunter monitored the radio transmissions in moscow from the nkvd .  the transmissions made reference to a couple of other public buildings that were being used to house displaced citizens .   none of the messages mentioned an exact address .  however  hunter heard references to neighborhoods and streets that helped him choose the team   s direction .  after nearly an hour of walking through the cold  he approached another warehouse  from which a small amount of light escaped around the edges of a blacked out window .      that must be the place     said hunter .     i can hear the sleeping breaths of many people inside  as jane suggested earlier .         what   s our story .     steve moved up next to hunter  moving slowly with weariness from all the walking .     won   t they want to know what we   ve been doing out at this hour .         as you have occasionally recommended  i shall improvise .     hunter knocked firmly on the front door .     the story we used when we first arrived  without you  should be sufficient .         what was it .     steve asked .   before hunter could answer  the door opened slightly .  a stout  scowling man glared at him .     yeah  what is it .         we are displaced citizens from a farm west of moscow     said hunter .     we have fled the germans and seek shelter for the night .         the germans have been at our gates for weeks .  where have you been since then .     the man eyed steve suspiciously .     where   s he from .  he   s no russian .              steve stepped back .   my friend is a mongol who originally came from south of here  down by the black sea     hunter said calmly .     recently  he worked on the collective farm with us .  here are my sister and my cousin .         you are a fine  big  strapping fellow     the guard said .     why aren   t you out in the front lines .  we have need for men like you .      hunter patted his left leg .     i can   t keep up on the march .  bad leg .         oh .  and you   re out in the cold all night .     the man started to say something else when another man   s voice from inside stopped him .      let them in  yevgeny .  so you can close the door .  you   re letting all the cold air inside .      the first man frowned even more  but he stepped back  holding the door open .   hunter entered first  judging that more potential danger to his team lay in the uncertainties inside than in the empty street outside .  however  this warehouse was little different from the last one .  in the weak light from a lamp on the front table  he could see that the warehouse floor was covered with the sleeping people he had first heard a few moments before .      we have no more blankets .     their host folded his arms across his chest and stared at hunter .     and we have very little space left .         it will be fine     hunter said casually .     thank you .     he led the team down one wall  carefully stepping around or over the people in the way .   as in the other warehouse  people had clustered near the heating vents and had avoided the external walls as much as possible .  that once again left some space for the team in one of the back corners .  the corner was not exactly warm  but it was much warmer than the streets .   hunter turned to look at his team members in the shadows and spoke in a whisper .     is everyone okay .     he glanced past them to see that no one else was listening .      yes     whispered judy .     good job .         i   m fine     said jane .      let   s get some rest     said steve .      your sleep schedules do not match the time to which we have come     said hunter .     you will probably not sleep .  but we must remain quiet so that we attract no more attention .  your bodies will begin to adjust .         it   s like jet lag     said steve  with a shrug .     wayne was shivering uncontrollably out on the steppe by the time headlights appeared in the distance to the east .  the lights quivered and jumped as the vehicle rumbled across the frozen steppe toward them .  ishihara waited patiently .   a soviet armored car finally roared to a stop in front of them .  it was designed in a slightly different way from the one leutnant mohr had driven  but essentially accomplished the same purpose .  the moment it stopped  however  a squad of soviet soldiers leaped out of the back and fanned out to surround them  aiming their rifles at wayne and ishihara .  one of them shouted in russian .   ishihara raised his hands over his head .  wayne imitated him .  neither of them spoke .   the squad leader shouted again .  two of the soldiers slung their rifles over their shoulders and jogged forward .  they frisked wayne and ishihara  then stepped back .   the squad leader spoke sharply once more  jerking his head toward the back of the armored car .      follow me .     ishihara walked toward it  glancing back at wayne .   the instruction was unnecessary .  wayne was going to do whatever ishihara did .  they climbed into the back of the armored car  followed by the rest of the squad .   the armored car rumbled forward in a wide turn and drove back in the direction from which it had come .  these soldiers were much more alert than the exhausted germans had been .  they kept their weapons trained on the prisoners during the entire ride  and never looked away from them .   since ishihara said nothing  wayne remained silent as well .  these soviet soldiers seemed more dangerous  at least so far  than the germans ever had .  he could only hope that their superiors  like the germans  would be open to hearing their story .  as the icy wind whipped past them  he concentrated on keeping his balance and not making any sudden moves .   the journey did not take very long .  the searchlights over moscow were closer than ever .  with the soviet lines blacked out  however  wayne suddenly realized that they were coming right up on the lines without any warning .  moscow itself was still some distance away .   the armored car drove through the lines to the rear .  when it pulled up in front of a large tent  the squad leader shouted in russian again .  ishihara jumped to the ground  so wayne followed him .     ishihara felt stress under the first law imperatives .  he had to keep wayne safe or else somehow reach inside his torso cavity quickly and take them both to the safety of another time .  his promise to wayne not to do so unnecessarily  however  prevented him from acting too hastily .   two men in civilian clothes  wearing long black overcoats and fur hats  came out of the tent .  one of the civilians conferred briefly with the squad leader in russian .  the other soldiers still held their weapons trained on wayne and ishihara .      this way     said the civilian to ishihara in russian  nodding toward the tent .   turning  ishihara led wayne into the tent .  ishihara was surprised that civilians were going to talk to them .  here in military lines  he had expected to be grilled by military officers again .   only a battered wooden table and a couple of wooden stools stood inside the tent .  the dirty canvas walls protected them from the wind but did little else .  one of the civilians spoke in a coldly formal tone .      what nationality are you .         my friend is swedish and i am swiss .      they had agreed upon this story while waiting out on the steppe .  the soviets would not like to hear that ishihara had any connection to japan because of their historical resentment  in       the japanese had defeated czarist russia in war .  if wayne and ishihara were both swedish  however  their hosts would expect them to communicate in that language .  since ishihara knew that switzerland had also been neutral in this war  claiming to be swiss would explain their language differences .      my friend does not speak russian or any of the languages spoken in switzerland and i do not speak swedish     said ishihara .     therefore  we speak english to each other and i can translate russian for him .         very well .      ishihara turned to wayne and explained this exchange in english .      all right     said wayne .     any idea who these guys are .  they aren   t officers .         i am not certain .     ishihara turned .     who are you .  what are your names .         you don   t need to know .      ishihara translated this  as well .   wayne nodded .  then he waited  as one of the two civilians asked questions .  his partner remained silent .   ishihara prepared to translate throughout the conversation .      what are your names .     the man in charge  a stout  frowning man  looked back and forth between them from under bushy eyebrows .      wayne nystrom and r .  ishihara .         what are you doing here .  what is your purpose .         we are pro soviet agents from neutral countries     said ishihara  matching their host   s formal tone .     for many months  we have been pursuing a german agent across much of central and eastern europe .         why are you wearing those ridiculous clothes .         we were given these clothes while crossing the mountains fleeing the enemy .      the man studied them both for a moment .     you say you are chasing a german agent .         two agents     said wayne .     remember hunter .         oh  yes .         eh .  you aren   t certain of your mission .     the russian glowered at them both suspiciously .     you are changing your story  now .         our first mission is to apprehend a man codenamed mc       said ishihara .      however  another german agent is hoping to warn him about us first     said wayne .     his name is hunter .  naturally  we must stop him  too .         this agent who is code named mc       said the russian  still eyeing ishihara closely .     do you know what his name is .  or what name he is using .         no     said ishihara .      what is his mission in moscow .      ishihara was aware that wayne was deliberately remaining quiet  letting ishihara take the lead .  if they both answered simultaneously  and contradicted each other  they would lose their credibility completely .  wayne watched ishihara .      we believe that mc   will observe red army military placements     said ishihara .      then he will not enter the city proper .         we expect that he will also infiltrate the city to gain further information .  then he will radio what he learns back to german lines .         if he has preceded you here  he may already have radioed this information .     their host turned to wayne .     you have said very little .  do you think you are too late .         uh   no     said wayne slowly  as ishihara continued to translate .     we aren   t too late .  i don   t think he can risk too many radio transmissions from here to the german lines .         he can   t risk too many .  what do you mean .     for the first time  the russian sounded less hostile .      well  if he radios back too soon  he runs the risk of being caught before he has learned everything he can     said wayne .     he won   t want to take that chance .         then what do you expect him to do .         i think he   ll probably try to look around the red army positions first  then enter the city before he transmits anything .         yes     said ishihara  nodding quickly .     this would match his pattern of behavior in the past .         eh .  what pattern do you mean .         he will try to gather all his information first and then transmit it at once .  a single radio transmission will lower the risk to himself .         that   s right     wayne said quickly .     that   s what i was trying to say .         now what about this other agent .  is    hunter    his code name or the one he is giving to others .         this is what he calls himself     said wayne .     we  uh  don   t know what his code name is .         what do they look like .      the second russian took out a pad of paper and a pencil from his overcoat and prepared to take notes .      they are opposites     said wayne .     mc   is a short  slender man  very slight and quick .         hunter is tall and brawny     said ishihara .     blond hair  blue eyes .        the man taking notes nodded as he scribbled .  when he had caught up with what they had said already  wayne and ishihara finished giving him descriptions of the two robots .  wayne had decided that mc   and hunter  being robots  could adequately take care of themselves .   however  wayne did not want to be responsible for the human members of hunter   s team falling into the hands of the soviet government .  he did not mention them .  when ishihara also avoided giving any information about them  wayne decided that the first law prohibited ishihara from doing so .   wayne hoped merely to cause delays for hunter .  if hunter got into real trouble  of course  he could ultimately take his team out of danger by returning to their own time .  meanwhile  maybe the soviet authorities could somehow help wayne and ishihara locate mc   .   on the other hand  the authorities might want to keep these spies for themselves if they caught them .      both these agents are clever     said wayne .  he was not sure what he was going to say  but he wanted to convince their hosts that these two fugitives should be brought to wayne and ishihara .     to get the most out of them  we should participate in the questioning .         yes  of course     said the first man .      only we two can fully interpret their answers and their information     ishihara added  apparently picking up wayne   s concern .      we must ask them about their activities on earlier missions  as well     said wayne .      what about the german lines .     the second man  who had been silent to this point  finally spoke .     what have you observed that can be of use to us .      wayne hesitated .  ishihara saw that he did not want to pass information that could somehow alter history in a significant way .  he needed prodding .   ishihara gave wayne a very subtle nod of encouragement .     i am certain we shall win     said ishihara .     the upcoming battle will be a victory .         yes .  why are you so sure .     the civilian   s tone was a little more open now .      what is your name .     ishihara asked .     so we can all become acquainted .         i am agent raskov     said the second man .   the first man  who had refused to introduce them earlier  scowled in resignation .     i am agent konev .         why are you so certain that we will win the next battle .     agent raskov asked again .      the german army is dying on its feet     said wayne .     they are cold .  in fact  their soldiers don   t even have winter clothes to wear .         eh .     agent raskov glanced in surprise at his partner .     how can this be .         their generals were overconfident     said ishihara .     they expected to have taken moscow before winter began .  already  the red army has stalled their plans .         so they are cold .     agent raskov turned back to wayne .     what else .         their morale is low .  they are totally dispirited .  they really just want to go home .         they do .     agent konev raised his bushy eyebrows .     are they ripe for subversion .         uh .  .  .     wayne glanced uncertainly at ishihara .     what do you think .         no     said ishihara .     the german soldiers are discouraged but they are not cowards or traitors .         maybe they fear hitler more than they fear us     said agent konev .      yes  that is possible .         we were in panzer group       said ishihara .     i can tell you its placement .         excellent .     agent raskov turned a page in his notebook .     go ahead .      wayne waited patiently while ishihara described german placements .  he was certain that these were not secrets  the soviets already knew where the germans had been .  finally  when ishihara had finished  their hosts seemed to soften a little .  agent raskov even smiled very slightly as he put away his notebook .      your information about the placement of the enemy matches our own     said agent raskov .      why was no previous liaison made with us .     agent konev shook his head .      yes  we should have heard from you     said agent raskov .     that is true .         we apologize     said ishihara  with a faint shrug .         agent konev turned to wayne .  he acted more relaxed now  though he remained reserved .     since you are traveling without credentials  you should have given us some form of advance notice .         we would have if it had been possible     said wayne .     we were afraid that the germans would intercept any radio communication we made too soon .         that was a real danger     said agent raskov .     you seem to have handled it well .         by the time we did radio you  we were closer to red army lines than german lines  so we felt it was safe enough to attempt     said wayne .      we took a considerable risk contacting you when we did     said ishihara .      how did you get across the no man   s land .     agent raskov asked .     i mean to say  as far across it as you got .         it was a long  cold walk     said ishihara .     and we only dared use our radio when we realized that we could not make the trip on our own .         and where is your radio now .     agent konev asked .     do the soldiers have it .         no     said ishihara .     it malfunctioned .  since it was heavy  we abandoned it under fire from the germans as we fled .      both russians nodded .   ishihara did not know if their hosts completely believed their story .  however  he could see that they  like the germans  were at least undecided about them .  he was certain that the fact that he had taken the initiative to contact them lent some positive weight to their story  too .      what help can you give us .     ishihara asked .     in our search for the two enemy agents .         we must confer further on this     said agent raskov .     however  first we can give you some hot coffee .     he grinned openly for the first time .     coffee is rare these days  carefully rationed .  but we can offer you some .         i could use something to eat  too  if that   s possible     said wayne .      of course .     agent raskov glanced at his watch .     we can arrange it .  as for the help  however  it is quite late .  what help do you want .         where would two strangers find shelter in moscow .     ishihara asked .     traveling individually  with no one to help them  where would they go .         public housing     said agent konev .      that   s right     said agent raskov .     it would be easier for them now  in wartime  than in peacetime .  so many people have been displaced by the war .         then we would like to visit these places     said ishihara .     to look for our quarry .      agent raskov looked at his partner .     i think we can do this tonight .         yes .  tonight is good .  if we find these enemy infiltrators while they are sleeping  they will be easier to identify and apprehend .         i agree     said agent raskov .     first we will feed you .  then we will drive you into the city and see if we can take care of this matter .         thank you .     wayne relaxed a little .  hot coffee  food  and help finding mc   were the best news they had received since arriving in this time .     can you find us ordinary clothes .         wait here     said agent raskov .     we will send someone with coffee and something for you to eat .  if we can find clothes  we shall bring them .         thank you     said wayne .  the two agents left the tent without saying anything else .  in only a few moments  they were out of human hearing .  however  ishihara heard them still talking to each other with his enhanced hearing .      how much time should we spend looking for these other agents .     agent raskov asked quietly .      we should look tonight  at least  in case we can find them quickly     said agent konev .      and then .         we must have more information about our two guests .  at dawn  we must interrogate them thoroughly .  we cannot allow ourselves to work with only partial information .         even if we find these two agents .  that would back up their story .         no matter what we find     said agent konev .     their story is too thin and they have no documents to back it up .  we must interrogate them as we would an enemy .        hunter lay motionless in the darkened warehouse .  he had not shut himself down  but was conserving energy by not moving .  of course  he pretended to sleep at the same time .  when a firm  resounding knock sounded at the main door  he did not move  but instantly magnified his hearing .  he checked his internal clock and found that the time was      a . m .   the knocking was repeated  loudly  as someone from the front went to answer it .      who   s there .     one of the guards spoke cautiously from inside the door .      agents raskov and konev  nkvd .      as the door was opened  hunter reached out and gently woke steve .      steve  can you hear me .     hunter whispered .      yeah .         i believe the nkvd is looking for judy .  you and jane move closer to her .  cover her face with something .  i will try to create a diversion .         what .     steve opened his eyes  startled .     the nkvd is here after all .      hunter slipped his belt unit into steve   s hand .  he knew steve would not leave for their own time without him except in an extreme emergency .     i have already set the controls .  use it if you must .      steve nodded and moved over to wake up jane and judy  whispering to them quietly .   hunter listened to the two nkvd agents ask the guards about hunter by both his name and his description .  the overhead lights came on  causing a number of people in the crowd to stir .  hunter looked up and saw one of the guards pointing directly toward this corner .   the two agents began working their way down the length of the warehouse .  their way was blocked by all the sleeping and newly awakened people on the floor .  hunter had a few seconds to consider what to do .   he was puzzled by their possessing his description but not judy   s .  still  he expected that these agents would take the entire team if they found the group together .  he had to separate himself from the others immediately .   hunter did not want to return his entire team to their own time in front of so many witnesses .  two such events would definitely be discussed and would influence the local authorities in some way .  having everyone flee out the rear door again might not be as effective this time  the nkvd agents would maintain pursuit  where as the ordinary guards in the previous warehouse had not bothered .   the two agents stared at hunter with grim determination as they stumbled through the crowd .   to prevent them from taking the human members of his team  hunter could allow himself to be taken .  he felt he could manage to get away later if they arrested him .  his team members would still be in some danger without him  but totally avoiding significant risk was now impossible .   to help the rest of his team escape  he would have to lead the nkvd agents away from them .   hunter got to his feet suddenly .  the two agents both stopped in surprise  looking up at him  maybe his height startled them .  instead of running  however  hunter strode toward them  imitating the scowls on both their faces .   the two russians recovered from their surprise .      stop  comrade     said one .     i am agent raskov .  you must come with us .      since hunter wanted to keep their attention on him  he did not bother to answer .  he suddenly darted to his right  stepping over a sleepy  puzzled elderly man .  as the two agents moved to block his way  he jumped over someone else to a small open spot on the floor .      halt .  i command you .      more people were sitting up  blinking in the light and looking around .   hunter  of course  could have easily leaped through the crowd  throwing the two agents aside with his greater strength .  instead  he was hoping to make them work to capture him  so that they would forget about arresting his team members .  he hesitated  giving the agents a chance to maneuver closer .      you will not be hurt  comrade     said agent konev  as he came forward  pulling a handgun out of his overcoat .     not unless you force us to get angry .      around him  those who were awake gasped and squealed in sudden fear .  some scuttled away from him  still on the floor .  others lay flat  their eyes wide .   hunter had been prepared to move toward the front door again .  now he stopped  staring at the gun aimed at him .  he wondered if these agents would actually risk opening fire in the crowded room .  from what judy had said about this society  he estimated that they would .   the third law prevented him from taking an unnecessary risk to himself  of course  but the first law completely prevented him from fleeing now  for fear that bystanders would be shot by mistake .  he raised his hands slowly and did not move .  the other agent also drew a gun .      do not fire     said hunter .     do not endanger anyone else here .         turn around     said agent raskov .      agreed .  please do not fire .     hunter obeyed .  he felt himself being frisked .  with the demands of the first law dominating his thoughts  he fully expected that they would next go after the humans on his team   probably forcing steve to take them all back to their own time .   instead  to his surprise  each agent took one of his arms and they walked him forward through the warehouse .     ishihara and wayne had been left out in the backseat of the car each time that raskov and konev went inside another building .  their hosts had found them each a long  black woolen overcoat  but no other clothes to wear .  wayne kept his cloak bundled carefully under his arm .   for almost two hours after reaching moscow  they had gone to one facility after another  looking for mc   and hunter among the people displaced by the war .  ishihara had already told wayne what he had overheard with his enhanced hearing about raskov and konev interrogating them when morning arrived  whether or not they located the two enemy agents tonight .   ishihara knew that the interrogation would involve torture .  under the first law  he could not allow wayne to take that risk of harm .  they had to escape sometime tonight .      when are we going to make our move .     wayne asked .     wouldn   t this be a good time to get away from them .  we   re just sitting here .         i fear that simply jumping out of the car and running would put you in danger of freezing to death  without improving our chances of avoiding recapture .         yeah .  well .  .  . if we don   t escape to begin with  we won   t have to worry about being recaptured at all .     wayne sighed .     i don   t want to freeze out there  either  but if we   re going to go  shouldn   t we just do it .         yes  you have a point .         hey   they   ve taken a lot longer in this one than the others .  before  they just talked to a few people at the door  got the lights turned on  and came back out .  you think that means something .      ishihara turned up his hearing to maximum .  suddenly he recognized hunter   s voice telling someone not    to fire .     ishihara knew a weapon was being held on him .      get in the driver   s seat     ishihara said suddenly  opening his own door .     now  quickly .     he got out and closed the door as quietly as he could .   wayne climbed over the front seat and rolled down the window so he could speak to ishihara .     but now what .  i don   t know how to work this thing .      ishihara ran around to the driver   s side    they are bringing hunter out .  we must avoid him for the good of your own mission .         okay .  but what do i do .      ishihara leaned inside  pointing .     push down that pedal  the clutch  with your left foot .  hold on to the steering wheel .     he grabbed the gearshift and moved it .     hold this right here and  let up with your left foot .         got it .     wayne did as he was told .     how do you know how to work this thing .         i observed the driver carefully as we were riding before  and listened to the engine and gear sounds .         but he used a key to turn it on  didn   t he .  and he must have taken it with him .  it   s not here .         i realized that this vehicle is one i have some knowledge about .  it will start a couple of other ways than by normal use of the key .         it will .         use your other foot on the other two pedals .  those are the brake and accelerator .         all right .  that   s the same as in our electric vehicles back home .      ishihara hurried to the rear of the car .  his hearing revealed three sets of footsteps inside the warehouse walking resolutely toward the front door .  hoping that his information about this car was reliable  he leaned against the back of the car and used all of his strength to push it .  slowly  the car rolled forward .   the vehicle was on a fairly level stretch of pavement .  in a moment  ishihara had it moving faster .  suddenly the car jerked a couple of times and the engine made a coughing noise .  finally it roared to life .      halt .  i order you to stop .     agent konev   s voice came from the front door .   ishihara ran around the right side of the moving car .  he yanked the passenger door open and jumped inside .  then he slammed it shut .      now what .     wayne asked frantically  pushing the accelerator to the floor .     it won   t go very fast .         push down the clutch .     ishihara reached over at the same time and put his hand over wayne   s on the gearshift  moving it for him .  the engine roared and jerked  then the car sped up as it moved into second gear .      halt .     a gunshot followed the shout .   wayne yanked the steering wheel to turn a corner  making the tires squeal .   ishihara turned to look behind them just before they completed the turn .  in the shadows  agent raskov held his gun pointing into the air .  next to him  agent konev was holding hunter by one arm .            now what do i do .     wayne shouted over the roar of the engine as he gripped the steering wheel .     this can   t be right .  it   s going a little faster  but it doesn   t sound like it did before .     he was driving down a city street now  but much too slowly .      push down the clutch again .     as before  ishihara grabbed his hand over the gearshift and moved it into third gear .  instantly  the engine noise lowered and the car sped up .      okay     wayne muttered .     i   m getting some idea about how this works now .  but where am i going .      ishihara pointed into the shadows ahead .     turn left at the next corner .      wayne turned too fast .  the tires squealed again and they both were thrown to the right in their seats .  he hit the brake and slowed down  belatedly .      uh  sorry     said wayne .     i   ll need a lot of practice to get this right .     as soon as he had the steering under control again  he pressed the accelerator and sped up .      right now  we need to use an evasive pattern     said ishihara .     our hosts are probably telephoning their main office for help right away .         yeah .  what are we going to do  then .         once we have put some distance behind us  we can plan where to go .  at the moment  however  i suggest you slow down .  we do not want to attract attention by going unusually fast .         oh .  yeah  i guess not .     wayne carefully braked slightly .  this time the car slowed down smoothly .     there .  that wasn   t too bad .      ishihara looked around .  the streets of moscow were empty and scoured by the wintry winds .  so far  he could see no one following them .      i am not certain what to recommend now     said ishihara .     the nkvd at large  of course  will have the description and license number of this car as soon as the agents call in a report .         oh  yeah     said wayne .     shouldn   t we stop somewhere and leave it behind  then .         we can risk using it for a short time .  then  as you say  we must find a place to hide the car .  we shall have to flee on foot again after that .         okay     said wayne .  he clenched the steering wheel hard in both hands  tense with his crash course in learning to drive this vintage vehicle .     just tell me what to do .        steve remained flat on the floor of the warehouse as hunter toyed with the nkvd agents .  when the agents took hunter out  steve cautiously sat up .  then jane and judy pushed themselves up  too  and looked around .   most of the weary russians around them lay back down again to go back to sleep .  some whispered fearfully to each other .  a few people lined up for the rest room .      they   re used to it     judy whispered .     that   s the worst part of it .         is that why they   re just going back to sleep .     jane asked  looking around .      yes     said judy .     everyone has become so used to this sort of treatment that they just hope no one is coming for them or their loved ones .         that   s horrible     said steve .      yes  it certainly is .  and beyond their own personal safety  the oppression doesn   t matter that much to them anymore .  after the back breaking work they do all day  going back to sleep is enough .         i thought they   d come for us  too     said judy .     this doesn   t make any sense .  the guards at the front must have told them we came in together .         i don   t get it  either .     steve patted the bulge made by the belt device inside his shirt to make sure it was secure .     i   m using the latrine .  be right back .      he got to his feet and joined the line at the rest room .  while he waited there  he kept one arm over the bulge in his shirt to hide it .  before his turn came  the people at the front table turned off the overhead lights  leaving on only a small lamp at their table .  steve relaxed a little  knowing that no one could any longer see him clearly in the shadows .   when steve finally got inside  he turned on his lapel pin and began whispering .     hunter  steve here .         yes  steve .         what can you tell me .  what   s going on .         i know very little .  at the moment  the agents who arrested me are escorting me down the street on foot .  clearly  they had not come for judy after all .         why didn   t they take all of us .         they only gave my name and description to the guards .  the guards merely pointed me out .  no one told them that the rest of you were with me .         how did they get your description .         i believe wayne nystrom and r .  ishihara gave it to them .         huh .  how do you know that .         the agents    car was stolen just as we left the warehouse .  from my glimpse of the thieves in the shadows  i am certain that r .  ishihara and wayne nystrom took the car .         what do you want me to do .     steve asked .     while you   re alone with those guys  you could get away and meet us somewhere .  should we slip out the back door again .         no     hunter said firmly .     i do not want the team on the run in the cold again .  remain sheltered there for the night .  for now  remain calm and patient .  i shall not risk calling you  so call me when you can .         all right .         be warned that i may have to change my appearance before i return .         okay .         hunter out .      steve worked his way back to jane and judy in the dimly lighted room and sat down .  no one else was moving around now .  he relayed the conversation with hunter to them in a whisper .      i guess hunter   s right     judy whispered back .     we can   t do much to help him anyway .      steve nodded .     i guess .         definitely     said judy .     besides  how could we agree on a place to meet .  we don   t know the city .         that   s true     said jane .     and hunter has so many more abilities than we have .  he has a lot more flexibility without us .  he won   t have to worry about us this way  since we   re sheltered here .         all right  all right     said steve .     suppose we focus on our main target  instead .  we   re spending all our time just trying to get along here .  but what about mc   .         i   ve been thinking about him     said judy .     originally  i believed that the first law would induce mc   to interfere with the german advance .         i remember     said jane .      well  maybe i was off base about that     judy said slowly .     actually  as i recall  the german military is in very poor shape right now .         they   re the real aggressors  though  aren   t they .     steve asked .      well  yes     said judy .     they are the aggressors  in that they   re standing on soviet territory and they   ve been marching on moscow .  but in the coming battle  the soviets actually conduct a counterattack .         i get it     said jane .     so now you think mc   might try to prevent violence by interfering with the soviet counterattack .         well  it   s just one idea .  but also  mc   may learn about the nkvd itself .  their political prisoners are tortured and sent to labor camps where they are worked to death .  mc   could be drawn to protect the labor camp prisoners from harm .         i can see that possibility  too     said jane .     do you have others .         two more .  the soviet army   s german prisoners of war are also treated brutally .  over on the german side  soviet prisoners die by the thousands .         labor camp prisoners and prisoners of war on both sides     said steve .     plus the soviet army command .  that   s at least three important places mc   might pick out   not to mention any specific situations he happens to see .         i haven   t narrowed the possibilities very much  i   m afraid     said judy .   jane nodded .     so many humans are being harmed in so many ways near here right now that the first law might draw mc   in almost any direction .  and  of course  he will have to begin by putting his energy into learning all of this .  maybe we   re getting ahead of ourselves .  he could just be trying to find clothing and a way to fit in at this stage .         all right     said steve .     i know our sleep schedules aren   t in line with this time zone  but we might as well lie down and relax a little .  when morning comes  we   ll see if we can meet hunter somewhere and plan something .         good idea     said jane .   steve sighed .  he was concerned about hunter  but could not see anything he could do at the moment .  this society was much more structured  even in the disruption of wartime  than the earlier ones the team had visited .  operating in it would be much more complicated than he had realized .   a pounding knock on the front door startled him .  feeling a surge of adrenaline  he forced himself to remain prone and simply turned to look toward the front .  as one of the guards spoke through the door and then opened it  the thumping continued .  people sleeping inside began to stir .   four men in long  black coats strode inside .  one of them switched on the lights .  they had the same manner and clothing as the nkvd agents steve had seen before .      everyone up .  immediately .  wake up .  stand against the wall .     the first man barked the orders .  he drew a handgun and held it without pointing it at anyone in particular .   two of his companions began grabbing people   s arms and pulling them to their feet .  most of the people were groggy from sleep and confused .  the fourth man glanced around and then walked over to the front table  where he started looking around carefully .   steve pushed himself up and helped pull jane and judy to their feet .  at least the three of them were already awake .  he led them over to the wall where the others were being herded  so they could get lost in the crowd .   the agent holding the gun kept it on the crowd .  the man who had begun inspecting the front table slowly worked his way through storage cabinets down the wall toward the rest room  pulling out whatever he found and letting it fall .  the last two men began kicking apart the bedding and personal items on the floor .   since they had asked no questions  steve could not tell right away what they were looking for .  he watched as the two agents in the middle of the floor shook everything apart  throwing belongings in all directions .  the people huddled around them watched in terror  without protesting .      does this happen often .     steve whispered to judy  lowering his head to stay out of sight .      as often as they want     said judy .     but they   re looking for something specific  i think .      jane nodded .     something too big for people to hide on their bodies .  that   s why they aren   t searching anybody .      no one else spoke as the three men systematically tore apart all of the personal belongings and threw the items in the storage cabinets onto the floor .  the man searching the far wall also inspected the rest room .  finally  after they had finished  they turned and faced the crowd .      two secret radio transmitters have been detected functioning in this neighborhood     said the man with the gun .     who knows something about them .      steve froze with tension .  his call to hunter  when hunter had still been nearby outside  had been picked up by soviet receivers  along with hunter   s response .  for the authorities to have estimated the location of the two sources  at least two receivers had to have overheard them  and probably more .  since the man had used the word    neighborhood     they had not been able to focus specifically on this building .  obviously  however  they had come very close .   steve chastised himself for being careless .  in all of their previous missions  radio had been unknown and  therefore  completely secret .  their only worry had been to avoid having hunter call them on their lapel pins while they were in the hearing of local people .   he had completely forgotten that their messages could be intercepted by local authorities .  since hunter had not warned him of this at the time  even hunter might have taken the possibility lightly .  now they had caused this disruption and potential danger to everyone in the warehouse .   the crowd remained silent  some eyeing the four nkvd agents with fear and others turning their faces away .  in turn  the four men stared at individuals in the crowd  frowning with suspicion .  no one spoke for a long moment .   steve frantically tried to remember the content of his conversation with hunter .  he remembered that judy   s first name had been mentioned and also the names of wayne nystrom and ishihara .  he had addressed hunter by name and used his own first name   and they had spoken in english .  that alone would mark them as foreigners .  also  the brief exchange had raised the possibility of sneaking out to meet  which certainly would have sounded suspicious .  beyond that  however  he could not recall the exact wording of the discussion .   the agent with the gun walked up to the crowd and spoke in a low voice to someone in the crowd .  steve could not see him .  he could not make out the words  either  but the tone was menacing  aimed at intimidation .   steve decided that radio meant something much more important here than it did in his own time .  though his knowledge of history did not come close to that of hunter or judy  and was not as good as even jane   s  he supposed that radio was the only broadcast tool available in this time .  it would be especially useful for intelligence agents .  these nkvd agents were probably looking for spies  though they had no idea that a transmitter and receiver could be small enough to hide in a lapel pin .   the agent with the gun shoved the person he had been talking to out of the way and studied the crowd  looking for someone else to question .         wayne concentrated so hard on driving the car without running up on the sidewalk that he had no time to be scared .  he turned corners when ishihara suggested he do so  and could slow down enough not to make the tires squeal .  however  ishihara still had to tell him when to shift gears and to help him move the gearshift while he depressed the clutch .  if ishihara did not tell him to turn  wayne simply drove straight down the dark streets .      i am surprised     said ishihara .     i have continued to monitor nkvd radio traffic .  no alert has gone out for the nkvd to search for this car .         no alert has gone out .  why not .         i can only conclude that agents konev and raskov have not yet reported that we stole their car .         really .  they   ve had plenty of time .         i would have thought so .      wayne grinned .     of course  their radio is in this car .  i guess they   d have to look for a phone .         yes     said ishihara .     this means we are free to keep this car for now .  we are in no danger of a specific search by the nkvd at large until they report its theft .         well  that   s good .  at least the heater works .     wayne thought a moment .     but why haven   t those two agents reported that we took their car .         i do not know .  perhaps they have had difficulty locating a telephone .         don   t they have a lot of authority  though .  they could just commandeer a phone  couldn   t they .         maybe at this hour  they have literally not found one available .         can   t they just pound on someone   s door to get a phone if they really want to .  the way they knocked on those doors to the public housing in the middle of the night .         i believe you are correct  to the limit of my knowledge     said ishihara .      so why haven   t they reported in .         i do not know     said ishihara .     we could turn on the receiver in this car for you to hear  if you understood russian .         i wish i did .     the mystery made wayne uncomfortable  even though it seemed to be to their advantage at the moment .     well  where are we going .         we must find you shelter for the night     said ishihara .     it has been a long night so far .  we cannot risk your sleeping in this vehicle  for fear the report will be made and the search will begin .         is there anything we can do about finding mc   .  while we still have this car .         my only suggestion is that we search through crowds  especially where a first law imperative might draw mc   to take action .         i guess that won   t apply in the middle of the night when the city   s asleep .         i estimate you are correct .         okay .     wayne shrugged .     so  what should we do to find shelter  then .         a couple of blocks from where we took the car  i saw another large building that may house displaced citizens .  my hearing told me that many people were sleeping inside .  i shall direct you back there and we shall go to the door .         i   m ready when you are .      wayne drove according to ishihara   s directions .  they slowly made their way back to the neighborhood where they had begun .  as wayne recognized one of the blocks  he started looking for pedestrians .      what if they   re still here .  hunter and those agents .  we don   t want them to see us again .         i have been looking for any sign of them .  i have not seen any .  the warehouse from which we took the car is still out of sight .         how close to it are we going to get .         no closer than this .  turn left in the alley just ahead of us and stop the car at the right curb .         all right .      wayne turned left and braked nearly to a stop .  the car jerked to a sudden halt and the engine died .  he shrugged at ishihara .     sorry .         i should have told you to depress the clutch as we stopped     said ishihara .     never mind that now .  we will get out and knock on the door .      wayne grabbed his bundled cloak and followed ishihara around the corner .  at least their overcoats hid their tunics and leggings .  they approached a very large building  barely visible in the faint moonlight .  ishihara led him to the front door and knocked .   at first nothing happened .  ishihara knocked several more times .  finally  wayne heard footsteps and the door creaked open slightly .  an elderly woman with long white hair falling about her shoulders looked out .      please  comrade     said ishihara .     we have been turned away from many places tonight .  we only need a small space in which to sleep .      yawning  the woman glanced at both of them .  then she nodded .  she stepped back and opened the door .   wayne followed ishihara inside  relieved to feel the warmth .  the woman switched on a small lamp .  in the light it threw  wayne could see that sleeping people filled the floor .  a few lying within the range of the lamp stirred slightly  otherwise  the light did not disturb anyone .   the woman gestured vaguely toward the room at large  apparently she was telling them to find their own places .  then she stood next to the lamp  waiting for them to do so before turning it off again .  ishihara found a small spot for them along one wall .  they sat down there  and wayne rolled up in his cloak .  a moment later  the woman turned out the light .     hunter   s glimpse of wayne and ishihara had been brief and limited by the shadows  but it had been enough to identify them .  the agents who had just taken him into custody had been furious .  while one held hunter   s arm  the other had shouted in rage  stomping his feet and firing a warning shot into the air after the departing vehicle .  during that same few seconds  steve had radioed hunter from just inside the building .   as the two agents had argued with each other  hunter had overheard their names .  agent raskov  the angrier one  had wanted to go back inside and use the warehouse telephone to report the theft of the car .  however  agent konev had absolutely forbade it on the grounds that they would look bad  even incompetent  to the people inside .  hunter observed that agent konev was the senior partner  with the authority to make the final decision .   since that argument  the two agents had been marching hunter up the street between them .  each one held one of his arms and walked in silence .  hunter was not certain if they had a clear plan themselves .  he did understand agent konev   s position  however .  when a government functioned by terrorizing its own citizens  its agents could only lose power by revealing their personal fallibility .   at any time  of course  hunter could pull away from them by brute force .  he did not want to do that except in an emergency .  if possible  he wanted to satisfy the nkvd agents that he was no threat and depart from them on good terms .  otherwise  the team would remain fugitives from the nkvd for the rest of their time here .  that could only damage their chances of finding mc   .      all right  hold it .     agent raskov brought them to a stop .     are we going to walk all night .  even if we don   t report to the head office that the car was stolen  surely we can call someone for help .         who .     agent konev demanded gruffly .     how many of our fellow agents want to see us reassigned  so they could move up into our places .  all they need is something to use against us .  we don   t dare turn to any of them .         not every colleague wants our jobs .  what about the two guys you worked with last year .         hah .  they would love to see us both in siberian labor camps  comrade .         well  even if we walk all the way to the office  someone will notice our car is not there   in the morning  after daylight .     agent raskov sighed .     i   m very tired .         you may interrogate me here     said hunter .     if it would be more convenient .         shut up     said agent konev .   hunter saw that he was not particularly angry .  since hunter had been docile to this point  and both agents had handguns  he had not challenged their control of the situation .  he decided to risk speaking again .      why did you take me .         i just told you       agent konev started .      don   t waste your breath on him     agent raskov interrupted .     what are we going to do .         have you been influenced by wayne nystrom and mr .  ishihara .     hunter spoke in a calm  unemotional tone .  he had no idea  of course  if they had given their right names .   both men turned to him in surprise .      what have they told you .     hunter asked .      shut up     agent konev repeated .  he was still studying hunter   s face  however  with new interest .      you know them personally .     agent raskov asked .      yes  i do     said hunter .     i suspect they are using you for their own ends .         what does that mean .     agent konev demanded .      i think it   s obvious     said agent raskov .     we   ve been duped  comrade .  they sent us on a diversionary chase and stole our vehicle .  maybe hunter  here  is not at all that they claimed he was .         well  maybe he is .  we certainly can   t afford to make another blunder tonight .         granted     said agent raskov .     let   s go into an apartment building and start knocking on doors .  sooner or later  we   ll find someone who has a telephone .  we don   t have to give any explanations about our car .         all right     agent konev said wearily .     we must get to work on this .  i agree .      hunter patiently allowed them to take him wherever they wished .  they marched him to the front of a darkened apartment building  where agent raskov remained out on the sidewalk with him .  agent konev pounded on the locked front door  waited  and then hammered on it again .  the sound was loud on the quiet street .  finally someone opened it .  agent konev identified himself and was allowed inside .   hunter waited only six minutes with agent raskov before agent konev came back out of the building .      did you find a phone .     agent raskov asked .      yes .     agent konev nodded grimly .     i did not explain  not yet .         we will have to explain soon .  who else was on duty .  who is coming to get us  comrade .         the night clerk is driving out .         oh  young mikhail .  at least he will keep his mouth shut .     agent raskov let out a long sigh .      yes  he will .      they waited out on the street for only about ten minutes before a car drew up to the curb .  hunter allowed himself to be directed into the backseat between the two agents .  no one spoke as they rode away .   the car parked behind a large building .  hunter recognized it as the same one from which he had rescued judy .  he was taken into an unmarked back door .  inside  he found himself at the opposite end of the same hallway where he had bluffed his way in to get judy .   for a few minutes  the agents locked him up alone in an interrogation room .  it was similar to the one in which judy had been held  with a table  a single lamp  and several chairs .  the walls had no windows .  a steam radiator against one wall provided some heat .  he sat down in a chair .   when the door opened  his two hosts came in  now without their overcoats  and shut it .  they sat down across the table from him  studying him grimly .  he waited for them to speak .      who are you  hunter .  where did you come from .     agent konev looked him in the eye .      i was a farm worker west of moscow until the germans came .  then i fled into the city with everyone else .     by now  using their own speech as a model  hunter had polished and perfected his russian accent and colloquialisms .  they would not pick out flaws in his speech .      what was the name of your farm .      hunter did not know of one .  he shrugged .     we just called it    the farm .          agent konev frowned deeply .     you don   t know the name of the place were you worked .         we never paid much attention .         i say you are a german spy .      hunter remained silent .  that was probably what wayne nystrom had told them .  based on what judy had told him about the nkvd  he now expected much worse treatment   maybe physical torture and an attempt to imprison him in a labor camp .      what is your mission here .     agent raskov spoke this time .     who is your contact .      hunter considered his options .  of course  he could withstand substantially greater torture than a human  but he could not afford to have his captors find that out .  in any case  the third law required that he not allow harm to come to himself .      speak  hunter .     agent konev shouted .     your silence proves your guilt .  now answer us .      since hunter had given steve the belt unit to trigger the sphere back in room f     hunter could only escape by means of his own personal resources .  that would endanger the welfare of his whole team .  he still did not want to take that step .   suddenly agent konev shot up out of his chair and punched hunter across the table  striking him in the face .  hunter   s reflexes gave him plenty of time to see it coming  and he rocked back slightly with the blow .  he carefully sustained much of the punch and allowed himself to fall from his chair to the floor  to give the man some satisfaction .   as hunter slowly got to his feet  both agents moved around the end of the table .  agent raskov grabbed hunter under his arms and hoisted him up .  at the same time  agent konev slammed his fist into hunter   s abdomen .  as before  hunter reacted the way he judged a human would  doubling forward and then falling to his knees  pulling free of agent raskov   s grasp .      let him think about it     said agent raskov .      he needs more convincing  comrade   and this is only the beginning .     agent konev struck hunter in the head with his knee  almost casually .   hunter obligingly fell over on the floor .  he could see only their lower legs and feet now .      it   s been a long night     said agent raskov .     at least  let   s discuss it outside .  come .         all right .     agent konev kicked hunter with one foot as a parting shot and switched off the light .   hunter remained motionless until they had left .  the door closed behind them firmly and the lock snapped into place .  then hunter stood up .   the room was completely dark except for the strip of indirect light entering under the door from the hall .  the only possible exit for hunter was the door .  unless he chose to use it  he could do nothing but wait .         the next morning  steve sat with judy and jane in their corner of the warehouse with their bowls of hot gruel .      what are we going to do .     jane asked .     are we joining the work brigade today  or what .         it   s the best way to blend in     said steve .     if we leave  we might not be welcome back .  judy  what do you think .         what   s the point of joining the work brigade .  just to wait till hunter comes back .         yeah  exactly .     steve paused to eat .     if we start running around moscow on our own  it   ll be even harder for him to find us .         you could .  .  . you know .     jane tapped her lapel pin .     if we call him after we leave here  it won   t endanger these people again .       .    but we   ll be stuck with nowhere to go tonight     said steve .     i think our best bet now is to stay with the work brigade and wait for hunter to come back .         i   m afraid we   ll wait forever     said judy .     what if something permanent happens to him .  we   ll just be sitting around .         let   s give him another day  at least     said steve .     that   s not very long .         i agree     said jane .     if he has to sneak away instead of break out  a day isn   t too long to wait .         so i   m outvoted     said judy  with a sigh .     all right .  i guess it won   t hurt a historian to go out with a work brigade and dig ditches for a day .  maybe i   ll learn something useful out there .        ishihara lay motionless on the hard  cold floor  conserving his energy .  wayne slept soundly  using his cloak for padding .  in the morning  the sounds of other people rising and talking awakened wayne .  stretching  he looked around and then sat up .      are you well .     ishihara asked quietly .  he sat up  also .      uh  yeah .  it was kind of a short night  though .  how long was i asleep .         six hours and four minutes .  well short of the eight hours recommended for ideal human rest .         it   ll do .         i see some people in the front are preparing large vats of hot cereal .  we shall be fed .         good .  i   m hungry .     wayne looked around .     what kind of a place is this .      ishihara glanced about the room .     if you look carefully  you can see disconnected cables and holes in the floor where machinery was once bolted down .         yeah  i see .  what does that mean .         i believe this was previously a factory .  now all the industrial machinery has been hauled away .         why .  something to do with the war .         yes .  i think they carried it away from the advancing germans .         in case moscow is captured .         yes  and also to avoid having it bombed .      ishihara looked around at the crowd  which consisted mostly of women and children .  a small number of elderly men were scattered through it .  some people were getting in line for the rest rooms and for breakfast .      what do they all do in the daytime .     wayne asked .     do they have jobs to go to .         i have been listening to people talk .  this is a work brigade .  after breakfast  trucks will take everyone outside moscow to dig ditches .         we don   t want to waste any time doing that .         no .  however  before we leave  i suggest you eat .  we may have trouble finding other food today .         yeah .      ishihara waited where he was as wayne got in line for the rest room .  by the time he had joined the line for breakfast  most people already had their food .  he brought his back to ishihara and started eating .      i have continued to monitor the nkvd radio traffic     said ishihara .      i guess the car must have been reported stolen by now     said wayne .      no  not yet     said ishihara .     not yet .         we still have some time in which we can use the car     said ishihara .     at least as long as it still has fuel .  we should use it while we can .         we   ll use it in more than one way     said wayne .     it will lend us an air of authority  won   t it .  maybe we can get some information from the guys up at the front table .         i think i understand what you mean     said ishihara .     more play acting .         right     said wayne .     but you   ll have to do the talking  of course .  and you   ll have to explain why a couple of important people came begging for places to sleep in the middle of the night .      when wayne had finished eating  he rolled up his cloak and walked with ishihara up to the front .  ishihara observed the women ladling out hot cereal and the two men standing by the door and decided to approach the men .  he stood up straight and assumed a confident demeanor .      who is in charge here .     ishihara asked .   the two men glanced at him in surprise .      i am the commissar of this facility     said one .  he was a blond man of medium height  about thirty years old .     i have not seen you before  comrades .  when did you arrive .         we came in late last night     said ishihara .     we are in pursuit of an enemy agent .      the commissar   s eyes widened .     you are .  here .         no  no .  i have not seen him here .     ishihara described mc   .     have you seen anyone of this description .         no     said the commissar thoughtfully .     of course  many people are coming and going these days .     he glanced at his partner  who also shook his head .  then the commissar looked back and forth between wayne and ishihara .     you are .  .  . nkvd .         we are working in cooperation with them     ishihara said carefully .      in cooperation with them .  what does this mean .  may we see your badges .      ishihara had worried about this moment .  no one had demanded the real agents    badges  but they had expressed their authority with guns and bluster .  ishihara drew himself up stiffly  hoping to bluff the commissar .     you question our authority .         well .  .  . meaning no disrespect .     the commissar hesitated .     i am boris popov  comrade .  who are you .         we must be on our way  comrade .     ishihara turned abruptly and walked past him  out the door .  his hearing detected wayne   s footsteps right behind him .  however  he also heard the commissar and his partner following wayne out the door .   ishihara did not look back  feeling that his bluff would work better if he showed no concern over the commissar   s attention .  he led wayne at a brisk stride down the sidewalk in the morning light and turned at the alley .  the commissar   s footsteps stopped uncertainly just outside the door .   in the alley  out of sight  ishihara got into the driver   s side .  he closed the door and quickly leaned down to pull some of the wires under the dashboard out where he could see them .      aren   t we going to start the car the same way .     wayne asked .     i can steer while you push  but i can   t push as hard as you can if you   re the one who   s steering .         we cannot convince anyone this car is ours if they see us start the engine that way     said ishihara .     get in on the passenger side .         okay   but what are you doing .         the key to the ignition must allow some sort of electrical connection to be made that starts the engine .  if i select the correct wires  then i can make the same connection .  i think i have them .  please get in .         yeah  okay  okay .     wayne hurried around to the other side and slid inside  slamming the door .   ishihara had carefully stripped the insulation from a couple of wires .  he touched the bare metal together and heard the starter whine .  when he gave the engine gas  it started up .  he shut his own door and backed out of the alley .      wow  not bad     said wayne .     i understand how a robot works  but figuring out these primitive machines at a glance  without a design to go by  forget it .         thank you     said ishihara  stopping in the street and shifting into first gear .     now we must drive past the commissar so that he can see us driving away .      ishihara kept his head straight as he drove past the front door of the converted factory  still pretending to have no concern over the commissar and his partner .  his peripheral vision  however  told him that both men were still standing there watching them .  they did not react outwardly .      what do you think .     wayne asked .     did we bluff them or are they suspicious .         i do not know     said ishihara .     cars appear to be fairly rare here  so our possession of one is a powerful symbol .  however  they are probably still somewhat suspicious .         well   you still haven   t heard any nkvd alert for finding this car .         not yet .         that   s great .  maybe we can close in on mc   before they do .  where shall we look .         i suggest factories and military posts .  the first law will drive him to participate with the local people in ways that might help them .         okay .  how do we find places like that .         big smokestacks can take us to factories that are still functioning .         for the military  i guess we have to drive back out to the front  if we have enough fuel .         yes .         you   re driving .  take us where you think we   ll have the best chance to find him .        hunter remained locked in the room in darkness .  his internal clock kept him aware of the passing time .  the sounds of voices and footsteps down the hall told him when the day shift arrived for work .  he waited patiently  uncertain of what he wanted to do .   just before noon  two uniformed guards came into the room .  without a word  they took his arms and escorted him out into the hall .  at the end of the hall  they took him down a staircase .  in the basement of the building  they placed him in a large barred cell with a crowd of other prisoners .   as the metal door clanged shut behind him  he turned to look at the other prisoners .  he estimated that he was sharing space with about sixty other grown men of varying ages .  most sat on the cold floor  some had stretched out and a few remained on their feet  leaning against the walls or the bars in the front of the cell .  they were dressed in ordinary street clothes .  as they looked back at him cautiously  no one spoke .   hunter knew that the nkvd was primarily concerned with security risks right now  not petty criminals .  his companions down here were almost certainly political prisoners on their way to labor camps in siberia .  he felt an immediate urge from the first law to help them  to save them somehow .  of course  he knew he could not without risking a significant change to history .   also  he knew that enough contradictory pressure from the first law could neutralize him completely .     wayne noticed that ishihara was pulling the car over to the curb .  they had just spoken to their fourth factory commissar .  each one seemed to realize that their car signified government power  they had all been very cooperative .  however  neither wayne nor ishihara had seen any sign of mc    nor had anyone they questioned .      why are we stopping .     wayne asked .      the car theft has finally been reported     said ishihara .     we must decide what to do now .      wayne grabbed the door handle .     well  let   s get going .  come on .         immediate flight is not necessary     said ishihara calmly .     the description of the car and the plate number have been announced to agents at large over the nkvd radio band  but so far no one has actually reported sighting us .         let   s keep it that way     said wayne  grinning nervously .     i mean  why stay in this car until they do .         i am not suggesting we should .  however  i judge that we have some time left to us .  the nkvd does not seem to have reported the car theft to the regular city police .         well   maybe they reported by phone .  that   s why you didn   t hear it on their radio band .         i can monitor the city police band  as well .  they still have not reported this theft .         yeah  i see .  what do you think   maybe the nkvd doesn   t want to admit it could happen to them .         i believe this is the case .  they will want to maintain the image of the nkvd as all powerful .         what do you suggest we do now .         maybe we should approach a military installation       ishihara stopped suddenly .      what   s wrong .      ishihara held up his hand for wayne to wait .   relieved that ishihara had not malfunctioned in some way  wayne waited  watching him .   ishihara turned to him .     the nkvd has report ed a sighting of someone of mc     s description .     ishihara pulled the car away from the curb and drove down the street .      oh  yeah .  i forgot   raskov and konev are still looking for him  too .  where is he .         he was originally reported sleeping in a schoolhouse that had been used for housing displaced citizens .  everyone there is in a work brigade that digs ditches every day .         you know where .         yes .  i have the same directions that were just given to the other nkvd agents .         raskov and konev might be there .  they   ll recognize us when we drive up .         as we approach  we can decide how to proceed .  in the meantime  i shall continue to monitor the radio band .  they will not be able to communicate over it without letting us hear the message  too .         we   re driving right into the lion   s den     said wayne .     but if that   s where mc   is  that   s where we have to go .            steve  judy  and jane joined the work brigade for the day .  they rode out to the antitank ditches with everyone else and spent the morning digging together .  they moved far enough from the other workers to talk among themselves privately  but steve did not call hunter again .  he knew that hunter would not try to contact him  and that left him undecided about what to do .   at midday  they got in line with the others for lunch .  after they received hard rolls and bowls of a thin vegetable soup  they sat down to eat by themselves on the top edge of the ditch .  the other workers sat with their own friends .      have you looked up the ditch that way at all .     jane pointed .      hm .     judy turned  her mouth full .      there   s a guy up there who   s small enough to be mc   .  i saw him just now .         really .     steve tore off a piece of a hard roll .     there must be hundreds of people in the ditch all around us .  where is he .         right now  he   s lost in the crowd     said jane  leaning to her right as she tried to see him again .     and he was in the distance  almost out of sight .         i don   t see him  either     said judy  leaning the other way to look .      how well did you see him .     steve asked .     i mean  are you sure it was mc   .     he looked in disgust at his bowl of watery soup .      well  no .  but he was dressed poorly  his coat was too big and one sleeve was tom .         like he might have picked up cast off clothing from somewhere     said steve .      that   s right .         what was he doing .     judy asked .      he was digging like everyone else .     jane was still looking up the long ditch  but she shook her head .     i don   t see him now .         judy     said steve .     what would happen if we went to look for him .         i don   t think we should .  these brigades are rigidly organized .         what would happen to us .     jane asked .      i don   t know .  but i don   t see anybody walking around socializing .     judy lowered her voice .     it   s hard to convey just how oppressive the communist party is during this era .  even the military units have party members watching over the ideological purity of everyone .  and  of course  they can summon the nkvd at any time to take away dissidents  real or imagined .  the same is true right here .         i   m convinced     said steve .     we don   t want to attract attention to ourselves .  without hunter here  i don   t want to take any unnecessary risks .         especially since that guy might just be someone else     said jane .     i only got a glimpse .         let   s just keep looking from here for now     said steve .     if he does look like mc    then at the end of the day  maybe we can see which truck he gets on .  that will help us find him later tonight .         good     said judy .   steve thought a moment .     what are the chances that we would just run into him like this .  doesn   t that seem farfetched to you .         i suppose it does seem like a coincidence     said judy .      it   s not just pure chance     said jane .     remember  hunter specifically identified a certain area of moscow where he expected mc   to appear .  our warehouse is nearby .         that   s right     said judy .     and all the displaced citizens who are not working at something more essential are being drafted into the work brigades .         exactly     said jane .     so his presence here  in a brigade from the same neighborhood as our warehouse  is not really too unlikely .      steve nodded  looking through the crowd in the distance again .     maybe we have a chance  then .        ishihara drove while wayne sat rigidly next to him .  though wayne had to be excited by the prospect of finding mc    a glance at him told ishihara that his human companion was frightened by the fact that other nkvd agents were going to the same location .  so far  they had hardly even left the outskirts of moscow .      we   re leaving the city     wayne said anxiously .     what   s our route .         i have been considering this     said ishihara .     from what i have been able to observe and overhear on our travels so far  the soviet lines are positioned mainly to the north of moscow .  i believe they are poised to make a flank attack on the germans when and if the germans advance eastward on the city .  the antitank ditches are being dug straight west of moscow  but still have military patrols behind them .         and that   s where we   re headed .         yes .     ishihara drove a varied pattern through the west side of moscow .  finally he found a well used  unpaved road leading out of the city .  they drove in silence .     after the midday break  judy picked up her shovel and looked again where jane might have seen mc   .  then as judy resumed digging  she worked her way toward a middle aged woman in her own brigade .  steve glanced at her but merely nodded  trusting her to be careful .   casually  keeping her head down while she continued to dig  judy spoke quietly to the other woman .      where is that other brigade from .  do you know .         what .  which one .         the one working right next to us .      the woman looked up at her suspiciously .  she was missing a couple of lower teeth .     why .         well .  .  .     judy smiled and shrugged in what she hoped was an embarrassed manner .     there is a man over there i would like to meet .         ah .     the woman laughed .     ah  yes  i see .  well  they spend their nights in that school near us .  you know the one  that was bombed .  they had to fix up the roof .         uh   yes .  it   s down the block from us .     judy did not want to admit how little she knew .      no  no .  it   s on the next block .         east of us .         no  my dear .  north .         oh  yes .  i   m sorry .      the woman looked over toward the other brigade .     so which one is he .         well .  .  . i don   t see him right now .  he   s a rather short fellow .         short .     she laughed  shaking her head .     ah  you   re so silly .      they went on digging .  gradually  judy worked her way back to steve and jane .  when they were far enough from the others not to be overheard  she told them what she had learned .      i just wish we could get a good look at him     said steve .     if we knew for sure it was mc    we could make some definite plans .  maybe we could even grab him  take him back  and then return for hunter .         really .     jane asked .     you   d do that .      steve grimaced .     i wouldn   t like it much .  it   s a possibility  but i   m getting worried about hunter .        eventually  ishihara could see the military patrols ahead of them on the rolling steppe .  sentries blocked the road .  it was      p . m .      have you decided what you   re going to say to them .     wayne asked .      i shall say something similar to what we said to the commissar in the factory .      ishihara slowed the car as they approached the checkpoint .  wayne stiffened visibly in his seat .  ishihara rolled down his window  preparing to speak to the sentries .   without a word  a uniformed sentry nodded grimly and waved them through the checkpoint .  wayne glanced at ishihara in shock .  ishihara showed no sign of surprise as he nodded back and drove past them .      this is really easy     said wayne  with a sudden laugh .     this nkvd car makes all the difference  doesn   t it .         i believe part of the reason is up ahead     said ishihara  pointing .  ahead of them on the same road  another car similar to their own was just moving out of sight in the distance .  ishihara slowed down a little .   wayne looked .     what do you mean .         i suppose that the agents in that car explained what their business was out this way     said ishihara .     the sentries just assumed we were with them .  that is why they felt no need to question us .  even in the military  no one in this society wants trouble with the nkvd .         but now we have to worry about those other agents     said wayne .      i have already slowed down to let them move away from us     said ishihara .      what if they saw us .         if we find them waiting  i shall turn around the car and we shall flee .  however  i do not expect that .  i believe that they will be searching for mc    just as we are  without great concern for us .         but you said that the theft of our car has been reported now .  why wouldn   t they check us out .         maybe they will     said ishihara .     however  they would not expect the car thieves to be following them .  most likely  they expect us to flee at the very sight of another nkvd car .  remember that the alert to find mc   here went out to all the nkvd cars .  the agents who come here will expect to see each other near the ditches .         i hope you   re right     wayne muttered quietly .      i expect so .      ishihara drove over the next slight rise in the ground .  ahead of them  down a long but very gentle slope  work brigades dug ditches with shovels .  the nkvd car ahead of them had turned right and stopped .  two agents had just left the car and were walking toward the nearest work brigade .   next to him  ishihara saw wayne slide down in his seat  covering the side of his face with one hand .   instead of continuing straight down the slope  which would have taken them close to the nkvd agents  ishihara turned at an angle .  he began driving left down the slope  leaving the road .  one of the nkvd agents glanced back over his shoulder at the sound of their car .  then he turned back to his business at hand  uninterested in them .      okay so far     wayne muttered .   ishihara took the car down to the ruts that ran behind the ditch .  the tracks of large truck tires filled the ruts .  they had spontaneously carved a rough service road simply by driving up and down here every day .      i still hear nothing concerning us on the nkvd radio band     said ishihara .      good .     wayne sighed .  then he looked back over his shoulder .     those agents are out of sight now .  you want me to drive .  then you can scan the workers for mc   .         excellent .      they traded places and wayne drove slowly down the rough road .  when ishihara instructed him to slow down or stop  he did  always nervously looking around for more nkvd cars .  gradually  they moved down the length of the ditch as ishihara searched the work brigades .  the ditch was full of people digging up and down its entire length .      didn   t the alert identify which work brigade mc   was in .     wayne asked .      no .  it only gave this general vicinity .         you could radio mc   directly     said wayne .     and tell him that we are from his own time .         that would merely alert him to the pursuit     said ishihara .     he would flee .         that   s what i mean     said wayne .     we might flush him out that way .         ah  i understand .  you mean  instead of remaining camouflaged  he would reveal himself by running away .         maybe .  what do you think .         it could work if he is in our sight     said ishihara .     if he is too far ahead of us  or if he was in the other direction when we turned left  then we would not see him .         oh  yeah .         these ditches are very long     said ishihara  looking ahead .     to protect moscow from attack  they must be many kilometers long .  we have many workers to consider .         this is as close as we   ve come so far     said wayne  shrugging .     besides  i   m really getting the feel of how to drive this car now .     he grinned wryly .   they continued their slow progress down the length of the ditch .  the sun was low over the horizon when ishihara heard the rumble of large trucks behind them  still in the distance .  he did not bother to turn and look .      looks like quitting time     said wayne  glancing into the rearview mirror .     here come the trucks to take people home .      a familiar shape in the distance  among the workers  momentarily slipped into ishihara   s vision and then disappeared again .     stop     ishihara said sharply .   wayne hit the brake and the clutch quickly .     what   s wrong .  i don   t think the truck drivers will care what we   re doing here .         no  that is not the reason .  i saw mc   .         what .  where .     wayne stopped the car and leaned toward ishihara to look .   ishihara pointed .     i saw him there  but he is not visible now .  he is lost in the crowd .         did he run away .         i do not believe so .  he has no way of knowing our identities and was not looking toward us .      near them  the workers had also seen the trucks coming .  they were picking up their shovels wearily and climbing out of the ditch .  the crowd was dense  however  and wayne could not see mc   anywhere .      maybe we can have him brought to us     said ishihara .     we do not have to chase him ourselves .     he got out of the car and slammed the door .   wayne got out and hurried around the car to join him .  ishihara saw a man approaching him and waited for him with an arrogant expression .  the man smiled nervously .      can i help you  comrade .     his voice quivered slightly .      nkvd     ishihara said imperiously .     do you know the code name mc   .         mm  no  i don   t .     he shook his head tightly .     i really don   t .      ishihara described mc   .      yes  i remember seeing him .  he just joined us a few days ago .  a real little guy .     the man nodded vigorously .      have some people bring this man to me immediately .  do not let him escape .         yes  comrade .     the man hurried back down toward the ditch .   wayne  next to ishihara  let out a long breath .     is he going to help .         yes     said ishihara .  then his internal receiver picked up another alert on the nkvd radio band .  they had been spotted standing outside the car by a pair of agents who did not recognize them .  those agents were on their way for a closer look .      we must go     said ishihara  turning and looking into the distance .  in the middle of the line of trucks  he saw another nkvd car .  it was trying to get around the trucks in front of it  but the slope was too rough in that spot for it to pass them .     get in the car and start it .  wait for me .  now .      wayne hurried back to the car .   ishihara ran down the slope after the man he had just sent to find mc   .     comrade  wait .         huh .  what is it .         an emergency has arisen .  tell no one about this man called mc   .  i repeat   no one .         all right .         where does this work brigade spend the night .     ishihara asked quickly .   the man gave him an address .   ishihara ran back up to the driver   s side of the car .  taking the hint  wayne slid quickly over to the passenger side .  the driver of the other nkvd car honked his horn and waved for the trucks to move out of his way .  when the truck drivers could  they slowly worked their way to the side on the uneven terrain .      it may be a rough ride     said ishihara .     hang on .  i will search for a place where we can turn back toward moscow .     he took the car forward with a jerk .  some distance behind them  the other nkvd car still honked angrily at the trucks in its way .      what if they have us surrounded .     wayne asked frantically .     how do we know which way to go .         only one car has reported sighting us so far     said ishihara .     i do not believe they saw the license plate on this car .  they saw us standing outside the car and must have had our personal descriptions .      wayne nodded .   ishihara gripped the wheel hard and drove forward  glancing in the mirror .  the nkvd car had finally passed the trucks and was speeding toward them .           steve shoveled in silence for the rest of the afternoon .  he finally decided to call hunter again on the ride home  after they had entered moscow again .  even when the call was intercepted  as he was certain it would be  the movement of the truck through city streets would make locating the transmitter impossible .  the nkvd would not be able to focus on a single truck and then hassle the people in his work brigade again .  he would just have to be careful about exactly what he said .   the trucks came to pick them up when the sun was low in the west .  all the workers began climbing wearily out of the ditches and plodding toward the trucks .  steve glanced around for jane  then saw judy quickly working her way toward the neighboring work brigade .      come on .     steve grabbed jane   s arm and pulled her after him .  he tried to follow judy  but she had a substantial head start .  in the crowd of people moving toward the trucks  the only way he could catch her was to run and dart through the crowd  drawing everyone   s attention .      what   s she doing .     jane asked quietly  hurrying along next to him .     did she tell you .         no  but i   m sure she wants to ride back with the other brigade .         we   ll never catch her .  she   s already climbing into one of the trucks .     jane stopped .      i didn   t think they   d let her on the wrong truck     said steve  reluctantly pulling up  also .     she said everything was so well organized .         i guess she got herself lost in the crowd     said jane .     everybody   s exhausted  including the guys who watch over the work brigades .         at least she looks the part enough to do that     said steve  with a tired grin .     i couldn   t .         we better get on our own truck     said jane .     before it leaves without us .         come on .     steve glanced one more time at judy  who smiled at them from the back of the truck she had mounted .  he hoped she knew what she was doing .  they could not call each other without risking being overheard by locals .  at least for now  she was on her own .     hunter spent the day quietly in the prisoner pen .  very few people spoke and he did not initiate conversation with anyone .  they had been fed a tasteless gruel in the middle of the afternoon .  otherwise  the guards merely walked through the corridor on patrol once every hour .   as the hours passed  hunter considered his situation .  at first he expected that the nkvd would eventually take him out and question him further .  the additional contact would have brought him new data and allowed him to make more judgments about how to free himself .   however  that had not happened .  during the course of the day the nkvd had shown no interest in any of the prisoners .  now hunter had to consider that perhaps the agents planned no further contact with any of them for a substantial period of time .  theoretically  they might all be shipped to another prison without any more interrogations .   the first law pressed him internally to help these people .  all of them were probably headed for either torture here or a slow death in the siberian labor camps .  of course  his first law imperative not to change history took precedence .   however  the internal stress was building .  he remained in some danger of being neutralized by the conflict .  finally  of course  he was useless to his team while he simply sat in a cell .  late in the afternoon  he decided that he would have to take action to free himself .   the next time one of the guards came down the hall on his routine patrol  hunter walked over to the bars .  every other prisoner in the pen was watching to see what he would do .  no one spoke .      i have changed my mind     hunter said loudly to the guard .     tell the agents i have changed my mind .      he could hear disapproving murmurs from the crowd behind him .  the guard stopped  studying his face suspiciously .  then he came closer .      you changed your mind .     the guard folded his arms .     about what .         i would like to speak to the agents who arrested me     hunter said calmly .      oh  would you .     the guard smiled grimly .     and why would they like to speak with you .         i did not answer their questions previously .  i am willing to do so now .     hunter  of course  would have to improvise those answers .  right now  his focus was simply on getting out of this pen .      maybe you already had your chance .     the guard snickered .     why don   t i just let you rot right here .  or maybe i   ll just let you freeze .  where you   re going  that will be easy .     he laughed harshly .   hunter realized suddenly that the guard was angling for a bribe of some kind .  other prisoners might  from time to time  be able to arrange a bribe through family members or friends .  hunter did not have that choice .      the agents will be very grateful when they hear what i have to say     said hunter .     they will appreciate the guard who brought me to them .         yeah .  how do i know that .         i have information about the germans     said hunter .     if you do not report that i am willing to cooperate  then one of the guards on another shift will .  he will get the credit .  those agents will not like hearing that you delayed my information from reaching them .      the guard studied him without speaking .   hunter forced himself to smile .     maybe you will join me in here  comrade .         the germans     the guard said to himself  uncertainly .  he looked at hunter without speaking .      let him out     called one of the other prisoners .  he was followed by a few calls of agreement from others .   most of the prisoners remained absolutely silent .      well  why didn   t you say this was about the war .     the guard drew himself up .     of course i will speak to the agents for you .  this is a matter of patriotism .        ishihara drove as fast as he dared  using all of his faculties to escape the nkvd car behind them .  as they rode roughly over the open  frozen ground  ishihara scanned the terrain with magnified vision .  he picked out the smoothest pieces of ground  utilizing his precise eye hand coordination to steer so that the tires would get the best traction and the clearest path .  gradually  he began to circle back toward the road they had taken from moscow .   as ishihara drove  he watched the pursuit car in the rearview mirror as much as he could .  he observed that the human driver behind them was not handling the steering over open ground nearly as well .  the nkvd agent was not able to hit the quick turns  twists  and shifts of gears that ishihara could maintain .  as a result  the pursuit car bumped and bounced much more severely .  ishihara slowly gained ground  leaving the other car behind .   behind them  the sun was already down .  through the waning light  he could barely see the unpaved road which he and wayne had taken to reach the ditches .  some of the trucks carrying workers back to moscow were visible on it  the beams of their headlights marking its path .  ishihara headed for the road .   wayne turned to look over his shoulder at the car following them .     finally .  we   re leaving them behind now  aren   t we .  you see that .         yes .     suddenly ishihara picked up another communication from the car behind them to their colleagues .     they have realized it  too .         what .  what do you mean .         up to now  they had not called for help .         really .  why not .     wayne looked at him in surprise .     what   s going on now .         i believe they wanted to catch us and take all the credit for themselves .  however  they just radioed our position and direction for the first time to the nkvd at large .         oh  no .         do not panic .  the nearest nkvd cars which have responded are well behind us .  they were spread out along the length of the ditches and have not returned to moscow .         but moscow must have plenty more agents .  they   ll cut us off on our way back to the city .         they will try     ishihara said calmly .  he knew that wayne needed some reassurance .  since ishihara did not have any good news for him  he tried to convey confidence through a calm and reassuring demeanor .      but what are we going to do .     wayne asked frantically .     i mean  at some point we   ll have to jump in time again .  but i still hate to do that .         the trucks on the road haven   t answered by radio  i don   t think they have radios .  i think we should be able to reach the edge of moscow without being caught .  at that point  we have a chance to get lost in the city .         but the whole nkvd will be coming for us now  won   t they .     wayne looked behind him again .      yes  i expect so .  once we have eluded the immediate pursuit in moscow  we shall have to plan on abandoning the car out of sight and escaping on foot .         okay .     wayne looked at him for a moment  a little calmer now .     okay .  just tell me what to do .      ishihara decided not to tell wayne at this time that he was not sure what to do .  leaving the car somewhere in moscow was not enough .  to escape the current pursuit effectively  without moving through time again  they required a crowd of people in which to lose themselves and shelter for the night .   by the time ishihara reached the road  the nkvd car following them had fallen well behind .  its headlights bounced crazily in the darkness .  ahead of ishihara and wayne on the road  the trucks were roughly a half kilometer ahead .   ishihara drove in silence  gradually catching up to the ponderous trucks .  since the car pursuing them would soon reach this road  too  and speed up  he passed the first truck .  when he could  he passed the next one .  slowly and patiently  he moved to the front of the convoy and eventually faced an open road to moscow .   in the distance behind them  he soon saw the headlights of the pursuit car swinging around the trucks  also .  soon they were in a simple race on the frozen  unpaved highway .  ishihara drove as fast as the car would safely go  still using the edge that his robotic skills and reflexes gave him .  slowly  they simply pulled away from the car behind them .   when ishihara came to an intersecting road near the edge of moscow  he slammed on the brakes and took the turn sharply .  the tires squealed and wayne hooked one arm over the back of his seat to steady himself .      i apologize     said ishihara .     but from now on  we are in greater danger  as you mentioned earlier  of being surrounded by the nkvd .         we have to find a place to abandon the car     said wayne .     right .         perhaps not yet .  i have the address of the work brigade in which mc   was working .         what .  why didn   t you tell me .     wayne laughed suddenly  a little anxiously .      i was concerned about escaping the pursuit     said ishihara .     if we were caught  i did not want to harm you by adding additional disappointment .         that changes everything .  let   s just go get him   if more nkvd guys don   t find us first .         we are on our way now     said ishihara .     i am taking an evasive route .  now that we have the complex of city streets in which to lose ourselves  i believe we have a good chance of success .         what about their radio communication   are they going to surround us or something .         they are trying already     ishihara said calmly .     the pursuit car has continued to radio ahead for help .  however  as long as they use the radio to communicate and report their positions  i shall know where each of their cars is moving .      wayne nodded .     okay .  good .      ishihara chose not to worry him further by telling him just how close the pursuit had become .         hunter remained standing by the bars in the prison pen after the guard walked away .  he kept his back to his fellow prisoners  hoping to avoid a confrontation .  many of them were muttering angrily among themselves about his willingness to cooperate .   a very few defended his choice to reveal information about the german enemy .  he decided not to speak to any of them .  as always  he feared that unnecessary interaction might lead to events that would be historically significant .   while hunter waited for the guard to return and  he hoped  take him back upstairs  he also monitored the nkvd radio traffic .  he heard the alerts go out to locate the stolen nkvd car .  by now  the nkvd had confirmed to him that the stolen car was being driven by wayne and ishihara .   hunter also noticed that an alert had gone out for someone of mc     s description .  no word of his apprehension had been reported yet .  now hunter was more eager than ever to escape from nkvd custody .   finally the guard returned with a partner .  without a word  the guards unlocked the door and escorted hunter back upstairs to the same interrogation room in which he had been held earlier .  they seated him inside and looped handcuffs around a table leg before snapping them closed on his wrists .  then they left him alone again .   the room was reasonably warm  much more comfortable than the prison pen in the basement .  the steam radiator was a luxury not wasted downstairs .  its occasional hissing was the only sound in the room .   hunter felt more confident now  however .  no matter what happened in this room  he could arrange his own escape without revealing any robotic abilities to the prisoners downstairs .  getting away was now just a matter of time .   more than two hours passed uneventfully .  hunter heard occasional footsteps and voices down the hall and elsewhere in the building  but he overheard nothing pertinent to him .  as he continued to monitor the nkvd radio band  he followed the pursuit of the stolen car .  he compared the information from the radio communication among agents and their dispatcher to the map of moscow and outlying areas stored in his memory .  as the pursuit continued  he followed the movements of the pursuit cars .  he realized that wayne and ishihara were working their way back to the neighborhood where the public housing was concentrated .   abruptly  he received a direct call on another radio band .      steve calling hunter .  don   t respond .  just listen  okay .     steve   s voice on the other band was muffled  and nearly drowned out by the sound of rushing air and a loud  rumbling engine .     i hope you   re there .      hunter understood that steve was in a place where hunter   s voice might be overheard if it came over steve   s lapel pin .  from the background sounds  he surmised that the team was riding one of the big trucks on the way home with the work brigade .  instead of speaking  he transmitted a clear tapping sound in a repeating rhythm  one  two .  .  . one two three .  .  .  one  two .  .  . one two three .  .  .      i read  hunter .  jane and i are huddling down in one corner of a truck  pretending to talk to each other .  look   judy took off in one of the other trucks .  she   s chasing mc    but we   ve already lost sight of her truck in the dark .      again  hunter acknowledged his receipt of the message by transmitting the rhythmic tapping .      if there   s any way you can meet us back at the warehouse tonight  we need you .  and we   ve all seen mc    so we have a shot at getting him .  i   m shutting off again .  steve out .      hunter felt a renewed urgency .  his team was on the verge of finding mc    but wayne and ishihara were also drawing near .  in their most recent mission  back to germany in roman times  they had taken the component robot into custody and back to their own time only moments before wayne nystrom would have caught him  instead .   the voices he could hear down the hall began diminishing .  most of the people left the building  while a few new ones entered .  the night staff  much smaller than the day staff  had started its shift .   shortly after that  hunter heard two sets of deliberate footsteps enter the front door and come down the hall .  the door to the room opened and agents raskov and konev entered .  both their faces were red from the cold  they still wore their overcoats and fur hats .      this had better be very important     said agent konev .     it had better be more important than what we were doing when we were ordered back here .         it is very important     hunter said politely .  he waited for them to sit down .      you have further information about the germans .     agent raskov demanded .  he pulled off his hat and unbuttoned his coat .     do not waste our time .  what is it .      hunter watched him for a moment without speaking .     it is warm in this room  is it not .  perhaps you would like to be comfortable .      agent konev scowled but pulled off his hat and tossed it onto the table .  then he unbuttoned his coat and hung it on the back of a chair .  light from the one lamp reflected off the handcuffs hanging from his belt .   hunter carefully calculated the moves he could make to escape .  of course  he could not actually harm any humans or clearly display any robotic abilities .  however  he could use any ability that he could hide .      what do you have to say .     agent konev glared impatiently at him .      i apologize for the inconvenience     said hunter .  at the same time  under the table  he quietly pulled one of the links loose between his cuffed wrists .  when it had opened wide enough  he unlinked the chain between the two cuffs .      get to the point     ordered agent raskov .   without a word  hunter stood up  in the same motion turning over the table toward the two men .  agent konev was on his left  and as the table fell over on its side and forced the two agents to jump backward  hunter reached over and yanked the handcuffs from agent konev   s belt .      hey .     agent raskov stuck one hand inside his coat  still backing away .   hunter could not risk getting shot  which might reveal some evidence of his robotic insides .  he quickly jumped toward agent raskov and ripped the gun out of his hand .  hunter surreptitiously used his strength to bend the trigger sideways slightly  so it could not be pulled .  then he dropped it on the floor .   agent konev was reaching for his own handgun .  hunter shoved his partner hard against him  causing them to fall to the floor next to the radiator .  the motion threw agent konev   s gun hand off to one side .  hunter also snatched his gun away and bent the trigger in the same manner .   before the two men could get up  hunter snapped agent konev   s handcuffs on them  looped around one leg of the radiator .  while they pulled and scuffled  not yet realizing what had happened  he searched their pockets for their keys .  when he found their handcuff keys  he bent them  too .   hunter heard footsteps running down the hall toward him  probably in response to the noise of the fight .  he stepped to one side of the door and waited for only a few seconds .  the door was flung open and two more agents ran inside  past him .   hunter shoved them both from behind  using their own momentum .  they both stumbled against the overturned table .  hunter slipped out the door and ran up the hallway .   a man at the reception desk leaped to his feet when hunter came into view  but then halted at the sight of him .  hunter threw open the front door and found himself outside on the cold  dark street .  he no longer had his winter coat  but for now  he had enough stored energy to function even in this temperature .  without stopping  he turned and began jogging in an evasive pattern  around the corners of buildings and through alleys .     steve and jane arrived back at the warehouse without any further discussion of their situation .  he was worried about judy but could not see anything to do at the moment .  once they got off the truck  however  jane leaned over to him .      maybe we can find out where that other work brigade went .         yeah .  how .         i could ask around our own brigade .  somebody will know .         let   s wait for hunter .  i don   t want to attract any special attention to us with a question like that .       jane nodded .   by now  they were accustomed to the routine .  they joined everyone else in line for the customarily bland dinner .  then they returned to their private corner to eat it .   steve looked up from his bowl  feeling a little defensive .     it   s tough just waiting  isn   t it .  i feel like we should be doing something .  but right now  waiting for hunter to rejoin us really is a good idea  i think .      jane grinned .     you know  you   re getting more levelheaded and responsible all the time .         who  me .     he smiled wryly .     too much time with you and hunter  i guess .      she laughed lightly and nudged him with her elbow  almost spilling the contents of her bowl .   steve returned his attention to his own meager dinner .  he really liked jane and in moments like this he wished they could talk leisurely  without the danger of discovery that surrounded them and the urgency of completing the mission safely .  then  as always  his earlier doubts recurred .  their rapport was based on the dangers around them  not on any ordinary friendship .   after dinner  the exhausted work brigade members settled in for the night .  some were still talking quietly among themselves about the anticipated german attack .  steve sat against the cold wall  anxiously waiting for hunter .   finally he heard a knock at the front door .  steve and jane both watched as the guards spoke to the visitor .  when they backed up and let him in  steve straightened in surprise .   hunter had kept his body unchanged  but his face was longer and narrower than before .  even at his height  no one who had seen his face before would believe this was the same person .  most importantly  he plodded wearily  as though he had just finished a long day of physical labor .  he worked his way down the wall toward steve and jane .      i   m sure glad to see you     steve said with a smile .     i would have thought you   d make yourself shorter  though .      jane was looking at hunter carefully .     hunter  are you okay .         i am extremely low on energy     said hunter .     i did not receive any sunlight from which to recharge my solar cells today .  i have been using my stored energy through all of last night  during the day  and now tonight .         wait a minute     said jane .     you can store immense amounts of energy .  what happened .         you are correct .  until i escaped the nkvd a short time ago  i was using very little energy and still had much to spare .  however  i left without my winter coat and had to flee through the city without any insulation .  further  i am conserving my energy for the remainder of the night because i feel we should leave here immediately and make our way somehow to mc   .  at dawn  of course  i will begin to recharge .         we don   t know exactly where to find mc       said steve .     or judy .         we can ask someone     jane added .      no need     said hunter .     judy called me and told me where she is .  but mc   is not there .         what .     jane asked .     what happened .         mc   never got on the trucks to return to the city .  he slipped out of the crowd and disappeared .  she saw him heading westward across the steppe  but it was too late for her to get off the truck .  she rode back to the school used by that particular work brigade for shelter .         so we should start by joining up again     said steve .     or do you want to have us spend the night where we are and start again tomorrow .         no  i do not dare risk that now     said hunter .     judy does not have your experience with living in other times .  also  we now know something about mc     s location and direction .  last  i fear that the nkvd may yet come back here searching for me again .  they might take you two for questioning this time .         then let   s get out of here     said jane .     how should we do it this time .         the lights will be turned off in a few minutes     said hunter .     we can afford to wait that long .  i suggest we leave the same way as last time  from that other warehouse .     he nodded toward the rear door  then toward the circuit breaker box .     this establishment has the same basic design as our previous residence .         good idea .     steve glanced around .     i guess it will work again .  but i hope we don   t need another shelter .  if we keep sneaking out of every place we can spend the night  then pretty soon we   ll use up all the public housing .      as hunter had said  the overhead lights were turned out shortly  leaving only a small table lamp burning in the front .  steve and jane worked their way across the crowded room and flipped the circuit breaker  while hunter opened the rear door in the sudden darkness and held it .  the procedure worked just as well this time as it had before .  in a few moments  the team again ran up a back alley out in the cold  clear  night air .   when they were sure no one was chasing them  hunter stopped to allow his team members to put their coats on and catch their breath .      are you both all right .     hunter asked .  his appearance had now returned to normal .      yeah     said jane  as she buttoned her coat .     wow  it   s cold out here .         i   m fine     said steve .     which way do we go .         please simply follow me .  it will be faster and quieter than explaining .      hunter led them at a brisk walk through the darkened city .  he kept to alleys and side streets as much as possible  ducking into shadows on the rare moments when vehicles appeared nearby .  when they reached the school judy had told him about  hunter knocked on the door .   a tall  stocky man opened the door and looked at hunter coldly .     we are full  comrade .  sorry .     he started to close the door .      we are not seeking shelter .     hunter grabbed the edge of the door in one hand and held it fast .  his tone was firm and authoritative .     please tell judy taub to come to the door .      the guard made one more attempt to jerk the door shut .  his eyes shifted to hunter in surprise when he realized that he could not move it even slightly .  he turned and called judy   s name over his shoulder .   judy  with a big smile of relief  was already hurrying to the door .      we shall relieve you of your overcrowding     hunter said  as judy slipped out past the guard .     thank you .      the guard slammed the door loudly .           hunter led his team away from the door  then he turned to judy .      you are well .     hunter asked .     sure  i   m fine .         good .  since you radioed me  have you gained any additional information about mc   .         no .         from what you said  it appears that mc   is heading for the german lines .  do you agree .         well  i don   t know     said judy .     i saw him running straight west across the steppe  but that doesn   t mean he didn   t double back later .      hunter turned to jane .     as our roboticist  what do you think .         judy  was he running away from you personally .     jane asked .      no .  he couldn   t have been .  i didn   t reveal myself in any way as someone from our time .  actually  i never even got very close to him .         then i think he must be leaving the soviet lines for reasons of his own     said jane .     some new interpretation of one of the laws of robotics must have dictated his actions .  otherwise  the third law would force him to take care of himself with shelter  which the work brigade offered .         so something unknown caused him to leave the work brigade for the german lines     said hunter .      yes  that   s my best guess .         i agree     said hunter .     he may have learned that radio transmission was in use here .  if so  he may have monitored the same nkvd radio traffic that i heard .  it has told him that he is being sought  though he cannot possibly know why .         he will find all sorts of humans in the german lines to save from harm if he can     said judy .     behind the lines  the nazis have prisoners of war and political prisoners they have gathered during their campaign .         the first law could keep him busy there  then     said jane .     hunter  what are we going to do .  he could start interfering with history as soon as he reaches those prisoners .         those lines are a long way from here  aren   t they .     steve asked .     and he   s on foot .         yes     said judy .      a robot of his type can walk that distance in a night without stopping  though     said jane .     he would be very low on energy by the time he arrived  but he can count on the sun to recharge him at dawn .         so  without a vehicle of some kind  we don   t have a chance of catching him     said steve .     he had a head start out at the ditches and now he   s been hiking for a couple of hours already .         i dare not steal a vehicle  as wayne and ishihara did     said hunter .     i fear it could cause a significant disruption in events .         well  we have one more problem now     said judy .     if my memory serves  the soviet counterattack will begin at dawn .  anything we do now will happen during actual battle conditions .         i see     hunter said stiffly .     that eliminates any choice of crossing the neutral zone between the armies .  i cannot risk that much harm to you .         you have a plan .     steve asked .      once again  i must make a concession i do not like     said hunter .     we shall have to return to our own time and then come back to this time  but behind the german lines .  please stand close to me .  steve  please give me the belt unit .      as his team members crowded around him  steve pulled the unit out of his shirt and offered it .  hunter glanced around to make sure that no local people could see them .  then he triggered the unit .     wayne finally began to relax as ishihara drove through the smallest back streets in moscow to reach their destination .  for the first time  they had a real lead on mc   .  then  without speaking  ishihara slowed down and stopped the car by the curb .      something wrong .     wayne felt a sinking sensation .      yes     said ishihara .     a new report has just gone out on the nkvd band .         what did it say .         mc   is not at the location where his work brigade is spending the night .  some other agents who interrogated people in the work brigades got a lead on mc   by using his description  at about the time the brigades got on the trucks to go home .  the agents figured out which work brigade he had worked in and reached them ahead of us .  i fear that our need to take evasive measures delayed our arrival until it was too late .         what happened to him .         they do not know for sure .  those agents questioned people in the work brigade and reported that mc   never got on the truck back at the antitank ditch .  they think he may be hiding out in the ditch tonight .      wayne thought a moment .     just spending the night there .  that doesn   t make sense .  they   ll all be back tomorrow .         of course  they believe he is limited by human abilities .         so we came all the way back to moscow for no reason .  he stayed out there all along .         do not forget that the nkvd spotted us out there .  we had to make this run back into moscow in order to lose the pursuit .  it was not wasted time .         well   all right .         i think mc   is probably now fleeing back across the neutral territory to the german lines .  they know no human would attempt that on foot .         yeah .  he has to flee the entire soviet  held territory now .  and that means we can still get him first .  even the nkvd won   t go all the way to the german lines .  let   s go .         we can attempt it     ishihara said calmly .     i must warn you that we have only a quarter tank of gasoline left .  we have no money with which to acquire more and attempting to get some by stealth would probably also bring renewed pursuit .         well .  .  . how far can this thing go on a quarter tank .         from our driving so far  i estimate that we might reach the german lines .  i am certain that we would get within walking distance .         i want to go after mc   now  while we have a chance to snatch him out in open territory .  will the first law let you try it .         yes     said ishihara .     the germans were not exactly happy with us  but they will certainly be more hospitable than the soviets .         then let   s go .      ishihara drove away from the curb .      we can pick up his trail back at the ditch     said wayne .      our first problem is getting around the antitank ditches     said ishihara .     those ditches are too deep and steeply dug for this car to cross .  there are no bridges or causeways across them  that would defeat their purpose .  we shall have to go around one end .  then we can search for mc     s trail .      wayne nodded .      the greatest gasoline expenditure will be another evasive pattern through the city to escape the nkvd   s notice .  once we are past the ditches  i can slow down to conserve gasoline usage and still maintain greater speed than mc   has even at his fastest .      wayne said nothing .  his earlier elation had been dampened by the need to reverse direction  but the news was not really that bad .  in fact  if they could find mc   out on the open steppe with fuel in the car  then chasing him down and grabbing him would be even easier than apprehending him in the middle of a work brigade .   as before  ishihara took them safely out of moscow by a long  involved route with many turns .  they reached the same unpaved road that they had taken to the ditches earlier .  at first  wayne did not see any other headlights as they left moscow behind .  after a while  however  he saw ishihara glance into the rearview mirror .      trouble .     wayne looked over his shoulder and saw headlights far behind them  but on the same road .      yes  but they are not aware of it yet .         huh .  what does that mean .      ishihara reached out and switched on the car   s communication system .   wayne heard static crackling first  followed by a man   s voice speaking a couple of russian phrases .  the man waited  then spoke again .  wayne could not understand the words  but he could tell that the speaker was repeating the same phrases again .      i first heard him over a minute ago on my internal receiver     said ishihara .      what   s he saying .         he is just trying to get me to respond .  it is merely a standard nkvd opening  i have learned that they all use it .  he must have recognized this car as an nkvd vehicle  but is too far back to see our license plate .  for this reason  he has not yet realized that we are in the fugitive nkvd car .  he and his partner are almost certainly going to look for mc   at the ditches and he simply assumes that we are doing the same .      wayne grinned .     well  we are .         true .  however  i dare not respond .  instead of confirming to him that we are the fugitives  i shall wait for him to figure it out .     ishihara turned off the car speaker again .      what are we going to do about them .         i shall just keep driving .  we have a good lead .  once we find a way around the ditch  we shall take off west across the open steppe .         okay .     wayne looked back again .  the other car seemed to be just a little closer .     steve felt the same familiar time shift as before .  the team suddenly found itself jammed together in the dark  curved bottom of the sphere they used to travel in time .  it opened and he could see hunter climbing out .      please remain where you are     said hunter .     i shall program the console and rejoin you immediately .         hold it  hunter     said steve .     there   s no need to hurry right back  is there .  i mean  we can go back to whatever moment we want whether we leave now or in a couple of hours  right .         yes .  why .         well  look .  we   re all tired and we could use some good food for a change .  you   re low on energy  and ought to recharge .  then we can return to the german lines in the morning  with our sleep schedule matching their time zone .         sounds great to me     said judy .     especially about getting a really nice dinner .  something with dessert .         yeah  hunter     said jane .     we can split up for now and come back fresh .         i agree that we should take some time here     said hunter  as he helped judy get out of the sphere .     however  i do not want us to leave the institute .  i am concerned that unexpected distractions and unpredictable problems might arise .      steve jumped out and unbuttoned his coat .     you want us to sleep here .  we can do that .  what about food .         i can help  of course .     r .  daladier  the security robot who had been left here originally  was still standing motionless by the door that opened onto the hall .      i will arrange for daladier to bring whatever food or personal items you wish from anywhere in mojave center     said hunter .     steve  after dinner  i suggest you sleep on the couch here .  i shall help judy and jane find another room with couches elsewhere in the building .         sounds okay to me     said jane  shrugging .     go ahead and plug into the building   s power system to recharge  hunter .         i shall do so     said hunter .     it will not take long .  then i shall arrange different costumes for all of us .  we should not wear soviet clothes to visit the germans .         now  then     said steve .     what are the choices for dinner .        wayne stared forward into darkness as ishihara drove over rough  frozen ground at the southern end of the antitank ditches .  from now on  wayne knew  they had no road to follow .  the car bounced hard  jarring him  and he grabbed the back of his seat to steady himself .      are they turning back .     wayne asked .      see for yourself     said ishihara .   wayne looked back .  now four sets of headlights were following them .  the nkvd car that ishihara had refused to answer over the radio had obviously figured out that they were the fugitives .  other cars had been called and they had converged on the trail .   the chase continued over the open steppe .  the car bounced and veered hard  at times ishihara had to slow down to keep control .   after a while  wayne looked back again .  the pursuers were slowly gaining .  their headlights  too  jumped and jerked in the darkness .      why aren   t we gaining .  when you drove over open ground last time  you left them behind .         this car has sustained damage from the hard use we have given it .  i have to drive more slowly now or else it may not last for the entire distance .  the cars behind us have apparently not suffered as much .  however  their gain on us has been very gradual .         well .  .  . how far do we have to go .         we have covered seven of the approximately eighteen kilometers to the german lines .         how about this   radio forward to the germans .  they still believe we   re german spies  so they should help .  what do you think .  we can tell them that we   re bringing back important information .         we have none .         i know  but .  .  . it might help .  we   ll think of something when the time comes .         we still cannot risk precipitating a battle .         that isn   t the soviet military behind us  it   s a bunch of civilian cars .  and german patrols must be out this way already .         i agree .  i shall call .      wayne watched him in silence for several minutes .      i have made contact     ishihara said finally .     i explained our dilemma and approximate position to the german radio operator who responded .  i also told him we have spoken with major bach  whose name may help us .         you told him we have critical military information about the soviets  right .  what did he say .         yes  i told him .  i have been instructed to stand by .      wayne looked back again .  the headlights behind them looked a little bigger than before .     do you think we   re going to make it .         i do not know .  as i said before  the first law will require me to take you to another time and place before i allow you to be taken by the nkvd .         i don   t want them to get me  either .  but maybe we could just jump forward a few hours .  and behind german lines .  not so far into the future that hunter will grab mc   in the meantime .         it is possible  but we would again have much explaining to do .  they would want to know how we got back there  especially without their sentries noticing .  we shall have a considerable challenge already in giving them any information about the soviet military important enough to impress them but unimportant enough so that it will not alter the course of history .         yeah .  just don   t make any move unless we just can   t get away from the nkvd any other way .         i agree .  further  i have good news .  the german operator has just radioed back .  he called the german patrol on duty in this sector .  an armored car is coming out to meet us .         great .     wayne glanced again at the headlights behind them .  they were closer than ever .     i hope they get here in time .         i suspect that only our claim to have military information has caused anyone to go to this much effort for us .         yeah  well  whatever it takes .     wayne grinned .      i fear your history is poor .  you do not realize just how horrible the nazi regime was .  we run the risk of angering them .            the race across the frozen neutral zone continued .  wayne turned in his seat and watched in horrified fascination as the four nkvd cars behind them narrowed the gap .  slowly  but inexorably  their headlights grew larger .  soon they had closed within three or four car lengths .  then they began to spread out .      ishihara   they   re surrounding us .  they   re going to close in .         i see     said ishihara .     however  look forward again .      wayne swiveled .  he saw two tiny lights ahead in the distance  bounding over the horizon .     ishihara .  is that the german patrol .         yes .  i have just made contact .  it is leutnant mohr   s patrol again .         how close are we to the other side .         not very .  i estimate we are near the twelvekilometer mark of the total eighteen .      suddenly a loud  staccato popping sounded in the distance .      hey   are they shooting at us .     wayne slid down in his seat .     what   s wrong with them .         leutnant mohr has ordered his machine gun to be fired high over all of us     said ishihara .     i acknowledged this without objection .  it is merely a warning .         yeah .     staying low  wayne turned again to look at the pursuit .  all four cars were veering away from them in sudden turns .     hey  that   s great .  they aren   t going to challenge outright military power  are they .         no .      wayne grinned .     wow .  that was close .         yes .  it was .  now we shall follow the patrol back to german lines .         do we have enough fuel .         i believe so .  just barely .      wayne sat up  weak with the sudden release of tension .  he could see the armored car waiting for them up ahead .  as they drew near  it turned and led them back to the west .   after that excitement  wayne felt profound relief .  the remaining six kilometers or so seemed very short now that no one was chasing them .  finally  the armored car led them back through the front lines to a place among the tents .   ishihara stopped behind the armored car .  as the soldiers jumped out of the back  wayne and ishihara got out of the car .  leutnant mohr hurried to meet them  the fur cloak swirling about him in the wind as he spoke quickly in german to ishihara .   wayne waited while they spoke .  the soldiers in the patrol were attentive  but not hostile .  when leutnant mohr gestured to a small command tent  ishihara nodded and turned to wayne .      he wants to talk to us himself .  i think he is worried about getting into trouble for coming to get us .      wayne nodded and followed ishihara into the tent while the rest of the patrol remained outside .  inside  a soldier sat at a small wooden table in front of a large metal box .  only the antenna told wayne that it was their crude field radio  the rest of the unit was unrecognizable to him .  the tent was a rather meager communications center .   he watched leutnant mohr and ishihara speak in german .  as the discussion progressed  leutnant mohr became more agitated .  ishihara kept talking  calmly but quickly .  suddenly leutnant mohr shouted and the soldiers in his patrol swarmed into the tent to surround ishihara and wayne at gunpoint .   leutnant mohr gave one more command and the patrol marched out their new prisoners .   wayne was mystified .  ishihara did not speak  however .  they were herded onto the back of the armored car again .  this time  the patrol drove them through the lines of gaunt  hollow eyed soldiers huddling together to the rear .  there  they were ordered into a makeshift holding pen .   the pen offered no shelter  being merely a circle of open steppe surrounded by barbed wire guarded by sentries .  a crowd of bearded men in ragged and dirty soviet military uniforms lay huddled on the ground  their only protection from the winter wind coming from each other   s bodies .  after leutnant mohr   s men had marched back to their armored car  ishihara squatted and spoke quietly in russian for a moment to another prisoner .  the other man responded briefly and ishihara stood up again .   wayne followed ishihara a short distance away so they could speak english without being overheard .      what happened with leutnant mohr .     wayne asked .      i told leutnant mohr about the placement of the antitank ditches .  i also told him about the width of the neutral zone between the armies and roughly where i believe the red army is placed .  i felt i could risk telling him that much  because it will not change the coming battle .  unfortunately  the leutnant knows that this is worthless information .         and he got mad .         leutnant mohr feels that we tricked him  which  of course  is actually true .  now the leutnant has to save himself from major bach   s anger .  i think he is hoping that treating us as prisoners will look good to his superior .      wayne glanced at the cold  spiritless men in the pen with them .     i would have thought the germans would have more prisoners than this .         the man i spoke to here told me that this is just a holding pen for paws .  the vast majority of prisoners have already been marched far to the rear .  this pen simply holds those who have been captured since the others left .  apparently  the germans have a bunch of these small pens up and down the rear of their lines .      wayne nodded .     leutnant mohr overreacted .  don   t you think major bach will let us out again .         predicting is difficult .  leutnant mohr is protecting himself when in doubt .         well .  .  . he didn   t take my fur cloak away .  last time we saw him  he wanted it .         maybe he is simply distracted by larger issues at the moment .  i suggest that the time has come to go to another time and place .  we could give up on mc   and attempt to apprehend one of the other component robots .         no  not yet .  we can always go at the last minute   on the point of death .         i cannot allow the risk of harm to come that close to you .         we haven   t reached that point yet .  look  you know i haven   t done very well .  i only need to get my hands on one of the component robots   but i   m desperate for one .  i don   t dare give up this easily .         all right .  until more immediate danger threatens  the second law still applies .      wayne nodded  tightening his fur cloak around him .     it   s going to be a long  cold night out here .        steve found breakfast waiting when hunter woke him .  the team ate  showered down the hall  and dressed in the new costumes hunter had waiting .  these clothes looked similar to the previous ones to steve  but hunter assured him that the differences in style would be noticeable to the germans .  then they gathered in room f     wearing new overcoats in anticipation of returning to the russian winter .      i see we   re all ready     said judy .     any final briefing  hunter .         only that we shall go back to the area behind german lines  at dawn the morning after we left .         i was thinking about that     said steve .     can   t you calculate where mc   would be earlier in the night  while he   s crossing the neutral zone alone .  we could trap him out on the open steppe  without any local witnesses .         i considered it     said hunter .     that move sounds easy but it would actually be difficult .  for instance  we cannot afford to go back at a time when we were already there  appearing there twice at the same time would risk time paradoxes that could bring about incalculable problems .         your internal clock will tell you exactly when we left     said jane .     you can take us back an hour later .  mc   would still be out in the middle of nowhere .         i have no way to predict his precise route .  he will probably take some evasive measures  and may alter his path even more as he draws close enough to see or hear soldiers on the german lines .  remember  he cannot just walk up to them without violating the third law by getting shot .  so as he sneaks up on the germans  his moves become unpredictable .         you could still make an educated guess     said steve .     i like the idea of nabbing him all alone out in the open .         if i fail to take us within sight of him  we will have accomplished nothing     said hunter .     we could not risk following him to the german lines .         i   m with hunter     said judy .     we   re going back to december         .  the soviet army moves on the germans at dawn .  if we   re standing between the two armies when it does  we   re in big trouble .         we would have to come back here again     said hunter .     and go to the german rear anyway .         okay     said steve .     i   m convinced .      jane nodded .      then we shall go directly to the rear of the german lines     said hunter .     i shall set the console .      steve helped jane and judy climb into the sphere and then followed them .  as always  hunter joined them last and closed it .  steve only hoped they could avoid the dangers of combat once the battle began .     as soon as the team arrived safely on the cold ground  hunter stood up and looked west in the pale early light .  he could not see any sign of the german lines  but when he raised his aural sensitivity  he heard the sounds of vehicles  voices  and marching feet .  then a series of thunderous booms reached them .      soviet artillery     said judy .     the germans will be moving quickly to prepare for the soviet advance .         i do not want to waste any time     said hunter .     i shall radio in german for help .      hunter sent out a call in german  identifying himself as a swiss national whose team was involved with german intelligence .  after a brief delay  the radio operator responded that a german patrol would be sent to pick them up .  hunter gave his location as well as he could and signed off .   soon hunter could hear the roar of a loud  powerful engine coming toward them .      i believe the patrol is on the way     said hunter .      probably an armored car     said judy .     carrying troops in the back .         yes     hunter said  magnifying his vision and focusing on a speck that had just come over the horizon .     i see it now .      the armored car rumbled over the rough ground as the sound of artillery grew more intense .  as soon as it pulled up in front of the team  the soldiers in the back leaped to the ground and fanned out around them  leveling their weapons .  one young officer stepped out of the passenger side of the car .      hands up .  now .     he was excited  his voice tense .     who is in charge here .      hunter raised his hands and saw that his team also complied .     i am     he said in german as fluent as the officer   s .     this man is japanese  the rest of us are swiss .  we are no threat to you .         frisk them .     the officer pointed to two of his men .   as they slung their rifles over their shoulders and trotted forward  hunter looked at the officer in surprise .     who are you .  what is wrong .         i am leutnant mohr .     he walked up in front of hunter  studying him carefully as artillery pounded even faster  shaking the ground .     what is your business with german intelligence .         we are on the trail of an enemy agent .  we believe he may have infiltrated german lines here .         what does he look like .      hunter described mc   .  he was startled to see leutnant mohr   s face tighten suspiciously .  one of the soldiers frisked hunter and then stepped back .      they are not armed     he said .      take them into the back     said leutnant mohr .  he turned and walked back to the cab of the armored car .   the other soldiers kept the team covered and herded them into the back .  in a few minutes  the armored car was bouncing in a tight circle to return to the lines .  no one spoke .   puzzled  hunter kept careful watch on all the soldiers .  a couple of them held their rifles on their prisoners  but the rest had turned their attention to the booming artillery ahead .  since the shells were not landing nearby  hunter did not feel that his team members were in immediate danger  but he had to be ready to move if any of the soldiers became more belligerent   and if the shells landed closer .   hunter had certainly not expected their welcome to be so hostile .  at the very least  he had expected his story to be plausible enough to receive some consideration .  when hunter had first heard the tension in leutnant mohr   s voice  he had guessed that the artillery barrage and the coming battle were the reason .  then he had seen leutnant mohr   s sudden reaction to mc     s description .  it obviously meant something to him  but hunter did not know what .  all he could do now was wait and look for an opportunity to find out .   hunter   s sensitized hearing brought him more complex sounds of battle every minute .  the steady rumble of thousands of tanks now mixed with the heavy pounding of artillery .  over the german radio band  men were shouting orders all along the lines .   hunter did not take his eyes off the soldiers around him and his team  even when the armored car pulled up to a large barbed wire pen .  the soldiers opened the back and jumped out  gesturing for the team to follow .  then the soldiers hustled them through the gate and left them inside the pen .  a few men inside glanced at them  but most gazed to the east  where billows of gray smoke rose over the battlefield .         steve stumbled into the pen  repeatedly shoved from behind by one of the soldiers .  as soon as they had locked the gate behind him  however  he saw that the team was together and unhurt .  right now that was good enough .      hey  hunter     said steve .     look at the crowd in here .  maybe mc   is in here someplace .  what if they grabbed him when he showed up and just threw him in .         just as they did with us     said judy .     that   s a good possibility .  we should look .         i am looking     said hunter .     however  the crowd is dense .  everyone is standing together .  i cannot see most people well enough to recognize them .     he turned to his team members .     we can move into the crowd in a moment .  first i want to say this .  i fear we may have to return again to our own time .  if the artillery shelling comes near this area  i shall have no choice .  so we must remain close together .         maybe we really messed up     said judy .     a big battle in the industrial age is no time to look for mc   .  i thought we   d be talking to some officers  not just locked up and abandoned .         me  too     said jane .     hunter  do you want to go right back and pick another time .  in all this confusion  i doubt anybody would notice if we just vanished again .         i agree with you about that     said hunter .     that gives us slightly greater flexibility .  we can afford to wait a little longer before giving up .         you mean you want to stay longer .     steve was startled .     why .         the continuing danger is that wayne nystrom will beat us to mc    even in the midst of the battle .  however  my greatest fear is that mc   will be hit by gunfire or something worse  damaging him to the point of being unrecognizable .  that will make locating him very difficult   perhaps impossible .  coming back after the battle could be useless  and we would never be able to reassemble mojave center governor .         i don   t see what we can do here     said judy .     and if mc   gets blown into junk  then he won   t change history .         you forgot about that nuclear explosion     said steve .     even if he   s in two thousand pieces that just lie around under the soil undisturbed until our time  we know his remains explode when the time comes .         oh   yeah .     judy nodded tightly .   hunter turned to her .     what happens here today .         let me think .  the germans are on the defensive .  they   re about to experience their first defeat on the russian front .  during the next six weeks  they   ll be driven back until they can stabilize the line in mid january .     she shook her head .      what   s wrong .     hunter asked .      today in particular  i just don   t remember much detail .  the germans obviously get the worst of it .     she hesitated .     half a million prisoners in their control  like these right here  will die in the first three months of winter from exposure .      steve could hear the sounds of artillery and tanks drawing closer .  the weapons of this time required that the battle would be fought at a fairly close distance .  the ground shook with the thundering of artillery .      let   s walk up and join the group     said hunter .     if we   re lucky  mc   is right here .      the other prisoners had little interest in them  as they continued to watch the smoke rising in the distance .  the team slowly merged into the crowd .  hunter  because of his height  could see much more clearly than his team members .  when steve saw motion off to one side of the pen  outside the barbed wire  he turned to look .   a troop of german infantry was marching a long line of other prisoners past the pen  away from the front lines .  as the filthy  ragged prisoners streamed past  a german officer stopped at the gate to their pen .  the guards nodded and opened the gate .      hunter     steve said quickly  tapping him on the arm .     look .      hunter turned .  at the same time  one of the guards blew a whistle and began waving for everyone to come out .  another guard began barking orders .      judy  what are they doing .     hunter asked .     where are they taking all these people .         all the pows are being marched to the rear right away  so they can   t be a threat of any kind in the day   s operations .  these guys were probably held in other pens similar to this one .      steve watched everyone .  the crowd of prisoners around them was already moving toward the gate .  since the marching prisoners were being taken west  away from the growing battle  none of the prisoners in the pen hesitated .      we shall go with them     said hunter .     long enough to find out if mc   is here somewhere  or in that other group .  if we see no sign of him  we can return to our time and plan again .  at least we are leaving the combat behind .      steve nodded .  he waited patiently as the crowd shuffled forward  slowed by the bottleneck at the gate .  again  hunter led the way and steve brought up the rear .   at the gate  some prisoners had been pulled out of the line by men in different uniforms .  these prisoners were standing at gunpoint just to one side of the gate .  hunter passed out of the gate  as did jane .  then one of the guards grabbed judy   s arm and jerked her aside  out of the line .   before steve could respond  another guard leveled his rifle at steve and sharply moved the point toward judy .  suddenly moving very cautiously  steve stepped over to her .   hunter turned and saw them from outside the barbed wire .      hey .  what are you doing with them .     hunter demanded .   one of the guards slammed the butt of his rifle into hunter   s abdomen .  the big robot  unhurt  bent forward slightly at the impact  pretending to react .     why are you keeping them .         they   re going to execute us     judy shouted through the wires .      shut up  jewish pig     said one of the men  spitting on her .     all you subhumans will be eliminated before we go .      steve slammed into him  knocking him off balance .     judy  run .  get outside the gate .     he pushed her forward .  hunter could not take the team back while local people stood among them  within the range of the sphere  or else he would take them  too .   suddenly  in the line of prisoners marching behind hunter to the west  steve saw mc    his head down like the others .  steve pointed .     hunter .  there he is .     he started to yell mc     s name  then realized that it would alert the component robot to the pursuit .  so far  in the noise and confusion all around  mc   had not realized anyone was concerned with him .   something hard slammed into the back of steve   s head and his legs crumpled  dropping him to the frozen ground with a thump .  for a moment  he was dazed .  he heard shouts and felt the pounding of feet on the ground around him  but could not think clearly .     wayne and ishihara had both seen leutnant mohr   s armored car pull up to the gate .  wayne had hoped the leutnant was coming back for them .  when wayne had seen hunter and his team  of course  he and ishihara had hidden in the crowd of prisoners .  they stayed behind hunter as the prisoners moved toward the gate of the pen .   now  however  they had both been herded close to the gate with everyone else .  ahead of him  ishihara had almost reached the opening .  wayne remained caught behind the bottleneck  near steve and judy and the guards holding them .  then wayne heard steve shout and point to mc    who was about to march right in front of the gate among the troop of prisoners .   wayne felt a rush of excitement .  he  too  pointed to mc   .     ishihara  grab him .      ishihara was still trapped in the crowd  however .  as they shuffled forward with everyone else  wayne heard a uniformed man tell the woman whom steve had called judy that he was going to kill her  steve  and the others who had been taken aside .  then the man spat on her .   wayne was shocked .  somehow  until this moment  the people around them had been sort of abstract  unreal .  he knew that the combat and stress of war was horrible  but he had not expected to see prisoners simply executed out of hand like this .  for the first time  he realized how ignorant he was of this time and these people .   hunter had moved just outside the gate and beyond the barbed wire  but he responded instantly .  flinging aside one startled german guard  he plunged directly into the barbed wire  stretching it forward with his weight  ignoring how it tore into his clothes .  he reached through the wires for judy and steve  but two more guards threw themselves on him  forcing him to turn and fight them off .   in the same instant  ishihara pushed people away from him just inside the barbed wire .  he slammed into the guard who had spit on judy  knocking his rifle to the ground .  the immediacy of the danger to people from his own time had forced ishihara to act under the first law .   the other prisoners quickly drew away from the gate  hoping to avoid getting hurt if the germans began firing their weapons .  suddenly the open gateway was in front of wayne .  mc   was only a few yards away .   wayne looked back at hunter and ishihara  who were struggling with a knot of german guards and other soldiers .  more soldiers had gathered around them with their rifles aimed .  they hesitated to shoot for fear of hitting their own comrades .   steve pushed himself up  stumbling into a standing position .  judy took his arm to help him up .  she frantically pulled him toward the open gate .   the angry  impatient guard who had spit on judy had drawn his sidearm .  with deliberate care  he raised it toward the back of judy   s head .   forgetting mc    wayne threw himself against the man   s legs .  the gun went off  firing into the ground .  both men fell  tripping some of the troops who had been shuffling in a crazed huddle with hunter and ishihara .     steve blinked  staggering dizzily  and looked around .  judy was dragging him by the arm .  ishihara flung german soldiers away from himself .  they fell against the semicircle of armed soldiers surrounding them .  some fired as they went down  but their bullets went wild into the air .   as judy pushed steve out the open gate  ishihara threw himself on the ground over wayne  protecting him .  then he reached into his tunic  apparently the same one he had worn in ancient germany .  wayne and ishihara vanished .   jane had grabbed mc     s arm and was trying to pull him after her .  he was not coming  but she had slowed him down .  hunter hurled the soldiers around him to the ground just as steve and judy reached him .  then hunter stretched out one long arm and yanked mc   closer .  jane came with him  still holding the small robot   s arm .  steve saw hunter reach inside his heavy overcoat .     an instant later  steve found himself back in the familiar  crowded darkness of the sphere .  no one spoke while hunter opened it  jumped out  and pulled mc   into room f    after him .  judy got out next  this time she and jane had to help steve climb out slowly .  he was still dizzy .      hunter  steve needs to be checked by a medical robot     said jane .     he   s hurt .  i can   t tell if it   s serious or not .         i am radioing for one now     said hunter .  he turned to mc   .     can you hear us speak .         yes .         jane  please give him direct instructions .         do not make any attempt to get away or shut off your receptivity to our instructions under the second law     jane said  looking over her shoulder .     stay right where you are until we give you further orders .  acknowledge .         i agree     said mc   .   jane turned to daladier  who still stood by the door .     do not allow mc   to leave our custody .  if he makes some interpretation of the first law to justify it  he might still make an attempt to escape .         acknowledged     said daladier .   steve sank onto the couch .  his head throbbed painfully  but he could think more clearly now  and followed the conversation around him .     did we leave right in the middle of everybody .         yes     said hunter .     however  i believe that in the crowd and confusion  with the battle coming near  stories of our disappearance will not be taken seriously .         the sad truth is  most of those prisoners died soon afterward in captivity     said judy .     their stories about our disappearance  if they told them  had nowhere to go but to each other .         the german soldiers and guards may have lived to tell the story     said jane .     a few of them  anyway .         some may have survived to talk about it     said judy .     under the nazi regime  i feel that anyone who said he lost custody of prisoners who vanished magically would not be taken seriously   he might even be punished for offering such a flimsy excuse .  in a system that thrives on fear  the soldiers might have chosen not to repeat what they saw .         our concern is a real one     said hunter .     if possible  we must not disappear in front of witnesses during future missions .         how did we happen to come across mc   .     steve muttered  looking up at him .   jane turned to mc   .     tell us how you came to be a prisoner of the germans .         i attempted to sneak up on the german lines and move past them     said mc   .     however  dawn was breaking by the time i had crossed the open territory and german sentries saw me .  they trained their weapons on me and the third law required that i not take risks with them .  they put me in a prison pen without interrogation .  then some soldiers came and began emptying each pen .  they escorted us with weapons and told us which way to go .  we marched from one pen to another down the rear of the lines until we reached the one where you were .         lucky for us     said steve .      actually  chance factors were quite low     said hunter .     under the pressure of impending combat  the germans were imprisoning all strangers and marching them together out of the area .  we were all caught in the same net .  if we had not spotted him when we did  we would have had to return to our own time .  however  in a later trip to complete the mission  we would have still have found him in the group marching to the rear .         what do you think .     jane grinned at mc   .      i agree .         steve     said hunter .     how are you feeling .         i think i   ll be okay .         with your permission  i shall contact the medical robot again and have him meet us at mc governor   s office .  are you well enough to ride there .         yeah .         daladier  please remain here and continue to watch for dr .  wayne nystrom and r .  ishihara     said hunter .      of course .         jane  please instruct mc       said hunter .      you will remain with us as we move through mojave center to the office of mc governor     said jane .     you will still cooperate with us fully and make no attempt to escape us or to interfere with our return to the office .         acknowledged     said mc   .   hunter led his team out .  steve gratefully allowed jane to take his arm and support him .  hunter had a security detail waiting to drive them back .   outside the office of mc governor  a medical robot was already waiting for them  holding his small black case of equipment .      i am r .  cushing     said the medical robot .     my    patient is named steve  i have been told .         that   s me .      cushing stared at steve for a long moment .     my specialized vision reveals no fracture .  you will be fine .     he took a pressure gun from his black case and held it against the side of steve   s neck .  it popped against his skin .     this is a mild painkiller .  my infrared vision tells me that the inflammation is localized and stable .  for the swelling  i recommend that you apply ice .         okay     said steve .     thanks .         i shall leave you     said cushing .     i am permanently on call  so contact me if the situation changes .  i do not expect it will .         thank you     said hunter .   cushing departed .   jane came lip and gave steve a quick hug .     i always knew you had a hard head .      judy walked up on the other side and gave him a hug  too .     that guy clobbered you after you knocked down the one who spit on me .  he was about to shoot both of us .  i   ll never forget that .      steve smiled wryly .     i won   t either .         i feel so bad about ivana  too     said judy .     she was totally helpless  and completely innocent .  i wonder what happened to her .      jane gave judy a quick hug .     whatever it was  it happened to her long before we ever went back and met her .      judy nodded .      those two regimes have disturbed me deeply     said hunter .     the earlier societies we have visited were primitive in their values because of their early place in social evolution .  however  the nazi regime and the soviet union were barbaric throwbacks .  their values were more primitive than those of many societies which had preceded them .          and they had the power of the industrial age to use in their atrocities .     judy straightened  her voice firm .      it   s fairly old history now     said jane .      and the obligation of our time is to remember it     said judy .     the larger lesson is that technological development does not necessarily mean civilized values   we all have to remain on guard .  humans  unlike robots  have the power to choose how to behave .      everyone was silent for a moment .  then judy shrugged  smiling self consciously .     well  end of lecture .  look  i want to clean up .  okay if i excuse myself .         of course     said hunter .      i   ll say good bye a little later     said judy .  she slipped out .      we haven   t asked you about the nuclear explosion yet     said jane .     hunter  i suppose you   ve been monitoring the news since we returned .         yes .  no explosion has taken place in moscow .      steve looked up .     i feel better already .  that stuff cushing gave me works fast .         i have news of another nuclear explosion  however     said hunter .     i checked the sphere console before we left room f    and the information matches .  the current unexplained nuclear explosion has eliminated the city of beijing  the capital of china .  millions have died already .         china .     steve grinned .     on our next mission  i   ll be the one who fits in for a change .         what time in history will we visit this time .     jane asked .      the time of kublai khan  when he was emperor of china .
